This is the outline for a film
            written by Ray Bradbury in 1981. This draft, although commisioned by the studio, was never
            filmed. The outline script is 50 pages in length. This first appeared on Dreamerwww.com.  The site is currently down.  When that site comes back up, I will redirect this back to the site that did all the work.

THE
            EVENING OF THE SECOND DAY
            by
            RAY BRADBURY

Canaveral. Christmas
            Eve. Sunset.
Far off we can hear
            carols being sung...Christmas lights
at a distance, faint
            laughter.
The CAMERA prowls over
            the landscape. We see the largest building in the world, silhouetted against the setting
            sun... the Vehicle Assembly Building where the Apollo rockets were fitted together and
            sent out to the launch-pads to go to the Moon.
The CAMERA peers
            briefly into the cathedral interior of the VAB where, perhaps, in a far alcove we see that
            someone has set up a small Christmas tree, lit. Somewhere a radio is playing, a mere
            whisper of some Carol or other. The giant hangar is empty. It is obvious that almost
            everyone has gone home early for the Holiday.
The CAMERA prowls
            inside for a moment, and we may we11 see, standing tall, in the shadows, the titanic ghost
            shapes of Apollo rockets, motionless and waiting.
The CAMERA moves out
            into sunset dune territory, scans the various gantries which are deserted. The wind blows
            dust over the lone machineries. The CAMERA finds and reads, quickly, a sign which says:
            ABANDON IN PLACE, No Further Activity Authorized. Perhaps we
            can hear an echo of the

            sounds, voices counting down, the merest murmur of machineries, radios, computers.

THE
            VOICES




Oxygen
                    check.......hydrogen check.......ten minutes to launch...etc., etc...




The sounds rise and
            fall in the sound of surf from the nearby sea.
THE
            VOICES
One
            minute and counting.......
The CAMERA fixes on
            the Apollo 11 gantry.




A VOICE
...seven...six...five...four...
                    three...two...one...we have ignition!




There might be a
            mighty blast, but instead an explosion of -- wings!
Birds fly up from the
            dunes in a great bang of flying!
A flurry of motion and
            color as...
Click, click, click,
            click, a MAN with a camera rises up to photograph this ascension.
The birds wheel and
            fly off.
The MAN continues to
            photograph them in the sunset light.
Then he stops, checks
            his camera, looks around, moves off.
The CAMERA follows him
            along the dunes, east the abandoned gantry where only the wind sounds now. He blinks up at
            the vast metal machineries as he passes, his face full of remembrance. He stops to snap a
            picture.

THE EVENING OF THE
            SECOND DAY / Ray Bradbury
                                                
            3A car
            goes along the road a hundred yards off, a Christmas tree tied to its too, and voices
            singing raggedly: "We wish you a merry Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas
            ...and a ... happy New Year..."
He snaps a picture of
            the sign: ABANDON IN PLACE.
He reads the sign
            quietly, shakes his head.
Surf falls on the
            shore.
He is about a hundred
            yards from the Vehicle Assembly Building now, and snaps a half dozen quick pictures of it.
As the sun vanishes.
And the light dies on
            the vast building.
The MAN quickens his
            gaze for he has seen something, perhaps heard something in the sky.
A star is there, very
            bright, on the horizon.
THE MAN
It's
            bright tonight....
The star glows even
            more.
THE MAN




Wait a minute...that's
                    the wrong place...it can't be Venus!




And out of the sky, as he
            watches, comes a craft of some saucerlike shape, immense, vibrant, moving swiftly.
The MAN stares as:
The craft soars down,
            the CAMERA moves with it and --

            4Flies
            right through the vast gates of the Vehicle Assembly Building to vanish inside!!!
Stunned, the MAN
            watches as:
In the cathedral
            interior, the spacecraft hovers, sinks, sets down.
The MAN starts to run.
Even as the great
            Gates thunder to shut in the visitor from the sky!
The MAN leaps through
            as: the Gates slam.
He turns to look at:
The craft, glowing in
            the dark.
He circles it, staring
            at it. He whispers to himself:
THE MAN
Wait! I
            know this!

He moves around the
            vast craft, memory shadowing his face.
THE MAN
Thirty
            years ago. Yes!
A sound startles him.
            A nearby elevator hums and drifts up in the strutworks, a shadow inside it.
He runs, stops, stares
            up: as the elevator slides into the shadowy heights.
The MAN stares from
            the elevator to the spacecraft, then jumps, runs, punches a second elevator button. The
            second elevator slams its door wide, he leaps in, goes up.

THE EVENING OF THE
            SECOND DAY / Ray Bradbury
                                                
            5On the
            way into the dark mountainslopes of machinery, he stares up at --
That other elevator,
            carrying its alien cargo up and on up into yet darker cathedral heights.
It reaches the top of the
            Vehicle Assembly Building a good ten seconds ahead of him. Distantly, we see and hear its
            door clang wide, and a shadow move.
Reaching the top, the MAN
            runs by the other elevator, checking it. He glances up and around at further staircases.
The MAN emerges on the
            roof of the VAB as the last light of day fades.
He looks around at
            emptiness. The wind mourns up here, as lonely as the wind out in the dunes among the
            abandoned rocket pads.
A sound jerks him about.
It is the other elevator
            -- going back down into the shadows 400 feet below. Both elevators, in fact! He has been
            tricked. Obviously, someone has pushed the button or the second one and leaped out to let
            it go down by itself.
Cursing, the MAN races to
            a third bank of elevators, and has to wait, while, far below, the other two elevators
            reach their destination.
Sliding down out of the
            darkness, the MAN emerges and looks around at silence and shadows. Whoever led him up to
            trap him on the roof, was gaining time. They have had a fu11 minute or more to vanish.
            They are indeed gone.

            6A
            VOICE
Hey!
The MAN whirls.
A building ATTENDANT has
            come out on a catwalk above.

            The MAN gazes up as:
The ATTENDANT stares
            down, blinking at:
The spacecraft, which
            glows and hums, with the small Christmas tree nearby.
The ATTENDANT, stunned,
            says:
THE
            ATTENDANT
Who put
            that gift under my tree?
CUT TO DARKNESS. A slam
            of brakes. A car arrives outside. 
A door slams.
Feet run.
The MAN is waiting for
            this arrival outside in the blowing night.
The arrival is the VAB
            DIRECTOR, who glares at the MAN.
DIRECTOR
You've
            been drinking , of course?!
He looks into the MAN's
            face, sniffs, shakes his head.
DIRECTOR




No. I'll be damned. Who
                    shut those doors?




He is glaring at the vast
            doors now.
THE MAN
I wish I
            knew.

            7The
            DIRECTOR gives him a last glare, plunges on.
DIRECTOR
Get out of
            the way!
He opens the squall door
            in the great Gate, steps through. And stops, shocked as:
We see what he sees: the
            spacecraft, a light unto itself, filling the great church-like interior.
DIRECTOR
            (to the MAN)
You just
            got your job back.
THE MAN
I didn't
            know I was fired.
DIRECTOR
You were.
            Come on.
They move off to circle
            the mystery.
More officials arrive to
            confer. For now, only a few people know of the alien spaceship’s landing...the MAN,
            plus the ATTENDANT, plus the handful of Canaveral people gathered here.
The question is asked:
            why did the craft land here, this place, at this hour?
The MAN, let us call him
            CHRIS ATKINS, almost responds. A shadow crosses his face. He has half-remembered
            some-thing about the visiting ship. But he remains silent.

            8The
            great doors of the Vehicle Assembly Building are locked shut, the various officials are
            warned that no single word about this must be said beyond the Base, for the time being.
Someone was aboard the
            craft. Someone came out. Someone vanished -- where? He, or she, or it, must be found.
How do you do
            that, without knowing what you're looking for?
CHRIS ATKINS speaks up.
ATKINS




Maybe we don't search.
                    Maybe we wait for it to find us.




DIRECTOR
Why should
            it do that?
ATKINS
Because --
            it knows one of us.
DIRECTOR
Who?
ATKINS
Me. I
            think. I have a hunch.
DIRECTOR
I hope
            your hunch is scientific.
ATKINS
And how
            will your search pay off?
DIRECTOR
It won't.
            Get home. It's Christmas Eve.

            9They get
            ready to go. The spacecraft suddenly stops humming and glowing. It is at rest. They look
            at the dark shape. Beyond it, the small Christmas tree blinks and blinks its lights.
ATKINS
You'll
            hear from me.
The DIRECTOR regards him
            quietly and at last nods.
DIRECTOR
By God, I
            bet we wi11.
They turn to go when:
The spacecraft gives a
            short burst of whine and hum.
And all the elevators in
            Canaveral, empty, begin to glide up their shafts like great dark spiders, moving up toward
            the unseen stars.
The men below look up,
            startled.
Four hundred feet above,
            the elevators arrive in silence and open their doors up high, where the night winds mourn
            through the interstices. The elevators shut their doors and glide back down.
The DIRECTOR looks at the
            silent spacecraft.

Did it
            do that?
ATKINS nods.
The elevators arrive,
            open their doors, stand silent.
ATKINS 
            Merry Christmas.
DIRECTOR
So they
            tell me....
They exit. After they are
            gone...the elevator doors whisper shut.
ATKINS drives to his
            boarding house. He pauses on the steps to look up at a sign which reads: THE CLEAN,
            WELL-LIGHTED PLACE. ROOM AND BOARD. Week or month. Founded 1969. MRS. PERKINS, PROP.
Inside, grand
            festivities. The boarders, ten in all, are trimming the Christmas tree.
ATKINS joins in the
            trimming, the drinking, the general all-around happiness, but --
His face shadows again
            and again with remembrance of what he has seen just a few hours ago,
And...there are new
            boarders at the house, One, a man, and of a most peculiar aspect, ATKINS stares at him.
            The man flinches self-consciously and at last speaks.

            11It is a
            Cockney accent! He's here to write an article on the Space Shuttle for a London
            news-sheet.
What looked so suspicious
            at a distance -- and ATKINS has been studying him, across the table, at dinner, where the
            man spoke not at all, or in murmurs -- now is shattered by the vulgar reality. This simply
            couldn't be a traveler from across the Universe!
Or ... could it?
There's another new
            boarder, unseen so far. Arrived today, they say, front upstairs room. A girl, a young lady
            that is, name of Clapham or Clarkson, something like that, not feeling we11...will be down
            later, they say, over dessert.
Now, trimming the tree,
            watching the eccentric-looking Cockney with an ironic eye, ATKINS climbs a small ladder to
            place the last baubles on the tree.
ATKINS




Now, where's the star for
                    the very top!?




A VOICE
Here...
A hand reaches up. In it
            is an exquisitely strange and glowing fragment of beauty, a bauble filled with small

            12lights,
            like an enclosed universe, a constellation, a bit of comet's bridal veil, a lunar
            illumination.
ATKINS looks beyond its
            soft light, down along the hand and arm that has stretched it up, to the face at the end
            of the arm.
It is a beautiful face.
            It is a young woman's face, of some twenty-five to thirty radiant years. The light and
            shadow of the ornament she offers plays over her cheeks and brow, and fills her eyes.
ATKINS
            (stunned)
            Upstairs -- front room?
Her eyes fix him gently.
            The fine mouth moves.
YOUNG
            WOMAN
            Upstairs. Front room.
ATKINS is transfixed. His
            hand moves to touch the glowing ornament.
A BOARDER




For gosh sakes, hang
                    the damned thing!




Everyone laughs. ATKINS
            flushes, looks dorm at:
The incredibly lovely and
            fresh young face.

            13He
            turns to hang the bauble high to generate gasps and admirations and acclaims. The light
            fills the air, touches his face. He almost falls off the ladder when -bang!
The front door slams!
He looks down at:
The empty place where
            the YOUNG WOMAN had stood a moment before. She is gone.
ATKINS almost falls
            off again, slides down, looks around.
ONE OF
            THE MEN
Son,
            looks like you missed out!
To general laughter,
            he plunges through them.
At the front door he
            stares out as:
A car drives off at a
            fine pace.
ONE OF
            THE MEN
            You gonna follow?

            darts upstairs, dares to open the Upstairs Front Room door, looks around at --
The YOUNG WOMAN's room,
            which has very little in it. She is obviously traveling light.
An incredibly beautiful
            slender valise, made of some strange metal, lies on the bed. He touches it, turns it.
            There is no visible lock. He lets it lie, gives the bed and room a last look as if to pick
            up some vibrations from so looking.
Turning in the middle of
            the room, he feels, we feel, her unseen presence. There is a whisper of sound here, a
            touch of strange, but --
He departs.
On his way out the front
            door, one of the lady boarders laughs and calls:
LADY
            BOARDER
            How you know where to go?

            drives away.
To arrive not long before
            midnight back at the Cape.
He parks in front of the
            Vehicle Assembly Building, gets out, stares around in the dark wind. Far off, the surf
            falls.
The guard outside refuses
            him entrance. The DIRECTOR drives up, ATKINS argues with him. Do or do they not want to
            know who or what got off the ship? He, ATKINS, may be able to provide a clue. He will find
            the 'door' for them.
DIRECTOR




There is no door, no
                    hatch, no port. Find it, and you're the genius of the century. 
                    (a beat)
                    Go on in. Ten minutes.




Inside, ATKINS stands
            looking at the ship.
He reaches out to touch
            it. It hums and glows at his touch, as if in some sort of mechanical recognition.
A shadow crosses his
            face. His lips whisper, move, and at last remember. He speaks quietly.

The seam appears.
ATKINS might run, but
            doesn't, watches fascinated as:
The 'door' -- the light
            seam in the side of the ship -- parts and lets down the rampway leading up to the revealed
            port.
From inside come hums and
            murmurs of machines that ca11 back memory.
ATKINS
            (to himself)
            Yes.....yes!
Inside the ship, ATKINS
            almost panics when the great quiet door seals behind him, but the look of the shadowed
            walkways and corridors draws him on. The sound of dim machineries humming under their
            breath calls to him. He circles inward to find:

            17The
            central room where on quiet display is a crystal block. It is almost like those old
            magical displays from traveling miracle-magic shows where someone was kept frozen within a
            long block of ice for hours, or days, on end.
Inside the cube, the
            crystal, the cold gem-like display lies a man asleep, or dead; probably the latter.
It is, of course, KLAATU,
            returned across the years to visit Earth, as promised.
ATKINS circles the quiet
            form in the flawless ice, or glass. Faint music stirs. Old voices whisper.
ATKINS dares to touch the
            crystal rectangle, the lightest touch. The lights flicker.
KLAATU's voice speaks
            across Time. We hear fragments of his old promise to return, for Earth to begin to find
            ways to behave.
ATKINS, listening,
            remembers hearing some of this as a child.

            18Finally,
            KLAATU's VOICE, from a hidden source as his body lies sleeping dead, says:
KLAATU




I have not lived to
                    return, but return I have. I have brought living flesh with me as teacher. In the days
                    ahead, the final teaching begins. Go now, and wait for the one who teaches....




The lights dim. The
            whispers die. The machineries hum to themselves.
ATKINS departs.
Outside the VAB building,
            a few reporters have arrived to confront an angry DIRECTOR.
DIRECTOR




How in hell did you get
                    in?!




THE

We just ran over the

Well you can damn well

The DIRECTOR and the
            scientists go inside. There is a flash of light, a hum of machinery, as they enter and the
            door shuts. ATKINS is left outside in the blowing night wind.
Far off among the
            deserted gantries, he sees something move. Instinctively, he walks, then hurries toward

Out on the dunes, by the

            the rusting space machineries, and the great Vehicle Assembly Building.
He stands looking at her
            in profile. She is dressed in slacks and a trim jacket with a scarf. Her hair blows in the
            wind. It is a good clean profile that he sees, with a touch of luminous inner knowledge in
            the cheeks, in the brow, in the eyes.
She is not startled when
            he arrives, nor, for a long while does she look at him. Then, very quietly, listening to
            far radio voices and musics that drift by in the night, Christmas carols coming and going,
            she says:
YOUNG
            WOMAN




In a few minutes, it's
                    your Christmas.




He catches the way she
            has phrased it. And instead of saying hello, introducing himself, he continues as if they
            were picking up a conversation dropped only a moment ago:
ATKINS
            Not yours?
The YOUNG WOMAN looks
            around at the sea and the land.
YOUNG
            WOMAN
            Not mine.
This quickens him. She is
            admitting things, half sensed.

ATKINS
            Do you like our world?
The YOUNG WOMAN looks,
            thinks, responds.
YOUNG
            WOMAN
            Some of it. Not all.
Her eyes are fixed to the
            rusting machines now. He looks with her.
ATKINS
            All of this was -- great -once.
She nods and muses on
            this truth.
YOUNG
            WOMAN




I know. What a shame.
                    What a waste.




ATKINS defends the land,
            the ruins.
ATKINS




It'll be great again some

Again the clear gaze.
Again, he almost
            pulls back. There is no threat in her voice, but he is vaguely uneasy.
ATKINS
            Yes!

That is -- unless

ATKINS




That this Christmas morn,

                    about to happen, that will change us forever and be only for the good!

The great doors of the

She touches her wrist

And the lights on the far
            gantries spring on. They are like immense Christmas trees in the night.
ATKINS stares, stunned
            and incredulous.
The gantries blaze. The

YOUNG

Her footprints in the

            deep morning of Christmas, ATKINS drives home.
Stepping inside the
            silent and sleeping house, he sees, atop the Christmas tree, the small and incredible
            ornament that glows and pulses with a faint heartbeat of illumination.
CUT TO THE INTERIOR of
            the Vehicle Assembly Building, where the vast spaceship dimly pulses with a similar beat
            of light.
Inside the ship, as the
            CAMERA moves in on the crystal enclosure where KLAATU death-sleeps, the light from the
            ice-floe mass beats in a long slow pulse.
CUT TO: the interior of
            the YOUNG WOMAN'S, KLAATA'S, room upstairs, as the CAMERA moves toward her bed where she
            sleeps, her hair furled out on her pillow.  By her bedside is a crystal cube, opaque,
            in which the pulse of illumination is repeated again, so we connect it and the ornament
            downstairs, AND the spacecraft, AND the crystal ice enclosure where KLAATU
            lies dreaming or dreamless, in suspended animation.
ATKINS, coming upstairs,
            sees the faint beat of light under KLAATA's door.

            half-alarmed.
He pulls back, takes a
            deep breath, and leaves.
His door shuts.
The pulse of light, the

            in the ruins of one of the old rocket pads at high noon, climbing to the top where they
            can see the entire stretch of Canaveral's machineries for mile on mile, ATKINS finally
            turns to KLAATA and asks the most important question.
ATKINS




You waited thirty years.
                    Why did you come back now?




KLAATA
            We said we would.
ATKINS




You also said you'd
                    destroy
                    Earth if we didn't behave. We haven't behaved, have we?
                    What are you waiting for?




KLAATA turns, surveys the
            scene, and the world beyond the Cape.
KLAATA




You've behaved better
                    than you think. That's why we delayed. You're strange people. You've actually done some
                    things right!




ATKINS
            Like what?
KLAATA




Don’t you know? Must
                    I, from
                    some other world tell you?
                    Thirty years ago people still
                    died from polio, malaria, scarlet fever. You've stopped all that. Your country invented
                    new kinds
                    of wheat and corn. You send food to 90 countries. Immigrants pour into your land, 500
                    thousand a year. Why are they coming here if you're as bad as you say?

The tone of your voice
                    says for you. You don't like yourself, your world, your people. How peculiar that
                    I find much to defend. All this, that, there, didn't exist, thirty years ago. You've
                    reached the Moon. You've touched Mars and Jupiter and Saturn!




ATKINS
            And stopped touching...
KLAATA
            But you can do it again!
ATKINS




If I had my way...yes.
                    But I’m only one person.




KLAATA
            Ah, and so am I. But watch me!
 
There is no threat in her
            voice, only wi11 and energy; much fervor, a great fire.
He turns to look at her
            face.
ATKINS




So you're the teacher
                    Klaatu 
                    told me to expect? You going
                    to teach them?

            rapidly down through the ironwork steps toward the ground, half-serious, half-laughing.

She rushes down the metal
            stairs. He can only follow, his face shadowed and disturbed.
She is waiting in the

They enter her room, in

Only here, when the fire
                    cooled, did the elements separate, yes? This bit of fire became nitrogen, that flame

                    things are put together, all the things of Earth, list them one by one, analyze their
                    structure --




ATKINS
            For instance?
She touches the computer
            bracelet. The Sun goes out. She opens the night bureau drawer and takes out a packet of
            needles.

            places the needles on top of the crystal cube. On the ceiling a prism pattern, a 'reading'

KLAATA




There. That's what
                    needles are made of. And if we know how to make them, then we know how to--




ATKINS

She nods, takes the cube
            from his hand, puts it on the table. Touches her computer wristband and--
ATKINS
            My God!
The needles disappear.
ATKINS stands stunned by

ATKINS
            Good trick...
KLAATA

ATKINS




Can you make all the

KLAATA

KLAATA




Isn't it more interesting

KLAATA

KLAATA then explains in
            some detail what their plan, her plan, KLAATU's plan, is. To let the panic grow in little
            starts and stops, little vanishings, little disappearances, at first unnoticed. Who cares,
            for instance, if a11 the tiddlewinks in the world vanish on the same day? Or all the

In the hours before
            her final going-away, KLAATA gathers, perhaps by force, an assorted score of military and
            world leaders. Delivered to Canaveral, packed into the space vehicle, they soar in what
            seems a few instants, to New York and hover by the base of the Statue of Liberty.
ATKINS squints at KLAATA.
ATKINS
            Is this the right direction?
KLAATA looks up along the
            pointing arm of the Statue of Liberty.
KLAATA

She slams the controls.

Where, suspended over

            Assembly Building at Cape Canaveral. It is, in fact, a few minutes before midnight on New

A car goes along the
            deserted road on the edge of the sea. We hear fitful rises and falls of music:
            "Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot".....and a voice, with static, describing
            Time Square...the crowds...five minutes until the New Year....
Inside the VAB, in the
            immense darkness, KLAATA, the daughter of KLAATU, is ready to depart on the spacecraft.
            Her one week, which began on Christmas Eve, is up. She moves through the vast church-like
            silence with ATKINS, to stand near the spaceship.
She touches a large
            relief-map chart-computer which stands in the shadow. A whole series of lights come on,
            each by its own symbol of land, sea, air, problems, people.
He scans the board, the
            lights.
ATKINS




Everything we’ve
                    done right, the last few years?

Neglected for a long time.
ATKINS tries again,
            moving his hands over the tabs, to see the faintest pulsings of lights in the computer
            layout.
ATKINS




And -- if we do all the

                    give us the gold star?




KLAATA
            More than that.
She reaches down and
            brings up into the light, a cube of pure glowing illumination, roughly six inches by six
            inches in dimension. There are slots on each side of the cube. She puts the cube on the
            table near the layout. Beside it she fans out a series of blank computer cards which will
            one day be printed with data.
