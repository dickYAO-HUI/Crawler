   1 EXT. MARS RED ROCK DESERT (DREAM SEQ.#1) - DAY                   1

     RED!  A vacant, epic expanse of glowing crimson.

     TWO MOONS rise into frame, floating over the jagged peaks
     of distant mountains.  We are PANNING DOWN to the endless
     red plains of MARS.
   

   2 EXT. MARS RED ROCK DESERT (DREAM SEQ.#1) - DAY                   2

     TWO PEOPLE in space suits walk across the Mars surface, down a
     slope, across a flat area and up onto a small ridge.  They
     stand and look out over the Mars landscape.  They reach for
     each other's hand and look at each other.
                                                                 
                         QUAID
               I love you.

                         MELINA
               I love you.

     Then they hug each other and walk off.


   3 EXT. MARS RED ROCK DESERT (DREAM SEQ.#1) - DAY                   3

     Quaid walks from the precipice down a gradual slope.  The
     ground gives way underneath him.  He falls.  His visor hits
     a rock.  A small crack spreads, and the visor blows out.

     Quaid starts to decompress.  HHHHNh!  His breath is drawn
     out.  His face puffs up.  Veins stand out in his skin.  His
     eyes bulge.  His tongue protrudes.  His nose and eyelids
     bleed.

     The woman rushes to him.  She kneels down over him.  They
     clasp hands.  His eyes explo...

   6 INT. QUAID'S BEDROOM - DAY                                       6

     Quaid wakes in bed, sweaty and panting.

     A beautiful woman wakes up next to him.  She's not the
     brunette from before, but a stunning blonde amazon -- LORI.

                         LORI
               Doug?  are you all right?

     He's still disoriented.

                         LORI (CONT'D)
               You were dreaming.  It's O.K.

     Quaid starts to come back to reality.  Lori presses a button
     and opaque walls dissolve into transparent windows.  WHITE
     LIGHT gradually fills the dark room, and the city becomes
     visible outside.

                         LORI (CONT'D)
               Was it about Mars?

     Quaid nods, troubled.  Lore wipes the sweat from his brow.

                         LORI
               Is that better?

                         QUAID
               Mmmm.....

                         LORI
               Poor baby.  This is getting to be an
               obsession.

     Lori caresses him, comforting, then erotic.  Her lips dwell on
     his muscular chest.  He starts to relax.

                         LORI
                    (non-chalant)
               Was she there?

     Amused, Quaid plays dumb.

                         QUAID
               Who?

                         LORI
               The brunette.  The one you told me
               about.

                         QUAID
                    (laughs)
               Lori, I don't believe it...You're
               jealous of a dream!

     Lori punches Quaid in the stomach, and they wrestle playfully
     but rough.

                         LORI
               Who is she?

                         QUAID
               Nobody.

                         LORI
               Nobody?!
                    (down onto him)
               What's her name?

                         QUAID
               I don't know.

                         LORI
               Tell me!

     Lori straddles Quaid, and he laughs so hard he can't defend
     himself.

                         LORI
               It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about
               her every night.

                         QUAID
               But I'm always home by morning.

     Quaid grabs Lori's wrists and immobilizes her in the infamous
     pretzel grip.

                         LORI
               Let me go!

                         QUAID
               Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl
               of my dreams.

     She stops resisting.

                         LORI
               ...You mean it?

                         QUAID
               You know I do.

     Quaid lets her go, and Lori entwines him in her long, athletic
     legs.

                         LORI
               I'll give you something to dream about.


   7 INT. QUAID'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DAY                           7

     TWO LARGE BANANAS are liquified as they pass through a juicer
     into a half-gallon pitcher.

     Dressed for heavy construction work, Quaid makes the POWER
     SHAKE to end all power shakes.  He grinds up fruits,
     vegetables, buts, wheat germ, leftovers, several kinds of
     powder.  He pours in a dozen shelled eggs--glubglubglub--from
     a carton.  Then he mixes it all together in a forty-horsepower
     blender.  ZEEEEEEEE!

     Meanwhile, The NEWS drones in the background.

                         NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
               On the war front, Northern Block
               satellites incinerated a shipyard in
               Bombay, starting a fire that swept
               throughout the city.  Civilian
               casualties are estimated to exceed ten
               thousand.  The Chairman defended the
               attack, calling space-based weapons
               the only effective defense against the
               Southern Block's numerical superiority.

     Quaid gulps down his breakfast directly from his jumbo pitcher
     and walks over to the flat, wall-sized HIGH DEFINITION
     TELEVISION.

                         NEWSCASTER
               And more violence last night on Mars...

     Quaid lowers the pitcher, watches with attention, and walks
     over to the table.

     ON TV, FIREFIGHTERS put out a blaze at a MINE as ARMORED
     SOLDIERS brutally beat back a crowd of MINERS.  The Mine is
     enclosed under a glass "DOME".

                         NEWSCASTER (O.S.)(CONT'D)
               ...where terrorists demanding
               independence once again halted
               extraction of turbinium ore.

     Lori comes out of the bathroom and walks behind Quaid to the
     kitchen.  She tensely watches the news as she makes her
     breakfast.

     In a small corner of the TV screen, we see a STILL PHOTO OF
     VILOS COHAAGEN, a middle-aged man of commanding presence and
     obvious intelligence.

                         NEWSCASTER (CONT'D)
               With one mine already closed, Mars
               Administrator Vilos Cohaagen vowed that
               troops would be used, if necessary,
               to keep production at full capacity.
               At the press conference, he emphasized
               that...

     As the INSERT OF COHAAGEN expands to fill the screen, Lori
     presses the remote control.  BONK.  The TV screen transforms
     into an ENVIRONMENTAL WINDOW that look out onto a virgin
     forest.

                         LORI
               No wonder you have nightmares.  You're
               always watching the news.

     Quaid and Lori sit down and eat breakfast.

                         QUAID
               Lori...

                         LORI
               Yeah, sweetheart?

                         QUAID
               Let's do it.

                         LORI
               Do what?

                         QUAID
               Move to Mars.

     She stops buttering the bread.

                         LORI
               Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly
               wonderful morning.

                         QUAID
               Just think about it.

                         LORI
                    (exasperated, but sweet)
               Sweetheart, we've been through this
               a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars.
               It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I
               mean, really, a revolution could break
               out there any minute.

                         QUAID
               Cohaagen says it's just a few
               extremists.

                         LORI
               And you believe him?

                         QUAID
               All right, forget about it.

     Quaid clicks on the remote control.  The FOREST PRIMEVAL is
     replaced by a...PRESS CONFERENCE ON THE TELEVISION.

                         REPORTER (O.S.)
               Do you want to give them independence?

                         COHAAGEN
               Absolutely not.  Mars was colonized
               by the Northern Block at enormous
               expense.  Our entire war effort depends
               on their turbinium.

     Lori straddles Quaid seductively, obscuring his view.

                         LORI
               Doug, maybe we should take a trip.

                         QUAID
               Lori, move.

                         LORI
               There's lots nicer places than Mars.

                         COHAAGEN
               ...and it's ridiculous to think we're
               going to give it away just because a
               bunch of lazy mutants think they own
               the planet.

                         LORI
               What about Saturn?  Don't you wanna
               see Saturn?  Everybody says it's
               gorgeous.

     Quaid stretches to see around Lori.  She playfully leans with
     him.

                         REPORTER
               Any comment, sir, on the rumor you
               closed the Pyramid Mine because you
               found alien artifacts inside?

     Cohaagen and the reporters all chuckle.

                         LORI
               We could take one of those lonnng space
               cruises.  The kind with nothing to do.

     Lori traps him into a lonnng kiss.

                         COHAAGEN
               Pat, I wish we could find some nice
               alien artifacts.  Our tourist industry
               could use a boost... -- But the fact
               is, it's Mr. Kuato and his terrorists
               who spread these rumors, to undermine
               trust in the government.

     Back to the studio.

                         NEWSCASTER
               That's it for the news.  Stay tuned
               for Christine and the weather.  But
               first this.

     COMMERCIAL for American Express: "Don't leave Earth without
     it."

     Lori finally ends the kiss.

                         LORI
               Well...What do you say?

                         QUAID
               I'm late.

     Quaid trudges to the door, discouraged.  Concerned, Lori
     catches him before he can leave.

                         LORI
               Sweetheart...I know it's hard being
               in a new town, but let's at least give
               it a chance here.  Okay?

                         QUAID
               Lori, don't you understand?  I feel
               I was meant for something more than
               this.  I want to do something with my
               life.--I want to be somebody.

     Lori strokes his cheek and looks into his eyes adoringly.

                         LORI
               You are somebody.  You're the man I
               love.

                         QUAID
               Bye.

     Quaid hugs Lori hard, grateful for her love and support, but
     he's still, somehow, unsatisfied.  They kiss good-bye, and
     Lori watches him head down the hallway to work.

                         LORI (CONT'D)
               Have a nice day.

     Quaid joins the bustling crowd of school children and
     commuters who scurry like ants in all directions through the
     central plaza/transportation hub of this futuristic community.

     Quaid follows signs down to the Subway.

     Commuters file past wall-sized PANELS.  On the other side,
     GUARDS screen them for concealed weapons.  PAN with Quaid
     as he approaches the checkpoint.

     BEHIND X-RAY PANEL as Quaid passes behind the X-ray panel,
     he and other commuters become WALKING SKELETONS.  A few steps

     boards a subway car.


  14 INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY                                            14

     The doors close behind him and Quaid walks to the side where
     TV COMMERCIALS play on a row of flat MONITORS.

     ON TV, A CABBIE, in an old-fashioned checkered cap, turns
     to the back seat and addresses the CAMERA.

                         JOHNNY
               Thanks for taking JohnnyCab.  I hope
               you enjoyed the ride.

     This commercial ends, and the next one begins.

     A HAPPY FELLOW lies next to a SEXPOT on a round bed.  The
     bedroom is under a glass dome at the bottom of the ocean.
     Outside, colorful fish swim around .

                         NARRATOR (O.S.)
               Do you dream of a vacation at the bottom
               of the ocean...

     JUMP CUT:  The Fellow now appears in a poverty level
     apartment, alone, surrounded by a pile of bills.

                         NARRATOR (O.S.)
               ...but you're snowed under with work?

     A SPORTSMAN in a space suit climbs up the pyramidal mountain
     from Quaid's dream.

                         NARRATOR (O.S.)
               Have you always wanted to climb the

                    (jingle)
               Reeeeeeekallll... RekallRekallRekall

     As a CHORUS OF SIRENS chants dreamily on, Dr. Edgemar opens his
     cupped hands.  A butterfly flutters out.

     SUPERIMPOSE Rekall LOGO and a twelve-digit PHONE NUMBER.

     Quaid is intrigued.


  15 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY                                     15

     GRRRRRRRR!!  Futuristic DRILLHAMMERS grind a concrete surface
     to bits.

     Quaid's taut muscles glisten with sweat as he and several
     WORKERS excavate a rocky building site.  The others struggle
     to control the powerful tool, but Quaid wields his drillhammer
     like an artist, working twice as fast with half the effort.

     Quaid shouts at HARRY, a middle-aged buddy with a beer belly,
     likeable face, and Brooklyn accent.

                         QUAID
               Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of
               Rekall?

                         HARRY
               Rekall?

                         QUAID
               They sell fake memories.

                         HARRY
               Oh, Rekall.

                         QUAID
               Yeah.

                         HARRY
               "RekallRekallRekall."
                    (stops drilling)
               You thinkin' of goin' there?

     Quaid also takes a break, leaning on his drillhammer, which
     HISSES in neutral.

                         QUAID
               I don't know.  Maybe.

                         HARRY
               Well don't.

     Quaid is surprised, even challenged, by the intensity of
     Harry's reaction.

                         QUAID
               Why not?

                         HARRY
               A friend of mine tried one of their
               "special offers"...Nearly got himself
               lobotomized.

                         QUAID
               No shit...

                         HARRY
               Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It
               ain't worth it.

     Harry and Quaid rev up their hammers.

                         QUAID
               I guess you're right.

     They resume drilling.


  16 EXT. REKALL BUILDING - DAY                                       16

     Quaid walks through an almost desolate plaza and enters
     through the glass doors.


  17 INT. REKALL BUILDING/LOBBY - DAY                                 17

     Quaid walks to the CONSOLE in the center of the floor.

     CLOSE ON: COMPUTER DIRECTORY as Quaid selects REKALL, INC.
     from a long list of names.  The screen displays the location
     and personnel.


  18 INT. REKALL RECEPTION - DAY                                      18

     CLOSE ON:  A YOUNG WOMAN'S HANDS.  A white stylus touches
     each fingernail, and red pigment instantly saturates the
     entire surface.  RACK FOCUS to Quaid, who enters in the
     background.

                         QUAID
               Hello.

     TIFFANY, a bored, ornamental receptionist hides her
     paraphernalia and greets Quaid.  She sits in front of a large
     REKALL LOGO.

                         TIFFANY
                    (big smile)
               Good afternoon.  Welcome to Rekall.

                         QUAID
               Douglas Quaid.  I have an appointment.

     Tiffany checks a schedule and finds his name.

                         TIFFANY
               Okay.  Just a moment, Mr. Quaid.

                         QUAID
               Thank you.

     Tiffany speaks to a salesman on the VIDEO INTERCOM.  We see
     him on the screen.

                         TIFFANY (CONT'D)
               Bob, Douglas Quaid is here to see you.
                    (listens, hangs up)
               It'll just be a minute.

                         QUAID
               Thank you.

     Quaid ambles around the room, perusing VIDEO TRAVEL POSTERS
     for imaginary vacations.  Tiffany watches him with interest.
     A moment later, BOB McCLANE enters.  He's a former high school
     jock.

                         MCCLANE
               Doug...Bob McClane.

                         QUAID
               Nice to meet you.

                         MCCLANE
               Good to see ya. Right this way.

     McClane shakes Quaid's hand and leads him away.  Meanwhile,
     Tiffany diffidently changes the color of her fingernails again
     with a touch of the stylus.


  19 INT. MCCLANE'S OFFICE AT RECALL - DAY                            19

     McClane ushers Quaid into a stylishly decorated room.

                         MCCLANE
               Have a seat, sit down, make yourself
               comfortable.

     Quaid lowers himself into a sleek, futuristic chair.  McClane
     sits behind his desk.

                         MCCLANE (CONT'D)
               Now help me out here, Doug.  You were
               interested in a memory of...

                         QUAID
               Mars.

                         MCCLANE
                    (unenthusiastic)
               Right.  Mars.

                         QUAID
               That a problem?

                         MCCLANE
               To be perfectly honest with you, Doug,
               if outer space is your thing, I think
               you'd be much happier  with one of our
               Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about
               'em.

                         QUAID
                    (irritated)
               I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said
               Mars.

                         MCCLANE
               Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.

     McClane types on his computer keyboard, and figures come up on
     his screen.

                         MCCLANE (CONT'D)
               Let's see...the basic Mars package will
               run you just eight hundred and
               ninety-nine credits.  That's for two
               full weeks of memories, complete in
               every detail.  --A longer trip'll run
               you a little more, cause you need a
               deeper implant.

                         QUAID
               What's in the two week package?

                         MCCLANE
               First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall,
               you get nothing but first class
               memories: private cabin on the shuttle;
               deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all
               the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the
               Grand Canals, and of course...
                    (leers)
               Venusville.

                         QUAID
               How real does it seem?

                         MCCLANE
               As real as any memory in your head.

                         QUAID
               Come on, don't bullshit me.

                         MCCLANE
               I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't
               know the difference.  Guaranteed, or
               your money back.

                         QUAID
               What about the guy you lobotomized...Did
               he get a refund?

                         MCCLANE
                    (nervous laugh)
               You're talking ancient history, Doug.
               Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer
               than getting on a rocket.
                    (types)
               Look at the statistics.

     Numbers and graphs appear on the monitor.

                         MCCLANE
               Besides, a real holiday's a big pain
               in the butt:  lost luggage, lousy
               weather, crooked taxi drivers.  When
               you go with Rekall, everything's
               perfect.  --So whaddaya say?

     Quaid ponders his decision.

                         QUAID
               All right.

                         MCCLANE
               Smart move.
                    (types)
               Now while you fill out the
               questionnaire, I'll familiarize you
               with some of our options.

                         QUAID
               No options.

                         MCCLANE
               Whatever you say...Just answer one
               question.  What is it that is exactly
               the same about every vacation you've
               ever taken?

     Quaid fills out the questionnaire on his video screen.

                         QUAID
               I give up.

                         MCCLANE
               You.  You're the same.
                    (pauses for effect)
               No matter where you go, there you are.
               Always the same old you.
                    (grins enigmatically)
               Let me suggest that you take a vacation
               from yourself.  I know it sounds wild,
               but it's the latest thing in travel.
               We call it an "Ego Trip".

                         QUAID
               I'm not interested in that.

                         MCCLANE
               You're gonna love this. --We offer you
               a choice of alternate identities during
               your trip.

     McClane pre-empts Quaid's questionnaire on the video monitor
     with CLOSE UP: the following list.

                         A-14  MILLIONAIRE PLAYBOY
                         A-15  SPORTS HERO
                         A-16  INDUSTRIAL TYCOON
                         A-17  SECRET AGENT

                         MCCLANE (O.S.)
               Face it...Why go to Mars as a tourist
               when you can go as a playboy, or a
               famous jock, or a...

                         QUAID
               Secret agent...How much is that?

                         MCCLANE
               Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a
               top operative, back under deep cover
               on your most important mission.  People
               are trying to kill you left and right.
               You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...

     McClane interrupts himself.

                         QUAID
               Go on.

                         MCCLANE
                    (sits back)
               I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug.
               Just rest assured, by the time the trip
               is over, you get the girl, you kill
               the bad guys, and you save the entire
               planet.
                    (smiles confidently)
               Now you tell me.  Is that worth three
               hundred measly credits?

     Quaid smiles reluctantly.  McClane's got him hooked.


  20 INT. REKALL - MEMORY STUDIO - DAY                                20

     Quaid sits in a "dentist's chair" in an office which is a
     cross between an operating room and a sound mixing booth.
     An IV tube is connected to the back of his hand, and he wears
     a GREEN SURGICAL SMOCK over his street cloths.

     ERNIE, a hyperactive young technician, lowers over Quaid's
     head a burnished metal bowl at the end of an elbow arm.  He
     has the air of an acid-head who's still out there.

                         ERNIE
               Just relax.  First trip?

                         QUAID
               Mm-hmm.

     Ernie carefully aligns the complex scientific instrument and
     locks it in place.

                         ERNIE
               Don't worry.  Things hardly ever fuck
               up.

     The door opens and a bird-like, middle-aged woman enters in a
     stylish pants suit.  DR. LULL is too skinny and her hair is
     too red.  She treats Quaid with impersonal conviviality.

                         DR. LULL
               Good evening...
                    (checks video-chart)
               Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.

                         QUAID
               Nice to meet you.

     Dr. Lull flips through Quaid's computer chart.

                         DR. LULL
               Ernie, patch in matrix 62B, 37, and...
                    (looks at Quaid)
               Would you like us to integrate some
               alien stuff?

     In quick succession, Dr. Lull runs through a series of
     graphics on the computer screen representing "memory trip"
     cassette covers.  We see pictures of slimy green Martians.

                         QUAID
               Two-headed monsters?

                         DR. LULL
               Don't you keep up with the news?  We're
               doing alien artifacts now.

     Dr. Lull and Quaid share a facetious smile.

                         QUAID
               Sure.  Why not?

     The latest graphic appears on the screen:  a sophisticated
     archaeological dig inside a red cave.  Dr. Lull crosses the
     room to get another laser disk.  She tosses it to Ernie, who
     examines the cover art with interest before plugging it in.

                         ERNIE
               That's a new one.

     Dr. Lull fastens straps over Quaid to hold him in place and
     makes perfunctory conversation.

                         DR. LULL
               So, been married long?

                         QUAID
               Eight years.

                         DR. LULL
               I see.  Slipping away for a little
               hanky-panky.

                         QUAID
               Not really.  I've just always been
               fascinated by Mars.

                         ERNIE
               All systems go.

                         DR. LULL
                    (fastens last strap)
               Then we're all set.

                         DR. LULL (CONT'D)
               Ready for dream land?

     Quaid nods and Dr. Lull shoots him in the neck with the
     medicine gun.

                         DR. LULL (CONT'D)
               I'll be asking you a few questions,
               Doug, as we can fine tune the ego
               program.  Answer honestly, and you'll
               enjoy yourself a whole lot more.

     Quaid begins to feel the effects of the anaesthetic.  Dr. Lull
     checks his vital signs.

                         DR. LULL (CONT'D)
               Your sexual orientation?

                         QUAID
               Hetero.

                         DR. LULL
               Hmmm.
                    (flips a switch)
               And how do you like your women?

     Quaid looks drowsily at a schematic female outline on a
     computer screen.  With each decision, the computer image
     adjusts to correspond to Quaid's taste.

                         DR. LULL (CONT'D)
               Blonde, brunette, redhead?

                         QUAID
               Brunette.

                         DR. LULL
               Slim, athletic, voluptuous?

     The schematic figures fills out, her breasts expanding to
     enormous size.

                         QUAID
                    (woozy)
               Athletic.

     The computer figure returns to more normal proportions.

                         DR. LULL
               Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.

                         QUAID
               Sleazy...and demure.

                         DR. LULL
                    (with certainty)
               Forty-one A, Ernie.

     Ernie inserts cassette 41A into his console.  The computer
     image seems very similar to the woman in Quaid's dream.

                         ERNIE
               Boy, is he gonna have a wild time.
               Won't wanna come back.


  21 INT. MCCLANES OFFICE - DUSK                                      21

     McClane is talking with another prospective client, a
     spinsterish, middle-aged woman, MISS LONELYHEARTS.

                         MCCLANE
               So, what do you say?

                         MISS LONEYHEARTS
               I'm not so sure.
                    (complains)
               But there won't be any souvenirs.

                         MCCLANE
               Not true.  For just a few credits more,
               we supply T-shirts, snapshots of you
               at the sights, and letters from the
               handsome men you'll meet.

     The VIDEOPHONE rings, and Dr. Lull appears on his screen.

                         DR. LULL (LIVE FEED)
               Bob?

                         MCCLANE
                    (impatient)
               What is it?

                         DR. LULL
               You better get down here.

     McClane rolls his eyes, as if in league with the customer
     against the company.

                         MCCLANE
               I'm with an very important client.

                         DR. LULL
               Looks like another schizoid embolism.

     Miss Lonelyhearts is scandalized.  McClane stands and attempts
     a reassuring smile.

                         MCCLANE
               I'll be right back.

                         MISS LONELYHEARTS
               Mr. McClane, Mr. McClane.

                         TIFFANY
               Bob, what's wrong?


  22 INT. REKALL - MEMORY STUDIO - DUSK                               22

                         MCCLANE
                    (to Tiffany)
               Don't let her leave

     McClane strides into the memory studio, ready to kick ass,
     but he pulls up short at what he sees and hears.

     Quaid shouts and thrashes about in the chair, violently
     struggling to break the straps that hold him down.  He's like
     a different person:  a caged animal.

                         QUAID
               You're dead, all of you!  You blew my
               cover.

     Terrified, Dr. Lull and Ernie keep a safe distance from Quaid.
     McClane is merely aggravated.

                         MCCLANE
               What the fuck is going on here?!  You
               can't install a simple goddamn double
               implant?!

                         DR. LULL
               It's not my fault.  We hit a memory
               cap.

                         QUAID
               They'll be here any minute!  They'll
               kill you all!

                         MCCLANE
               What's he talking about?

                         QUAID
               Let me go!

     McClane walks up to Quaid and examines his eyes.

                         MCCLANE
               Mr. Quaid, try and calm down.

     Quaid breaks the strap holding his right arm and grabs McClane
     by the throat.

                         QUAID
                    (quietly menacing)
               My name's not Quaid.

     McClane, choking, tries to pry Quaid's hand from his neck,
     but he can't loosen the iron grip.

                         QUAID
               Untie me.

     Ernie rushes over and unsuccessfully tries to wrestle Quaid's
     arm down, using his full body weight.  McClane's eyes are
     bulging.

     Dr. Lull frantically jabs a SYRINGE GUN into Quaid's thigh
     and fires dose after does until Quaid's grip weakens and he
     passes out.

     McClane falls to the ground, gagging.  Dr. Lull goes over
     to help him.

                         DR. LULL
               Are you all right?

     McClane shoves her away and gasps for breath.

                         DR. LULL (CONT'D)
               Listen to me!  He's been going on and
               on about Mars.
                    (frightened)
               He's really been there.

                         MCCLANE
                    (raspy)
               Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's
               acting out the secret agent role from
               his Ego Trip!

                         DR. LULL
                    (superior)
               I'm afraid that's not possible.

                         MCCLANE
                    (condescending)
               Why not?

                         DR. LULL
               We haven't implanted it yet.

     McClane falls silent.  Suddenly he's terrified.

                         MCCLANE
               Oh shit....Oh shit...

                         DR. LULL
               I've been trying to tell you.  Someone
               erased his memory.

                         ERNIE
                    (hysterical)
               Excuse me, someone?  We're talking the
               fucking Agency!

                         DR. LULL
               Shut up!

                         TIFFANY
               Bob, the client's gone.

     WHACK!  Dr. Lull SLAPS Ernie across the face.  Her violent
     act shocks everyone to silence, including herself.  McClane
     tries to think.

                         MCCLANE
               Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
               Renata, cover up any memory he has of
               us or Rekall.

                         DR. LULL
               I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy
               in there.

                         MCCLANE
               Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the
               corner.  Tiffany, you help him.
                    (Ernie nods)
               I'll destroy his file and refund his
               money.
                    (stands)
               And if anybody comes asking...we've
               never heard of Douglas Quaid.

                         DR. LULL
               Come on...put his head in place.

     They look at Quaid, sprawled unconscious in the chair.


  23 EXT./INT. TAXICAB - NIGHT (RAIN)                                 23

     Quaid, befuddles, slowly comes to his senses in the back seat.
     It's pouring RAIN outside.

                         QUAID
               Where am I?

                         CABBIE
                    (cheerful)
               You're in a JohnnyCab!

                         QUAID
               I mean...what am I doing here?

     Through WINDSHIELD, we see that the Cabbie is a smiling
     robotic mannequin in an old-fashioned cabbie's uniform.  His
     vehicle is a JOHNNYCAB, the automated Checker Cab of the
     future.

                         JOHNNY
               I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase
               the question.

                         QUAID
                    (impatient, enunciates)
               How did I get in this taxi?!

                         JOHNNY
               The door opened.  You got it.


  24 EXT. THE COMMONS - NIGHT (RAIN)                                  24

     The JohnnyCab dives up to the commons.  Quaid exits the
     JohnnyCab.

                         JOHNNY
               Thanks for taking JohnnyCab!  I hope
               you enjoyed the ride.

     Still woozy, he staggers down a covered walkway out of the
     pouring rain.  Harry, his buddy from work, approaches him.

                         HARRY
               Hey, Quaid!

                         QUAID
                    (surprised)
               Harry!

                         HARRY
                    (claps Quaid on shoulder)
               How was your trip to Mars?

     Harry walks with Quaid toward the SECURITY GATE leading to
     his apartment complex.

                         QUAID
               What trip?

                         HARRY
               You went to Rekall, remember?

                         QUAID
               I did?

                         HARRY
               Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but
               you did anyway.

                         QUAID
               What are you, my father?

                         HARRY
               Let me buy you a drink.

                         QUAID
               No, Harry, I'm already late...See you
               tomorrow.

     Suddenly, THREE LARGE MEN grab Quaid and rush him back
     downstairs to Harry who draws a gun.

                         QUAID
               Hey!

     Quaid starts to put up a fight.


  25 INT. COMMONS - NIGHT (RAIN)                                      25

     Harry and the Agents march Quaid along an interior corridor.

                         QUAID
               Harry, what the hell is this?

                         HARRY
               Come on, let's go have that drink.

                         QUAID (CONT'D)
               What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell
               me!

                         HARRY
               You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about
               Mars!

                         QUAID
               Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything
               about Mars.

  
  26 INT. COMMAND - NIGHT (RAIN)                                      26

     The goons throw Quaid against a wall and twist his arms behind
     his back.

                         HARRY
               You shoulda listened to me, Quaid.
               I was there to keep you outta trouble.

                         QUAID
               Harry, you're making a big mistake!
               You've got me mixed up with somebody
               else!

                         HARRY
               Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed
               up with somebody else.

     Harry starts to pull the trigger.  Quaid kicks with both legs
     -- one to Harry and one to the other Goon facing him.  Then he
     throws the goons holding him against the wall and cracks their
     heads together before throwing them aside.  Then he kicks
     Harry's gun out of his hand.

                         HARRY
               Son of a bitch.

     Then Quaid kicks the goon to his right in the stomach, then
     knees him in the face.  Then he karate chops the goon to his
     left in the face.  Then he steps forward onto Harry's neck.
     Harry reaches up and Quaid grabs his arms and cracks his neck
     by pulling up.

     Then the kicked goon attacks Quaid by grabbing his neck.
     Quaid gains the advantage and cracks the goon's neck.

     Then he steps toward the karate chop goon who is attacking
     with Harry's gun.  Quaid wrestles the gun from his and shoots
     him in the back, drops him and shoots the last Goon and runs
     away


  27 INT. QUAID'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT                         27

     Lori adjusts the HOLO-CONSOLE.  The image of a female TENNIS
     PLAYER pops up and executes a perfect swing.  Lori walks to
     the hologram and gets inside.  She imitates the movements
     of the holo-model, making minor adjustments to her form until
     they are completely IN SYNC.

     Bingo!  The hologram glows bright red and colors the room.

     The front door flies open, and Quaid enters, breathless.

                         LORI
               Hi, honey.

     Quaid darts around the apartment, crouched below window level,
     turning off every light in the place.

                         LORI (CONT'D)
               What are you doing?

                         QUAID
               Some men just tried to kill me!

     Quaid turns a switch at the holo-console, and BZZZT!  The
     hologram disappears.  Lori stands there, alarmed, as Quaid
     keeps turning off lights.

                         LORI
               Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right?
               What happened?

                         QUAID
               No!  Spies or something.  And Harry
               from work...Get down!

     Lori has stepped in front of a window.  Quaid drags her to
     the floor.

                         QUAID (CONT'D)
               Harry from work...He was the boss.

                         LORI
                    (bewildered)
               Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what
               happened?  Why would "spies" want to
               kill you?

                         QUAID
               I don't know!  It had something to do
               with Mars.

                         LORI
               Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.

                         QUAID
               I know it sounds crazy, but I went to
               this Rekall place after work, and...

                         LORI
                    (grabs him)
               You went to those brain butchers?!

                         QUAID
               Let me finish!

                         LORI
               What did they do to you?  Tell me!

                         QUAID
                    (embarrassed)
               --I got a trip to Mars.

                         LORI
                    (disapprovingly)
               Oh God, Doug.

                         QUAID
               Forget Rekall, will you!  These men
               were going to kill me...

                         LORI
               Doug, nobody tried to kill you.

                         QUAID
               They did!  But I killed them!

     Lori tries to lead Quaid to the sofa.

                         LORI
               Sweetheart, listen to me.  Those
               assholes at Rekall have fucked up your
               mind, and you're having paranoid
               delusions.

     Quaid holds up his hands, which are covered with blood.

                         QUAID
               You call this a paranoid delusion?!

                         LORI
               Doug...

     Lori is stunned.  She doesn't know whether to be afraid for
     Quaid--or of him.

                         LORI (CONT'D)
               Doug, I'm calling a doctor.

     He dashes to the bathroom, keeping low.

  29 INT. QUAID'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT                         29

     Upset, Lori makes a videophone call.

                         QUAID (O.S.)
               Don't!  Don't call anybody!

     An imposing man appears on the videoscreen.

                         MAN (RICHTER, LIVE FEED)
               Hello.  How can I help?


  30 INT. QUAID'S BATHROOM - NIGHT                                    30

     Quaid shuts the door.  He looks at himself in the mirror.  He
     twists the faucet and washes the blood off his hands.  Quaid
     splashes water on his face, takes a deep breath, dries off,
     then opens the bathroom door.  Tracer bullets RIP into the
     dark bathroom, smashing the mirror, walls, and fixtures.  The
     photograph on the dresser explodes.


  31 INT. QUAID'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT                         31

     Quaid dives forward and scrambles into the living area, which
     is also in total darkness.

                         QUAID
               Lori!  Run!

     Quaid hides behind the BAR, and peeks over the edge..  Bullets
     shatter bottles and glasses all around him.  He creeps around
     the bar and jumps toward the far wall.  His assailant fires
     and looks for him with a flashlight.  Quaid lands behind the
     dining table and goes for the chair next to the display
     shelves.  As his assailant fires again, Quaid throws a chair
     and runs after it to attack the assailant.  Their fighting
     silhouettes are visible against the window.

     A gun SKITTERS across the floor.  We hear a few meaty THUDS,
     then a painful GRUNT as someone's breath WHOOSHES out.

     A LIGHT comes on, and Quaid is standing there with one hand
     on the lamp switch and the other arm circling Lori's neck
     in a chokehold!

     Quaid is astonished.  Devastated.

                         QUAID
               Lori...

     Lori elbows him in the ribs, hits him in the balls, then
     punches him in the face.  She then continues her assault on
     his pushing himbackwards along the kitchen counter.

     Quaid merely defends himself, unwilling to strike his wife.
     Under this handicap, he absorbs savage blows that would kill a
     lesser man.

     As Lori winds up for the coup de grace, he throws her over the
     counter.  She flies all the way to the kitchen, where she
     lies, dazed.

     Quaid recovers his breath.

                         QUAID (CONT'D)
               Lori, why are you doing this?

     Lori grabs a carving knife from the wall and charges Quaid.
     He tumbles away just in time.  She pursues him, doing her best
     to slice him open.  He disarms her, and Lori still tries to
     grab the gun on the floor.  Quaid gets to it first and holds
     the gun to her head.

     Lori remains stubbornly silent.  Crazed, Quaid shoves the
     gun barrel in her ear.

                         QUAID (CONT'D)
               Not talk!  I said TALK!!

                         LORI
               I'm not your wife.

                         QUAID
               The hell you're not.

                         LORI
                    (panicked)
               I swear to God!...I never saw you before
               six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just
               a memory implant -- agghh!

                         QUAID
               You think I'm an idiot?
                    (bitter)
               Remember our wedding?

                         LORI
               It was implanted by the Agency.

                         QUAID
               And falling in love?

                         LORI
               Implanted.

                         QUAID
               Our friends, my job, eight years
               together, I suppose all this was
               implanted too?

                         LORI
               The job's real. -- But the Agency set
               it up.

                         QUAID
               Bullshit.

     Quaid pushes Lori away, but keep his gun trained on her.

                         LORI
               They erased your identity and implanted
               a new one.  I was written in as your
               wife so I could watch you, make sure
               the erasure took. -- Sorry, Quaid.
               Your whole life is just a dream.

     Quaid tries to defend his sanity with an air of sarcasm.

                         QUAID
               O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who
               the hell am I?

                         LORI
               Beats me.  I just work here.

     Quaid sits in a chair and rubs his forehead, trying to decide
     what to do -- how to react.  Lori is suddenly sweet and
     intimate.

                         LORI (CONT'D)
               But Doug...There's something I want
               you to know.  You're the best assignment
               I ever hand.  Really.

                         QUAID
               I'm honored.

                         LORI
               You sure you don't wanna...?  For old
               time's sake.  If you don't trust me,
               you can tie me up.

                         QUAID
               I didn't know you were so kinky.

                         LORI
               It's time you found out.

     Quaid catches Lori glancing at the VIDEO MONITOR which
     displays the lobby of the apartment building (LIVE FEED).
     AGENTS enter.  The leader in RICHTER, the "doctor" Lori
     called.  He radiates malevolence with a dark intensity.  His
     equally vicious partner is HELM.  Quaid glares at Lori and
     holds the gun to her head.

                         QUAID
               Clever girl.

                         LORI
               Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would
               you?  After all we've been through?

                         QUAID
               Yeah.  Some of it was fun.

     Lori leans seductively toward Quaid, expecting a caress.
     Instead, he knocks her out with the gun.

                         QUAID (CONT'D)
               Nice knowing you.

     Quaid stands and runs to the door.


  32 EXT. COMMONS - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                  32

     Quaid races down the hallway and runs downstairs.  A second
     later, Richter and his men dash across the commons, then up
     the stairs as Quaid watches and then exits.

     Richter finds Lori, unconscious, on the floor.


  34 EXT. COMMONS - STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                 34

     Quaid runs downstairs and into the subway.


  35 INT. QUAID'S LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT                         35

     Helm activates a futuristic TRACKING DEVICE and pans it around
     like a Geiger counter.  Other agents search the apartment.
     ONe agent tries to help Lori, Richter kicks him away.

                         RICHTER
               Don't touch her.

     She's comes to, groggy.

                         RICHTER (CONT'D)
               You all right?

     Lori gingerly checks out her bruise.

                         LORI
               Sorry, guess I blew it.

                         RICHTER
               What's he remember?

                         LORI
               Nothing, so far.

                         HELM
               I got him!

     Helm shows Richter the tracking device.

     CLOSE ON: A FLASHING RED DOT moving through a SCHEMATIC
     REPRESENTATION of the building.

     RICHTER AND HELM run to a window and look outside.  They see
     Quaid running down an inclined rooftop toward the Commons.

                         RICHTER
               Shit, he's going for the subway.  Let's
               get him.  Go!

     Helm and the other agents storm out.

     Richter lags behind and walks over to Lori.  They kiss
     passionately.

                         RICHTER
               Pack your stuff and get out of here.

     He heads for the door.

                         LORI
               What if they bring him back?

                         RICHTER
                    (turns around)
               Not a chance.

     Richter leaves.


  36 EXT. COMMONS - ENTRANCE TO SUBWAY - NIGHT                        36

     Richter, Helm and the agents run downstairs into the subway
     after Quaid.

                         RICHTER
               The subway....Go!


  37 INT. SUBWAY STATION - SECURITY AREA - NIGHT                      37

     Quaid arrives at the SECURITY AREA and passes behind the X-Ray
     screen.  He's a SKELETON.

     Suddenly ALARMS WAIL!!  RED LIGHTS FLASH!!  The skeleton is
     surprised.  Then he remembers the gun, which GLOWS BRIGHT RED
     in his bony hand!

     Guards spring forward to intercept him.  Quaid's SKULL sees
     them coming.  The skull turns and looks behind him.

     Richter and Company rush toward him at full speed.

     The Guards, now skeletons, storm closer.

     Trapped, his skull looks straight ahead (through X-ray screen,
     at camera), and runs forward.

     Quaid CRASHES THROUGH the X-ray screen, emerging from the
     image of his skeleton in a shower of glass.

     He races toward the subway platforms followed by Richter,
     Helm, the agents and guards.

     Quaid arrives at the intersection and barrels down the stairs.

                         RICHTER
               Move!  Move!

     A moment later, Richter arrives at the same place and consults
     the Tracking Device, which indicates Quaid's location.
     Richter signals everyone but Helm to continue on the same
     level.

                         RICHTER
               Go, go, go.  You come with me.

     Helm and Richter dash down the stairs.

  43 INT. SUBWAY - LOWER LEVEL ESCALATOR - NIGHT                      43

     Quaid turns a corner and runs onto an escalator flowing up.
     As he rises, he looks behind him, then AHEAD -- and there
     they are!  Four agents arrive at the upper escalator landing.
     They look down; see him; shoot!

     Most of the commuters crouch to the ground, but an UNLUCKY
     BUSINESSMAN catches a bullet in the face.  Dead, he falls
     backwards onto Quaid.

     Quaid grabs Unlucky's body and, using it as a shield, mounts
     the escalator.

     The Agents keep firing, blasting the body to bits.  Quaid
     fires up at this enemies, killing one, two, three four!

     But the gunshots continue!  Richter and Helm, now behind him,
     shoot as they run up the escalator.

     Quaid hurls the remains of the corpse at them, knocking them
     down.  He arrives at the top of the escalator and runs away.

     Richter and Helm struggle out from under the corpse.  They run
     after Quaid from the escalator.

                         HELM
               Platform!

                         HELM
               Up to the right.

     Quaid fights his way through the exiting passengers to a train
     that is leaving.  He runs along the side of the train, breaks
     a window and dives into the train, bowling down passengers.

     Richter and Helm charge into the area, see Quaid, and shoot
     at his with total disregard for innocent bystanders.

     Richter and Helm get a clearer shot at Quaid.  Their bullets
     are coming closer.  They only manage to shoot out the windows
     and the train leaves the station.


  45 INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT                                          45

     Suddenly, it's quiet.  In shock, no one says a word.  The
     only VOICE comes from a line of TEN TELEVISIONS, all playing
     the same commercial.

     ON TV, A HUCKSTER delivers a sales pitch in CLOSE UP.  ZOOM
     OUT and reveal that he stands in front of a gargantuan rocket
     ship on a launching pad.

                         HUCKSTER
               Don't settle for pale memories!  Don't
               fall for fake implants!  Experience
               space travel the old-fashioned way on
               a real-live holiday you can afford.

     The rocket sails through space past the Earth orbit.

     Quaid shakes his head and sighs.


  46 EXT. COMMONS - NIGHT                                             46

     Richter and Helm angrily stride out of the station and gets
     in their CAR.

                         RICHTER
               I want that fucker dead.

                         HELM
               I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want
               Quaid porkin' my old lady.

                         RICHTER
               Are you saying she liked it?

                         HELM
               I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute
               of it.


  47 INT. RICHTER'S CAR - NIGHT                                       47

     The dashboard is filled with elaborate tracking devices,
     electronic maps, and communications equipment.  In the
     passenger seat, Richter furiously turns knobs and punches
     buttons, unsuccessfully trying to get a reading on Quaid.

                         RADIO (O.S.)
               Six beta nine, we have a live
               transmission from Mr. Cohaagen.

                         RICHTER
               Richter here.  Patch it through.

     A video monitor lights up with a grainy image of Cohaagen's
     angry face.

                         COHAAGEN (LIVE FEED)
               What the fuck is going on down there?!

                         RICHTER
               I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.

                         COHAAGEN
               If I wanted him dead, you moron, I
               wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.

                         RICHTER
               We can't let him run around.  He knows
               too much.

                         COHAAGEN
               Lori says he can't remember jack shit!

                         RICHTER
               That's now.  In an hour, he could have
               total recall.

                         COHAAGEN
               Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid
               delivered alive for re-implantation.
               Have you got that?  I want him back
               in place with Lori.

     Richter is mortified.

                         COHAAGEN (CONT'D)
               Did you hear me?

     Richter turns a dial, causing the reception to break up.

                         RICHTER
               What was that?  I couldn't hear you.

                         HELM
               I've got Quaid.

                         COHAAGEN
               I said I want him back in place with
               Lori...

     Richter deliberately intensifies the interference.  Cohaagen
     makes vituperative threats which we can't decipher.

                         RICHTER
               Hello?  We've got sunspots.  I'm
               switching to another channel.

     Helm nudges Richter.  A blinking red dot flashes on the
     Tracking Device on a map filled with large CIRCLES.  Richter
     is happy to see it.  He snaps his fingers and points Helm
     forward.

                         RICHTER (CONT'D)
               I'm losing you sir.

     Richter ends the transmission as Helm guns the car into
     traffic, splashing water on commuters.

                         RICHTER
               Where is he?

                         HELM
               Level 2.  Galleria.

                         RICHTER (CONT'D)
               He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.


  48 EXT. SUBWAY/MALL - NIGHT                                         48

     Quaid walks out of a Subway Station and emerges in a round
     shopping plaza sunk in the middle of a traffic circle.  Cars
     whiz around the periphery of the plaza, which has degenerated
     into a slum, complete with bars, flophouses, pimps,
     prostitutes, gangs, motorcycles, peddlers, and drunks sleeping
     in doorways.

     In the distance, he sees a flashing sign on a flophouse, HOTEL
     RITZ.


  49 EXT./INT. RICHTER'S CAR - NIGHT                                  49

     Richter fulminates as Helm zigs in and out of traffic,
     HONKING.

     Helm looks away at the TRACKING DEVICE, which zooms to a more
     detailed map section.

                         HELM
               Circle twenty-eight.  Top level.


  50 INT. RITZ HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                     50

     Quaid no sooner enters and closes the curtains than the
     videophone RINGS.  He doesn't answer.  On the fourth ring, he
     steps to the side of the screen, so he can't be seen, and lets
     the call through without saying anything.

     The videophone screen shows a man's hand blocking the lens.

                         CALLER (LIVE FEED)
               If you want to live, don't hang up.

     Quaid doesn't hang up.

                         QUAID
               What do you want?

                         CALLER (CONT'D)
               They've got you bugged, and they'll
               be busting down the door in about three
               minutes unless you do exactly what I
               say.

     Out of sight, Quaid searches his clothes for the bug.

                         CALLER (CONT'D)
               Don't bother looking.  It's in your
               skull.

                         QUAID
                    (looks around, spooked)
               Who are you?

                         CALLER
               Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it
               around your head.  That'll muffle the
               signal.

                         QUAID
               How'd you find me?

                         CALLER
               I'd advise you to hurry.

     Quaid sees the sink on the other side of the room.  Once he
     walks in front of the videophone to get there, the caller
     continues.

                         CALLER (CONT'D)
               This'll buy you some time.  They won't
               be able to pinpoint you.

     Quaid feels like a fool, but he wets a large towel and begins
     to wrap it around his head.

                         STEVENS
               And hurry.


  51 INT. RICHTER'S CAR - CROSS STREETS - NIGHT                       51

     CLOSE ON: TRACKING DEVICE.  The frame ZOOMS OUT six levels
     of detail to general map of the area.  The blinking light
     grows dim.

                         RICHTER
               Shit!

                         HELM
               What is it?

     Richter fiddles with the tracking device, then whacks it a few
     times.

                         RICHTER
               We lost him!


  52 INT. RITZ HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                     52

     Quaid finishes wrapping the wet towel around his head like
     a turban.

                         CALLER
               Now go to the window.

     Quaid pulls aside a curtain and peeks outside.

                         CALLER (CONT'D)
               Can you see me down there?


 52A EXT. RITZ HOTEL/PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT                              52A

     Quaid looks out and SEES the phone booth. (INTERCUT
     VIDEOPHONE/PHONE BOOTH/HOTEL ROOM)  STEVENS, a mustachioed
     soldier-of-fortune, holds up a DOCTOR'S SATCHEL.  Quaid can't
     clearly see the man's face.

                         STEVENS
               This is the suitcase you gave me.

                         QUAID
               I gave you?

                         STEVENS (CONT'D)
               I'm leaving it here.  Come get it and
               keep moving.

     Quaid see Stevens begins to hang up.

                         QUAID
               Wait!

                         STEVENS
                    (impatient)
               What?

                         QUAID
               ...Who are you?

                         STEVENS
                    (abrupt, irritated)
               We were buddies in the Agency back on
               Mars.  You asked me to find you if you
               disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.

                         QUAID
               What was I doing on Mars?!  Damn!

     The line goes dead.  Stevens leaves the phone booth.  Quaid
     dashes out of the hotel room.


  53                                                                  53

  55 EXT. RITZ HOTEL/PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT                              55

     Quaid runs out of the hotel, glances around for Stevens, then
     hustles over to the phone booth, where a sweet LITTLE OLD LADY
     is pulling out the suitcase.

                         QUAID
               Excuse me, ma'am.  That's mine.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
               I don't see your name on it.

     Quaid takes hold of the suitcase and pulls gently, but the
     Old Lady won't let go.

                         QUAID
               Somebody left it for me.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
               Go find your own bag!

     The Little Old Lady clutches the suitcase to her chest with
     all her might.  At a loss, Quaid rips it away from her.

                         QUAID
               Sorry, ma'am.  I need it.

     Quaid turns and walks off.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
               Fuck you, asshole!

 64A INT./EXT. RICHTER'S CAR/OUTSIDE THE MALL - NIGHT                 64A 

     Richter and Helm drive up to the Mall, looking for Quaid.
     Helm consults the Tracking Device, which displays only  a
     vague map of the whole area.  Suddenly the red dot gets
     brighter.  He looks around and sees Quaid approaching a
     Johnnycab.

                         HELM
               That son of a bitch got to be around
               here somewhere.

                         RICHTER
               I've got him.  The guy in the turban.

     Helm slams on the brakes and brings the car to a SCREECHING
     halt.

     Quaid turns to the sound and sees Richter and Helm.


  65 INT. JOHNNYCAB/MALL - NIGHT                                      65

     Quaid jumps in the Johnnycab.  Johnny turns around and
     addresses him.

                         JOHNNY
               Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?

                         QUAID
               Drive!  DRIVE!!

     Quaid sees Richter and Helm leave their car and rush straight
     at him.

                         JOHNNY
               Would you please repeat the destination?

                         QUAID
               Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!!
               SHIT!!

     Richter and Helm take aim through the crowd.

                         JOHNNY
               I'm sorry.  I'm not familiar with that
               address.

     Quaid furiously wrenches Johnny (an armless torso) from his
     console, drags him into the back seat and takes off in the
     Johnnycab just as Richter and Helm run up.

     Richter and Helm fire.  A window shatters in the Johnnycab.

     Quaid leans over the driver's seat and awkwardly turns the
     steering joystick.  The cab starts spinning.  As Richter and
     Helm keep shooting, the windows blow out in sequence.

                         JOHNNY'S HEAD
               Please fasten your seat belt.

     Quaid fiddles with the joystick.  When he reaches the limit
     of his frustration, Johnnycab suddenly straightens out.

     Richter and Helm run after it.

  66                                                                  66

  70 EXT. CEMENT FACTORY - NIGHT                                      70

     Quaid drives Johnnycab up to an abandoned factory and exits,
     taking the case with him.

                         JOHNNY
               The fare is eighteen credits, please.

                         QUAID
               Quit while you're ahead.

                         JOHNNY
                    (spewing sparks)
               Thanks for taking Johnnycab.

     Johnnycab starts forward after Quaid who is walking away.
     Quaid jumps out of the way just in time as Johnny goes past
     and crashes into a wall and explodes.

                         JOHNNY
               We hope you enjoyed the ride.

     Quaid runs away from the explosion and up some stairs,
     entering the factory.


  71 INT. CEMENT FACTORY - NIGHT                                      71

     Quaid enters into the MACHINE ROOM, a huge space filled with
     rusted equipment.  Rats scurry out of his way.

     Quaid sets the satchel on an assembly line apparatus and
     removes the contents:  Packets of MARTIAN MONEY.  Quaid
     whistles to himself as he flips through the RED BANK NOTES.  A
     few false IDENTITY CARDS with photos we can't clearly see.  A
     SPACE SHUTTLE TICKET TO MARS, FIRST CLASS.  A weird SURGICAL
     INSTRUMENT sealed in clear plastic.  A WRIST WATCH.

     As Quaid examines the watch, he is startled by a fearsome
     INTRUDER who stares at him from the shadows about thirty feet
     away.  Quaid draws his gun and FIRES.  The Man simultaneously
     SHOOTS at Quaid.

     Who's going to drop?  Neither.

     Guns extended, they have each other in check.  Quaid takes
     a step forward.  The Intruder also steps into the light.

     Quaid can now see the Intruder.  It's himself!  Or rather,
     a mirror image HOLOGRAM of extremely high fidelity.

     He walks toward the hologram, which matches him step for step.
     Like the Marx Brothers routine, Quaid makes a sudden movement.
     The hologram isn't fooled.

     Quaid presses a button.  BZZZT.  The hologram disappears.

     He reaches into the satchel and removes a miniature VIDEODISC
     PLAYER/TV SET.

     Quaid turns it on.

     ON THE TV SCREEN Quaid himself appears in close-up and
     addresses the camera.

                         HAUSER
               Howdy, Stranger; this is Hauser.  If
               things have gone wrong, I'm talking
               to myself--and you've got a wet towel
               wrapped around your head.

     Hauser laughs heartily.  He has an air of complete
     self-confidence.  Quaid watches, fascinated.

                         HAUSER (CONT'D)
     Now whatever your name is, get ready for the big
     surprise.--You're not you.  You're me.

     Quaid stares at Hauser's face.

                         QUAID
               No shit.


  72 EXT./INT. RICHTER'S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT                        72

     Richter and Helm drive around, looking for Quaid and trying to
     pick him up on the tracking device.

                         AGENT
               Six beta nine, six beta nine, come in.

     Richter punches a button, and the agent appears on the
     videophone screen.

                         RICHTER
               You found him?

                         AGENT
               No.  We picked up an explosion at the
               old cement factory.

                         RICHTER
               Send two units.  We'll meet them there.

                         AGENT
               Roger.

     The car accelerates.


  73 INT. CEMENT FACTORY - MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT                       73

     Fascinated, Quaid continues watching his alter ego.

                         HAUSER
               All my life I worked for Mars
               Intelligence.  I did Cohaagen's dirty
               work.  Then a few weeks ago, I met
               somebody--a women. And I learned a few
               things; like I've been playing for the
               wrong team.
                    (sighs)
               All I can do now is try to make up
               for it
                    (taps on his forehead)
               There's enough shit in here to fuck
               Cohaagen good. Unfortunately, if you're
               listening to this,  that means he got
               to me first.  And here comes the hard
               part, old buddy:  now it's all up to
               you.

     Quaid's not so sure he likes this idea.

                         QUAID
               Great.

                         HAUSER (CONT'D)
               Sorry to drag you into it, but you're
               the only one I can trust.


  74 EXT. CEMENT FACTORY COMPOUND - NIGHT                             74

     Richter's car and two other Agency vehicles cruise down the
     alleys between the various buildings, alert for any sign of
     Quaid.  They drive to the burning Johnnycab and exit their
     cars.

                         RICHTER
               What do we got?

                         AGENT
               He's not here.  He's gone.

                         HELM
               I've got a weak signal over there.

                         RICHTER
               Split up.  Find him.


  75 INT. CEMENT FACTORY - MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT                       75

     ON TV:  Hauser reaches into the same satchel that Quaid picked
     up at the pawn shop.

                         HAUSER
               First, let's get rid of that bug in
               your head.
                    (holds up plastic bag)
               Take this thing out of the case and
               stick it up your nose.  Don't worry;
               it's self guiding.  Just shove real
               hard...

     Quaid throws the remainder of his Mars bar to the rats and
     takes out "the thingy in the plastic bag".  He tears it open
     and removes a surgical instrument that looks like the metallic
     tentacle of an alien.

                         HAUSER (CONT'D)
               When you hear the crunch, you're there.
               Just pull it out.

     He sticks the tentacle up his nose and shoves.  Whoa!  Quaid
     grimaces with pain.

                         HAUSER (CONT'D)
               And be careful.  It's my head, too.

     The recorded message freeze-frames.  Quaid warily sits down
     and continues with the procedure.

     As the instrument winds through his sinuses, Quaid's face
     bulges and distorts.  The pain grows more and more intense
     until CRUNCH!  The instrument breaks through cartilage and
     stops.

     Quaid pulls the large device from his nose.  The homing device
     glistens like an aluminum pea in a tiny claw at the end of
     the tentacle.

     Quaid takes the bloody pea, rolls it between his thumb and
     forefinger, then shoves it into a Mars bar.


  76 EXT. CEMENT FACTORY COMPOUND - NIGHT                             76

     Richter, Helm and the agents continue their search among the
     buildings of the factory.  Helm studies the tracking device.

                         HELM
               He's not at ground level.

                         RICHTER
                    (signals to agents)
               Up!

     They all climb ladders and staircases to the second story of
     various buildings.

     They split up at the top of the stairs.  Richter, Helm and two
     agents continue across a catwalk.  Helm is consulting the
     tracking device.

                         HELM
               I've got a lock!  There!

                         RICHTER
               Come on!

     They head toward the building where Quaid is hiding.


  77 INT. CEMENT FACTORY - MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT                       77

     Recovering from the pain, Quaid presses a button on the
     Videodisc player, and the recorded message continues.

                         HAUSER
               Now this is the plan.  Get your ass
               to Mars.  Then go the Hilton and flash
               the Brubaker I.D. at the desk.  That's
               all there is to it.  Just do what I
               tell you, and we can nail that
               sonovabitch who fucked you and me and
               millions of other poor bastards here
               on Mars.
                    (personal)
               I'm counting on you, buddy.  Don't let
               me down.

     The TV automatically turns off.  Quaid is left in the silent
     darkness.

     He hears Richter and his men nearby, sees a beam from their
     flashlights and springs to his feet.

     Quaid races back to his things, throws them into the case,
     smashes the videoplayer with his case and runs.  He stops,
     and returns to put the bug in a piece of candy.


  78 INT. CEMENT FACTORY - ADJOINING ROOM - NIGHT                     78

     Richter and his men juke left and right like heat-seeking
     missiles.  The Tracking Device shows Quaid's exact location.

                         HELM
               Straight ahead...in there.

     Richter spins through a door into the...


  79 INT. CEMENT FACTORY - MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT                       79

     Flashlight beams cut through the dusty air  Richter and the
     others unleash a FIRE STORM in the general direction of
     Quaid's remains.

                         HELM
               There!

     Another fire storm ensues.  No luck.

                         HELM
               There!

     They all point in another direction.  Another fire storm.

                         HELM
               There!

     And they point in yet another direction.  And yet another fire
     storm.

     Richter now understands how they were tricked.  Infuriated, he
     BLASTS THE RAT TO A PULP.

                         HAUSER (O.S.)
               ...ass to Mars squrtrk Get your ass
               to Mars squrtrk...

     In the midst of the barrage, Helm walks up to Richter with
     the broken videoplayer which SQUAWKS like a broken record.
     Distracted, Richter stops shooting, turns and watches a
     static-ridden snippet of the recorded message on the CRACKED
     SCREEN.  Only a small shard of the videodisc remains inside.

                         HAUSER
               ...Get your ass to Mars squrtrk Get
               your ass to...


  80 EXT. MARS - DAY (WEEKS LATER)                                    80

     RED!

     A vacant, epic expanse of glowing crimson.

     A space ship drops into frame, retro rockets burning.  PAN
     DOWN with space ship as it descends in front of two moons,
     the Pyramid Mine, a distant city -- and prepares to land at
     the Mars SPACE PORT.


  81 INT. MARS SPACEPORT/IMMIGRATION HALL - DAY                       81

     CLOSE ON PASSPORT:  BAM!  An official seal stamps down on the
     document, leaving the circular imprint:  MARS FEDERAL
     COLONY/CONFEDERATION OF NORTHERN NATIONS.

     An IMMIGRATION OFFICER hands the passport back to its OWNER,
     who takes it and moves on.

                         IMMIGRATION OFFICER
               Next!

     The Immigration Hall is filled with passengers arriving from
     Earth, queued up in three long lines.  SOLDIERS on a high
     state of alert stand guard with AUTOMATIC RIFLES.

     QUAID'S SATCHEL sits on the floor behind a white line.  A hand
     reaches down, picks it up, and carries it forward.  FROM THE
     BACK, we see that the person carrying the satchel is a tall
     FAT LADY in a loose-fitting dress.  She steps up to the
     Immigration Officer at his desk.

                         IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)
               Passport.

     As the Fat Lady hands over her passport, SOLDIERS rush
     directly towards her from the rear of the hall, shoving people
     aside.  Richter, Helm, and EVERETT, a stern military officer,
     urgently follow in the path cleared by the Soldiers.

     They get closer and closer to the Fat Lady...and pass right
     behind her without noticing anything in the least suspicious.

                         EVERETT
               Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right
               away.

                         RICHTER
               Any news of Quaid?

                         EVERETT
               Not since you lost him.

                         RICHTER
               Watch your mouth, Captain.

     The group walks past the Immigration desks and exits the
     frame.  HOLD ON the back of the Fat Lady.

     The Immigration Officer studies her passport.  CLOSE ON her
     PHOTO.  He looks up.  CLOSE ON her FACE.

     She bears no resemblance to Quaid.

                         IMMIGRATION OFFICER
               How long do you plan to stay on Mars?

                         FAT LADY
               Two weeks.

                         HELM
               Look at this shit.

                         RICHTER (O.S.)
               What the hell is this?

     BEHIND THE DESKS, Richter stops at a wall defaced with
     graffiti: "KUATO LIVES!".

                         EVERETT
               The Martians all love Kuato.  They think
               he's fuckin' George Washington.

                         HELM
               Kill the bastard.

                         EVERETT
               Nobody knows who he is.

     The Immigration Officer picks up the seal, ready to stamp the
     Fat Lady's passport after one last perfunctory question.

                         IMMIGRATION OFFICER
               Have you brought any fruits or
               vegetables onto the planet?

                         FAT LADY
               Two weeks.

     He stops himself from hammering down with the seal.

                         IMMIGRATION OFFICER
               Excuse me...?

     Fat Lady covers her mouth, embarrassed.

                         FAT LADY
                    (loud)
               Two weeks.

     Richter glances at the Fat Lady but keeps walking toward the
     exit.

                         EVERETT
               And things are getting hot around here.
               The rebels took over the refinery last
               night.  No turbinium's going out.

     THE FAT LADY is having some kind of fit.  She keeps repeating
     the same phrase over and over, each time SLOWER and MORE
     DISTORTED, like a phonograph record running down.  Everybody
     stares at the poor woman.  She holds her mouth and tries to
     shut herself up.

                         FAT LADY
               Twooo weeeks.  Twoooooo weeeks.
               Twooooooo weeeeeeks.

     Richter stops and looks suspiciously at the Fat Lady. The
     Fat Lady sees him staring.  They lock eyes.  Richter knows!
     He points!

                         RICHTER
               Quaid!  That's Quaid!

                         EVERETT
               Where?

                         RICHTER
               There!  The woman!

     The Fat Lady edges to the side along a wall.

                         RICHTER
               Get him!

     Everett and his men are confused.

                         RICHTER (CONT'D)
               HER!

                         EVERETT
               Arrest that woman!

                         FAT LADY
               Twoooooo!  Weeeeeks!

     Richter, Helm, Everett and soldiers run over.  The Fat Lady
     twists her ear.  She is shaking radically.  Her face splits
     down the middle, revealing Quaid inside!

                         QUAID
               Catch!

     Quaid throws the split face at a SOLDIER near a window.  The
     Soldier instinctively catches the face, which snaps together
     and addresses him in a normal voice.

                         FAT LADY FACE
               Get ready for a big surprise.

     Just as the Soldier reacts, BOOM!  The face explodes.
     Everett, Richter and Helm fire at Quaid.  The gunfire bursts
     a window.

     The near-vacuum outside creates an INSTANT TYPHOON in the
     station.  WHRRRRRR!  Loose objects are sucked out through the
     broken window.  Richter, Helm, Everett and all the soldiers
     hold on for dear life.

     Quaid pulls himself along a stair railing toward a doorway.

     ALARMS sound and METAL BARRIERS slide down over windows and
     doorways, sealing off the depressurized area:  SQQRRCHANG!
     SQQQRRCHANG!  SQQQRRCHANG!

     Quaid thrusts out from a wall and rolls under a falling
     barrier.  SQQQRRCHANG!

     A metal sheet covers the shattered window.  SQQQRRCHANG!

     Instantly, the air is still and quiet.

     Richter sprints to Quaid's doorway and tries to pull up the
     metal barrier.  It won't give.  He YELLS at a young,
     frightened SOLDIER.

                         RICHTER
               Open it!!!

     The Soldier is speechless.  Furious, Richter backhands him
     with his gun.

                         RICHTER (CONT'D)
               Open the goddamn door!  Now!

     Everett grabs Richter's arm as he is about to strike again.

                         EVERETT
               I can't--they're all connected.

     Richter and Everett stare at each other with mutual hatred.


  82 INT. MARTIAN SUBWAY CAR - DAY                                    82

     The train CLATTERS through a dark tunnel.  The CROWDING AND
     FLASHING OF LIGHTS create a feeling of anxiety.

     REWARD POSTERS for KUATO are posted throughout the train.
     They contain no likeness of the wanted man.

     Quaid looks around, alert to potential danger.  He overhears
     snippets of various private conversations.

                         MARTIAN WIFE
               Then a few days later, Cohaagen raised
               the price of air.

                         MARTIAN HUSBAND
               Again?

                         MARTIAN #3
               Nobody on Earth gives a damn what
               happens up here.

                         MARTIAN HUSBAND
               They just want our turbinium, so they
               can zap things from space.

     RED LIGHT floods the car and the REVERBERATED CLATTERING
     DIMINISHES.  The subway emerges onto the surface of Mars.
     Through a window behind Quaid, we see the Pyramid Mine from
     his recurrent dream.

     Quaid turns, and sees the object of his obsession.
     Fascinated, he addresses a BURLY MINER standing next to him.

                         QUAID
               Excuse me.
                    (nods to mountain)
               What's that?

                         BURLY MINER
               You mean the Pyramid Mine?
                    (sees Quaid staring at it)
               I used to work there, till they found
               that alien shit inside.

                         QUAID
                    (dismisses the idea)
               Well, that's a rumor, isn't it?

                         BURLY MINER
               Think so?

     Quaid's eyes are rivited the object of his obsession.


  83 EXT. SURFACE OF MARS - DAY                                       83

     The train worms into a tunnel leading to the domed city of
     CHRYSE, perched on the side of a steep canyon.  High on the
     other ledge looms COHAAGEN'S HEADQUARTERS.


  84 INT. COHAAGEN'S OFFICE - DAY                                     84

     Cohaagen sits in his high-backed executive chair in front
     of a wall-sized picture window which overlooks a majestic
     panorama of the Pyramid Mine.

     We hear doors slide open, then footsteps.  Richter enters
     the frame.

                         RICHTER
               Mr. Cohaagen...You wanted to see me?

     Cohaagen swivels around in his chair.  He's smiling.

                         COHAAGEN
               Richter, do you know why I'm such a
               happy person?

                         RICHTER
               No, sir.

                         COHAAGEN
               Because I've got the greatest job in
               the solar system.  As long as the
               turbinium keeps flowing, I can do
               anything I want.  Anything.
                    (stands)
               If fact, the only thing I ever worry
               about is that one day, if the rebels
               win, it all might end.

     Cohaagen explodes, pounding his fist on the desk.

                         COHAAGEN (CONT'D)
               AND YOU'RE FUCKIN' MAKING IT HAPPEN!!!!
               FIRST YOU TRY AND KILL QUAID AND THEN
               YOU LET HIM GET AWAY!!

     Richter survives the barrage, shaken but not cowed.

                         RICHTER
               He had help.  From our side, sir.

                         COHAAGEN
                    (as if totally obvious)
               I know that.

                         RICHTER
                    (caught off guard)
               But I thought...

                         COHAAGEN
               Who told you to think?!  I don't give
               you enough information to think!
                    (points)
               You do what you're told!!  That's what
               you do!

                         RICHTER
               Yes, sir.

     Cohaagen feeds his GOLDFISH who swim around in a large
     spherical bowl.

                         COHAAGEN (CONT'D)
               Now let's get down to business.  Kuato
               wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he
               might be able to get it, cause they
               say he's psychic.  Now I have a little
               plan to keep this from happening.  --Do
               you think you can play along?

                         RICHTER
               Yes, sir.

                         COHAAGEN
               Great!  Because, otherwise I'll erase
               your ass.


  85 INT. TRANSPORTATION HUB - DAY                                    85

     A mob of passengers disembark from a commuter train.  Amid
     the crowd, we find Quaid, doing his best to be inconspicuous.

     He moves through a broad underground plaza hewn from solid
     rock.  The railway platform is on one side, across from a
     large scale, bustling MINE OPERATION.

                         PUNK CABBIE
               Taxi!  Sir!  Taxi!  Sir!  Magazines!

                         BENNY
               Man!

     Around the Hub, OTHER TUNNELS lead to various neighborhoods
     (labeled SECTORS A-D, SECTOR E-F, etc.) and hotels.  Quaid
     walks into the tunnel labeled "HILTON".


  86 INT. HILTON HOTEL LOBBY/LOUNGE/RECEPTION - DAY                   86

     Quaid comes out of the inclined underground walkway into a
     spacious atrium under a glass dome.  The Pyramid Mine is
     visible straight ahead, through a high wall of glass.  Red
     sunlight bathes the lobby in a weird rosy glow.

     Quaid crosses the lobby and walks up to the REGISTRATION DESK.
     A CLERK addresses him.

                         CLERK
               Good afternoon.  Can I help you?

     Quaid hands his ID card to the Clerk.

                         QUAID
               I'd like a room, please.

     The Clerk takes the ID card and plugs it into a slot.  The
     "Brubaker" file shows up on the monitor.

                         CLERK
               Nice to have you back with us, Mr.
               Brubaker.

                         QUAID
               Thank you.

                         CLERK
               Would you like the same suite?

                         QUAID
               Definitely.

     The Clerk sees something unusual on the monitor.

                         CLERK
               Hmm.  It seems you left something in
               our safe.

                         QUAID
               Get it, please.

                         CLERK
               Identification?

     They press their thumbs to a safe-opener box.

     A small SAFE DEPOSIT BOX slides smoothly out of a wall.  He
     pulls the box from its track and sets it in front of Quaid.

     The clerk politely leaves Quaid alone.

                         CLERK
               I'll go encode your room key.

                         QUAID
                    (opens box)
               Thank you.

     The Clerk steps away, and Quaid look inside the box.

     It's empty....except in the back, there's a piece of red paper
     folded in eighths.  Quaid grabs the paper and hurriedly
     unfolds it.

     CLOSE ON: RED PAPER.  It's an advertising FLIER for a bar,
     THE LAST RESORT in VENUSVILLE, featuring a drawing of a naked
     woman.

     Quaid turns the paper over.  On the other side is a
     handwritten message:  "For a GOOD TIME, ask for Melina".

     The Clerk returns with a plastic key card, which he hands
     to Quaid.

                         CLERK
               There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610
               in the East Wing.

                         QUAID
                    (reaching for a pen)
               May I use your pen?

     CLOSE ON:  BACK OF FLIER.  Quaid scribbles "Melina" under
     the written message.  The handwriting matches.


  87 INT. TRANSPORTATION HUB - DAY                                    87

     Quaid comes out of the driveway from the Hilton and strides
     toward the cab stand.  On the way, he's approached by BENNY,
     an amiable black hustler in his early-thirties.

                         BENNY
               Hey, man...need a cab?

     Quaid nods toward the first taxi in line.

                         QUAID
               What's wrong with this one?

                         BENNY
               He ain't got five kids to feed.

     Quaid sees that the other cabbie is a PUNK in his early
     twenties.  He takes mercy on Benny.

                         QUAID
               Where's yours?

                         BENNY
               Over there man.

                         QUAID
               You got the job.

     As Benny leads Quaid away, the Punk Cabbie runs after them.

                         PUNK CABBIE
               That's my fare, you asshole!  Hey
               mister...goddamn it..fuck off
               man...shit!

     Suddenly, BOOM!  A HUGE EXPLOSION destroys the upper level
     of the mine.  Windows shatter.  The blast throws Benny to
     the ground and almost topples Quaid.  ALARMS go off.

     Benny staggers to his feet, slightly dazed.

                         BENNY
               Welcome to Mars.

                         QUAID
               What was that?  An accident?

     SOLDIERS dash from all directions and engage in a shootout
     with REBEL GUERRILLAS.

                         BENNY
               The rebels.  They're trying to shut
               down the mines.

                         BENNY (CONT'D)
               Let's get out of here...before they
               arrest us.

     Benny swings up the gullwing door of HIS MINI-CAB, and Quaid
     squeezes himself into the tiny vehicle.


  88 EXT./INT. BENNY'S CAB/TRANSPORTATION HUB - DAY                   88

     Benny quickly pulls into traffic.

                         QUAID
               What to the rebels want?

                         BENNY
               Oh, the usual.  More money, more
               freedom, more air.

     Benny cuts off several cars and drives into a dark tunnel.


  89 INT. TUNNEL - DAY                                                89

     Benny drives through the narrow tube.  Occasionally, a patch
     of red light hits the cab through a ceiling panel.

                         BENNY
               So, where to?

                         QUAID
               The Last Resort.

                         BENNY
                    (suggestive)
               You're getting off to an early start.

     The cab emerges into a plaza, immersed in red light.


  90 EXT./INT. MINING HUB - DAY                                       90

     Various tunnels lead to different SECTORS and different MINES.
     Benny's cab swerves out of the path of a stampeding mining
     MOLE.

                         BENNY
               First time on Mars?

                         QUAID
               Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.

                         BENNY
                    (to himself)
               Man don't know if he's been to Mars
               or not

     The cab zigs into a tunnel marked, "Sector G/VENUSVILLE".


  91 EXT./INT. VENUSVILLE PLAZA - DAY                                 91

     Benny's taxi emerges from a tunnel in the bustling adult
     entertainment district, filled with bars, brothels, cafes,
     strip joints, t-shirt shops, cheap hotels, and PSYCHIC
     PARLORS.

     Most of the buildings are dilapidated and covered with ads,
     signs, and graffiti.  REWARD POSTERS for KUATO are posted
     up everywhere.

                         BENNY
               Voila!  Venusville.

     Porters push handcarts and carry goods on their backs.
     SOLDIERS patrol the streets in pairs.  Huge fans blow air into
     Venusville.

     Quaid stares out the window, engrossed in the spectacle of the
     strange planet.  Benny parks the taxi by a pedestrian alley
     which is too narrow for cars.

                         BENNY
               Crazy Martian drivers.
                    (exasperated, to Quaid)
               We're going to have to walk from here.

                         MUTANT
               Would you like to know the future?

                         BENNY
               Come on.  It's around the corner.

     Benny leads Quaid down a crowded, narrow alley.  Barkers and
     hookers try to lure them inside.

     MADAME FATIMA stands in front of a psychic parlor with her
     LITTLE GIRL.  She looks like a knockout.  Benny nudges Quaid
     to look.  Hair covers half her face.

                         BENNY (CONT'D)
               Not bad, eh?

                         MADAME FATIMA
               Read your palm?  Read your aura?  Probe
               the secrets of your heart.

     As Madame Fatima steps forward, the fan blows her hair,
     revealing a horrible disfigurement on the concealed side of
     her face.  Quaid is shocked and disturbed to see that Madame
     Fatima's little girl had the same congenital defect.

                         LITTLE GIRL
               I bet I can guess your birthday.

                         QUAID
                    (bends low)
               What is it?

                         LITTLE GIRL
               You're a Taurus, right?

                         QUAID
                    (impressed, smiles)
               How'd you guess?

     Quaid gives the little girl a coin.  She smiles in gratitude.
     He walks on and turns to Benny.

                         QUAID (CONT'D)
               Tell me something; are all psychics,
               uh....?

                         BENNY
               Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with
               the territory.

                         QUAID
               What happened to them?

                         BENNY
               Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out
               the rays.

     Arriving at a corner, Benny points into a dead-end alley at a
     seedy dive.

                         BENNY (CONT'D)
               Well, there it is; the Last Resort.
                    (grimaces)
               Sure you wanna go in?

                         QUAID
               Why not?

                         BENNY
               I know a much better place down the
               block -- the girls are clean; the liquor
               ain't watered down...

                         QUAID
               And you get a kickback.

     Benny pleads guilty with a broad smile.  He has a mouth full
     of bad teeth, including two gold caps, one with a crescent
     moon design, the other with a star.

                         BENNY
               Hey, I got five kids to feed.

     Quaid peels a few large bills into Benny's hand.

                         QUAID
               Take 'em to the dentist.

     Benny counts the money, his eyes wide with amazement.  By
     the time is looks up, Quaid is walking away.

                         BENNY
               Hey, mister!...thanks!  I'll be waiting
               for you; take your time.  Benny's the
               name.  Benny!

     Quaid walks into the Last Resort.


  92 INT. LAST RESORT - DAY                                           92

     Quaid stops just inside the door and cases the joint.  It's
     a low-down whorehouse for miners.  Girls walk in and out,
     picking up clients and bringing them upstairs.  Some of the
     men play cards.

     Quaid walks to the bar and approaches the BARTENDER.

                         BARTENDER
               What do you want?

                         QUAID
               I'm looking for Melina.

                         BARTENDER
               She's busy. --But Mary here, she's free.

     Mary, a sexy, well-built prostitute, rubs against Quaid.

                         MARY
               Not "free" honey, but available.

     Quaid notices that Mary has THREE BREASTS, prominently
     displayed in a special bikini top.

                         QUAID
               I'll wait for Melina.

     Insulted, Mary farts and oozes over to another customer.

                         MARY
               Earth slime.

                         BARTENDER
               Thing is, friend, Mel's real picky.
               She kinda sticks to her regulars.

     Quaid presses a red banknote into the Bartender's hand.

                         QUAID
               Don't worry.  She will like me.

     The Bartender calls toward a table near the stairs.

                         BARTENDER
               Mel!  Hey, Mel!

     A woman carouses with a bunch of miners at a table.  She sits
     on the knee of a sullen, unshaven fellow named TONY.  GEORGE,
     who's relaxed and confident, sees the Bartender trying to get
     Melina's attention.  He signals her, and she turns around,
     laughing.  When she sees Quaid, her laugh fades to shock.

     Melina bears an uncanny resemblance to Quaid's fantasy
     composite at Rekall.

     Melina sashays over to Quaid and looks him up and down.

                         MELINA
               Hello there, Hauser.  Still bulging,
               I see.

     She kisses him wet and sloppy and rubs up against him.

                         MELINA (CONT'D)
               Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?

                         QUAID
               Blondes.

                         MELINA
                    (looks down)
               I think it's still hungry.

     Melina leads Quaid toward the stairs.  Tony sticks his leg
     out, blocking the way.

                         TONY
               You got a lotta nerve showin' your face
               around here.

                         QUAID
               Look who's talking.

     Tony grabs Quaid's arm, and they're about to come to blows
     when George defuses the situation.

                         GEORGE
                    (to Tony)
               Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a
               break.

                         QUAID
               Relax, you'll live longer.

     With some relief, Tony lets go of Quaid.

     Melina takes Quaid by the hand and leads him up the stairs.


  93 INT. LAST RESORT - STAIRWAY - DAY                                93

     They pass THUMBELINA, a beautiful midget in a push-up corset.
     She's going down.

                         MELINA
               Honey, take care of Tony, will ya?

     THUMBELINA surveys Quaid appreciatively.

                         MIDGET
               As usual.
                    (eyes Quaid)
               You need and help with this one gimme
               a holler.

  95 INT. LAST RESORT - MELINA'S CRIB - DAY                           95

     Quaid enters first, then Melina pulls the door closed behind
     her.  She turns to Quaid, smiles seductively, then SLAPS him
     hard across the face!

                         MELINA
               You son of a bitch!  You're alive!

     Quaid is stunned.

                         MELINA (CONT'D)
               I thought Cohaagen tortured you to
               death!

                         QUAID
               I guess he didn't.

                         MELINA
               You couldn't get me a message?  You
               never wondered what happened to me?

     Melina's tone of voice and bearing are suddenly completely
     different:  intelligent, dignified.  Quaid doesn't know what
     to say.  He looks at her, guilty yet innocent.

     Seeing Quaid's lost expression, Melina's wrath evaporates.

                         MELINA (CONT'D)
               Oh, Hauser...Thank God you're alive.

     She kisses him with deep feeling, engulfing him in a flood
     of chaste passion.  He makes half-hearted resistance.

                         QUAID
               Melina...Melina...

     Quaid summons the strength to push her away.

                         QUAID (CONT'D)
               Melina!

     Melina is flushed and panting.

                         MELINA
               ...What?

                         QUAID
               There's something I have to tell you...

     Melina waits, curious.  Quaid continues with difficulty.

                         QUAID (CONT'D)
               I don't remember you.

                         MELINA
               What are you talking about?

                         QUAID
               I don't remember you.  I don't remember
               us.  I don't even remember me.

     Melina half-laughs, not really believing him.

                         MELINA
               What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you
               get here?

                         QUAID
               Hauser left me a note.

                         MELINA
               Hauser?  You're Hauser.

                         QUAID
               Not any more.

     Melina looks at him with puzzlement.

                         QUAID
               Now I'm Quaid.  Douglas Quaid.

     She breaks into a grin.

                         MELINA
               Hauser, you're lost your mind.

                         QUAID
               I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it.
               He found out that Hauser switched
               sides,-so he turned him into somebody
               else.  Me.

                         MELINA
               This is too weird.

                         QUAID
               Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife
               and a lousy job and ...

                         MELINA
               Wait, did you say wife?...Are you
               fuckin' married!!?

     Quaid realizes he's stuck his foot in his mouth.

                         QUAID
               She wasn't really my wife.

                         MELINA
               Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How
               stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.

                         QUAID
               Forget I said wife.

                         MELINA
               No. Let's forget everything!  I've had
               it with you and your goddamn lies.

                         QUAID
                    (exasperated, innocent)
               Why would I lie to you?

                         MELINA
               Because you're still working for
               Cohaagen.

                         QUAID
               Don't be ridiculous.

                         MELINA
               You never loved me, Hauser!  You just
               used me to get inside.

                         QUAID
               Inside what?

     Quaid's curiosity seems to confirm Melina's suspicions.  She
     becomes cold and distant.

                         MELINA
               I think you better leave.

                         QUAID
               Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.

                         MELINA
               I'm not falling for it.

                         QUAID
                    (points to his head)
               He said there's enough in here to nail
               Cohaagen for good.

                         MELINA
               Get out!

     Quaid steps forward.

                         QUAID
               You've got to help me remember.

     Melina backs toward the bed.

                         MELINA
               I said get out!

                         QUAID
                    (closes in)
               Melina, please...People are trying to
               kill me.

     Melina pulls a HUGE AUTOMATIC PISTOL from under her mattress,
     and Quaid finds himself staring down the barrel.

                         MELINA
               Really?

     Quaid studies her steely eyes.

                         QUAID
               All right.  I'm leaving.

     Quaid backs out of the room.  Melina holds back tears.


  96 INT. LAST RESORT - DAY                                           96

     Benny sits at the bar and feels up Mary.

                         BENNY
               Oh, baby, you make me wish I had three
               hands.

                         MARY
               You're doing okay with two.

     Over her shoulder, Benny sees Quaid coming down from upstairs.

                         BENNY
               'Scuse me, babe.  We'll pick this up
               later.

     To Mary's surprise, Benny slips out of her embrace and pushes
     through the crowd.  He meets Quaid at the bottom of the
     stairs.

                         BENNY
               That didn't take long.

     Quaid ignores Benny and heads for the door.  Benny chases after
     him.

                         BENNY (CONT'D)
               Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck
               a mutant?

                         QUAID
               Take me to the hotel.

     Quaid walks out of the brothel.

     CAMERA watches them through a window as they disappear into
     the sights and sounds of Venusville.

                         BENNY
               I know these Siamese twins...Man, you
               don't know if you're comin' or goin'.

     George appears in the foreground in front of the window.
     He looks from the window to the top of the stairs, where
     Melina stands.

  98 INT. HILTON - QUAID'S ROOM - DAY (LATE)                          98

     Quaid lies forlorn on his bed in the dark, staring at the
     TV, but not really watching.  The blue light of the television
     flickers against the somber red of the setting sun.

     ON TV:  COHAAGEN delivers a speech from his office.

                         COHAAGEN
               This afternoon at 4:30pm, I signed an
               order declaring martial law throughout
               the Mars Federal Colony.  I will not
               tolerate any further damage to our
               mineral export operations.  Mr. Kuato
               and his terrorists must understand that
               their self-defeating efforts will only
               bring misery and suffering to the people
               of Mars.

     Quaid turns off the TV and stares at the ceiling.  He is
     startled by a KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

     Quaid sits up slowly, on alert.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
                    (through door)
               Mr. Quaid...?

     Quaid picks up his gun.

                         QUAID
               What?

                         VOICE (O.S.)
               I need to talk to you--about Mr. Hauser.

     Quaid COCKS his gun and approaches the door very cautiously,
     from the side.

                         QUAID
               Who are you?

                         VOICE (O.S.)
               Dr. Edgemar.  From Rekall.

                         QUAID
                    (stunned, incredulous)
               How did you find me?

                         EDGEMAR (O.S.)
               It's difficult to explain...Could you
               open the door, please.  I'm not armed.

     All of a sudden, Quaid flings opens the door and takes
     hair-trigger aim at...Dr. Edgemar from the Rekall
     commercial!!!  He's dresses in the same tweed jacket.  Quaid
     keeps the gun on Edgemar and glances up and down the hall.

                         EDGEMAR
               Don't worry; I'm alone. --May I come
               in?

     Quaid roughly pulls Edgemar into the hotel room and closes
     the door.  He frisks Edgemar and find to weapon.

                         QUAID
               What do you want?

                         EDGEMAR
               This is going to be very difficult for
               you at accept, Mr. Quaid.

                         QUAID
               I'm listening.

                         EDGEMAR
               I'm afraid you're not really standing
               here right now.

     Quaid can't repress a chuckle.

                         QUAID
               Ya know, Doc, you could have folled
               me.

                         EDGEMAR
               I'm quite serious.  You're not here,
               and neither am I.

     Quaid squeezes Edgemar's shoulder, verifying its solidity.

                         QUAID
               Amazing.  Where are we?

                         EDGEMAR
               At Rekall.

     Quaid's cockiness wavers.

                         EDGEMAR (CONT'D)
               You're strapped into an implant chair,
               and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe
               console.

                         QUAID
               Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this
               is all part of that delightful vacation
               your company sold me.

                         EDGEMAR
               Not exactly.  What you're experiencing
               is a free-form delusion based on our
               memory tapes.  But you're inventing
               it yourself as you go along.

                         QUAID
               Well, if this is my delusion, who
               invited you?

                         EDGEMAR
               I've been artificially implanted as
               an emergency measure.
                    (gravely)
               I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid,
               but you've suffered a schizoid embolism.
               We can't snap you out of your fantasy.
               I've been sent in to try to talk you
               down.

                         QUAID
               How much is Cohaagen paying you for
               this?

                         EDGEMAR
               Think about it.  Your dream started
               in the middle of the implant procedure.
               Everything after that--the chases, the
               trip to Mars, your suite here at the
               Hilton--these are all elements of your
               Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid
               to be a secret agent.

                         QUAID
               Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.

                         EDGEMAR
               What about the girl?  Brunette,
               athletic, sleazy and demure; just like
               you specified.  Is that a coincidence?

                         QUAID
               She's real.  I dreamed about her before
               I even went to Rekall.

                         EDGEMAR
               Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself?
               "She's real because you dreamed her?"

                         QUAID
               That's right.

     Edgemar sighs, discouraged.

                         EDGEMAR
               Maybe this'll convince you.  Would you
               mind opening the door?

     Quaid jabs his gun into Edgemar's ribs.

                         QUAID
               You open it.

                         EDGEMAR
               No need to be rude.  I'll do it.

     Quaid shadows Edgemar as he opens the door.

     Lori stands in the threshold!

     Quaid does his best to absorb another shock.

     Lori puts on a brave face, like holding back tears in front
     of a sick child.  There is not the slightest indication that
     she has even been anything but Quaid's adoring wife.

                         LORI
               Sweetheart...

                         EDGEMAR
               Come in, Mrs. Quaid.

     Lori walks in hesitantly.  Quaid pulls her to him and roughly
     frisks her.

                         QUAID
               I suppose you're not here either.

                         LORI
               I'm here at Rekall.

     Quaid laughs and roughly pushes her away.

                         LORI (CONT'D)
                    (crushed)
               I love you.

                         QUAID
               Right.  That's why you tried to kill
               me.

                         LORI
               Nooo!  I would never do anything to
               hurt you.  I want you to come back to
               me.

                         QUAID
               Bullshit.

     Lori's heart is breaking, but Quaid's is cold as ice.

                         EDGEMAR
               What's bullshit, Mr. Quaid?
                    (reasonable)
               That you're having a paranoid episode
               triggered by acute neuro-chemical
               trauma?
                    (derisive)
               Or that you're really an invincible
               secret agent from Mars who's the victim
               of an interplanetary conspiracy to make
               him think he's a lowly construction
               worker?

     Quaid's certainty in undermined.  Edgemar looks at him with
     great sympathy and kindness.

                         EDGEMAR (CONT'D)
               Stop punishing yourself, Doug.  You're
               a fine, upstanding man.  You have a
               beautiful wife who loves you.

                         LORI
               I do.

     Lori beams at him with pure affection.

                         EDGEMAR (CONT'D)
               Your whole life is ahead of you...
               But you've got to want to return to
               reality.

     Quaid is half-convinced, but doesn't want to show it.

                         QUAID
               Suppose I do...then what?

                         EDGEMAR
               Swallow this.

     Edgemar opens his hand, revealing a small pill.

                         QUAID
               What is it?

                         EDGEMAR
               It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return
               to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll
               fall asleep.

     Quaid picks up the pill and examines it.

                         QUAID
               All right.  Let's say you're telling
               the truth, and this is all a dream...

     Realizing something, Quaid raises his gun to Edgemar's head.

                         QUAID (CONT'D)
               Then I can pull this trigger, and it
               won't matter.

                         LORI
               Doug, don't!

     Edgemar remains preternaturally calm.  His eyes and voice
     express his unselfish concern for Quaid.

                         EDGEMAR
               It won't make the slightest difference
               to me, Doug, but the consequences to
               you would be devastating.  In your mind,
               I'll be dead.  And with no one to guide
               you out, you'll be stuck in permanent
               psychosis.

                         LORI
               Doug, let Dr. Edgemar help you.

     Finger on the trigger, Quaid is torn with doubt.

                         EDGEMAR
               The walls of reality will come crashing
               down.  One minute you'll be the savior
               of the rebel cause, then, next thing
               you know, you'll be Cohaagen's bosom
               buddy.  You'll even have ridiculous
               fantasies about alien civilizations--as
               you requested.  But in the end, back
               on Earth...You'll be lobotomized.

     Quaid becomes totally demoralized.

                         EDGEMAR (CONT'D)
                    (firm)
               So get a grip on yourself, Doug.  And
               put down the gun.

     Edgemar stares hard.  Quaid hesitantly lowers the gun.

                         EDGEMAR (CONT'D)
               Good... Now take the pill and put it
               in your mouth.

     Quaid puts the pill in his mouth.

                         EDGEMAR (CONT'D)
               Swallow it.

     Quaid hesitates.  Edgemar and Lori watch with great
     anticipation.

                         LORI
               Go ahead, sweetheart.

     Quaid is wracked with indecision.  Then he sees a single drop
     of sweat trickle down Edgemar's brow.  Abruptly, he swings his
     gun at Edgemar and fires.

     Edgemar's blood splatters in a dense circle on the wall.
     Quaid spits the pill out onto Edgemar's blood-stained body.

                         LORI
               Now you've done it!  Now you've done
               it!

     BOOM!  The blood stain EXPLODES, blasting Quaid backwards
     through the air.  FOUR MARS AGENTS storm through the big hole.

     Quaid ducks, turns, and starts to rise, facing toward the
     wall.

     Agent #1 rushes Quaid.  Quaid ducks as Agent #1 goes to hit
     Quaid with his gun, but goes over Quaid's shoulder.

     Quaid rises and flips #1 over his right shoulder.  #1 lands on
     bed.  As Quaid recovers, Agent #2 grabs Quaid's right arm.
     Agent #3 grabs Quaid's left arm, and Agent #4 comes in to hit
     Quaid.

     Quaid kicks #4 in the chest.  #4 flies backward.  Quaid then
     elbows #2 in the chest then backhands #2 across the face.  #2
     falls backwards.

     Quaid then throws a right cross at #3, who falls backwards, as
     Quaid follows through with his punch.  #4 comes in and kicks
     Quaid in the stomach with his right foot.  Quaid reacts, then
     backhands #4 across the face.  #4 hits the ground.

     #2 comes in with a right leg kick at Quaid's left
     shoulder/head.  Quaid grabs the leg and throws him.
     Instantly, #3 is rising up behind Quaid and hits him on the
     back of the head with his gun.  Quaid collapses and tries to
     crawl away towards the door.

     #1 grabs Quaid by the collar and shirt.  #4 grabs his left
     leg, and they try and restrain him.

     Then Lori steps in and kicks across the face, moves around to
     the other side and kicks him in the balls.  He stops
     resisting.

     Lori kicks him across the face again, Quaid falls backwards,
     unconscious.

                         LORI
               That's for making me come to Mars.
               You know how much I hate this fucking
               planet.  Cuff him.

     Lori looks down triumphantly and speaks into a wireless
     MINI-VIDEOPHONE.

                         LORI (CONT'D)
               I've got him.


  99 INT. HILTON - LOUNGE - DAY (LATE)                                99

     At the other end of the line, Richter sits at a bar next to
     Helm.  A panorama of Mars is visible behind them through the
     dome.

                         RICHTER
               Bring him down by the service elevator.

     Lori blows him a kiss.  End of call.  Richter and Helm slide
     off their stools, and run through the lobby to the service
     elevator.


 100 INT. HILTON - CORRIDOR/SERVICE ELEVATOR - 6TH FL. - DAY (LATE)   100

     Four agents drag Quaid, semi-conscious, to the SERVICE
     ELEVATOR, Lori follows.  An agent presses the call button.
     They wait.

     The doors slide open.  Melina stands inside and professionally
     assassinates the four agents who have their hands full with
     Quaid.

     Lori drops to the floor, swings her legs, and swipes Melina's
     feet out from under her.  Her gun goes flying.

     Then Lori kicks Melina in the face and the stomach and then
     flips her over her head.  They stand and face off, then Melina
     hits Lori in the face and kicks her in the stomach.

     Lori blocks Melina's next punch and elbows Melina in the ribs
     and flips Melina again, then elbows Melina in the face.

     Quaid squirms groggily over a pile of corpses and wrests a gun
     from a dead hand.

     Lori positions herself on top of Melina and pulls her head
     back.  Lori pulls a knife from an ankle sheath and prepares to
     plunge it into Melina's throat.

     PIYUNG!  The knife flies from Lori's hand.

     Quaid sprawls on the floor, hands cuffed in front of him.
     He holds a smoking pistol aimed at Lori.

                         LORI
               Doug...you wouldn't hurt me, would you,
               honey?

     She sees his expression.

                         LORI (CONT'D)
               Sweetheart, be reasonable...We're
               married.

     Lori stealthily reaches behind her back for a concealed gun.
     and pulls it on him.

     Quaid shoots Lori in the forehead, leaving a clean, small
     hole between her eyes.

                         QUAID
                    (rising, to Melina)
               Consider that a divorce.

     She falls backwards toward the elevator.  A beat...

                         MELINA
               That was your wife?

     He nods blankly.

                         MELINA (CONT'D)
               What a bitch.


 101 INT. HILTON - LOBBY SIDE/SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAY (LATE)           101

     Richter and Helm wait impatiently for the service elevator
     to arrive.  It's stuck on the sixth floor.  They realize
     something is wrong, and they run back to the passenger
     elevator in the lobby.

                         RICHTER
               Get out of the way!


 102 INT. HILTON - CORRIDOR/SERVICE-PASSENGER ELEVATORS - DAY (LATE)  102

     Melina hastily searches through the pockets of the dead
     agents.

                         QUAID
               I thought you didn't like me.

                         MELINA
               If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might
               be okay.

     Melina finds the key and starts unlocking Quaid's handcuffs.

                         QUAID
               So you dropped by to apologize?

                         MELINA
               Kuato wants to see you.
                    (off come the cuffs)
               Come on!

     She pulls him to his feet, and they run toward the passenger
     elevators.  The doors slide open:  Richter and Helm are
     inside!

     Melina pulls Quaid toward an adjacent corridor.  Richter and
     Helm charge out of the elevator, shooting.

     They chase after Quaid and Melina, until they almost trip over
     Lori's dead body.  Helm keeps going, but Richter, stunned and
     bereaved, kneels down and strokes her face.

                         RICHTER
               Oh, baby.


 103 INT. HILTON - CORRIDOR/BALCONY/DOME - DAY (LATE)                 103

     Quaid and Melina approach the end of the corridor:  A BALCONY
     which overlooks the lobby, far below.  The glass DOME
     stretches away at an incline, seemingly out of reach.

                         QUAID
               Now what?

                         MELINA
               Jump!

     Without missing a step, Melina and Quaid jump onto the
     balustrade and LEAP into the void.


 104 INT. HILTON - DOME - DAY (LATE)                                  104

     Quaid and Melina grab onto metal girders which form the matrix
     for the glass panes of the Dome.


 105 INT. HILTON - CORRIDOR/BALCONY/DOME - DAY (LATE)                 105

     Helm arrives at the balcony and takes aim, but he decides not
     to shoot.  Richter walks up a moment later, in a rage, and
     gets ready to fire.  Just as he pulls the trigger, Helm slams
     his arm down.  The gun discharges into the floor.

                         HELM
               No!  You're crack the fucking dome!
               Are you trying to kill us?!  The dome'll
               crack!

     Furious, Richter hits Helm and tries to shoot again.  Helm
     struggles fiercely with his much larger boss.

     Richter comes to his senses and stops fighting.  Looking over
     the banister, he sees that Quaid and Melina are climbing down
     the Dome to the lobby.  Richter and Helm dash back down the
     corridor.


 106 OMITTED                                                          106


 107 INT. HILTON - DOME - DAY (LATE)                                  107

     Silhouetted against the vast Dome like flies on a window,
     Quaid and Melina swing and slide toward the lobby.  On the
     way, they pass a WINDOW WASHER in a SPACESUIT on the outside
     of the Dome.

                         QUAID
               By the way...ever heard of a company
               names Rekall?

                         MELINA
               I used to model for 'em, why?

                         QUAID
               Just wondering.

     Quaid and Melina get into position and drop down into the
     Lobby.

 109 INT. HILTON - LOUNGE - DAY (LATE)                                109

     Quaid and Melina jump onto the lobby cat walk and then run to
     an exit that leads to the Hub.

     Quaid and Melina run into the street and look for a cab.
     Out of nowhere, a TAXI streaks up beside them.  The door wings
     up.  It's Benny.

                         QUAID
               Taxi!  Melina!  Melina!

     They dive inside.

                         BENNY
               Need a ride?

                         MELINA
               The Last Resort!  Quick!


 113 EXT./INT. BENNY'S CAR/TRANSPORTATION HUB - DAY (LATE)            113

     Benny's cab scoots into traffic.

                         BENNY
               You guys are going in circles.

     Richter and Helm run into the Hub; see the cab; shoot at it!

     The rear window of the taxi SHATTERS!

                         BENNY (CONT'D)
               Jesus!  Ya'll in trouble!

                         RICHTER
               Come on!

     Richter and Helm jump into their car and take off in pursuit,
     hitting a pedestrian.

     Benny's cab speed into a tunnel.

                         MELINA
               Shut up and drive!

                         BENNY (CONT'D)
               Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six
               kids to feed!

     Richter and Helm chase after Melina and Quaid.

                         RICHTER
               Faster!  Faster!

     Richter knocks out his window and fires at Quaid and Melina.
     They shoot back through the empty rear window frame.  Melina
     shoots the gun out of Richter's hand.

                         QUAID
               Not bad, for a hooker.

                         MELINA
               I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.


 116 EXT./INT. MINING HUB - DAY (LATE)                                116

     Benny's taxi jets out of the tunnel into the Mining Hub and
     swerves around a Mole.  Richter's car zooms into the Hub.
     He leans out the window again, only this time he has a MUCH
     BIGGER GUN.

     Benny makes a wide turn and fishtails into the Venusville
     (Sector G) tube.  Helm makes a tighter turn and gains some
     ground.  Richter blasts away with his Big Gun as his car
     enters the tunnel.


 117 EXT./INT. VENUSVILLE TUNNEL - DAY (LATE)                         117

     Benny's front windshield SHATTERS.  His taxi swerves out of
     control.


 118 EXT./INT. VENUSVILLE PLAZA - DAY (LATE)                          118

     Benny's cab careens out of the tunnel, weaves through the
     crowded area, and crashes into Madame Fatima's psychic parlor.


118A INT. SHOPS - DAY (LATE)                                         118A

     Benny's cab plows through the psychic parlor and a STRIP
     JOINT, finally coming to a stop in a COURTYARD.

     Out in the street, Richter's car screeched to a halt.  He
     and Helm run out and wade through the wreckage.

                         HELM
               Follow us!

     Quaid, Melina and Benny scramble out of the cab and start
     running down a narrow alley.

                         BENNY
               Aw, Christ!  Now they're after me!


118B EXT./INT. VENUSVILLE STREET - DAY (LATE)                        118B

     Melina, Quaid and Benny turn out of the alley onto a street.
     Richter and Helm follow a short distance back.  Before they
     can shoot, Melina, Quaid and Benny round the corner into the
     dead-end alley that leads to the Last Resort.


 119 EXT. LAST RESORT - DAY (LATE)                                    119

     The Bartender holds open the door.  Melina, Quaid, and Benny
     dash inside.


 120 INT. LAST RESORT - DAY (LATE)                                    120

     Melina leads Quaid and Benny through the crowd to the back of
     the brothel.

                         MELINA
               Tony!

     With rehearsed precision, Tony opens a concealed panel in the
     rear wall.  Melina, Quaid and Benny charge through the secret
     doorway.  Quaid stops for just a moment, and faces Tony.

                         QUAID
               Thank you Tony.

     Immediately, Tony and the Bartender close the panel, move the
     table into place, sit down, and manage to act non-chalant just
     as Richter and Helm charge inside, guns drawn.

                         HELM
               Spread out.

     The room falls quiet.  Richter and Helm wade into the club and
     look around.  SOLDIERS arrive and stand by the door.  Richter
     comes across Mary who's descending the stairs.

                         MARY
               What to have some fun?

                         RICHTER
               Where are they?

                         MARY
               What are you talking about.  I don't
               know...

     BANG!  Richter shoots Mary in the back.  Then he points his
     gun at Thumbelina and holds it on her.

                         RICHTER
               Maybe you know.

     Before she can respond, Tony comes from behind Richter and
     kicks the gun away.  Helm pivots to shoot Tony, when
     Thumbelina reaches up with a Bowie knife and guts Helm like a
     fish.

                         RICHTER
               Kill 'em!

     Richter runs from the stairs to the front of the Last Resort
     through the crowd and kicking and hitting two miners on his
     way to the window.  He reaches the window and jumps through
     and escapes.

 123 EXT. LAST RESORT - DAY (LATE)                                    123

     TEN SOLDIERS rush up just as Richter tumbles into the street.
     They cover his retreat with a rain of bullets.

     Richter dashes for cover behind a car  The soldiers exchange
     fire with rebels who snipe at them from inside the Last
     Resort.  Everett calls to Richter to come to the car and take
     a call on the videophone.

                         EVERETT
               Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.

                         RICHTER
               This is Richter sir...I've got them
               pinned down.

                         COHAAGEN
               Stop fighting and get out.

                         RICHTER
               They've got Quaid!  They're protecting
               him!

                         COHAAGEN
               Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now.
               Don't think.  Do it.

                         RICHTER
               Yes, sir.

     Cohaagen hangs up.  Richter just shakes his head.

                         RICHTER
                    (to Everett)
               Pull them out.

                         EVERETT
               O.K., everybody pull out!

     Quaid, Melina and Benny arrive at the hub and head toward a
     tunnel on the far side of the plaza....SQURRCHANG!!  Down
     comes a fire door.  They rush to the next
     tunnel...SQURRCHANG!!!  Too late.  Now they really pour it on,
     and crouch, roll, and dive under the last door
     before...SQURRCHANG!!  The whole hub is sealed off.

     SQURRCHANG!!!  SQURRCHANG!!!  SQURRCHANG!!  Richter and his
     group back out last.  SQURRCHANG!!

     Venusville is sealed off.  The streets are empty and quiet.

     The rebels from the Last Resort cautiously come out of hiding
     and mill about the eerily deserted area.  Slowly, gradually,
     others join them.  Madame Fatima and her Little Girl stand in
     front of the giant fans.

     A mechanical SHUDDER startles everyone, and the ambient noise
     level of the area grows MARKEDLY QUIETER.  The breeze of the
     fans stops blowing Madame Fatima's hair.

     The fan blades slow down, condensing from a blur of motion
     into hard metal.  They come to a stop.

     Silence.  Dread.

     MUMMIFIED CORPSES that lie in niches in a tunnel wall.

     Melina leads Quaid and Benny through a labyrinth of narrow
     corridors honeycombed with open tombs.

     Benny lingers behind, examining the dried bodies.

                         MELINA
               The first settlers are buried here.
               They worked themselves to death, but
               Cohaagen ended up with all the money.
               He built cheap domes and watched their
               kids turn into freaks.

                         QUAID
               I saw them.

                         BENNY
                    (from a distance)
               And if you wanna breathe, you gotta
               but his air.

                         MELINA
               But maybe you can change all that.

                         BENNY (O.S.)
               I think my grampa might be here.

     While Benny stops to inspect a mummy, Melina and Quaid proceed
     alone into the next chamber.


 131 INT. CATACOMBS/SITUATION ROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT                   131

                         QUAID
               What can I do?

                         MELINA
               Kuato's gonna make you remember a few
               things you knew when you were Hauser.

                         QUAID
               Like what?

                         MELINA
               All sorts of things.
                    (off-handed)
               You might even remember you loved me.

                         QUAID
               I don't need Kuato for that.

                         MELINA
                    (glances back, dubious)
               Oh, since when?

     Quaid pulls Melina to him and stares into her eyes.

                         QUAID
               Melina, I've been dreaming about you
               every night ...till I couldn't go on
               with my life.

     He kisses her passionately.  And they keep kissing.

     Behind them, some of the corpses start to move!  Slowly, they
     slide out of their niches and converge on Quaid and Melina,
     who are oblivious to their danger.  The zombies get closer
     and closer.

     Quaid and Melina opens their eyes and see the zombies!

                         MUTANT LIEUTENANT (O.S.)
               Freeze...

     A MUTANT LIEUTENANT and another rebel walk out through a bank
     of niches which is actually a concealed door.

                         MUTANT LIEUTENANT
               Come on Melina.  Kuato's waiting.

     The zombies pulls of their masks, revealing normal rebel
     fighters with rifles slung behind them.

     At this point, Benny blithely rounds the corner and catches
     up.

                         BENNY
               Well I didn't find him, but...Oh, shit!

     The rebels point their rifles at Benny, who freezes.

                         MUTANT LIEUTENANT
               Who's this?

                         MELINA
               He helped us get away.

                         BENNY
                    (nervous)
               Don't worry.  I'm on your side.

     Benny grabs his right arm and twists it off!  Underneath his
     prosthetic limb is a DEFORMED NUB with a few vestigial
     fingers.  The mutant Lieutenant and the others look with
     sympathy at Benny's handicap.  Benny then stretches out his
     arm, and an ADDITIONAL FOREARM unhinges like a Pterodactyl
     wing.

     Even the mutant Lieutenant is grossed out -- and convinced.

                         LIEUTENANT
               All right.  Let's go.

     The Lieutenant leads them through a narrow tunnel into the...


 132 INT. SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT                                      132

     A large force of armed Rebels has assembled in platoons.
     The mood is very dark.  They stare at Quaid.

                         LIEUTENANT
                    (to Benny)
               You wait here.
                    (to Quaid and Melina)
               Follow me.

     The Lieutenant escorts Quaid and Melina across the room to
     a table where the COMMANDING OFFICER and several other
     OFFICERS are gathered around a VIDEOPHONE.

     The Commanding Officer is George!  He communicates with Tony
     at the Last Resort.  Tony breathes with difficulty, as do
     the customers, staff, and children in the background.

                         GEORGE
               Drill through to Section M.

                         TONY
               We can't.  Cohaagen depressurized the
               tunnels.  And they're rigged to blow
               up.

     George looks over the monitor and sees that Quaid and Melina
     are being led over to him.

                         GEORGE
               Okay, sit tight.  Melina just got here
               with Quaid.

                         TONY
                    (gasps for a breath)
               I hope he was worth it.

                         GEORGE
               So do I.

     They exchange a solemn look, then George ends the call.  He
     turns to Melina and manages a faint smile.

                         GEORGE
               Glad you made it.

                         MELINA
               You don't look so glad.

     George gets up from his desk.

                         GEORGE
               Cohaagen sealed up Venusville.  HE shut
               off all the air.

     Quaid and Melina are appalled.

                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
               You must know something pretty damn
               important, Quaid.  He wants you.

     Quaid and Melina look at each other, mortified.

                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
               If we don't hand you over, everybody
               in the sector'll be dead by morning.

                         QUAID
               We don't have much choice then, do we?

                         MELINA
               We can't turn him in...

                         GEORGE
               That's up to Kuato.
                    (to Quaid)
               Come with me, Quaid.

     George leads Quaid to a fortified door.

     George leads Quaid through the door, and the Lieutenant
     immediately closes it behind them.


 133 INT. KUATO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT                                     133

     George and Quaid walk into a dark chamber, outfitted as an
     office with a desk and chairs.

                         GEORGE
               Sit down.

                         QUAID
               Where's Kuato?

                         GEORGE
               On his way.

                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
               You heard the rumors about the Pyramid
               Mine?

                         QUAID
               Yeah.

                         GEORGE
               Cohaagen found something weird inside,
               and it's got him scared shitless.

                         QUAID
                    (joking)
               What, aliens?

                         GEORGE
               You tell me.

                         QUAID
               I don't know.

                         GEORGE
               Yes, you do.  That's why we brought
               you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret
               is buried in that black hole you call
               a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it 
               out.

                         QUAID
               You're Kuato, right?

                         GEORGE
               Wrong.
                    (lets go of chair)
               Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset
               when you see him.

     George unbuttons his shirt, revealing...A SMALL SECOND HEAD
     GROWING FROM HIS CHEST!

     Kuato's sleeping face is ancient yet infantile, and no bigger
     than a grapefruit.  His eyes open.  His toothless mouth
     speaks.

     Kuato/George holds out his/their hands.  Quaid reluctantly
     holds them.

     George closes his eyes and falls into a trance.  Kuato stares
     hypnotically at Quaid.  One of his eyes is abnormally large.

                         KUATO
               What do you want, Mr. Quaid?

                         QUAID
               Same as you.  To remember.

                         KUATO
               But why?

                         QUAID
               To be myself again.

                         KUATO
               You are what you do.

     Kuato stares at Quaid, making sure he understands.

                         KUATO (CONT'D)
               A man is defined by his actions, not
               his memories.  Now take my hands.

     Quaid can't help looking into Kuato's large eye.  His gaze
     is caught and held.

                         KUATO (CONT'D)
               Now open you mind to me.  Please.
               Open your mind...
                    (hypnotic)
               Openyourmind... openyourmind... open
               your mind.

     QUAID'S POV;  ZOOMING into Kuato's large eye.  Quaid is
     reflected in the pupil.  ZOOMING in on Quaid's head, eye,
     pupil, darkness...


 134 INT. REACTOR CAVERN (MIND PROBE) - VARIOUS TIMES                 134

     GLIDING between AVENUES OF SQUARE METAL TOWERS.

     (NOTE:  From here on, the sequence is a seamless P.O.V.
     journey through Quaid's mental landscape.)


 135 INT. REACTOR CAVERN/ABYSS (MIND PROBE) - VARIOUS TIMES           135

     FOOTSTEPS and CONVERSATIONS echo in the distance.  LOOK DOWN
     and see PEOPLE walking far below on a FLIMSY BRIDGE that runs
     between the towers, over a dark, bottomless ABYSS.


 136 INT. REACTOR CAVERN/GLACIER (MIND PROBE) - VARIOUS TIMES         136

     CAMERA WHOOSHES DOWN the side of the tower, UNDER the tower,
     which hangs suspended over a GLACIER.  The tower has no bottom
     casing.  Inside, we see an orderly pattern of large metal
     rods.  We hear vague conversation.

                         SCIENTIST A (O.S.)
               But once it starts, that's it.  We can't
               contain it.

                         SCIENTIST B (O.S.)
               The chain reaction could spread to all
               the turbinium in the crust.


 137 INT. REACTOR CAVERN/BRIDGE (MIND PROBE) - VARIOUS TIMES          137

     WHOOSHING OVER AND UP to the bridge:  Cohaagen, Richter, and
     TWO SCIENTISTS are walking toward a tower.

                         RICHTER
               I say we throw the switch and see what
               happens.

                         COHAAGEN
               Don't be an idiot.

                         SCIENTIST B
               We're talking meltdown here.

     FOLLOW the group through a peeled-back section of the tower
     casing into the interior.


 138 INT. REACTOR (MIND PROBE) - VARIOUS TIMES                        138

     INSIDE THE TOWER are the metal rods which we saw from below.
     Up close they are gigantic, like a forest of shiny Sequoias.

                         SCIENTIST A
               Meltdown on a planetary scale.

                         RICHTER
               Don't you think whoever built this thing
               thought of that?

                         COHAAGEN
               Who knows what the hell they thought.
               They weren't human.

     CAMERA veers away from the group on its own exploration of
     the structure.  The voices become increasingly vague.

                         SCIENTIST A (O.S.)
               Maybe it's a trap.  Maybe they want
               meltdown.

                         COHAAGEN (O.S.)
               We're not sure this piece o' junk will
               even work.  What is it, a million, half
               a million...?

                         SCIENTIST B
               About a half a million.

                         COHAAGEN (O.S.)
               Half a million years old.


 139 INT. REACTOR (MIND PROBE) - VARIOUS TIMES                        139

     CAMERA tilts away from the group and looks toward the top
     of the tower, which rises seemingly forever.

     The POV SOARS UP, up, up the side of the tower to a LEDGE
     at the very top.  POV SWOOPS over the ledge into...


 140 INT. REACTOR CORE/CONTROL ROOM (MIND PROBE) - VARIOUS TIMES      140

     A CONTROL ROOM.  Five identical PILLBOX structures are
     arranged in a circle like some alien Stonehenge.  CAMERA
     approaches a ROUND STONE ALTAR in the center of the room.

                         KUATO (O.S.)
               Closer...

     Moving closer, hovering directly above the altar which has
     been sculpted with the IMPRINT OF A HAND.

                         KUATO (O.S.)
               Closer...

     TRACK TOWARD the round center of the altar, as is drawn into
     it.  The IMAGE starts to VIBRATE.  LOW-PITCHED RUMBLING fills
     the soundtrack.  The circle of the altar MATCH DISSOLVES INTO:


 141 INT. KUATO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT                                     141

     ...a rapid PULL BACK from the iris of Quaid's eye.  He snaps
     awake and sees a mining mole drilling through a stone wall
     into Kuato's chamber!  (The VIBRATION and RUMBLING from the
     dream continue.) Kuato/George sits motionless, still in a
     trance.  Quaid shakes George's shoulders.

                         QUAID
               Wake up!  Snap out of it!

     George wakes from his trance and sees the advancing mole.

                         GEORGE
               Shit!

                         QUAID
               C'mon!

     The mining mole crashes through the wall.  Quaid pulls George
     toward the concealed door.  George closes his shirt over
     Kuato's head.  Quaid swings the door open, and they run out.


 142 INT. SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT                                      142

                         GEORGE
               They found us!  Everybody out!

                         QUAID
               Melina!

     CHAOS!  Moles are drilling through the stone walls:  Entrances
     for more soldiers.  Freedom fighters retreat in all
     directions.  Quaid grabs Melina.  The mole backs up to let
     soldiers into the situation room.

                         LIEUTENANT
               George!  Get out!

                         GEORGE
               There's an airlock.

     George runs after them into the tunnel as the Lieutenant
     covers the retreat.  Quaid and Melina follow.

                         QUAID
               Come on Benny!  Let's go!

     Benny runs after them into the tunnel.  The Lieutenant is
     killed.


 143 OMITTED                                                          143


 144 INT. CONNECTING CHAMBER/AIR LOCK - NIGHT                         144

     The group arrives at an AIR LOCK.  It looks like they might
     actually get away.  They run inside.  Quaid closes the door.


 145 INT. AIR LOCK - WITH VIEW OF MARTIAN LANDSCAPE - NIGHT           145

                         GEORGE
               Put these on.  We're going outside.

     As Quaid starts to put on a spacesuit, he hears GUNSHOTS next
     to him,inside the airlock.  He sees George's body jerking to
     the staccato report of gunfire.

     Benny is the villain, in full control of his rifle.

     Quaid lunges for Benny, but before he can grab him, Benny
     takes Melina hostage, with his gun pointed at her head.

                         BENNY
               Freeze!

     Quaid and Melina can hardly believe their eyes.  Benny breaks
     into a wide smile.

                         BENNY (CONT'D)
               Congratulations, Quaid.  You led us
               right to him.

     Quaid and Melina are devastated.  After a moment, Quaid kneels
     down to examine George/Kuato's lifeless form.

                         MELINA
               How could you do this?  You're a mutant.

                         BENNY
               Hey, I got four kids to feed.

                         QUAID
               What happened to number five?

                         BENNY
                    (grins)
               Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even
               married.
                    (suddenly fierce)
               Now put your fucking hands in the air!

     As Quaid complies with the order, Benny edges over and
     vigorously kicks open the bolt on the airlock door.  He's not
     the geek he seemed to be.

     Richter and soldiers are approaching in the tunnel and enter
     the airlock.

     Kuato, barely alive, gags out a word.

                         KUATO
               Quaid...Quaid.

     Quaid leans close as Richter and solders comes to a stop.

                         BENNY
               Forget it, bro.  His fortune telling
               days are over.

     Kuato grabs Quaid's collar and pulls him nearer.

                         KUATO
               Start the reactor...Free Mars.

     A burst of gunfire finishes off Kuato.  Quaid spins around
     angrily and finds a rifle pointed directly in his face.
     Richter stands at the airlock door, holding the gun.  He wants
     to pull the trigger real bad.

                         RICHTER
               Mr. Cohaagen would like to talk to you.


 146 INT. COHAAGEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                   146

     A SHEET lies over a body.

                         COHAAGEN (O.S.)
               So this is the great man.

     A hand pulls back the sheet, revealing George/Kuato's dead
     body on a conference table.

     Cohaagen grimaces as he looks at the mutant.

                         COHAAGEN
               No wonder he kept out of sight.

     Richter, Benny, and several Security Police stand guard over
     Quaid and Melina, who are securely shackled.  Outside the
     picture windows, the city lights twinkle under a threatening
     violet sky.  Various scenes of suffocation in Venusville play
     on a bank of TV MONITORS.

     Cohaagen turns away and recovers his ebullient mood as he
     comes over to Quaid and claps him on the shoulder.

                         COHAAGEN
               Well, my boy, you're a hero.

                         QUAID
               Fuck you.

                         COHAAGEN
               Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the
               Resistance has been completely wiped
               out; and you were the key to the whole
               thing.

     Melina's face hardens.

                         QUAID
               He's lying.

                         MELINA
               You two-faced-bastard.

     She spits at Quaid.  Cohaagen pulls out his handkerchief and
     daubs away the saliva.

                         COHAAGEN
                    (to Melina)
               You can't blame him, angel.  He's
               innocent.  That's the beauty of it.

     Cohaagen enjoys Melina's and Quaid's confusion.

                         COHAAGEN (CONT'D)
               You see, Quaid, none of my people could
               get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants
               could always sniff us out.  So Hauser
               and I sat down and invented you: the
               perfect mole.

                         QUAID
               He's lying.  Hauser turned against
               you.

                         COHAAGEN
               That's what we wanted you to think.
               The fact is, Hauser volunteered to
               become Doug Quaid. It was the only way
               to fool the psychics.

                         QUAID
               Get your story straight.
                    (points to Richter)
               This idiot's been trying to kill me
               since I went to Rekall.  --You don't
               kill somebody you're trying to plant.

                         COHAAGEN
               He wasn't in on it.  You set him off
               by going to Rekall.

                         QUAID
               So why am I still alive?

                         COHAAGEN
               We gave you lots of help.
                    (gestures)
               Benny here...

                         BENNY
               My pleasure, man.

     Benny holds up his artificial limbs and reveals a blinking
     homing device.

                         COHAAGEN
               The guy with the suitcase; the mask;
               the money; the message form Hauser...All
               of that was set up by us.

                         QUAID
               Sorry.  Too perfect.

                         COHAAGEN
               Perfect, my ass!  --You pop your memory
               cap before we can activate you.  Then
               Richter goes hod wild, screwing up
               everything I spent a year planning.
               --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked.

     Quaid shakes his head, as if impressed.

                         QUAID
               Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to
               you...This is the best mindfuck yet.

                         COHAAGEN
               Don't take my word for it, Quaid.
               Someone you trust wants to talk to you.

                         QUAID
               Who is it this time--my mother?

     Cohaagen turns on the HOLOVISION.  HAUSER appears on the
     screen in the same clothes and setting as in the previous
     disk message.

                         HAUSER
               Howdy, Quaid.  If you're listening to
               this, that means Kuato's dead and you
               led us to him.  I knew you wouldn't
               let me down.
                    (laughs)
               Sorry for all the shit I put you
               through.  But hey, what are friends
               for?

     Quaid's last wall of resistance crumbles.

                         HAUSER (CONT'D)
               I'd like to wish you happiness and long
               life, old buddy, but unfortunately
               that's not gonna happen.  You see,
               that's my body you've got there, and,
               well...I want it back.

     Quaid is chilled.

                         HAUSER (CONT'D)
               Sorry to be an Indian giver, but I was
               here first.  --So, adios, amigo, and
               thanks for not getting yourself killed.

     Cohaagen steps into frame behind Hauser and lays a hand on
     his shoulder.  Together they smile and wave good-bye to Quaid.

                         HAUSER (CONT'D)
               Maybe we'll meet in our dreams.  You
               never know.

     The videodisc message ends.  Cohaagen beams, proud of himself.
     Quaid, in shock, looks at Melina.


 147 INT. COHAAGEN'S IMPLANT LAB - NIGHT                              147

     Quaid and Melina are brought into the Implant Lab and strapped
     into chairs that makes Rekall seem amateurish.

     Cohaagen and Richter watch with glee as a DOCTOR and SIX
     ASSISTANTS prepare for the re-programming operation.  Melina
     already has an IV drip in the back of her hand.  Quaid bucks
     and struggles as a technician inserts the needle in his hand.

                         DOCTOR
               Ready to go, sir.

                         COHAAGEN
               Relax, Quaid.  You'll like being Hauser.

                         QUAID
               The guy's a fucking asshole.

                         COHAAGEN
               Not true, he's one of my best
               friends...He's got a big house and a
               Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?
                    (leans close)
               Well, you'll get to fuck her every
               night.--That's right.  She's gonna be
               Hauser's babe.

                         MELINA
               I'll kill him first.

                         COHAAGEN
               Unh-un, princess.  We're having you
               fixed.  You'll be respectful and
               compliant and appreciative, just the
               way a woman should be.

     Melina spits at Cohaagen.

                         QUAID
               Bastard!

     Quaid struggles angrily against his shackles.  A call comes
     in on the VIDEOPHONE.

                         TECHNICIAN
               Get me Mr. Cohaagen.

                         ASSISTANT
               Mr. Cohaagen, for you.

     Cohaagen turns impatiently to the videophone screen, where
     a nervous TECHNICIAN stands at the AIR PUMPING STATION in
     front of a wall of dials and gauges.

                         COHAAGEN
               What is it?

                         TECHNICIAN
               Sir, the oxygen level is bottoming out
               in Sector G.  What do you want me to
               do about it?

                         COHAAGEN
                    (as if obvious)
               Don't do anything.

                         TECHNICIAN
               They can't last an hour, sir.

     Cohaagen presses a button on the videophone and switches TCHK
     - TCHK - TCHK to THREE QUICK VIEWS of people suffocating in
     Venusville.  TCHK.  He switches back to the phone call.

                         COHAAGEN
               Fuck 'em.  It'll be a lesson to the
               others.

     TCHK.  He hangs up.

                         QUAID
               Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you
               want.  Give these people air!

                         COHAAGEN
               My friend, five minutes from now, you
               won't give a shit about the people.
                    (to Doctor)
               Fire it up, Doc.

     The Doctor turns on the machine, which starts to WHINE.
     Cohaagen heads for the door and signals to Richter.

                         RICHTER
               Excuse me, Doctor, you mean he's not
               going to remember any of this?

                         DOCTOR
               Not a thing.

                         RICHTER
               I see.

     Richter thinks for a moment...then WHAM!  He slugs Quaid
     square in the face.

     Cohaagen turns around at the door and sees the two men staring
     hatefully at each other.

                         COHAAGEN
               Quaid, I'm having a little party
               tonight.  Why don't you and Melina drop
               by, say around nine-ish.
                    (to Doctor)
               You'll remind him, Doc?

     Pre-occupies with his work, the Doctor answers absently.

                         DOCTOR
               Sure.

                         RICHTER
               See you at the party.

     Cohaagen and Richter leave the lab, mightily amused.

     The WHINING noise now becomes truly terrifying.  Quaid and
     Melina concentrate to fight the effects of the re-programming.

                         DOCTOR
               Keep still.  Fighting just makes it
               hurt.

     Quaid bucks against the HELMET AND FOUR SETS OF METAL BRACKETS
     which bind his arms and legs (FIVE HANDICAPS).

                         DOCTOR (CONT'D)
               If you don't keep still, you'll end
               up psychotic.

     Quaid thrashes about in his chair.  The screws holding the
     chair together start to loosen.

     In adrenaline overdrive, Quaid rips the right armrest from
     the chair.  It hangs from his forearm like an unwieldy splint.
     (One of five handicaps is gone.)

     The Doctor rushes over.  Quaid swings the armrest and drives
     a long exposed bolt through the Doctor's throat.

     Assistant 1 grabs Quaid's forearm.  Quaid curls him into a
     one-armed hug and snaps his neck.

     Quaid lifts the helmet from his head.  (Two of five handicaps
     are gone.)  Assistant 2, behind him, grabs his wrist.  Quaid
     grips #2's hair and pulls him forward, over his shoulder.
     #2's head lands between Quaid's knees.  Quaid cracks his skull
     like a walnut.

     Quaid reaches over and releases the bracket over his left
     wrist. (Three handicaps down; two remain)  But Assistants
     3-5 converge on him, holding down his arms.

     Quaid sees that Melina is still fighting her brainwashing.

                         QUAID
               Hold on!

     Assistant 6 charges with a long metal pole.  Quaid pulls #5 in
     front of him, like a shield.  #5 is skewered.

     Quaid flings #5 aside, reaches down, unshackles one ankle,
     and immediately kicks #3 in the balls.

     Quaid stands up with only one leg still shackled.

     #6 and #4 bait Quaid like a bear, using the pole and a fireax.
     Quaid grabs the bole from #6 and uses it to block the ax.
     He then bends to unfasten the last ankle bracket.  The fireax
     comes arching down at him.

     Quaid leaps clear just as the fireax lodges in the chair.

     Now free and unhandicapped, Quaid faces #6.  He sidesteps
     a thrust, grabs the pole, and thrusts it into #6's head.
     It goes in one temple and out the other.

     Immediately, Quaid pulls off Melina's helmet.

     Number 4 (the ax man) activates an ALARM and makes a run for
     the door.  Quaid swings the pole, tripping 4 so that he lands
     directly on his nose.

     As ALARMS SCREAM, Quaid runs to Melina and begins releasing
     her from her many shackles.

                         QUAID
               Are you all right?  Are you still you?

                         MELINA
               I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?

     Quaid is aghast.  Melina kisses him.

                         MELINA (CONT'D)
               Let's get the hell out of here!

     Relieved, Quaid flips the last buckle.  Melina steps out of
     her chair, Quaid grabs the ax and they run.


 148 INT. CORRIDOR - LAB TO ELEVATOR - NIGHT                          148

     ALARMS blare.  Quaid and Melina run through the hallway for
     the elevators.  Quaid goes to the right, Melina to the left.
     Quaid throws the axe to Melina.  The elevator doors open, two
     soldiers are inside and start to exit.  Quaid hits the first
     soldier on the right, knocking him down and out.  Melina axes
     the second soldier on the left in the stomach and he goes
     down.  Then run into the elevator after taking the guns from
     the dead soldiers.  As the doors close they are each taking
     a flashlight off the back wall of the elevator.

                         QUAID
               The lamps!


 149 INT. COHAAGEN'S OFFICE - PRE-DAWN                                149

     Back to camera, Cohaagen stands in front of a wall of glass
     and stares out at the city and landscape, bathed in dark
     purple light.  The horizon is pink, signaling the approach
     of dawn.  The ALARMS WAIL in the background, muffled but
     insistent.

                         RICHTER (O.S.)
               Well, sir?

     Cohaagen thinks for a moment, then answers flatly without
     turning around.

                         COHAAGEN
               Kill him.

                         RICHTER (CONT'D)
                    (to himself)
               It's about goddamn time.

     Richter dashes out.

     Cohaagen looks at his pet goldfish swimming harmlessly in
     its bowl.  He peevishly sweeps the bowl off its stand.  It
     falls to the floor and smashes to bits.  The goldfish
     flounders desperately, unable to breathe.


 150 INT. MINE TUNNEL/ELEVATOR LANDING - PRE-DAWN                     150

     The elevator doors open.  Quaid and Melina, holding
     flashlights, run out in opposite directions.

                         MELINA
               Where are you going?!

                         QUAID
               The reactor.

                         MELINA
               What reactor?!

                         QUAID
               The one in the mine!

                         MELINA
               People are dying, Quaid!!  Stop!!
                    (digs in)
               We've got to get air!!

     Quaid snaps her to him and grips her shoulders.

                         QUAID
               The reactor makes air!
                    (calmer)
               That's Cohaagen's secret!

     Quaid lets go of Melina.

                         QUAID (CONT'D)
               Now come on.

     They start running.  The passage is strewn with tools,
     drillhammers, and other equipment which lie on the ground, as
     if abandoned in a panic.   Melina is still perplexed.

                         MELINA
               Where's this "reactor" come from?

                         QUAID
               Aliens built it.

                         MELINA
               Aliens?!


 151 INT. INTERSECTION TUNNEL/DEAD END - PRE-DAWN                     151

                         MELINA
               You sure about this?

                         QUAID
               It's just up ahead.

     Quaid's flashlight reveals that the tunnel abruptly comes
     to a DEAD END just up ahead.  He is dumbfounded.

     VROARRR!  Quaid and Melina are bathed in the bright light of
     a Mole, which rumbles past the intersecting tunnel, blocking
     any possibility of escape.  Its 7-foot/diameter CENTRAL DRILL
     spins at full speed.  Quaid and Melina back away, firing.


151A INT. CABIN OF MOLE - PRE-DAWN                                    151A

     Benny gleefully directs the mole form a cabin at the rear.  He
     steers with the aid of several video monitors.  One of them
     shows Quaid and Melina fleeing, just ahead of the tip of the
     drill.  Quaid and Melina run out of ammunition.  Quaid throws
     his gun aside, sees a drillhammer lying on the ground and
     grabs it.

                         BENNY
                    (into microphone)
               Quaid!  Hey, Quaid!  Remember me?
               Benny!  Benny's the name.  I'm gonna
               git you sucker!  You ain't goin'
               nowhere.

     Benny guns the central drill:  VROOM!  VROOOOOM!!  In the
     tunnel, Quaid and Melina hear Benny's amplified voice from
     inside the mole.

                         BENNY
               Go ahead, hurt me!  Give me your best
               shot.  Give it to me!  I can take it,
               fuck!  Shit!  Fuck!  Goddamn it!

     Quaid attacks the mole with the drill.  Quaid's arms and
     shoulders are lacerated on both sides by the drills.  In a
     final daring thrust, Quaid drives the drillhammer into a
     cable.  SPLURG!  Black hydraulic fluid gushes all over Quaid,
     and the central drill grinds to a halt.  GRGGRRGRR  -- the
     tip of the central drill chews into the stone wall.  Melina
     is trapped in a tiny recess to the right.  Quaid is penned
     into a slightly larger cul-de-sac to the left.

                         BENNY
               Hey Quaid!  You gonna bite the big one!
               Eat me!  Eat me!  Hey, Melina, how does
               it feel?  I'm comin' baby, I'm coming
               for you!

     Benny throws a fit inside the Mole and jams it into reverse.

                         BENNY
               What the fuck?!  Goddamn sonovabitchin'
               piece of Martian junk.  I'll back up!
               I'll back up!  I'll crush you!  Quaid,
               I'm gonna squash you!

     Melina checks out the hole in the wall made my the mole.
     As the Mole backs up, Quaid slips under the retracting side
     drill, squeezes between the mole and the side wall of the
     tunnel, and sidles his way to the back of the machine.

     Benny shifts into drive and checks his monitors:  There's
     Melina.  Where's Quaid?

                         BENNY
               Quaid!  Where are you?  Where the fuck
               are you?

     Quaid arrives at the back of the Mole, jumps onto a "running
     board" at the side of the cabin, and starts drilling.

                         QUAID
               Benny!  Screw you!

     Inside the Mole, Benny is disturbed by a curious high-pitched
     whine that cuts through the roaring and grinding.

     The drill penetrates the door of the cabin and bores into
     Benny's chest.  The spinning tip of the drill emerges from
     his back.  Quaid pulls the drill back out and drops it.

                         MELINA
               Quaid!  Get over here!

     Quaid runs over and joins her at the wall.  She points into
     the cone.

                         MELINA
               There's an opening.

     An open HOLE is in the stone wall.

     Quiad looks through it.  A dimly lighted object is visible
     in the distance.

                         QUAID
               I knew it!

     Quaid climbs through the hole, followed by Melina...
 

 152 INT. REACTOR CAVERN/ABYSS - PRE-DAWN                             152

     ...and gets his first look at the alien reactor.

     Quaid moves through the hole and continues down a tunnel which
     quickly widens, affording a panoramic view of a great wonder:
     The alien reactor glimpsed in Quaid's mind probe!

     Hundreds of geometric columns hand suspended in a graceful
     draping pattern, like metal stalactites in a vast mechanical
     cavern built by giants.  The titanic construction is organized
     into four groupings which radiate from a central core.

     Quaid stares with wonder and awe.  Melina appears next to
     him, even more impressed.  They look up at the alien reactor.
     The columns extend seemingly forever into the dark recesses
     of the hollowed-out mountain.

                         QUAID (O.S.)
               It's all one big reactor made out of
               turbinium.

     Quaid and Melina are standing at the edge of a steep cliff,
     next to the footings of a flimsy BRIDGE of human design.
     The bridge stretches from the cave wall, over an abyss, to
     the core of the reactor.

                         QUAID (CONT'D)
               Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the
               bastard won't turn it on.

                         MELINA
               Of course not.  If Mars had an
               atmosphere, he's lose control.

 155 INT. REACTOR CAVERN/BRIDGE - PRE-DAWN                            155

     Quaid starts climbing the footings toward the bridge, some
     eighteen feet above.  Melina follows him up the girders.

                         QUAID
               Ya see down there...It's a glacier.

     They are precariously balance over a seemingly bottomless
     ABYSS.

                         QUAID (CONT'D)
               The whole core of Mars is ice.  The
               reactor melts it and releases oxygen.

                         MELINA
               Enough for everybody to breathe?


 156 INT. REACTOR CAVERN/BRIDGE - PRE-DAWN                            156

     Quaid pulls himself onto the bridge, then reaches down and
     lifts Melina.

                         QUAID
               Plenty.

     Standing on the walkway, they look up at the gargantuan
     reactor which looms ahead of them like Valhalla at the end
     of the Asgaard Bridge.

                         QUAID (CONT'D)
               If we turn it on in time.

     They start walking toward the reactor.

     Richter gives a "get ready" signal to THIRTY SOLDIERS who
     lie in wait to ambush Quaid and Melina as soon as they come
     inside.

                         RICHTER
               Come on.  Let's go.

     The soldiers spread out among the huge metal Sequoias that
     extend down through the floor like pegs through a pegboard.

     Quaid and Melina approach the opening in the tower as seen
     in Quaid's mind probe.  Quaid signals Melina to stay back.
     He steps forward.

     Richter's people stare at the opening, waiting for Quaid to
     enter.  He steps into view.  Richter's soldiers reveal
     themselves.

     BRRTDBTRBDRTRTDBRTDBDRDBTTDRDBD!  Richter and his men open
     fire.  Quaid collapses.  They step forward in a tightening
     circle, emptying thousands of rounds into his body.

     He reacts to the shots and goes down on his knees  --  but
     he's not dead.  He stands up, laughs at the soldiers and
     starts to walk away.

                         RICHTER
               Son of a bitch!  He's got a hologram.
               Spread out!

     Quaid walks into one of the columns and disappears.  The real
     Quaid appears and mows down a lot of the soldiers with
     gunfire.

     Melina runs in to join Quaid shooting at soldiers.  Then they
     split up, Quaid running one way, Melina the other.

     Quaid kills two soldiers as he runs into the columns.  Quaid
     and his hologram appear at either side of a column.


 165 INT. REACTOR - DAY                                               165

     Quaid moves along among the columns and runs into three
     soldiers.  He starts laughing.

                         QUAID
               You think this is the real Quaid?  Well
               it is.

     Quaid then shoots them down and runs off.

     Melina and Quaid come together at one of the columns, cross
     each other and then go their separate ways.  She now has the
     hologram watch.  Melina runs to another column, peeks around,
     gets shot at, then goes to the other side of the column.

     A SOLDIER HERE and a SOLDIER THERE see her walking.  They
     both open fire.  The bullets pass through "Melina", and they
     shoot each other.

     Quaid and Melina meet up.  Melina throws the hologram watch
     back to him.  Quaid takes the hologram watch and runs up the
     middle of a row of columns.  Richter runs across in front of
     him and fires and misses.  Two soldiers pop out behind him
     and Melina kills them.  Quaid continues after Richter.

 168 INT. REACTOR CORE - DAY                                          168

     Richter sprints onto an open FREIGHT ELEVATOR at the far end
     of the area.  The elevator starts to rise.  Quaid jumps onto
     the elevator and drags Richter to the floor.

     Melina runs over too late and watches the elevator ascend
     at incredible speed with Quaid hanging below.

     Richter and Quaid wrestle savagely on the floor, trying to
     force each other over the side.  Richter lodges his foot in
     a hole in the floor and shoves Quaid's head over the edge.

     Quaid looks up.  YAAA!  The elevator is approaching a hole
     Cohaagen cut in the metal shell which encloses the bunch of
     columns.  The hole is exactly big enough for the elevator
     to pass through.  Anything extended beyond the boundaries
     of the elevator--like Quaid's head--will be sliced off!

     Quaid summons all his strength and throws Richter and himself
     back into the elevator without a nanosecond to spare.  As
     the elevator passes through the hole cut in the metal, a sharp
     edge guillotines Richter's rifle in half.  Nasty.

     The elevator emerges in a narrow space between two concentric
     curved walls.  The adversaries exchange blows.  Richter knocks
     Quaid down, then rushes at him.  Quaid flips Richter over
     the side!

     But Richter grabs Quaid's wrists and drags Quaid with him.

     Quaid's foot catches a crater in the floor and halts their
     mutual slide to death.  He hangs over the side, bend at the
     waist, supporting Richter who dangles from his wrists.

     Quaid struggles to pull himself back inside, but Richter
     bounces up and down, pulling Quaid further out.

                         RICHTER
               You're goin' with me!

     The elevator rapidly approaches another guillotine-hole cut
     in the metal platform.

     Richter pulls at Quaid.  Quaid slips.  He gropes for another
     foothold.  The metal edges are about to cut him in half.

     Quaid's searching foot finds a hole.  He pulls back...

     The metal edges sweep by.

     AGAAGHGGHGGHAA!  A cry of pain.

     The elevator comes to a halt.  CHUNGGG!

     Quaid lies on the floor, intact.  Still gripping his
     wrists...are Richter's severed hands.

                         QUAID
               See you at the party.

     Richter falls to his death, SCREEEEEEEEAMMMmmiinnnggg...
     Quaid walks to the other side of the elevator and rides up
     amid the columns.

     Quaid walks out of the elevator onto a platform and finds
     himself in the CONTROL ROOM from Kuato's mind probe.  The
     elevator closes behind him and descends.

     Quaid walks toward the round altar in the center of the room.
     At the center of the altar is the emblem of an open hand.
     Quaid reaches out for the mythic symbol.

     A light hits him and he stops his hand.  Quaid looks up and
     sees Cohaagen step into the light, holding a gun.

                         COHAAGEN
               Don't touch that!  Get away!  Get back!

     Cohaagen signals Quaid away from the altar.  He backs off.

                         QUAID
               What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.

                         COHAAGEN (CONT'D)
               Impossible.  Once the reaction starts,
               it'll spread to all the turbinium in
               the planet.  Mars will go into global
               meltdown.--That's why the aliens never
               turned it on.

                         QUAID
               Do you expect me to believe you?

                         COHAAGEN
               Who gives a shit what you believe?
               In thirty seconds, you'll be dead.
               Then I'll blow this place up...

     Cohaagen shows Quaid a detonator in his left hand and points
     with his gun to an explosive charge near the altar.

                         COHAAGEN
               ...and be home in time for corn flakes.

     Quaid makes a sudden move toward the emblem.  BANG!  Cohaagen
     shoots and hits the altar near Quaid.  Quaid freezes.

                         COHAAGEN
               I didn't want it to end this way.  I
               wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You
               had to be Quaid.

               Well all dreams come to an end.

     CLOSE ON:  A GUN.  The trigger is squeezed.  The sound of
     GUNSHOTS!

     Cohaagen is blown to the floor, hit in the shoulder and arm.
     He drops his gun and the detonator.

     Melina stands by the elevator.

     Cohaagen reaches for the detonator.

     Quaid runs to the explosive charge, grabs it, and throws it,
     while Melina runs to Cohaagen.   Cohaagen activates the
     detonator.

     toward the hole, Cohaagen gets a grip on the altar.  Melina
     grabs at the edge of the platform but gets sucked toward the
     altar.  Melina gets sucked around the altar and grips a light
     stand that is wedged into the altar.

     Sucked through the air toward the hole, Quaid desperately
     snatches a length of cable.  HWANG!  His flight jerks to a
     stop.

     Anchored, Quaid makes a Herculean effort to climb UP THE CABLE
     against the powerful wind.
