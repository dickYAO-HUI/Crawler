       FADE IN
 
1      EXT. NIGHT
 
       The snow piled streets at Dutch Harbor, Alaska.  A wind
       blows.  The street is empty.  A bundled figure moves
       through the street toward a low roofed lighted building.
 
       A sign outside the building reads:
 
                 "OFFICER'S CLUB, DUTCH HARBOR, ALASKA"
 
       Someone has scribbled the words under the printing "No
       Penguins allowed".
 
       The figure stops in the doorway and looks at a long
       thermometer.  It registers twenty-five below zero.  The
       figure continues into the club.
 
 
2      INT. OFFICERS CLUB ROOM - MIDNIGHT
 
       This is the social center for U.S.A. flying men roosting
       in the polar regions.  The air base is near Dutch Harbor,
       Alaska - a commuting hop from the Arctic Circle.  It is
       early winter.  The night in Dutch Harbor is long and
       dark.
 
       In the room two of the six gaming tables are occupied.
       At one sits a four handed bridge game.  At the other sit
       five men playing poker.  RADIO MUSIC - an American
       Service Broadcast - is coming a bit feebly into the room.
       All is cozy and steam-heated in the room.
 
       Among the five poker players are three men who are to be
       active in our story.  One is W.O. Vic MacAuliff.  He is
       a tough, taciturn radio man. He has seen service
       everywhere, heard nearly all the languages and drunk
       nearly all the different brews of the earth.
 
       The second is Captain Pat Henry, in his early thirties.
       Captain Henry has been a flyer since he shed his first
       stocking cap.  He is a man of whimsey and temper and
       also mood.
 
       The third is Lieutenant Eddie Dykes, a tall, homely man
       under thirty.
 
       The overcoats, boots, ear-lapped military hats of the
       aviators lie on an unused table nearby.
 
                                EDDIE DYKES
                      (as he shuffles
                       and deals)
                 It was about a hundred and five
                 in the shade in this place.  The
                 women didn't wear any clothes at
                 all to speak of - which was very
                 intelligent of them.  You lay in
                 a hammock and three of them stood there
                 fanning you.  When I die, I hope
                 to go to Accra.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 I was there.
 
                                HENRY
                      (looking at
                       his hand)
                 I open for one dollar.
 
                                PLAYER
                 I stay.
 
                                PLAYER
                 I'm out.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Going up.
 
       He puts two chips on the table.
 
                                EDDIE
                 Scotland strikes again.  I'm
                 in. Cards, gentlemen.
 
       Two other players add another chip each to the pot.
 
                                HENRY
                 Three.
 
                                PLAYERS
                 Three.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 These'll do.
 
       The figure has entered the room and is surveying the
       poker players as it removes its wrappings.  He is Ned
       Skeely, a newspaper correspondent.
 
                                HENRY
                 Hello, Skeely, how are you?
 
                                SKEELY
                 Faintly alive.  Twenty-five below
                 and going down.  It's a night for
                 brass monkeys.
 
                                HENRY
                 Care to join us?
 
                                SKEELY
                 As soon as I count my fingers.
                 I may have lost some.
 
                                HENRY
                 I think you know everybody here.
 
                      Players smile and say "sure."
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 I haven't met the gentleman, Captain.
 
                                HENRY
                 Ned Skeely - Angus MacAuliff.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 How do you do, sir.
 
                                EDDIE
                 Mr. Skeely's a newspaper man, Mac.
                 We're going to put on a snow ball
                 fight for him tomorrow.
 
                      Skeely takes a seat next
                      to Eddie.
 
                                HENRY
                      (returning to the play)
                 One dollar is bet.
 
                                EDDIE
                 Against a pat hand hald by a
                 Scotchman.  Captain Henry, your
                 decorations for valor have gone
                 to your head.  I'm folding.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Call.
 
                                HENRY
                 A pair of aces.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Beats two queens.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (to MacAuliff)
                 You ought to know better than to
                 try fooling my pal.  Only dames
                 can do that.
 
                                HENRY
                      (quietly)
                 I promised you a kick in the belly.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (mockingly)
                 Forgive.  Forgive.  A slip of the
                 tongue.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Skeely)
                 How'd you make out with General
                 Fogarty?
 
                                SKEELY
                 Your general is nursing his secrets
                 like a June bride.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Deal 'em out, lieutenant.
 
                                EDDIE
                 You in, Mr. Skeely?
 
                                SKEELY
                 Yes.  I am always interestad in
                 pauperizing the air force.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (dealing)
                 I've got a big idea that involves
                 you, Mr. Skeely.  You're not going
                 to get any story out of this post.
                 Forgarty has given us all instructions
                 to treat you like a Russian spy.
 
                                SKEELY
                 General Fogarty is going to end up
                 on his knees begging for my attention.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (intently)
                 This is more practical, Mr. Skeely.
                 There's a man in Edmonton who can
                 give you the whole Radar defense
                 story.  Loves to talk.  General
                 MacLaren.  You tell the General you
                 want to get to Edmonton - and Pat
                 and I'll fly you there.
 
                                SKEELY
                 I know General MacLaren.  He bores
                 me.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (desperately)
                 Don't be like that!  It's warm in
                 Edmonton!  They've got girls in
                 Edmonton!  Without fur pants on!
 
                                SKEELY
                      (to Henry)
                 How about it, Captain?
 
                                HENRY
                 Let's play cards.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (to Eddie)
                 Ye ought to know better than to try
                 and shoo our captain southward -
                 with his heart wrapped around the
                 North Pole.
 
                                HENRY
                 That'll do, Mr. MacAuliff.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (grinning)
                 I open - for two dollars.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (casually, as they play)
                 What's going on at the North Pole?
 
                                EDDIE
                 Some scientists are holding a
                 convention there.  Looking for
                 Polar bear tails.  Ever hear of
                 Dr. Carrington?
 
                                SKEELY
                 The fellow who was at Bikini?
 
                                EDDIE
                 The same.
 
                                HENRY
                 They're holed in about two thousand
                 miles north of here, a lot of
                 botanists and physicists.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (solemnly)
                 Including a pin-up girl.  Very
                 interesting type.  Captain Henry
                 can give you any data on her you
                 want.
 
                                HENRY
                      (looking at his cards and
                      speaking quietly to Eddie)
                 Someday I hope to have a co-pilot a
                 cut above a high school boy - or
                 at least dry behind his ears -
 
                      A voice comes over the
                      P.A. speaker.
 
                                VOICE
                 Captain Henry.  Captain Pat Henry.
                 Report to General Fogarty's quarters
                 at once, please.
 
                      Henry rises from the table.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (frowning and serious)
                 Twelve thirty and a general yelling
                 for his troops.  Sounds like the
                 old days.
 
                      Henry starts putting on his overcoat.
 
                                             DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
3      INT. GENERAL FOGARTY'S QUARTERS.  NIGHT
 
       A living room with a fire going in the fire place.  The
       room is fairly well furnished.  Some war trophies are
       on the wall, including a piece of a Japanese aeroplane,
       a Jap sword, and other important war souvenirs.
 
       Three men are in the room.  One is General Fogarty, in
       his forties; the second is the adjutant of the post,
       Major Smith.  The third is Corporal Hauser from the
       post's communication center.
 
                                FOGARTY
                      (to Corporal Hauser)
                 If any more messages come in from
                 that base I want to be notified
                 personally, no matter what time.
                 Tell the O.D.
 
                                CORPORAL
                 Yes, sir.
 
                      There is a knock on the door.
 
                                FOGARTY
                 Come in.
 
                      The door opens and a blast of
                      freezing air hits the room as
                      Captain Henry enters.  He closes
                      the door.
 
                                HENRY
                 Good evening, sir.
 
                      Corporal Hauser opens the door
                      and exits, letting another blast
                      of cold into the room.  The General
                      shivers, scowls and grumbles.
 
                                FOGARTY
                      (shivering)
                 Freddie, any chance of the Pentagon
                 sending us a revolving door?
 
                                MAJOR
                 Could be.  We got a gross of pith
                 helmets last week.
 
                                FOGARTY
                      (to Henry)
                 I've go something queer here from your
                 picnic party up north.  Just came in.
                      (he reads from a paper)
                 Believe air ship unusual type crashed
                 in our vicinity.  Please send
                 facilities to investigate.  Most urgent.
                      (he looks up)
                 It's from Dr. Carrington.  What's it
                 sound like to you, Pat?
 
                                HENRY
                 I think I'd better hop up.
 
                                FOGARTY
                      (dryly)
                 I knew you'd say that.  But what do
                 you think you'll find, besides your
                 lady friend?
 
                                HENRY
                      (quietly)
                 I don't know.  Any of our ships
                 reported missing?
 
                                MAJOR
                 Not a one.
 
                                HENRY
                 Could be a Russky.  They're all
                 over the Pole, like flies.
 
                                FOGARTY
                      (smiling)
                 Don't get nervous.  You're going.
                 When a double dome like Professor
                 Carrington says "most urgent",
                 small people like us have to jump.
                 Better take a dog team and everything
                 you might need for rescue work.
 
                                HENRY
                 I'll take off at 4:30.
 
                                MAJOR
                 What's the weather, Pat?
 
                                HENRY
                 There's a bad front moving in.
                 But I think there's enough time
                 to get there and back without
                 bumping into it.
 
                                FOGARTY
                 You can do me a favor, Pat.
 
                                HENRY
                 Yes, sir.
 
                                FOGARTY
                 Take that newspaper fella up with
                 you - and maroon him there.
 
                                HENRY
                 I'll invite him.
 
                                FOGARTY
                 And don't get me wrong about
                 who gets marooned, Captain
                 Henry.  I would appreciate
                 it if you didn't smash a landing
                 ski and find it necessary to
                 twiddle your thumbs for a week
                 while it's being repaired.
 
                                HENRY
                      (coldly)
                 That accident was unavoidable, sir.
 
                                FOGARTY
                 So was Romeo and Juliet.  I'll
                 expect you back tomorrow night -
                 with or without Mr. Skeely.
                 Good luck.
 
                                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
4      INT. C-54 PLANE.  IT IS FLYING THROUGH A DIMLY LIT
       SKY.  BELOW ARE CLOUD BANKS.
 
       In the plane are W. O. MacAuliff, Ned Skeely,
       Navigator Lieutenant Ken Ericson and Light
       Engineer Corporal Barnes.  Captain Henry is flying
       the ship, Lieut. Dykes is beside him.  MacAuliff
       is at his radio instrument.
 
       A dozen huskies and several sleds are in the plane,
       plus a pile of other cargo tied down under tarpaulin.
 
                                SKEELY
                 How far are we from camp?
 
                                HENRY
                 Three hours.  We've slowed down.
                 There's a breeze blowing.
 
                                EDDIE DYKES
                      (grimly)
                 A breeze, he says.  It's hitting
                 forty miles.  But you'll find
                 that our captain has some funny
                 ideas about the North Pole.  He
                 thinks it's a garden spot.  Come
                 and bring the kiddies.
 
                                HENRY
                      (grimly)
                 You're yapping is out of order,
                 Eddie.  I'm not going to tell
                 you again -
 
                                EDDIE
                 Always squawking - that's me!
                 And for no reason!  Shackleton
                 went to the North pole once -
                 and retired with a bag full of
                 medals.  I get to go there every
                 three weeks - like it was lover's
                 lane.
 
                                HENRY
                      (coldly)
                 I'd like you to get this straight,
                 Mr. Skeely, if you write anything.
                 I'm liaison officer between our
                 post and the Carrington outfit.
                 These flights are strictly official.
                 Usually bring in supplies.  They're
                 charting magnetic currents, growing
                 new kinds of polar plants, looking
                 for minerals.
 
                                EDDIE
                 That's right, Skeely.  I was
                 only kidding.  It's a terrific
                 outfit.  The biggest collection
                 of double domes ever got together
                 on an ice cake.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (to the talkers)
                 Something's coming through.
 
                      Henry, Eddie and Navigator
                      Ericson put on their head
                      phones and listen.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (listening to the
                       ear phones)
                 Somebody's gooped up!
 
                                HENRY
                      (removing ear
                       phones)
                 Give me a new reading, Ken.
 
                                KEN
                 I can't understand it.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Who was that?
 
                                HENRY
                 The radio man, Hendrix - talking
                 for Carrington.  He wants us to
                 correct our compass reading
                 twelve points East.  A magnetic
                 disturbance is whacking away at
                 everything.
 
                                KEN
                      (working)
                 This is no place to make a mistake,
                 Pat.  We were bee-lining for the
                 place.  Hadn't we better get them
                 back.
 
                                HENRY
                 No.  Carrington doesn't make
                 mistakes.  We'll follow ground
                 instructions.

6      EXT. POLAR PROJECT CAMP - DAY
 
       The C-54 makes a landing on skis some two hundred
       feet from the largest of the low looming buildings.
       The arrivals drop out of the plane door.
 
       A half dozen Eskimo workers belonging to the camp
       hurry toward them.
 
                                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
7      INT. LARGE ASSEMBLY ROOM OF POLAR EXPEDITION
 
       It is 60 per cent underground.  It's windows are
       near the ceiling and function as transoms for
       light.
 
       The room is comfortably furnished and warm.  It's
       steam pipes run along the wall.
 
       In the room are Dr. Chapman, Dr. Algari and Mrs.
       Chapman.
 
       Chapman is a forceful looking man in his forties.
       His wife is a good looking woman of forty who is
       also his assistant.  Chapman is a minerologist.
       Algari is an elderly man, white haired.  He is a
       botanist.
 
       A male cook stands at a large electric stove.  He
       is cooking coffee and a hot lunch in a number of
       pots.  Chapman walks up the stairs to the door,
       which is near the top of the room.  He opens it.
 
       Captain Henry and his group come down the stairs.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 Very pretty landing, Captain.
                 We watched it.  How was the trip?
 
                                HENRY
                 Nice ride.  This is Mr. Skeely,
                 Dr. Chapman, Mrs. Chapman, Dr.
                 Algari.  Mr. Skeely's a newspaperman.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Glad to know you.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (smiling)
                 Glad to have a newspaperman drop
                 in on us.  We're a bit off the
                 beaten track.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (looking around)
                 Don't tell me I'm practically
                 at the North Pole!  Looks more
                 like my old Kentucky home.
 
                                HENRY
                 Any further information, Dr.
                 Chapman?
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 I'm convinced it's some sort of
                 Russian air craft.  Probably some
                 new jet propelled rocket.
 
                                ALGARI
                 I very much doubt that, Hugo.
                 I don't understand Russian
                 science, but it can't be as
                 far advanced as the indications
                 we have from the crashed ship.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 If it is a ship.  We're all
                 quite excited, Captain.
 
                                HENRY
                 Where's Dr. Carrington?
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 In the lab.
 
                                MRS. CHAPMAN
                 They'll all be here for lunch.
                 It's ready - if you'd like to
                 eat first.  Fresh vegetables.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Skeely)
                 From their own garden.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Garden?
 
                                MRS. CHAPMAN
                      (smiling)
                 Hothouse.
 
                                SKEELY
                 You have a hothouse!  At the Pole!
 
                                EDDIE
                      (winking at Skeely)
                 They've got everything here.
                 Wait till you see.
 
                                HENRY
                 I'll join you in a few minutes.
 
                                ALGARI
                 I'll take you to the lab, Captain.
 
                                HENRY
                 Thanks.  I know the way.
 
       He starts out of the room.
 
                                MRS. CHAPMAN
                 Please sit down, everybody.
 
       The group moves toward a long refectory table set with
       twenty places.  We follow Captain Henry out.
 
 
8      INT. A CONNECTING UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR BETWEEN TWO OF
       THE CAMP BUILDINGS
 
       Henry, enters it and walks toward a steep stairway.  He
       climbs it and knocks on a door. A voice calls.
 
                                VOICE
                 Come in.
 
       He opens the door.
 
 
9      INT. NIKKI'S OFFICE AND SLEEPING QUARTERS
 
       A small office-like room, lined with filing cabinets,
       holding a desk, a typewriter stand, a voice recording
       machine, and a couch that serves as a bed, is revealed.
       Sitting at the desk, typing, is a vivid, young woman,
       Alberta Nicholson.  She is called Nikki.  She stops
       typing and rises.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Pat!  Welcome to our igloo!
 
                                HENRY
                      (smiling)
                 Hello, Nikki.  You look like seven
                 million dollars.  How are you?
 
                                NIKKI
                 Wonderful.  Sit down.
 
                                HENRY
                 I talk better standing.
 
       He steps up to her and embraces her ardently.  She
       pulls out of his embrace, calmly, and without alarm.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Please.
                      (she straightens her hair)
                 I think Dr. Carrington is waiting
                 for you.
 
                                HENRY
                 Dr. Carrington will have to wait.
                 I'm busy.
 
       He tries to embrace her again.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (evading him)
                 No, you're not.
 
                                HENRY
                      (frowning)
                 What's the matter?
 
                                NIKKI
                 Now, don't act surprised.  We've been
                 all through this before.  I don't like
                 promiscuous love making.  It's meaningless.
 
                                HENRY
                 Who's promiscuous?  We're alone, aren't we?
 
                                NIKKI
                 Pat, last time you were here, I spent
                 three days wrestling with a typical air
                 corps wolf.  It was like playing puss-in-
                 the-corner with Bluebeard or somebody.
                 You even invaded my bedroom, claiming you
                 were looking for a lost pocketknife.  Now,
                 I'm fond of you, Pat, but this time, if
                 you don't keep your hands to yourself,
                 we're through.
 
                                HENRY
                 You're fond of me, eh?  Well, I'm fond
                 of you, too.  What are we waiting for?
 
                                NIKKI
                 We're waiting until we get to know
                 each other.
 
                                HENRY
                      (grinning)
                 Now you're on my side.  Come here.
                 You'll get to know me.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (pushing him away)
                 Not that way.
 
                                HENRY
                 What other way is there?
 
                                NIKKI
                      (desperately)
                 Didn't you ever hear the word
                 "conversation"?  Didn't you ever read a
                 book, or see a movie - or - or think
                 about anything?
 
                                HENRY
                 Yeah.  But you don't want to talk
                 about what I'm thinking.
 
                                NIKKI
                 No, I don't.  If that's all you can think!
 
                                HENRY
                 I got other thoughts.
 
                                NIKKI
                 It would be an entrancing diversion to
                 hear one.
 
                                HENRY
                 Well, try this one.  Dames are all alike.
 
                                NIKKI
                 That's not a thought.  It's a cliche.
                 And a stupid cliche.
 
                                HENRY
                 All dames want to get married.  If you
                 ask them to marry you, you're sincere.  If
                 you don't you're Bluebeard, and a wolf.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (dangerously)
                 Are you saying I want you to ask me to
                 marry you?
 
                                HENRY
                 Never could figure them out.  If you
                 buy a dame one meal and try to kiss
                 her, you're a wolf and a Bluebeard.
                 But if the same fellow promises to buy
                 her thirty thousand meals, then he's a
                 prospective husband and he couldn't
                 beat her off with a stick.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Yes, and tell a fellow your garter
                 belt is your own business, and he'll
                 think of every mean, stinking thing
                 in the world to say back to you!
 
                                HENRY
                      (calmly)
                 That's the war of the sexes, I guess.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Well, I hate war!
 
                                HENRY
                 On the other hand, it's my business.  I
                 got a commission.  Gimme a kiss, Nikki.
 
                                NIKKI
                 I'm tired of you.  Now, come on.  Doctor
                 Carrington's eager to see you.
 
                                HENRY
                      (gloomily)
                 Okay.  Lead on, Miss Nicholson.  I
                 guess I came to the wrong Pole.
 
       He follows her out.
 
                                               DISSOLVE
 
 
10     INT. DR. CARRINGTON'S LABORATORY
 
       This is a large chamer in a separate building.  Here
       are concentrated the instruments used by the various
       scientists in their astronomical, mineralogical and
       botanical experiments.
 
       At a large flat-topped table in the room sits Dr. Arthur
       Carrington. He is a man of 43 with an alert, cheerful
       face.  He is good looking, well built, soft spoken.
       His dominant characteristic is a smile that seems never
       to leave his lips.  It is present always on his face
       like an extra feature.  He is a genius of science and
       a man whose brain is focused like a microscope on the
       secrets of nature.  But the intensity of his preoccupa-
       tion with science is not to be heard in the easy tones
       of his voice.  It will be seen in the things he does,
       in his point of view - but never in his manner.
       Outwardly, he seems only a good looking man full of
       child-like enthusiasm for a task and with a soothing,
       amiable way for his fellow man.
 
       In the room with Dr. Carrington is a lean young man
       named William Stone, in charge of the camp's
       photographic work and equipment.
 
       Captain Henry stands silently in the doorway, his eyes
       moodily on his scientific rival.  The doctor is
       studying the indicator dials of a complex instrument on
       the table.  Bill Stone greets the arrivals.
 
                                STONE
                 Hello, Nikki.  Hello, Captain
                 Henry.  How was the trip?
 
                                HENRY
                      (shortly)
                 O. K.
 
                      He remains staring at the preoccupied
                      Carrington who seems aware neither of
                      his or Nikki's presence.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (quietly)
                 Captain Henry is here, doctor.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (without looking up,
                       his voice amiable)
                 Yes, I know.
                      (his eyes stay on the indicator
                       dials and he continues softly)
                 Would you take these notes, please.
                      (he dictates to Nikki quietly.
                       She writes as he speaks)
                 November second, 2 p.m. Deflection
                 on screen nineteen continues -
                 twelve point three.  No lessening
                 or wavering of disturbing element.
                      (he looks up and smiles
                       at Henry and adds softly)
                 Can we start now, Captain Henry?
 
                                HENRY
                      (coolly)
                 Mind telling me where we're going?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Forty-eight miles due east.
 
                                HENRY
                 Your message said an aeroplane
                 had crashed.  Is that what we're
                 looking for?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (smiling)
                 I don't know, Captain.
 
                                HENRY
                      (covering his irritation
                       with difficulty)
                 I'd like to know what I'm supposed
                 to go looking for, Dr. Carrington.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (gently)
                 So would I.
                      (eagerly)
                 I think we should start while
                 the light holds.
 
                                HENRY
                      (without moving)
                 We'll start after you've given me
                 what information you've got.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (softly)
                 Is that necessary, Captain?
                      (he sees Henry's scowl
                       and is quickly contrite)
                 I'm very sorry.  I was thinking
                 only of the vagueness of my
                 information.  I dislike being
                 vague.  Will you please read
                 Captain Henry my first notes,
                 Nikki?
 
                                NIKKI
                      (opening the note book in
                       her hand and reading from
                       it)
                 November 1, 11:15 p.m.  Sound detectors
                 registered explosion due east.  11:18 p.m.
                 magnetic dial revealed twelve point three
                 deflection.  Such deflection possible only
                 if a disturbing force equivalent to 20,000
                 tons of steel or iron ore had become part
                 of the earth within fifty mile radius.
 
                                HENRY
                 That sounds like a meteor, doesn't it?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (amiably)
                 Yes, very much.  Except for our photographic
                 plates.  Our telescopic cameras were working
                 last night.  Here is the film taken between
                 11:12 and 11:15.  Let Captain Henry see it,
                 Bill.
 
                      Stone switches on a light in a moviola
                      box and runs a strip of film slowly
                      through it.  Captain Henry looks into
                      the box.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 You will note the small dot low on the film.
                 It is moving from west to east.  At 11:14
                 the dot moves upward.  At 11:15 it drops to
                 the earth and vanishes.  A meteor might move
                 almost horizontally from west to east, but
                 never upward.  If the traveling object caused
                 the explosion we picked up, it is in the ice
                 48 miles from here.  The sound reached us
                 four minutes after the object's disappearance.
                 This gives us the approximate distance from
                 here.
 
                                HENRY
                      (frowning)
                 Twenty thousand tons of steel is a lot of
                 metal for an aeroplane.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 For the sort of aeroplane we know, Captain.
 
                                HENRY
                      (abruptly)
                 Come on, let's get going.
 
                      He walks out followed by Carrington,
                      Stone and Nikki.
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
11     INT. C-54 PLANE
 
       Captain Henry and Lieutenat Dykes are at the controls.
       The rest of the crew are in their accustomed places.
       A dog sled and a dog-team occupy the rear of the
       passenger cabin.
 
       Flight Engineer Barnes is scanning the snowscape below.
       So are Photographer Stone and the scientists Olson,
       Chapman, Vorrhees, Laurenz and Redding.  Skeely is also
       peering avidly out of the window.  There is an air of
       tension to the silence.
 
       Only Dr. Carrington seems relaxed.  He shares a seat
       with Nikki.
 
       From time to time Captain Henry turns around to scowl
       at Nikki and Carrington.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (eagerly to her companion)
                 I'm terribly excited, Arthur!  I'm
                 jumping up and down inside!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (softly)
                 So am I.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (laughing)
                 If the world were coming to an end, I
                 don't think you'd change your expression,
                 Arthur.  You'd keep smiling - and dictating
                 notes - and expect me to take them down
                 accurately.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (nodding)
                 And you would.
 
                      Captain Henry has risen and left
                      Dykes at the controls.  He has
                      walked back to Carrington and stood
                      there waiting grimly for their talk
                      to end.  He speaks up now with
                      irritation.
 
                                HENRY
                 We're fifty miles out, Doctor, and not a
                 sign of anything.  Those gadgets of yours
                 must be screwy.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (amiably)
                 I doubt it, Captain.  They've exhibited
                 no signs of lunacy in the past.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (to Henry)
                 You must be off your course.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Carrington, insistently,
                       ignoring Nikki)
                 We haven't seen anything, have we?
                 What does that mean?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (amiably)
                 It means we haven't seen it.  It doesn't
                 mean it isn't there.
 
                      Henry's response is interrupted
                      by a cry from Dykes.
 
                                DYKES
                 Hey, Pat!  Look at this!  The compass
                 is turning around!
 
                                HENRY
                      (starting forward)
                 What the holy --
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (calmly)
                 We've passed it.
                      (calling to Dykes)
                 When did it start turning, Lieutenant?
 
                                DYKES
                 Just now -- fifteen seconds ago.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (to Nikki)
                 Mark the time, please.
                      (to Dykes)
                 Is it a complete revolution?
 
                                DYKES
                 Yep.  Hundred and eighty degrees.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (to Henry)
                 Then we flew right over it about a
                 mile and three eighths back.
 
                                HENRY
                      (curtly)
                 Thanks.
                      (he calls to the cockpit)
                 Spin it around Eddie, and take
                 her down low.
 
       Henry returns to the cockpit.  Carrington follows him
       and stands gazing out over his shoulder.
 
 
12     LONG SHOT OF ICE FIELD FROM SHIP'S POINT OF VIEW
 
       A dark patch in the ice appears.
 
 
13     INT. COCKPIT
 
                                CARRINGTON AND DYKES
                      (together)
                 There - I see it - over there!
 
                                DYKES
                 It's buried in the ice.
 
                                HENRY
                      (peering at the
                       ground)
                 What do you think, Eddie?
 
                                DYKES
                      (pointing)
                 Looks pretty smooth over
                 there -
 
                                HENRY
                      (nodding)
                 Fasten your seat belts,
                 folks.  We're going to land.
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
14     THE ICE PLANE
 
       The C-54 lands gracefully on its skis.  Its occupants
       disembark.  Barnes and Dykes start hitching up the dog
       team.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (standing on tiptoe)
                 I can't see it from here.
 
                                HENRY
                 It's that way.  About a half
                 mile.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 A little more south, I believe.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Oh, I hope we don't lose it.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (smiling at her
                       eagerness)
                 Hardly.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 This'll lead us right to it.
 
       He holds up a Geiger counter.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (surprised)
                 A Geiger counter.  But there's
                 no reason to suppose it's
                 radioactive.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 It is, though.  I noticed in
                 the plane.  See?
 
       He holds up the counter.  It clicks steadily.
 
                                DYKES
                 All set, folks.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Nikki)
                 You ride on the sled.
 
       Nikki gets on the sled.  It starts off, the rest of the
       party trotting along in its tracks.
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO
 
 
15     THE ICE PLAIN NEAR THE DARK PATCH
 
       The sled stops.  Nikki gets off and runs with the others
       to the dark patch.  They stand looking down at it from a
       little hillock of snow and ice.
 
                                BARNES
                 That's no aeroplane.
 
                                OLSON
                 It's certainly not a meteor.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Whatever it is, how in the
                 holy name of Aberdeen, did it
                 get in there?  Look, the ice
                 is smooth as glass.
 
       There is a little chorus of agreement and wonder.
 
                                HENRY
                 This is the craziest thing
                 I ever saw!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Not really.
 
                                HENRY
                      (over polite)
                 Perhaps you'll be good enough
                 to explain the little mystery
                 to all us ordinary people.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (staring at the
                       dark patch)
                 Anything hitting the earth's
                 atmosphere at an astronomical
                 speed would be white hot in an
                 instant.  It would melt its
                 way into the ice which would
                 then freeze over it again.
 
       Skeely and Barnes have moved to another hillock to get a
       better view of the buried object.  Suddenly Skeely lets
       out a yell.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (at the top of his
                       lungs)
                 IT'S A SAUCER!  IT'S A FLYING
                 SAUCER!
 
       There is an instant's silence.  They all stare into the
       ice.
 
                                OLSON
                      (softly)
                 Bless my soul, that's what it
                 is!
 
                                AD LIB
                 A saucer!
                 A flying disc!
                 Sure, look from over here - see?
                 A real, honest-to-God saucer!
                 See the direction vanes...
                 They said there were no such things...
                 D'ya suppose there's anyone in it?
                 Must be ... Sure...
 
                                SKEELY
                      (jumping with excitement)
                 Axes!  Get some ice-axes!
 
       Barnes and Dykes run for axes.
 
                                STONE
                 Stand back, everybody!  Let me
                 get some pictures!
 
                                SKEELY
                      (wildly, as Stone
                       starts photographing)
                 Where's the radio generator!
                 Hey, MacAuliff!
                      (MacAuliff turns
                       to him)
                 Scotty, come on, quick!  I
                 want to send a message!
 
                                HENRY
                      (interrupting)
                 Nothing doing.  No private
                 messages.
 
                                SKEELY
                 What do you mean, private!  I'm
                 going to send it to the whole
                 world!
 
                                HENRY
                 Sorry, Skeely.  This is army
                 information.  I'll have to wait
                 for authority to let you file a
                 story.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (beside himself)
                 You've got your authority from
                 the Constitution of the United
                 States!  It's called freedom of
                 the press!  I'm sending my story,
                 Captain!
 
                                HENRY
                 All right, send it.  But not from
                 my ship.
 
       Skeely glares at him in frustrated fury.  Henry ignores
       Skeely's rage, and turns to MacAuliff.
 
                                HENRY (cont'd)
                 Call Hendrix..Have him wire Fogarty
                 we've found a flying disc - intact
                 - imbeaded in the ice - and we're
                 going to get it out!
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Yes, sir.
 
       He starts for the plane - Skeely at his heels.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (urgently)
                 Looky, Scotty!  This is the
                 biggest story since the Red Sea!
                 A ship from another planet!  You
                 can't cover it up!  Have a heart!
                 Think what this means to the world!
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 I'm not working for the world.
                 I'm working for the army, and I've
                 got my orders.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (furiously)
                 Even the Russians wouldn't act
                 like this!
 
       He starts back toward Captain Henry.
 
                                OLSON
                      (to Carrington)
                 What do you make of that,
                 Arthur?  It certainly doesn't
                 look like 20,000 tons of steel.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Not even a ton, I'd say.
 
       During the above, axes have arrived.  Five of the men
       start hacking feverishly through the ice.  Nikki stands
       beside Carrington.  Captain Henry joins the men chopping
       on the ice.  The little group on the wind-swept snow
       work silently and desperately to remove the four feet
       covering of ice from the saucer.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (coming up to Carrington)
                 What do you think it's made of,
                 Arthur?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 No element we know on this earth.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (excitedly)
                 I don't see any door or windows
                 in it.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 They must be underneath.
 
                                OLSON
                      (peering)
                 I can't make out any engine.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I doubt if we'll find anything
                 we call an engine.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (arriving out of breath)
                 What planet do you figure it's
                 from, Doctor?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Not this one.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Must be Mars.  That's the only
                 one that's supposed to be
                 inhabited, isn't it?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I'll be able to answer your
                 questions a little more
                 accurately after I've examined
                 the interior of the craft and
                 its occupants, if any.
 
       Skeely grabs an axe and runs toward the chopping group.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Occupants!  They must be dead,
                 though!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Dead or alive - we'll learn a
                 great many things we don't know
                 in the world, now.
 
       The group is swinging axes.  Captain Henry suddenly stops
       digging.  He looks up at the sun looks at his watch.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Dykes)
                 We can't make it, Eddie.  The
                 light'll be gone in an hour.
                 The temperature's dropping, too,
                 I think.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (looking toward the
                       horizon)
                 That storm front's moving in
                 fast.  But we can't quit.  We've
                 got to keep going!  It's from
                 Mars!
 
                                HENRY
                 I'm not going to try an
                 instrument landing on skis in
                 the dark - and kill off everybody.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (eagerly)
                 We can dig for another half
                 hour, Pat.
 
                                HENRY
                 If they get that close - I'll
                 never get them back in the ship.
                 They're so excited now they don't
                 know they're half frozen.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (excitedly)
                 Look, Pat - I feel fine.  I'll
                 stay here all night.  Just
                 leave me a sleeping bag and some
                 whiskey.
 
                                HENRY
                      (suddenly)
                 I got a thermite bomb on the
                 sled.  Go get it.  We'll melt
                 the ice away.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (axe in hand)
                 Wonderful!  What a brain!
 
       He runs toward the sled.  At the same moment one of the
       diggers cries out.
 
                                BARNES
                      (axe in hand)
                 Here's a piece in the open!
                 We've uncovered it!
 
                      The scientists and the axe
                      wielders run over to Barnes.
                      Captain Henry comes over.
                      Dr. Carrington drops to his
                      knees and examines a two foot
                      metal edge protruding from the
                      ice.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 May I have a file, please?
 
                                BARNES
                 Here's one.
 
                      He removes a file from his heavy
                      clothes.  The group watches as
                      Dr. Carrington starts using the
                      file on the protruding edge of
                      the saucer.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 What's it look like, Arthur?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (hitting the file against it)
                 I don't know.  Probably an alloy.  I'll
                 try and get some filings.  We can analyze
                 them tonight.
                      (he looks up and smiles at the
                       group watching him)
                 We haven't much time.  I suggest you all
                 continue with your excavating.
 
                                HENRY
                 No need to.  We've got a thermite bomb.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (pleased)
                 Thermite!  Oh, excellent!
 
                      He stops filing and rises.  He
                      stands staring down at the machine
                      in the ice.  Lieut. Dykes arrives
                      with a thermite bomb, a length of
                      wire and a plunger.  MacAuliff comes
                      running up at the same moment.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (panting)
                 They're relaying the message to Fogarty now.
                 We ought to have an answer in an hour.
                 I got some news back from Hendrix.  The
                 barometer fell down to the cellar and a
                 freeze is coming up like nobody's business.
                 He says to watch out.
 
                                HENRY
                 I'm watching.  Drill a hole for that bomb,
                 Eddie.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (moving in to the group in
                       time to hear the last ramark)
                 A bomb?  Is that safe?
 
                                DYKES
                      (as he digs the hole, Barnes
                       assisting)
                 It's S.O.P.  Standard Operating Procedure
                 for removing ice.  It just melts it.
 
                                BARNES
                 It'll uncover the whole saucer in thirty
                 seconds.
 
                                NIKKI
                 I'm so excited, I'm almost sick to my
                 stomach.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Dykes)
                 That's deep enough, Eddie.  The light's
                 going fast.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (softly, as he continues to
                       stare at the metal mass at his
                       feet)
                 Five minutes from now we may have the
                 key to the stars.  A million years of
                 history are waiting in that ice for us.
 
                                DYKES
                 All set, Pat.
 
                                HENRY
                 Clear the field, Mac.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (calling)
                 Over here - everybody.  Keep together.
 
                      The crew and scientists and Nikki
                      move across the ice, led by MacAuliff.
                      Eddie uncoils a hundred feet of wire
                      and walks with it.  Captain Henry stands
                      in the increasing wind - surveying the
                      dimly outlined ship in the ice.
 
                                HENRY
                      (raising his arm)
                 Let her go, Eddie.
 
                      Eddie presses the plunger.  There
                      is the normal thermite bomb explosion.
                      A glow of the thermite flares and
                      dies.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (calling out)
                 O.K., folks.  She's clear.
 
                      Before anyone can move there is a
                      muffled exlosion.  And a second
                      flare starts under the ice.  Gradu-
                      ally the glare builds up.  The
                      whole ice field becomes illuminated
                      from beneath by an unbearable light.
                      The onlookers are forced to turn
                      their eyes away, all save Carrington,
                      and Henry who continue to stare at
                      it.
 
                      A chorus of exclamations and queries
                      rise from the group.
 
                                AD LIB
                 What is it?
                 What happened -
                 Secondary explosion?
                 Don't look - Shield your eyes!
                 How can it burn - in the ice?
                 Chain reaction - from the thermite!
                 Etc.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (grabbing Chapman's arm)
                 What's happening to it.  Tell me, Doc!
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (slowly)
                 I'm afraid it's disintegrating - totally.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (his face tense)
                 Secrets - that might have given us a new
                 science.  Gone!
 
                      Captain Henry stands aghast as
                      the wild burning consumes the
                      ship under the ice.  He sees its
                      outlines run and vanish.  Skeely
                      comes up to him.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (raging)
                 Standard Operating Procedure, you blind
                 ape!  You've destroyed it!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I should have thought - I should have
                 thought...
 
                                SKEELY
                 You sure should!  The greatest discovery
                 in history up flames!  Fine work!
                      (he wheels on Henry)
                 The army can be proud of itself - turning
                 a whole civilization into a Fourth of July
                 piece.  Even the Indians acted smarter
                 toward Columbus!
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 Not a shred left.  Every bit of it gone -
                 and we know nothing - nothing.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 We know one thing...what it was made of.
                 Obviously a magnesium alloy.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 That's right.  Only magnesium would react
                 to heat that way.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (bitterly)
                 Splendid!  There's a story for me.
                      (quoting)
                 Scientists learn magnesium burns!
 
                                DYKES
                      (to Henry)
                 Want me to mark the spot - so we
                 can find it after the storm?
 
                      Captain Henry has been staring
                      into the wind-swept ice.  He has
                      stood silent under Skeely's abuse.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Dykes)
                 Later, Eddie.  First, I want you to bring
                 up all your picks and axes.  Mac, I want
                 your Geiger counter.  And bring the dog sled.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Where to?
 
                                HENRY
                 I saw something under the ice about
                 fifty feet from here.  The flare lit
                 it up.
 
                      He holds the Geiger counter
                      in front of him and starts
                      walking slowly.  Carrington,
                      Ericson, Barnes, Dykes and
                      Skeely move along at his side.
                      The others straggle behind,
                      MacAuliff leading the dog team.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 What was it, Captain?
 
                                HENRY
                 I don't know.  It was shaped like a
                 man, but it might have been a piece of
                 the disk.
 
                                DYKES
                 A man!  You mean somebody got out of that
                 saucer?
 
                                HENRY
                 Probably thrown out when it crashed.  If
                 it is a man.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (gesturing toward the counter,
                       which is clicking)
                 It's radio active.  I imagine it must be a
                 fragment fron the saucer.
 
                                HENRY
                 Maybe.  It was sure man-shaped, though.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (with growing excitement)
                 Good work, Captain.  We may salvage
                 something yet.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (pointing at the counter)
                 It's getting louder.  More to your left,
                 I think.
 
                                DYKES
                      (pointing off)
                 There it is!  There!
 
                      He points to an ice bank.  Dimly
                      visible in the ice is a two legged
                      shape.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Is this a story!  The man from Mars!
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (excitedly)
                 It's got legs - and a head.  I can see 'em.
 
                                NIKKI
                 It is!  It's a man... It really is!
 
                      There is an ad lib chorus of
                      excited remarks from the others.
 
                                AD LIB
                 There - see it?
                 Look - right by that boulder!
                 It's an animal.
                 No - it's a man.
                 Must be eight feet long.
                 Etc.
 
                                EDDIE
                 How come it's frozen in the ice - if it was
                 thrown clear?
 
                                HENRY
                      (chopping at the ice)
                 Same as the saucer.  Got melted in.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (chopping at the ice)
                 How about using some thermite?
 
                                HENRY
                 Shut up!
 
                      The men continue to swing their
                      axes.  MacAuliff has stepped into
                      a small depression in the ice and
                      is closest to the figure they are
                      trying to extricate.  The ice
                      surrounding it has become flawed
                      from their blows, and the figure
                      it contains is practically invisible.
 
                                BARNES
                      (chopping)
                 I can't see it at all now.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Hurry up, boys.  I can't wait.
                      (to Henry)
                 Sure hope it isn't a mirage.
 
                                HENRY
                 No mirage.  It's there all right.
 
                                BARNES
                 What did it look like in the flare?
 
                                HENRY
                 You'll believe it when you see it.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (from below)
                 Hey -
 
                                HENRY
                 What's wrong, Mac?
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (staggering away
                       from the block
                       they have carved
                       out)
                 I'm sick to my stomach.  I sunk
                 my pick right into its skull -
                 something green oozed out.
 
                                EDDIE
                 No harm done.  It was dead
                 anyway.
 
                                ERICSON
                 The light's going, Pat.  We
                 haven't got time.
 
                                HENRY
                 You're right.
 
                                BARNES
                 Hey, look.  The whole block's
                 coming loose!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (nodding)
                 Recently formed ice.  Separates
                 easily.
 
                                HENRY
                 All right -- everybody on it.
                 We'll load the whole slab onto
                 the sled.
 
       They load the block onto the dog sled, and start
       hauling it across the ice field.
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
16     EXT. POLAR CAMP.  THE LIGHT IS ALMOST GONE
 
       The C-54 appears in the lowering sky.  It flies
       erratically in the increasing wind.
 
       The plane makes a precarious landing on its skis, the
       rising gale buffeting, and almost overturning it.
 
       A half dozen bundled Eskimos come out of the camp and
       move toward the plane.
 
       Barnes, Eddie and MacAuliff pile out.  They help Nikki
       and the scientists alight.  In the half dark, the
       pessengers start across the wind-blasted snow toward
       the camp.  They move with difficulty.  Words are
       inaudible in the gale.
 
       MacAuliff gestures the Eskimos toward the plane.  They
       climb in.  Captain Henry and Eddie bring out the dogs
       and a sled.
 
       The block of ice, half covered by a tarpaulin, is
       dropped from the plane's door.
 
       Working in the icy blasts now sweeping the dark, the
       men move the ice-block onto a sled.  Others tie the
       plane down, tethering it to stakes pounded into the ice.
 
       With the plane tied down, the party starts for the camp.
       The dogs draw the sled with the ice-block on it.
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
16A    EXTERIOR ENTRANCE TO STOREROOM
 
       A series of steps have been cut through the snowbank
       outside the storeroom entrance.  The ice-block is
       unloaded from the sled and bumped down the steep steps.
 
 
17     INT. STORE ROOM
 
       It is a dimly lit room, piled with barrels of
       scientific equipment.  It has the look of a gloomy
       well stocked cellar.
 
       The ice-block is slid into a clear space in the middle
       of the room.  Barrels and boxes are moved to make more
       room around it, all the group assisting.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Eddie)
                 Send the Eskimos away.
 
                                EDDIE
                 They've hot footed it already.
                 It's going to take a lot of
                 coaxing to get them back.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Anyone got some whiskey?
 
                                EDDIE
                      (poking among
                       some boxes)
                 Here's a whole bar room.
 
       He removes a bottle and starts opening it.
 
                                BARNES
                      (to Henry, nervously)
                 What do we do now, unveil him?
 
                                HENRY
                 Nothing to see through the ice.
                      (to Carrington)
                 Can you turn off the heat in
                 this room, Doctor?
 
                                CARRIGTON
                      (softly)
                 If it's necessary.
 
                                EDDIE
                 What d'you meen, turn off the
                 heat.  It's fifty below outside.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I suggest we discuss our procedure
                 before we take any further steps.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Eddie)
                 Open the window, Eddie.
 
       Eddie stares at him and climbs up to the window.
 
                                LAURENZ
                      (full of tension,
                       his eyes on the
                       tarp covered block
                       of ice)
                 We're wasting time, Captain!
                 We must melt it out.  Investigate!
                 Examine!
 
                                HENRY
                 We're not melting it out.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (from the ladder
                       top)
                 The window's closed.
 
                                HENRY
                 Punch a hole in it.
 
       Eddie breaks the window.
 
                                LAURENZ
                 This is stupid!  Criminal!  The
                 secrets of a universe are in
                 there.  We are scientists!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (quietly)
                 It's almost certain that we'll
                 be called in by the army to make
                 a study of it later, Captain.
 
                                LAURENZ
                 You can't fly the thing to Dutch
                 Harbor!  This storm may last for
                 weeks.  No human can walk in it.
 
                                HENRY
                 I'm sorry, gentlemen.  I'll wait
                 instructions from General Fogarty.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (quietly)
                 I think you're making a crazy
                 decision.  There's no army
                 precedent for how to treat a
                 Martian.  And nobody is better
                 qualified to take our visitor
                 apart than these gentlemen of
                 science.  You couldn't ask for
                 more geniuses at an autopsy.
 
                                HENRY
                 It's staying in the ice.
 
                                LAURENZ
                 You're behaving like a meddlesome
                 sophomore, Captain Henry!  There
                 are organisms that survive after
                 death.  Cold may destroy them.
 
                                REDDING
                      (quietly)
                 They may be dangerous organisms.
                 Disease germs from another planet.
                 We're not prepared medically to
                 cope with them.
 
                                LAURENZ
                 That is absolute nonsense, Redding!
 
                                REDDING
                 Nor do we know what effect the air
                 of our earth may have on the
                 creature's remains.
 
                                HENRY
                 Yes, I'd feel kind of foolish if
                 this thing disappeared in a cloud
                 of smoke like that saucer did.
 
                                LAURENZ
                      (to Carrington)
                 Arthur, you are in charge of
                 this post.
 
                                VORHEES
                 We have every right to proceed
                 scientifically.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (controling himself)
                 Captain Henry, I can only urge
                 you in the interest of human
                 knowledge to permit us to
                 examine the body in there -
 
                                LAURENZ
                      (excitedly)
                 We don't have to be permitted!
                 We have thirty men in this camp -
                 all armed.
 
                                HENRY
                 Your request is denied, Dr.
                 Carrington.  That ice-block and
                 what's in it is army property.
                 And this is a military installation.
                 As head of the military here, I'm
                 taking over.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Martial law, eh!
 
                                HENRY
                 Until I receive instructions from
                 my superior officer on what to do
                 - we'll mark time.  I'm posting a
                 guard to keep everybody out - and
                 everybody's hands off - in the
                 meantime.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (softly)
                 Captain Henry is doing what he
                 considers right.
                      (to Henry)
                 It's difficult for me to mark
                 time - with such amazing information
                 waiting for us - but I accept your
                 decision.  I suggest that your guard
                 use one of our electric blankets to
                 keep warm.  Will you get him one, Fred.
 
       A mechanic present nods.
 
                                HENRY
                 Thanks.  How do we get to your
                 radio room?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I'll show you.
                      (he starts out)
 
                                SKEELY
                      (excitedly)
                 The radio room!  I'm getting
                 senile!  I forgot all about it.
 
       Skeely starts out.
 
                                EDDIE
                 Mind if I have a last peek at
                 our pal --
 
       He goes to the ice-block, and pulls off the tarpaulin.
       The dim two-legged shape is blurringly visible inside
       the block.
 
                                HENRY
                 Come on, Eddie.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (staring at the
                       frosted ice-cake)
                 I can't quite make it out yet,
                 but I know one thing.  They
                 don't bread 'em for beauty on Mars.
 
       The rest of the group leaves through the inner door.
       We stay with Ken.  He stands alone in the cellar,
       leaning against a barrel.  He picks up a whiskey
       bottle and takes a swig.  Then he approaches the block
       of ice.  He stares into it for a moment and backs away.
       He removes his gun from its holster, and resumes his
       place leaning against the barrels, his eyes nervously
       on the ice-block.
 
 
18     INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - CONNECTING CELLAR AND
       RADIO BUILDING
 
       Led by Dr. Carrington, the group moves down the shadowy
       length.  Skeely is talking as he walks beside Captain
       Henry.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (his excitement a contrast
                       to the silence of the
                       scientists and army men)
                 Can you imagine what's going to happen
                 when this story hits the headlines!
                 Everybody who owns a sled is going to
                 start for the North Pole for a look at
                 the man from Mars.  Gentlemen, you'll
                 be doing a bigger business than Coney
                 Island in a week!  What a shame, he's
                 dead!  An interview with a live Martian!
                 That would have been something, eh?
                 Look, Captain, you've got to let
                 these boys get at that corpse as soon
                 as possible.  Our readers will be
                 waiting for details.  You're liable
                 to give the whole nation a nervous
                 breakdown.
 
 
19     INT. RADIO ROOM
 
       The entire communication equipment of the post is
       housed here.  A step-ladder leads to a trap-door which
       in turn leads to a small observation tower above the
       radio room.  Sitting at, the radio controls is Ezra
       Hendrix, the operator.
 
       The group enters.  Ezra is a stocky young man.  He is
       full of excitement as he turns to the arrivals.
 
                                EZRA
                 I'm using full power.  The lousy pole
                 is shooting electricity all over
                 the place.
 
                                HENRY
                 I'm Captain Henry.  Any messages for me?
 
                                EZRA
                 Yes.  Came through a few minutes ago.
                      (he reads from a
                       piece of paper)
                 Fogarty to Henry.  Remove flying
                 saucer from ice at once.  Use thermite
                 bomb to melt her out.  Erect temporary
                 structure to protect find until my
                 arrival with staff chiefs.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (beaming)
                 That's what I like about the army.
                 Smart - all the way to the top.
                      (to Henry)
                 Well, Captain, that gives you a chance
                 to pass the buck on that thermite deal.
 
                                HENRY
                      (ignoring him)
                 Will you send this to General Fogarty?
 
                                SKEELY
                 Make it short, will you, Captain?  There's
                 a hundred and fifty million people holding
                 their breaths -
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Ezra)
                 Henry to Fogarty.  Flying saucer completely
                 destroyed by thermite bomb, due to unforeseen
                 composition of ship.  Have removed dead
                 passenger from wreck...
 
                                EZRA
                      (as he taps the key)
                 You got a Martian?  Where is he?
 
                                SKEELY
                 On ice, buddy.  Hurry it up - I've got a
                 flash for you.
 
                                EZRA
                      (tapping)
                 The static's knocking us out of the air.
 
                                HENRY
                 Keeping dead body in block of ice.  Carrington
                 wants permission to remove and examine.
                 Waiting your instructions before further
                 action.  That's all.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (eagerly)
                 O. K.  Cosmopolitan Press Office, New York
                 City.  You can clear through Edmonton.  Try
                 our bureau there.
                      (he dictates)
                 With Carrington expedition.  North Pole -
                 The world has a new visitor today, a two
                 legged creature from Mars.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 You are being a little premature, Mr.
                 Skeely.  That has not been established.
 
                                SKEELY
                 You can un-establish it - if I'm wrong,
                 Doctor.
 
                                EZRA
                 It's dead.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (angrily)
                 I know it's dead.
 
                                EZRA
                 I mean the sender.  Nothing's going out.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Keep clicking, man!  It can't quit on you
                 now!
 
                      Another telegraph clicking
                      sound comes through.
 
                                EZRA
                 Something's coming in.
 
                      He starts writing.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 It will alter our situation, Captain -
                 if we can't get through to your General.
 
                                HENRY
                 The situation remains as it is - until
                 we do.
 
                                EZRA
                      (reading from the paper on
                       which he has been writing)
                 Everything grounded - can't join you.  Want
                 you to -
                      (he looks up)
                 The rest is scrambled, Captain.  Can't pick
                 it up.
 
                                HENRY
                 He didn't get my message?
 
                                EZRA
                 Doesn't look like it.  We're a weaker
                 station than the one at your base,
                 Captain.  I may be able to pick them
                 up - if they keep sending - but our
                 outgoing stuff is hopeless.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Lookie!  You can't stop!  I've got
                 to get this story through.  Send it
                 anyway.  Some ham may pick it up -
                 there's millions of them.  Send it!
                      (to Henry)
                 Pat, how about heading back for
                 Dutch Harbor?
 
                                HENRY
                 I don't think we can get as far as the
                 plane - in this wind.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (desperately, as he leans
                       over Ezra)
                 Keep hitting it, pall!  Somebody'll get
                 it - somewhere.  Keep clicking...
 
                      Ezra clicks desperately away
                      on his instrument.  The group
                      stands waiting and silent.
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
20     INT. BEDROOM OF THE POST.  NIGHT
 
       This is a large dormitory with cot beds in it, lining
       the walls.  Henry, Eddie, Barnes and Skeely are in the
       room.
 
       Skeely is walking up and down, peering out of the window
       at the storming night.
 
       Eddie sits on a cot.  Barnes is curled up on another cot.
       Henry is at a window, looking out.
 
                                EDDIE
                 You know something?  These scientists
                 here remind me of the time I was stuck
                 on Bulan Island with the Hundred and
                 Sixteenth.  An army nurse came ashore
                 one day and created a disturbance similar
                 to this Martian.
 
                                BARNES
                      (from his cot)
                 What happened to her, Lieutenant?
 
                                EDDIE
                 Nothin' she didn't like.  I'm just
                 wondering if the professors will try
                 to rush us, Pat.
 
                                HENRY
                      (grimly)
                 Might relieve the monotony if they did.
 
                                EDDIE
                 I'd hate to have to shoot down seventeen
                 of the world's greatest geniuses.  You
                 know somethin?
 
                                HENRY
                 What?
 
                                EDDIE
                 They're kids, all of them.  Nine year olds
                 drooling over a new fire engine.  Scientists!
                 Did you notice those two double domes who
                 started crying - when we left the table?
 
                                SKEELY
                      (suddenly)
                 This storm is getting worse, Captain.
 
                                HENRY
                 Yes, it's tossing around some.
 
                                SKEELY
                 There's only one thing we can do - dog sleds!
                 We can wrap General Fogarty up and take him
                 along.
 
                                EDDIE
                 Fogarty?
 
                                SKEELY
                 That's my name for our pretty boy from Mars.
                 He has the same dubious relation to a human
                 being as that pot-bellied clam in Dutch
                 Harbor.  Dog sleds, Captain, are our only
                 solution.
 
                                HENRY
                 Solution to what?
 
                                SKEELY
                 Getting out of here - we could make
                 the base in five days -
 
                                HENRY
                 Cut the yammering, will you.  I've got
                 enough on my mind.  It's death outside.
                 The storm will knock off even the Polar
                 bears.
 
                      The door opens and MacAuliff
                      enters.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 He's going crazy.
 
                                EDDIE
                 Who?
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Fogarty.
 
                                EDDIE
                 Which one?
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Are you nuts?  There's only one Fogarty.
 
                                EDDIE
                 There's two now.  Skeely's baptized our
                 Martian with the same name.
 
                                HENRY
                 What about the General?
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Incoming stuff is pretty jammed.  But
                 I've figured it to read there's been a
                 leak in Washington.  News of our find
                 has made the papers.  Congress and the
                 President and a lot of other top brass
                 want further details.
 
                                HENRY
                 They're not picking up anything from us?
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Not a crackle.
 
                      SKEELY laughs.
 
                                HENRY
                      (frowning)
                 What's the joke, Skeely?
 
                                SKEELY
                      (chuckling)
                 A picture of my editor just came
                 to me...tearing up and down his
                 office - breaking windows and yelling
                 for Skeely.  I can almost hear him.
                 He's liable to shoot himself by mid-
                 night.
 
                      The door flings open.  Navigator
                      Ken Ericson enters.  He is in a
                      high state of agitation.
 
                                KEN
                      (loudly)
                 Where's Barnes?
 
                                BARNES
                      (sitting up)
                 What's up, Ken?
 
                                KEN
                      (violently)
                 It's eleven five.  You're supposed to
                 relieve me at eleven.
 
                                HENRY
                      (sharply)
                 You've left your post!
 
                                KEN
                      (wildly)
                 He's late.  He was supposed to come
                 at eleven.
 
                                HENRY
                 Shut up!
 
                                KEN
                      (desperately)
                 I can't take it any longer, Captain.
 
                                HENRY
                 Take what?
 
                                KEN
                 You can see it now!  The ice has cleared
                 up.  It's got crazy hands.  No ears, and
                 a lot of eyes.  They're all open!  I turned
                 a flash on it - and it looked like it
                 was moving.  And I lit out.
 
                                HENRY
                 Get back to your post.
 
                                KEN
                      (slowly)
                 O. K.
 
                                HENRY
                 Barnes will be right along.
 
                                KEN
                 O. K.
 
                                HENRY
                 Get going!
 
                                KEN
                 Yes, sir.
 
                      He turns and walks slowly
                      out of the room.
 
                                SKEELY
                 I'm going to have a look.
 
                                HENRY
                 You're staying out of there, Skeely -
                 along with everybody else.  Put on
                 your flightsuit, Barnes.  And get in
                 there before Ken starts having kittens.
 
                                BARNES
                      (pulling on his electrically
                       heated flying suit)
                 That's the first squawk I've heard out
                 of Ken since Ploesti.  I don't like it.
 
                                SKEELY
                 All I want is to verify what I know -
                 about it's being four-eyed.
 
                                EDDIE
                 He didn't say four eyes.  He said -
 
                                HENRY
                 Never mind what he said.  I'm barring
                 all civilians.
 
                                SKEELY
                 You're being a little stuffy about this
                 whole thing, Captain Henry.
 
                                BARNES
                 I won't need the electric blanket -
                 if I got this suit plugged in.  So
                 in case you care to send me any
                 company, I could make them
                 comfortable, Captain.
 
                                HENRY
                 I'll relieve you myself at 2 a.m.
                 And don't leave your post.
 
                                EDDIE
                 Pat's right, Barney.  If you give
                 them a chance, those scientists
                 will have him out - waltzing with
                 him.
 
                                BARNES
                 O.K., Captain.  I'll expect you
                 at 2 a.m.
 
                                HENRY
                 Right.
 
       Barnes opens the door.  Nikki is in the doorway.  She
       is dressed in a fetching looking outfit.
 
                                BARNES
                      (passing her)
                 Good evening, Miss Nicholson.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Hello.  May I come in?
 
                                HENRY
                      (coolly)
                 We're a bit untidy.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (smiling at
                       him)
                 Dreadfully unsocial atmosphere
                 around, even for the North Pole.
 
                                HENRY
                 I'm sorry to have contributed to
                 your gloom, Miss Nicholson.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Miss Nicholson!  Is that what
                 happens under martial law -
                 everybody loses their nicknames?
 
                                HENRY
                      (stiffly)
                 Did you want to see me about
                 anything in particular?
 
                                NIKKI
                 No.  I was having a drink - all by
                 myself in my room...and playing the
                 phonograph.  And I suddenly felt I
                 was being very selfish.  All that
                 lovely music, only for me.
 
                                HENRY
                      (smiling at her)
                 Want company?
 
                                NIKKI
                 That's what I'm hinting at, Mistah Henry.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Eddie)
                 I'll be in Miss Nicholson's quarters if
                 anything comes up.
 
                                SKEELY
                 I take it Miss Nicholson's quarters
                 are also out of bounds for civilians.
 
                                HENRY
                 During army occupation only.
 
       He moves Nikki through the door.
 
 
21     INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE NIKKI'S ROOM
 
       Nikki and Captain Henry approach it.  They walk in
       silence.  Nikki opens the door.
 
 
22     INT. NIKKI'S ROOM AND OFFICE
 
                                HENRY
                      (a bit sarcastically)
                 You sure you trust me with little
                 you all alone in your bedroom?
 
                                NIKKI
                 Yes, I think I can.
 
                                HENRY
                 Very manly.  You ought to wear
                 pants.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (giggling)
                 I do.
 
                                HENRY
                      (handing her a drink)
                 Outside of that news, what's on your mind.
 
                                NIKKI
                 I want a favor.
 
                                HENRY
                 Uh - huh..
 
                                NIKKI
                      (producing a bathrobe cord)
                 I want to tie your hands behind your back.
 
                                HENRY
                      (in a sudden temper)
                 Oh, for - Look, you asked me in here - I
                 didn't break down the door - why make a
                 production of -
 
                                NIKKI
                 Please, Pat.  I said it was a favor...
 
                                HENRY
                      (grudgingly)
                 All right, then.  But no practical jokes.
                 Promise?
 
                                NIKKI
                 I promise.
                      (indicating chair)
                 Here.  Sit here.  And put your hands around
                 the back.
 
                                HENRY
                      (obeying)
                 The Secretary of Defense will never
                 understand this.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (as she ties)
                 It's all very simple.  First there's a
                 boogyman in a cake of ice down in the cellar.
                 I've got a small case of jumps, and I
                 want company.
 
                                HENRY
                 Is this the way you usually entertain
                 your company?
 
                                NIKKI
                      (she has finished tying his hands)
                 How about a drink.
 
                                HENRY
                 I'd love it.  And a long straw, please.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (picking up a glass and holding it
                       for Henry while he drinks)
                 Second, I want you to know that out on the
                 ice today, I noticed the way you jumped
                 in between me and the exlosion...
 
                                HENRY
                      (patiently)
                 Could we get to the point?  Why am I tied up?
 
                                NIKKI
                 Because I want to tell you how much I admire
                 you without getting fingerprints all over
                 my clavicle.
 
                                HENRY
                      (sourly)
                 Thanks for the compliment.  Both of them.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Another drink?
 
                                HENRY
                 After you.
 
                                NIKKI
                 I'm going to have a straight one.  But don't
                 get your hopes up.  Liquor doesn't make me
                 amorous.
 
                                HENRY
                      (as she tosses off a drink)
                 It ought to.  Nothing else does.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (eyeing him steadily)
                 I liked the way you handled yourself today,
                 Pat.  And I liked the way you stood up to all
                 the big wigs, and refused to let them play
                 around with the - with the thing.
 
                                HENRY
                 You like everything about me, but me, is
                 that it?
 
                                NIKKI
                 No.  I like you, too.  In fact, I'm going
                 to kiss you.
 
                                HENRY
                 Untie me, honey.
 
                                NIKKI
                 No.  I'm going to kiss you, not wrestle you.
 
                                HENRY
                      (muttering)
                 Talk about Japanese tortures -
 
       Nikki kisses him briefly and precisely.
 
                                NIKKI
                 That was very nice.
 
                                HENRY
                 Was it?
 
                                NIKKI
                 Very.
                      (she pours herself another drink)
                 See what a good time we can have when
                 you're forced to behave yourself.
 
                                HENRY
                 Nikki, what you don't know about making
                 love would populate the whole interior
                 of Australia.
 
                                NIKKI
                 I'll learn.  When I'm good and ready.
                      (giggling)
                 They say it comes naturally.
 
                                HENRY
                 Untie me now?
 
                                NIKKI
                 Not on your life.
                      (she kisses him again)
                 Admit it, Pat.  This was a great idea.
                 Look at you - sitting talking to me like a
                 civilized man instead of grabbing around
                 like a throwback.  Why, if you weren't tied
                 up, I wouldn't have dared tell you how
                 much I liked you...
 
                                HENRY
                      (producing a cigarette)
                 Got a light?
 
                                NIKKI
                      (automatically striking a match
                       and lighting his cigarette)
                 You see, your trouble is you don't know
                 anything about women.  You have no - no
                 technique.  What a woman likes is to -
 
       She stops and stares at Henry's hands, which are resting
       quietly in his lap.
 
                                HENRY
                 Among other things you don't know is
                 how to tie a knot.
                      (he stands up and grins at her)
                 It's very likely because the only knots
                 you have on your mind are marital ones.
                 Good-night, Miss Nicholson.
 
       He goes out.
 
                                               DISSOLVE
 
 
23     INT. STOREROOM
 
       A faint light from the underground hallway comes through
       a transom.  Barnes enters.  The electric blanket
       discarded by Ken lies on a nearby packing case.  It is
       plugged into the electric light socket, hence no light
       in the room.  Barnes snaps on his flashlight and gets a
       bottle of whiskey out of another case, opens it, and
       takes a long swig.  He leans over and plugs his flying
       suit into the other half of the double-socket shared
       by the electric blanket's plug.  He takes another drink
       and, sitting in the semi-dark, starts whistling
       "Ragtime Cowboy Joe."
 
       Suddenly he stops whistling and laughs.
 
                                BARNES
                      (self-mocking)
                 Whistling in the dark, aren't you,
                 Barnes?..
 
       He lifts the whiskey bottle again, then sits staring
       toward the ice-encased mummy.
 
                                BARNES (cont'd)
                      (suddenly)
                 All right, let's ses what you look
                 like, sonny boy -
 
            He switches on his flashlight, and
            centers its beam on the ice-block.
            As Ericson said, the ice is now almost
            transparent.  Through it, only
            partially distorted, can be seen an
            unearthly horror.  It has a bulbous
            head, a tiny suck-hole for a mouth,
            multiple eyes, no ears.  Its arms
            are extra-long, ending in thorny
            clusters, rather than hands.  It
            stares malevolently through the ice.
 
            Barnes lets out a grunt of dismay,
            and turns the flashlight away.
 
                                BARNES
                 Whew!
 
            He drinks again, and then starts
            making himself comfortable.  He
            uses a bag of flour for a pillow,
            and prepares to stretch out on
            the floor.  Abruptly he shines
            the flashlight on the ice again.
 
                                BARNES
                      (angrily)
                 Quit staring at me!
 
            He sees the blanket lying on the
            nearby packing case.  He picks
            it up, and throws it over the
            ice-cake.
 
                                BARNES
                 I could go nuts looking at you...
 
            He lies down, puts his head on
            the flour sack and taking a
            magazine from his pocket prepares
            to read.  The camera moves to
            the electric blanket now covering
            the ice-cake, then follows the
            electric connection down to the
            indicator affixed to the cord.
            The indicator hand points to the
            "full on" position.
 
            After a moment, the camera
            moves back to the floor beneath
            the ice block.  A slow dripping
            has commenced.  The sounds of
            the rising storm outside obscure
            the pit-pat of the drops hitting
            the floor.  A small puddle starts
            to form.
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
24     THE PUDDLE
 
       It is now a large puddle, very large.
 
       The camera pans across the wet floor, and discovers the
       puddle is close to Barnes' legs.
 
 
25     CLOSE SHOT - BARNES
 
       He is having difficulty reading.  His flashlight has
       started to wane.  He snaps it on and off, experimentally.
       The battery is nearly dead.  Barnes aims it at the
       printed page once more, then decides it is useless for
       the time being.  He snaps it off, and stretches himself
       out more comfortably.
 
       A splinter of light from the hallway outside still
       illuminates the scene.
 
 
26     CLOSE SHOT OF PUDDLE
 
       It continues to grow.  The howl of the storm outside
       does not lessen.
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
27     STAIRWELL OUTSIDE STOREROOM
 
       The form of a sled dog appears.  It stands poised at the
       top of the steps for an instant, pointing eagerly at the
       storeroom window.  It is joined by three or four more
       sled dogs.  They start to bark angrily, their snouts
       still aimed at the storeroom window.  They run down the
       stairwell and press their muzzle against the storeroom
       door.
 
 
28     INTERIOR STOREROOM
       CLOSE SHOT OF BARNES
 
       He is sleeping.  The barking and eager whining of the
       dogs can now be heard over the storm noises outside.
       The CAMERA PANS down to Barnes' legs.  The puddle has
       reached them, and, as we look, they stir slightly,
       causing a little splatter of water.  Barnes abruptly
       sits up into the picture.
 
                                BARNES
                      (staring into
                       the darkness
                       at his feet)
                 What the --
 
            At this moment, a moving shadow falls
            across his face.  He looks up quickly.
            An expression of pure terror appears
            on his face.  He screams eerily, springs
            to his feet, and jerks out his revolver.
            He fires six times, then, still screaming,
            jumps for the storeroom door, the cord from
            his flying suit snapping out of the fixture
            and trailing behind him.  He yanks open
            the door and runs into the corridor.
 
 
29     INT. CORRIDOR
 
       Barnes races down the corridor, yelling at the top of
       his lungs!
 
                                BARNES
                 It's alive!  It's alive!  It's alive!
 
 
30     INT. MAIN CORRIDOR
 
       As Barnes appears, still yelling, doors have begun to
       pop open.  Captain Henry, pyjama-clad, gun in hand,
       comes running out of his room and grabs Barnes.
 
       The other inmates, in various stages of undress, tumble
       out into the hallway only minutes later.  Barnes
       continues to shriek incoherently.
 
                                HENRY
                      (shaking Barnes)
                 Shut up!  Cut it out!
                      (he slaps Barnes, who
                       stops screaming, and
                       stands sobbing with terror)
                 Now!  What is it?  What happened?
 
                                BARNES
                      (almost in shock)
                 It - it - it came after me!
                 It's alive, I tell you!
 
                                HENRY
                      (sharply)
                 Did you fire those shots?
 
                                BARNES
                      (staring past him)
                 I shot it - six times - it kept
                 on coming at me.
 
                                HENRY
                      (releasing Barnes and
                       wheeling to Dykes,
                       Ericson and MacAuliff)
                 Sounds like some joker's loose.
                 Come on.  Bring your guns.
 
            He starts for the storeroom,
            Eddie, Ken, and Mac following.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (to Mrs. Chapman,
                       indicating Barnes)
                 Esther, better give this lad a
                 sedative.  I'll be right back.
 
            He starts up the hall.  Carrington
            appears in his doorway.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (joining Chapman)
                 Did I hear right?  The boy said
                 it was alive?
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (nodding)
                 Probably had a bad dream.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (calling after
                       Carrington)
                 Wait for me, Arthur.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 You stay here, Nikki.
                      (he stops and faces
                       the group in the
                       corridor)
                 I'd appreciate it if you'd all
                 wait in the living room until
                 we can check this nightmare.
                 Thanks.
 
            He continues down the corridor,
            Chapman following.
 
 
31     INT. STOREROOM.
 
       Henry leads the way into the room.  He snaps on a light,
       and stands staring at the electric blanket in the puddle
       of water.
 
                                HENRY
                      (blankly)
                 Gone -
 
                                DYKES
                 Those double-domes!  They
                 stole it.
 
                                ERICSON
                 No.  The kid said it was alive!
                 I knew it - all the time I was
                 here - I could feel it!
 
                                DYKES
                 Nuts!  How'd it get out of the ice?
 
            For answer, Pat indicates the
            electric blanket.
 
                                HENRY
                 Somebody threw a hot blanket on it.
 
                                DYKES
                 I know who.  Those six-year old
                 Einsteins, that's who.
 
            Carrington and Chapman have
            appeared in the doorway.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 What did we do, Lieutenant?
 
                                DYKES
                      (furiously)
                 Swiped the freak.  Hustled it
                 off somewhere to take it apart,
                 that's what!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I assure you, Lieutenant --
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (suddenly)
                 Sh - h.  Listen!
 
            All heads are turned toward the
            open door.  Over the whine of
            the wind they hear a chorus of
            savage barking and growling.
 
                                HENRY
                 The sled dogs -
 
                                ERICSON
                 He's out there -
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 They'll tear him to pieces!
 
            Abruptly, Carrington brushes
            through the group, and darts
            out into the howling night.
            He is clad only in his pajamas
            and bathrobe.
 
                                DYKES
                 Doctor!  Stop!
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 Arthur - are you mad!
 
            Henry curses under his breath
            and charges in pursuit.  Locating
            Carrington with his flashlight,
            he brings him down with a flying
            tackle.  Carrington struggles to
            escape Henry's grasp, but Henry
            succeeds in leading him back
            into the storeroom.  The storm
            noises have made their exclamations
            inaudible.
 
                                HENRY
                      (panting)
                 Mac - get flying suits - hurry -
 
            MacAuliff runs out.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (also winded)
                 If you please - Captain - you
                 may release me now -
 
                                HENRY
                      (doing so)
                 That was a pretty stupid move -
                 for a genius.
 
                                DYKES
                 You'd have been frozen to death
                 in five minutes!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (apologetically)
                 Too much zeal, I'm afraid.
                 Forgive me, gentlemen.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (peering into
                       the night)
                 Over there - I see something!
 
                                HENRY
                 Put out the light.
 
            Dykes snaps off the storeroom
            light.  The four men gaze
            intently into the dark night.
            Henry turns on his flashlight.
            Skeely enters the storeroom.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (excitedly)
                 Where is it?  Is it really alive?
                 Can it talk?  Who else saw it
                 beside Barnes?  What are you doing?
                 Is it out there?  Speak to me,
                 somebody!
 
                                HENRY
                 Shut up.
                      (he listens and
                       looks for
                       another moment)
                 They're still barking.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (speaking through
                       numb lips - his
                       voice shivery)
                 If only the dogs follow it.
                 We'll never find it otherwise.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (a howl of dismay)
                 Don't tell me you've lost it -
                 you bungling army boob.  This
                 is worse than Pearl Harbor!
 
                      MacAuliff enters, carrying
                      flight suits.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Here you are, Pat.
 
                                HENRY
                 Grab one, Eddie.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 May I have one, Captain?
 
                                SKEELY
                 Me, too!
 
                                HENRY
                      (dressing hurriedly)
                 Army personnel only.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (through his teeth)
                 Wait till you see what I write
                 about you!  You'll shoot yourself!
 
                                HENRY
                      (zipping his suit up)
                 Snap it up, boys.
 
                      He grabs his flashlight, and
                      runs out into the storm.
                      MacAuliff and Dykes follow
                      a second later.  Skeely,
                      Carrington, and Chapman
                      remain staring after them.
 
 
32     EXT. STOREHOUSE
 
       The army officers, leaning against the iron wind, grope
       their way toward the barking dogs.  Their flashlights are
       almost useless in the snow flurries raised by the gale.
       They stop and confer for a second, their words carrying
       no further than the ear they are shouted into.  Henry
       points with his flashlight, and the trio alters course
       accordingly.
 
       Suddenly a flashlight beam picks up some moving forms.
       All three flashlights center on the activity, but snow
       flurries continue to intervene.  Dimly, a struggle can
       be discerned.
 
       The officers move toward it.  A sudden increase in the
       wind knocks them down.  They continue toward the barking
       and struggling, crawling on their hands and knees.
 
 
33     MEDIUM SHOT OF DOG PACK FROM HENRY'S POINT OF VIEW
 
       The dogs are tearing at a figure in their midst.  A sheet
       of flying snow blots out the scene.  When it reappears,
       the figure is gone.
 
       Henry, MacAuliff, and Dykes crawl into the scene.  Two
       dogs lie dead in the snow.  A third is wounded so
       hideously that Dykes shoots it.
 
       Henry signals his pals to pick up the dead dogs.  They
       each take one.
 
       Henry stops and examines the ground.  He picks up two
       objects, looks around, then starts back to the camp.
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
34     INT. DR. CARRINGTON'S LABORATORY
 
       It is crowded with nearly all the members of the
       expedition.  The scientists are ranged around
       Carrington's table.  The others stand behind him.
 
       Carrington is bent over the table.  Captain Henry,
       MacAuliff and Eddie are immediately around him.
 
       A bright beam of light is focused on the table center,
       hidden from our eyes as we come on the scene.
 
       The crowd around the table is silent and tense, as at
       some overwhelming dramatic performance.
 
       Nikki stands beside the doctor.  She is dressed in
       pajamas and a woollen robe.  All the others in the
       laboratory are also hastily dressed, some in bath robes
       and slippers, some in sweaters and work pants.
 
       Skeely's large bulk is crowded behind Captain Henry,
       peering over his shoulder.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (as he works)
                 Can you describe what you saw,
                 Captain?
 
                                HENRY
                      (quietly)
                 The dogs had him down, tearing
                 at him.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 I saw him get up, with three dogs
                 on his throat.
 
                                HENRY
                 The cold's blinding.  I couldn't
                 make out the action.  But when we
                 got there two of the dogs were
                 dead.
 
                                EDDIE
                 They looked like they'd been through
                 a chopper.  Mince meat!
 
                                HENRY
                 I found the hand under one of them.
                 They must have torn it off.
 
                                SKEELY
                 How could dogs tear off a hand?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (softly)
                 This kind of a hand.
 
                      He is bent over the object
                      on the table, looking at it
                      through a powerful lens.
 
 
35     TABLE TOP
 
       On it lies a hand and part of a forearm.  The hand
       has ten stringy looking fingers, twice the human
       length.  They are stiffened and resemble a slightly
       arced set of thin knives more than fingers.
 
                                OLSON
                 Sharp as razors, aren't they?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (studying the
                       knife fingers)
                 Yes - a sort of chitinous
                 substance.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (tensely)
                 Speak English - will you!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Something between a beetle's
                 back and a rose thorn.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Thorn fingered, eh?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (trying to bend
                       one of them)
                 Amazingly strong.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 They may be frozen.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I don't think so.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Well, we know one fact about him.
                 He's dead now.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 What is your opinion, Captain?
 
                                HENRY
                 I don't know. He stayed alive in a
                 block of ice for twenty-four hours.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 After I'd sunk a pick into his skull.
 
                                HENRY
                 And he got up - with twelve dogs
                 on him.
 
                                OLSON
                      (bending over
                       the table)
                 That's blood on the arm, isn't it,
                 Arthur?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Yes - but not his blood.
 
                                OLSON
                 From the dogs?
 
                      Carrington has been working
                      on the arm with a scalpel.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 There's no blood in the arm.  No
                 animal tissue.  Have a look at this
                 under the microscope, George.
 
                      He hands a bit of material to
                      Dr. Auerback, who adjusts it
                      under a microscope.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (his voice soft as
                       he continues his
                       examination)
                 I doubt very much if it is dead.
                 I doubt if it can die - as we
                 understand dying.
 
                                SKEELY
                 It's bound to freeze to death outside.
 
                                EDDIE
                 It got along all right in a block
                 of ice - for twenty-four hours.
 
                                AUERBACK
                      (from the microscope)
                 No arterial structure indicated,
                 Arthur.  No nerve endings visible.
                 Porous, unconnected cellular
                 growth.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I imagined that.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Sounds like you're trying to describe
                 a vegetable, doctor.
 
                                AUERBACK
                 I am.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (hunched over the hand,
                       his eye peering through
                       his lens)
                 Are you getting all this, Nikki?
 
                                NIKKI
                      (who has been writing
                       in her pad)
                 Yes, doctor.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 That's why the bullets fired into
                 it by Corporal Barnes had no
                 effect.  They merely punchcd a few
                 holes into some vegetable matter.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 What about the green stuff I saw
                 ooze out of its head?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 There is some of it in the hand.
                 I think we will find it has a
                 sugar base.
 
                                HENRY
                 Like - plant sap?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Yes.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (excitedly)
                 You mean - its some kind of a
                 super carrot, doctor?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 A carrot that can construct a
                 ship beyond our terrestrial
                 intelligence, of materials we
                 have not yet created - and guide
                 it sixty million miles or more
                 through space.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 But you don't think it has any
                 feelings, eh?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 It has an intelligence beyond ours -
                 and possibly feelings equally
                 refined.
 
                                HENRY
                      (softly)
                 A vegetable with a brain -
 
                                SKEELY
                 An intellectual carrot!  The mind
                 boggles!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 It shouldn't.  Imagine how strange it
                 would have seemed in the pliocene age
                 to forecast that worms, fish, and
                 lizards that crawled over the earth
                 were going to evolve - into us.  On
                 the planet from which our visitor
                 came, vegetable life underwent an
                 evolution similar to that of our own
                 animal life, which would explain the
                 superiority of its brain.  Its
                 development was not handicapped by
                 emotional or sexual factors.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Dr. Carrington, you're a man who's
                 won the Nobel prize.  You've received
                 every kind of international kudos a
                 scientist can attain.  If you were
                 for sale I could get a million bucks
                 for you from any foreign government.
                 I am not, therefor, I going to stick
                 my neck out and say that you are
                 stuffed absolutely clean full of
                 wild blueberry muffins, but I
                 promise you that my readers are going
                 to think so.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (smiling)
                 Not for long, Mr. Skeely.  In fact, not
                 even for a moment if they happen to know
                 anything about the flora of their own
                 planet.
 
                                SKEELY
                 You mean there are vegetables right
                 here on earth that -- that can think?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 A certain kind of thinking, yes.
                 Did you ever hear of the Telegraph
                 Vine?  Or the Acanthus Century Plant?
 
                                SKEELY
                 Not recently.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 The Century plant catches mice, bats,
                 squirrels -- any mammals small enough
                 to evade its privacy.  It lures them
                 with a bait of sweet syrup then it
                 closes like a fist and feeds on the
                 corpse of its catch.  It is only a
                 plant but its brain can obviously
                 outwit a species far above it in
                 the scale of minds as we measure
                 them.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (scribbling)
                 Thanks, doctor.  And what's a
                 Telegraph Vine?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 A vine that has proven beyond doubt
                 that it can signal to other vines
                 of its species twenty or one
                 hundred miles away.  If an insect
                 migration, for instance, is moving
                 in a certain direction, it will
                 devour the first vine but the second
                 one, having been warned, will have
                 altered its chemical structure
                 so that the insects find it inedible.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (still
                       scribbling)
                 That's one for Ripley.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (smiling)
                 There are hundreds of other examples.
                 No, Mr. Skeely, intelligence in
                 vegetable and plants is an old
                 story on this planet of ours.  Older
                 even than the animal arrogance
                 that has overlooked it.
                      (to Auerbach)
                 May I have your scalpel, George?
                      (Auerback hands
                       Carrington a
                       surgical knife)
                 The palm seems soft.
                      (he cuts it open)
 
                                OLSON
                      (looking)
                 Seed pods.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Yes - the neat and unconfused
                 reproductive technique of
                 vegetation.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 No pain or pleasure as we know
                 them.
 
                                HENRY
                 No heart.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 None.  Our superior in every way.
 
                                LAURENZ
                 The absence of ears of the
                 creature might indicate that it
                 has a hearing system superior
                 to ours.
 
                                REDDING
                 Or that it is deaf.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 It probably neither hears nor
                 sees as we do - but receives
                 magnetic impressions.
 
                                VOORHESS
                 We cen safely presume that the
                 planet on which it lived is
                 colder than ours and that its
                 atmosphere is too thin to conduct
                 sound waves.
 
                                LAURENZ
                 Or that there is any oxygen in
                 its air content - a planet would
                 need none.
 
                                REDDING
                 It's amazing how it was able to
                 adjust itself to the vitally
                 altered conditions of earth -
                 and stay alive.
 
                                LAURENZ
                 It's mysteries will be explained
                 when we - communicate with it.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (quietly)
                 Perhaps - before.
 
       He looks at the seeds in his hands.
 
                                LAURENZ
                 You think those seeds are alive?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (quietly)
                 That would be - too strange,
                 don't you think?
 
       He frowns at Laurenz.
 
                                LAURENZ
                      (quickly)
                 Absolutely.  There are certain
                 things which are - impossible.
 
                                HENRY
                 I think we're overlooking
                 something.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 What is that, Captain?
 
                                HENRY
                 What - it's doing.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Probably looking for another
                 block of ice to hide in.  A
                 vegetable would head for cold
                 storage...instinctively.  Keep
                 it from rotting.
 
                                HENRY
                 I don't think so.  There's no
                 reason for it to stay out in
                 that storm if it can move.  And
                 I saw it move.
 
                                VOORHEES
                 It ran out into the cold.  I
                 think our surmise that it requires
                 a cold temperature is correct.
 
                                LAURENZ
                 Obviously.  That's why the saucer
                 tried to land in our Polar regions.
                 They corresponded to the conditions
                 of its own planet.
 
                                HENRY
                 There might be another reason.
                 Its passengers could have wanted
                 to keep their arrival secret.
 
                                EDDIE
                 What's on your mind, Pat?
 
                                HENRY
                 I have an idea it's inside the
                 camp.  It headed into the storm
                 because it smelled the dogs and
                 was hungry.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (staring)
                 Inside the camp!  Gentlemen -
                 what I would give for an interview!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I don't think it eats, Captain.
                 There is no evidence of any animal
                 digestive system.
 
                                HENRY
                 If it doesn't eat, it does
                 something.
                      (to the group)
                 I'd like a half dozen men to go
                 along with Lt. Dykes and me.  We
                 don't need guns.  Knives, clubs
                 and axes will be better.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I grant you it may have returned
                 to the camp - and hid itself on the
                 premises, Captain.  But there's no
                 reason to go after it - like an
                 enemy.
 
                                HENRY
                 It didn't look friendly - in the
                 snow outside, doctor.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (softly)
                 It's a stranger in a strange land
                 - with strange - unearthly features
                 and attributes.  The only crimes
                 involved are those that man and
                 nature have committed against it.
                 It crashed in an air ship, was
                 frozen in the ice, had its head
                 split open by a pick, and was
                 attacked by a pack of fierce dogs.
                 I see no reason to give it a bad
                 character, Captain.
 
                                HENRY
                      (grimly)
                 It went after the dogs.  I'm in
                 charge of the search, doctor.
                 And I'm going to look for it,
                 my way.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (his voice rising)
                 It would be criminal vandalism
                 to injure the visitor further.
                 We must find it - and treat it
                 as our superior whose brain -
                 if we can communicate with it -
                 is full of unique and overwhelming
                 knowledge.  We must -
                      (he breaks off and stares at
                       the table)
 
                                SKEELY
                      (his eyes on the
                       table)
                 Holy Heaven!  It's moving!
 
                                EDDIE
                 It's alive - look out!
 
                      We see the hand moving on
                      the table.  Its knife fingers
                      flex and unflex.  The sliced
                      palm tightens into a fist and
                      opens again.  Some of the
                      watchers step away from the
                      teble, a terror in them.
                      Carrington remains bent over
                      the hand.  Captain Henry
                      stays beside him.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (softly, as the
                       hand moves)
                 Nikki -
 
                                NIKKI
                      (faintly)
                 Yes, doctor -
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (dictating)
                 At two forty-five the hand became
                 alive.  The temperature of the
                 forearm showed a twenty degrees rise.
 
                      He is studying a thermometer removed
                      from the arm as he dictates.  There
                      is a hush.  The only sound is that
                      made by the knife fingers beating
                      on the table.  During the hush,
                      Carrington takes the surgical scalpel
                      and cuts his thumb.  He holds the
                      bleading thumb over the moving hand.
                      His blood drops on the forearm.  The
                      hand's activity is increased.  Its
                      fingers move more quickly as they
                      beat on the table top.
                      Carrington continues his dictating.
 
                 I believe the activity due to the fact that
                 the organism when it's temperature rose was
                 able to ingest the nourishment provided by the
                 canine blood with which it was covered...
 
 
36     CORRIDOR LEADING FROM KITCHEN
 
       Six or seven supply rooms open on this corridor.  A
       searching party led by Captain Henry is in the process
       of examining these rooms.
 
       Henry carries a Geiger counter with which he scans each
       door before opening it and sweeping it with his flashlight.
 
       Carrington, MacAuliff, Dykes, Laurenz, Voorhees, Stone
       and Chapman comprise the rest of the searching party.
       With the exception of Carrington and Skeely, who are
       unarmed, they carry an assortment of ice-axes, iron rods,
       shovels and other improvised weapons.  Skeely carries
       a camera.
 
                                STONE
                      (as Henry searches)
                 You sure you know how to use that
                 camera, Skeely?
 
                                SKEELY
                 I ran one of these things on Iwo
                 Jima.  Never got out of focus once,
                 during the entire bombardment.
                      (he calls)
                 Hey, Captain -
 
                                HENRY
                 What do you want?
 
                                SKEELY
                 If we catch up with our pal I
                 want a couple of hundred feet of
                 film...before anyone starts making
                 a salad out of him.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (a touch sharply)
                 No one has any intention of
                 injuring him, Mr. Skeely.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 And no chance of finding him I'd
                 say.  He'd never hide in the camp -
                 not after the reception Barnes gave
                 him.
 
                      Henry has completed his inspection
                      of the supply rooms.
 
                                HENRY
                 No dice in this end.  Come on.
 
                      He leads the way.

37     INTERIOR RADIO ROOM
 
       A short corridor leads to a windowless chamber that
       houses ths camp's generators.  The party with Henry and
       his Geiger counter in the van, crosses the radio room.
 
                      Hendrix looks up from his
                      telegraphy.
 
                                HENDRIX
                 Looks like a lynching bee.  What's
                 up?
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (kidding)
                 We heard you got the Mars man
                 hidden back there.
 
                                HENDRIX
                      (in alarm)
                 I what!  You mean it's - it's -
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 Mr. MacAuliff is being amusing.
 
                                HENDRIX
                 I don't want any part of that
                 thing.  In fact, I'd like to go
                 home.
 
 
38     INTERIOR GENERATING ROOM
 
       Henry's flashlight probes its corners.
 
                                HENRY'S VOICE
                 Nothing.

39     A SHADOWY HALLWAY
 
       Thw party moves along.  As it reaches a doorway, Henry's
       geiger counter begins to click.
 
                                HENRY
                 Hold it!
 
                      He moves toward the doorway.
                      The clicking of the counter
                      increases.
 
                                HENRY
                 It's in there!  Eddie - Mac -
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (with a small chuckle)
                 No, Captain.  That's the mineralogy
                 lab.  We've got radioactive isotopes
                 in there.
 
                                CHAPMAN

                 Let's check it anyway.
 
                      Dykes and MacAuliff stand beside
                      him as he pushes open the door
                      and snaps on the light.
 
 
40     INTERIOR MINERALOGY LAB
 
       Save for the scientific paraphenalia that clutters it,
       it is empty.  Henry switches off the light.

       The party has halted by a closed door at the end of
       the hallway.

                      (trying the door)
                 It's locked.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 I'm sorry - I forgot.  I'll get
                 the key.
 
                      He hurries away.
 
                                HENRY
                 Nothing else was locked up.
                 What's in here?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 The greenhouse.  We have to keep it
                 locked.  Ths Eskimos have a weakness
                 for our strawberries.

                 Shut up a minute!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (quietly)
                 What is it?
 
                                DYKES
                      (his ear at the door)
                 There's something moving inside.
 
       There is a silence as everyone listens intently.
       Carrington puts his ear to the door.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (disappointed)
                 Yes, I hear it.  It's the ventilator.
                 The fan needs oiling.
 
       The group relaxes.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (bitterly)
                 We've been through every crevice of the
                 camp.  If it's not in there, we're
                 cooked.  Just think - we've lost a
                 flying saucer and a man from Mars
                 all in one day.  What a bunch of
                 butterfingers!
 
       Chapman enters.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (proffering the key)
                 Here you are, Captain.
 
       Henry takes the key and opens the door.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (ruminatively, as Henry
                       is opening the door)
                 I wonder what they would have
                 done to Columbus if he'd discovered
                 America, and then lost it.
 
       Henry opens the door slowly.  He aims his flashlight
       and snaps it on.
 
 
42     INT. GREENHOUSE
 
       Henry's flashlight illumines the greenhouse for several
       moments, playing over its plants and bushes.  Henry
       switches on the artificial sunlight arcs.  A queer glow
       suffuses the greenery.  Henry enters, the others follow.
 
       They stand staring into the corners of the large room.
       It is empty and silent.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 It's empty.
 
                                HENRY
                 Maybe.
 
       He starts forward to examine the spaces concealed by
       the shrubbery.  Skeely and Carrington move with him.
 
                                HENRY
                      (stopping)
                 Stay here, please.  Near the door.
 
                                SKEELY
                 My, you're big and brave.  What are
                 you going to do, catch him all alone?
 
                                HENRY
                 I'm still waiting to see if he wants
                 to catch me.  Eddie - Mac - come along.
 
       The soldier trio makes a round of the hothouse.  The
       others wait.
 
 
43     CLOSE SHOT OF CARRINGTON
 
       He is watching the moving flyers.  Suddenly he sees
       something that brings a glint of excitement to his eye.
       He starts to speak, then reconsiders and changes the
       incipient remark into a cough.
 
 
44     MEDIUM SHOT GROUP AT DOOR
 
                                VOORHEES
                      (closest to Carrington)
                 What's that, Arthur?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Nothing.  I just noticed.  The
                 Mendelson molds are vitiated.  We
                 mustn't neglect them.
 
       Voorhees and Laurenz look at Carrington curiously.  He
       shakes his head imperceptibly.  They refrain from
       comment.
 
       Henry and his colleagues complete their round of the
       greenhouse.
 
                                HENRY
                 Well, that's it, I guess.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Yes, and isn't it dandy.  We're
                 certainly going to be a famous group.
                 Like the Donner Party.
 
                                HENRY
                      (ignoring him)
                 Dr. Chapman was right.  Our pal is
                 probably holed up in a snowbank.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (nodding)
                 After all, he's lost a hand and had
                 six bullet holes shot in him.  Animal,
                 vegetable or mineral, he must need a
                 rest.
 
       The others laugh.  Their mood is much lighter now,
       except for Skeely, who stares morosely at the floor.
 
                                HENRY
                 We'll start searching outside as
                 soon as it's light.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 We'd better do it in relays.  A
                 half hour is about all you can
                 stand in that cold now.
 
                                HENRY
                 Good idea.  Report to Lt. Dykes
                 and he'll arrange a scedule for you.
                      (He reaches for the
                       light switch)
                 Coming, gentlemen?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (smoothly)
                 Not right away, Captain.  Doctor
                 Voorhees and Professor Laurenz and
                 I want to do some emergency work on
                 those molds.  Goodnight, gentlemen.
 
       There is a chorus of goodnights as the others move out.
       Henry stands looking at Carrington for a moment.
 
                                HENRY
                 Kind of late to start work now,
                 isn't it?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (laughing)
                 It's easy to see you're no scientist,
                 Captain Henry.  Work is what we do
                 when we want to relax.
 
       Henry continues to study him for another moment.
 
                                HENRY
                      (abruptly)
                 I see.  Goodnight.
 
       He goes out.  Carrington quickly closes the door behind
       him.
 
       He bolts it.  Laurenz and Voorhees watch him expectantly.
       Carrington turns and smiles at them brightly.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 The MacCormick molds - look!
 
       He points.  Laurenz and Voorhees regard the plants he
       indicates.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 They're wilted, from cold.
 
                                LAURENZ
                 But it's warm in here.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (grinning happily)
                 Isn't it?  So what do you conclude?
                      (without waiting for an
                       answer he continues)
                 Those molds would be in the direct
                 path of a blast of icy air if that
                 rear door were opened.  Ten or
                 twenty seconds of such an exposure,
                 and they would wilt.  I repeat,
                 gentlemen, what do you conclude?
 
                                VOORHEES
                      (pointing)
                 But that bolt hasn't been pulled.
                 How could the door be opened?
 
       For answer Carrington strides to the rear door.
       Leaving the bolt still in "Shot" position, he turns the
       knob and pulls.  The door opens.
 
       Voorhees and Laurenz move quickly to the door.  The wind
       whistles about them as the three scientists examine the
       bolt.
 
INSERT      CLOSEUP OF BOLT
 
       It has been cleanly severed.
 
                                VOORHEES' VOICE
                 Filed clean through!
 
       BACK TO GROUP.  Carrington closes the door.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (as he does so)
                 Not filed, Andrew.  Cut.
 
                                LAURENZ
                      (excitted)
                 Yes.  Of course.  Those razor-like
                 fingers on the hand!
 
                                VOORHEES
                 But the power - to cut through
                 that steel - like butter -
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (smiling happily)
                 Incredible.  Really incredible.
 
                                LAURENZ
                      (his eyes darting around
                       the greenhouse)
                 Then it's been in here.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (also scanning his
                       surroundings)
                 Beyond a doubt.
 
                                VOORHEES
                 What's that?
 
                                LAURENZ
                 Where?
 
                                VOORHEES
                 Stand here.  See?
                      (he points)
                 The storage bin.  See how the light
                 glistens on it.
 
       Carrington crosses to a two and a half foot storage bin,
       and stares at it.
 
 
45     CLOSE SHOT - STORAGE BIN
 
       Its handle glistens strangely.
 
 
46     BACK TO GROUP
 
       Carrington touches the handle with his forefinger.  It
       is coated with a viscous fluid.  Carrington rubs it
       between his thumb and forefinger, then smells it.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 A smear of sap - from the wounded
                 arm.
                      (indicating the bin)
                 Pull it down, please.
 
       Laurenz and Voorhees take hold of the bin and start to
       lift it to the floor.  It falls from their grasp.
 
                                VOORHEES
                 Look out!
 
       The bin crashes over on its side.  A body topples out
       of it and crashes at their feat.  It is the corpse of a
       dog.
 
       Carrington kneels down and examines it.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (feeling the dog)
                 Not dead over an hour.
                      (to Voorhees)
                 See if there's any congealed blood
                 in the bin, Andrew.
 
                                LAURENZ
                      (as Voorhees inspects
                       the bin)
                 Seems rather shrunken, doesn't it?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Its blood has been drained.
 
                                VOORHEES
                 The bin is clean.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (nodding)
                 Now we know definitely the type of
                 nourishment it requires.
 
                                 LAURENZ
                      (gesturing at the dead dog)
                 Why do you suppose it brought
                 the dog in here?
 
                                 CARRINGTON
                 We must try very hard to find an
                 answer to that question.
 
       His eyes start moving around the greenhouse.
 
                                 VOORHEES
                 Maybe the artificial sunlight
                 attracted -
 
                                 LAURENZ
                      (shaking his head)
                 The light was off.
 
                                 CARRINGTON
                      (tensely)
                 That loam bed - number four.
                 Does it strike you the earth
                 has been disturbed?
 
                                 LAURENZ
                      (eyeing the loam bin)
                 Olson started some lichen there
                 last week.
 
                                 VOORHEES
                 That's right.
 
       The trio moves over to the loam bed.
       Carrington regards the loose earth.
 
                                 CARRINGTON
                      (vibrantly)
                 Gentlemen, our creature will
                 come back here.  Of that I
                 am certain.
 
                                 LAURENZ
                 What do you see, Arthur?
 
                                 CARRINGTON
                 I'd rather not say - yet.  But
                 it will come back.
 
                                 VOORHEES
                 Hadn't we better tell the others?
 
                                 CARRINGTON
                 No.  I think it better if Science,
                 rather than the Army greeted it
                 this time.
                      (to Laurenz)
                 Will you keep watch with me tonight,
                 Andrews?
                      (Laurenz nods.  Carrington
                       turns to Voorhees)
                 Please bring us some sandwiches and
                 coffee.  Tell Doctor Auerback and
                 Doctor Olson what we have found.
                 Ask them to relieve us at eight in
                 the morning.  And ask them, please
                 to confide in no one.
 
       Voorhees nods and departs as we
 
                                              DISSOLVE TO
 
 
47     INT. MAIN ROOM. CAMP
 
       It is eleven-thirty the following morning.  A late
       breakfast is being served in the main living room.
 
       Outside the storm has not abated.  It fills the
       sky, darkening the arctic noon.
 
       Henry and Dykes are eating.  Mrs. Chapman sits
       nearby knitting.
 
                                 DYKES
                      (staring out the window)
                 Look at that, will you?  It'll
                 never let up!  And we could have
                 been in Edmonton - open air
                 cafes.  Moonlit gardens -
 
                                 MRS. CHAPMAN
                      (placidly)
                 Oh, we've had them worse than this.
                 Three weeks is the longest they last.
 
                                 DYKES
                 Three weeks!  We ought to be growing
                 our own fur by that time.
 
       The door opens and MacAuliff, Barnes and Ericson
       come in.
 
                                 HENRY
                 Anything, Mac?
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (removing his outer garments)
                 Not a sign.  We've poked into every
                 snowbank within a mile.
 
                                 ERICSON
                      (grinning)
                 Barnes flushed a Polar bear.
 
                                 BARNES
                      (bitterly)
                 I sure did!
 
                                 DYKES
                      (laughing)
                 Scare you?
 
                                 BARNES
                 Not after I saw it was only a bear.
 
       Hendrix enters from an interior door.  He carries
       a sheaf of messages.
 
                                HENDRIX
                      (bitterly)
                 I want a raise.  Or I'm gonna
                 strike.  Sixteen hours straight
                 receiving without stopping!
 
                                 HENRY
                 Anything for me?
 
                                 HENDRIX
                      (angrily)
                 Just a few million words.  What's the
                 matter with that Fogarty fellow -
                 got epilepsy?
                      (he tosses a bundle of
                       messages on the table)
                 I haven't even had time to eat.
 
       He pours himself a cup of coffee.  Dykes picks
       up the messages.
 
                                 DYKES
                 Some of them are for Skeely.
 
                                 HENRY
                      (eating)
                 Skip them.  Stick to Fogarty.
 
                                 DYKES
                      (scanning the messages, reads
                       from one after another)
                 Fogarty to Henry.  Preserve wreckage
                 of saucer carefully.
                      (he throws the paper down
                       and picks up a second
                       and reads)
                 Same to same.  Preserve corpse
                 of occupant carefully.  Allow no
                 one to touch it until my arrival.

                 Henry.  Why havent you answered?
                 Answer immediately.  Same to same -
                 radio silence unnecessary.
                 Reference message Fogarty to Henry.
                 Acknowledge immediately.  Acknowledge
                 soonest.  Fogarty to Henry.  Awaiting
                 report.  Silence confusing.  Same to
                 same - acknowledge.  Fogarty to
                 Henry.  Acknowledge.
 
                                 HENRY
                 I get the general drift.  He wants
                 to hear from me.
 
       Skeely enters.  He is rumpled, unshaved and still
       sleepy.
 
                                 SKEELY
                 What you got there?
 
                                 HENDRIX
                      (eating toast and gulping
                       coffee)
                 Some stuff for you.
 
                                 SKEELY
                      (diving for the messages)
                 For me?
                      (he stares at them, his voice
                       growing hoarse with
                       excitement)
                 They got part of my story!  It went

                 People in the streets yelling for
                 more news.  Every man, woman and
                 child in the U.S.A. has stopped

                 Lookie, Ez - I've knocked out ten
                 thousand words.  Been typing all
                 night.  Get back and send 'em.
 
                                 HENDRIX
                      (eating)
                 Not me.
 
                                 SKEELY
                      (yelling)
                 Get on that key!
 
                                 HENDRIX
                      (wearily)
                 Afterwards.  I'm going to bed
                 first.
 
                                 SKEELY
                 You can't go to bed.  Listen -
                 I'll split with you.  It's a
                 bonanza!  I'll give you 25
                 percent of the take.
 
                                 HENDRIX
                      (his eating done, wearily)
                 Nothing doing!  I'm out on my feet.
                 And the stuff ain't going through
                 anyway.  Waste motion.
 
                                 SKEELY
                 It'll go through!  You keep send-
                 ing!  Ez, old man, they're mobbing
                 the newspaper offices.  They're
                 hanging out of windows.  This is
                 a world emergency.  You can't desert
                 your post in an emergency - any more
                 than you would if a ship was
                 sinking?
 
                                 HENDRIX
                      (starting to open
                       the door, his back
                       turned to it)
                 A ship is sinking!  And it's me.
 
       As he pulls the door open, we see a tall figure
       leanings against it.  Hendrix, unaware of it,
       continues to open the door as he talks.
 
                                 HENDRIX  (cont'd)
                 I wouldn't stay up another hour for
                 ten thousand dollars a minute.  I'm
                 out on my feet, I tell you.
 
       The tall figure slides in the doorway and comes
       crashing into the room at Hendrix' feet.  It is
       Aligari, the botanist.  His face is covered
       with blood.  He is semi-conscious.  Henry and
       Dykes rush to him.  Henry grabs his wrist and
       feels for his pulse.
 
                                 SKEELY
                 Who - Who's that?
 
                                 MRS. CHAPMAN
                 Dr. Aligari.
                      (to Henry)
                 Is he - dead?
 
                                 HENRY
                 No.
                      (to Barnes)
                 Get Dr. Chapman.
                      (to Mrs. Chapman)
                 Got any smelling salts?
 
                                 MRS. CHAPMAN
                 Right here - in the washroom.
 
       She starts out of the room.
 
                                 HENRY
                 Wait.
                      (to MacAuliff)
                 Go with her, Mac.
 
       MacAuliff follows her out.  Aligari stirs and
       tries to sit up.
 
                                 HENRY
                 Take it easy, Doctor.  Stay where
                 you are.  Can you talk?
 
                                 ALIGARI
                      (with difficulty)
                 In the greenhouse - the thing -
                 Dr. Olson - Auerback.
 
                                 HENRY
                 What happened?
 
                                 ALIGARI
                 I went in - to check the temper-
                 ature - my back was turned - when
                 Olson screamed - When I turned
                 around - the thing - it cut my
                 face - The blood blinded me - I
                 fell down - I must have fainted.
                      (Mrs. Chapman reappears.
                       She hands Henry the salts.
                       He holds them to Aligari's
                       nostrils)
                 Thank you ... When I came to, I
                 saw Olson and Auerback - hanging
                 upside down - Their throats were
                 cut - I crawled out - and came
                 here -
 
       Henry rises swiftly.
 
                                 HENRY
                 Come on, Eddie.  You too, Mac.
                 The rest of you stay here -
                 and stay together.
 
       He runs out.
 
                                 SKEELY
                 I'm coming!  I don't care what
                 you say!
 
       He follows the others.
 
 
48     OUTSIDE GREENHOUSE DOOR.
 
       The door is shut.  Henry, MacAuliff, Dykes and
       Skeely come down the corridor.  They are carrying
       axes and guns.
 
       Henry approaches the door, then stops.  He turns to
       MacAuliff.
 
                                HENRY
                 Mac, round up a detail and post it
                 at the rear door of this hothouse.
                 Don't go in - just take some timber
                 and seal up the doorway!
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Right.
 
                      He runs down the hall.  Almost
                      before Henry has finished
                      speaking, the door behind him
                      has opened with lightning
                      rapidity.  Henry turns with
                      almost equal speed, instantly raising
                      his axe.  The Thing appears for a
                      split second in the doorway, only
                      to be met with a crashing wallop
                      from the flat of Henry's axe.
                      The force of the blow propels
                      the Thing back into the greenhouse.
                      Henry seizes the doorknob and pulls
                      the door shut.  He turns the key
                      in the lock.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Dykes)
                 Get the carpenter - on the double!
 
                      Dykes runs out.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (tensely)
                 We going in now?
 
                                HENRY
                 No.
 
                                SKEELY
                 What about Olson and Auerback?
 
                                HENRY
                      (snapping)
                 Nothing about them!  They're dead.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (producing a camera from
                       his pocket)
                 How about opening the door long enough
                 for me to get one shot - just two seconds.
 
                                HENRY
                 I'll shoot the man who opens this door.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (grimacing)
                 Well, that's a straight answers.  What
                 other plans have you got?
 
                                HENRY
                 If Mac gets to the rear door in time,
                 we're going to keep that thing bottled
                 up in there.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Suppose it starves?
 
                                HENRY
                 I'll let you do my crying for me.
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
49     MEDIUM SHOT AT DOOR OF GREENHOUSE
 
       The carpenter is driving home spikes in a heavy cross
       beam that bars the greenhouse door.  Four similar bars
       have already been installed.
 
       Barnes and Ericson are holding the beam in position as
       the carpenter works.  Skeely has left to resume his
       pestering of Hendrix the telegrapher.
 
       Henry is consulting with Chapman.
 
                                HENRY
                 You're sure there's no other way out?
                 No trapdoor - or windows?
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 None.  Only the front and back doors.
 
                                HENRY
                 The walls solid?
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 Corrigated iron.
 
                                HENRY
                 That thing's radio active.  Could it
                 maybe burn its way out?
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 I'd consider it extremely unlikely, but -
 
                      He pauses.
 
                                HENRY
                 But what?
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 The thing itself is extremely unlikely.
                 According to Doctor Aligari, it has
                 already grown back its arm.
                      (with a sudden emotion)
                 Captain Henry - forgive me.  I don't want
                 to go against your orders but those two
                 men in there were friends of mine.  Close
                 friends, for many years.  Isn't there some
                 way we can get their bodies out?  I can't
                 stand the thought of them hanging there -
                 by their feet - and nothing being done
                 for them!
 
                                HENRY
                 What can be done for them?  Face
                 the facts, Doctor.  They're dead.
                 Their throats were cut and they bled to
                 death.  Upside down, like in a slaughter
                 house.  Our job is to see that nobody else
                 joins them.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (with a shudder)
                 What a way to die.
 
                      Professor Voorhees has come down
                      the corridor.
 
                                VOORHEES
                      (quietly to Chapman)
                 May I have a word with you, Fred?
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (turning to him)
                 Certainly.
 
                                VOORHEES
                 Privately.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 Oh.
                      (to Henry)
                 Excuse me.
 
                      Henry nods.  Chapman
                      accompanies Voorhees a few
                      yards down the corridor.
                      Voorhees starts to whisper.
                      Henry watches them.
 
                                VOORHEES
                      (into Chapman's ear)
                 Come to Carrington's lab as soon as
                 you can - and don't let anyone know.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 Right away.
                      (turning back to Henry)
                 Was there anything else, Captain?
 
                                HENRY
                 Yes.  We're keeping a double guard -
                 outside and in.  Two hour shifts.  I'll
                 need eight volunteers.
 
 
50     INT. DR. CARRINGTON'S LABORATORY
 
       Dr. Carrington is at his desk.  Nikki is beside him,
       note book in hand.
 
       Drs. Chapman, Voorhees, Laurenz and Wilson are in front
       of him.  They are silent and alert as he talks.
 
       Carrington is tense and queerly exuberant.  Exhaustion
       and excitement are in his face.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (softly and tensely)
                 Two of our colleagues have died and a
                 third is dying.  Those are our losses - and
                 the battle has only begun.  There will be
                 more losses.  The creature X is more powerful,
                 more intelligent than us.  We are infants
                 beside him.  He regards us as soft, vulnerable
                 earth worms important only for his nourishment.
                 He has the same attitude toward us as we have
                 toward a field of cabbages.
 
                                LAURENZ
                      (interrupting)
                 You said you had news for us, Arthur.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I have.
                      (he rises and smiles)
                 We are infants, earthworms and also
                 scientists.  We have made gains.
 
                                VOORHEES
                 What have you found out?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (glowing and tense)
                 A new world has come to devour us.  Only
                 science can conquer it.  Our minds, gentlemen -
                 the little muscle that thinks, observes,
                 examines and finds answers.  All other weapons
                 will be powerless.
                      (his eyes close.  Weariness
                      overcomes him.  He mutters)
                 I'm very tired.  It's difficult to eat.
                      (he presses his thumbs into
                      his eyeballs)
                 Will you read my notes, Miss Nicholson?
 
                                LAURENZ
                 You need some rest, Arthur.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (softly)
                 No rest.  Please read -
 
                                NIKKI
                      (reading from her note book)
                 At 9 p.m. I placed the fifteen seeds taken
                 from the severed hand of X in four inches
                 of earth.  I saturated the earth with two
                 units of plasma taken from our blood bank.
 
                      Nikki pauses, her face tense.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Please go on, Nikki.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (continuing to read)
                 The condition of the dog found in the
                 greenhouse indicated that blood was a
                 primal factor in the cultivation of the
                 seeds.  At 2 a.m. the first sprouts
                 appeared through the soil.  I used another
                 two units of plasma.  At 4 a.m. the sprouts
                 began to take on definite forms - and -
 
                      She breaks off, her face
                      strained, her voice faint.
 
                                LAURENZ
                      (tensely)
                 They are still growing!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Five of them - have survived.
 
                      Carrington rises and starts
                      toward a screened in table.
                      The others follow.  Nikki
                      remains motionless at the
                      desk.
 
 
51     SCREENED IN TABLE
 
       A four foot box of earth is on its top.  The men stand
       over it.  Five small sprouts are budding through the soil.
       There is a moment of silence.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (softly)
                 It reproduces itself - like a vegetable!
 
                                WILSON
                      (staring)
                 They're growing!
 
                                LAURENZ
                 Alive!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Yes.  The Geiger counter registered
                 6 point 1 radio activity from them an
                 hour ago.
 
                      He holds the counter over the
                      sprouts.  The men watch its
                      dial.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (reading the dial)
                 Nine point five.
 
                                LAURENZ
                 Thriving -
 
                      The men speak in excited but
                      controlled voices.
 
                                WILSON
                      (awed)
                 Human plants!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (softly)
                 Super human.
 
                                VOORHEES
                      (eagerly)
                 We must nourish them carefully.  My
                 examination of the hand revealed a
                 high glucose content and a chlorophyll
                 base.  I suggest a glucose injection.
 
                                LAURENZ
                 Glucose may be dangerous.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Yes.  I think so.  He's not using glucose
                 in the greenhouse.
 
                                WILSON
                 That's why he killed - for blood.  He's
                 growing seeds there.  What will we do - when
                 these mature?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Study them.
 
                                LAURENZ
                      (quietly)
                 Have you examined the roots, Arthur?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 There are no roots.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 Amazing!  I think we ought to turn the
                 violet rays on it.
 
                                LAURENZ
                      (testing with his fingers)
                 No.  The growth seems strongest where
                 the earth is dampest.  Any light might
                 dry it up.
 
                                VOORHEES
                 How much plasma have we got?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I've moved all the units in here.  Thirty-
                 five.
 
                                LAURENZ
                      (softly)
                 That may be enough.
 
                                WILSON
                      (looking at an instrument
                       beside the earth box)
                 What were you doing with that stethescope,
                 Arthur?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (quietly)
                 Listening to them.
 
                                LAURENZ
                      (looking at the buds through
                       a magnifying glass)
                 There doesn't seem to be any oscillation.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 The sound doesn't come from any oscillation -
                 but from something else.
 
                                VOORHEES
                 An animal sound!  Impossible!
 
                      Wilson puts the stethescope in
                      his ears and holds the end of
                      it over a bud.  The others wait
                      in silence.  We listen with him.
 
                                WILSON
                      (removing the stethescope)
                 Arthur's right.  It's a hunger noise -
                 like an infant.
 
                      Nikki has appeared behind
                      the screen.
 
                                NIKKI
                 May I talk to you, Arthur?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (quietly)
                 Later.  Would you please type up all
                 my notes.
                      (he looks at her intense face
                       and then smiles at her, he
                       turns to the men)
                 Excuse me.
                      (the scientists are bent over
                       the earth box.  They hold the
                       Geiger counter over it and listen
                       to its faint clicking.  Dr.
                       Voorhees listens as did Wilson
                       through the stethescope.  Carrington
                       moves out from behind the screen
                       with Nikki)
                 What is it, Nikki?
 
                                NIKKI
                 I insist that you get some sleep, Arthur.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Later.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (insistent)
                 You can't use your mind - if you're exhausted.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 My mind's still perfectly clear.
 
                                NIKKI
                 It isn't.
                      (he frowns at her)
                 You're not thinking of what's happening in
                 the greenhouse.  You saw what one of them
                 can do!  Well, just imagine if there are a
                 thousand, or a hundred thousand!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I have imagined it.
 
                                NIKKI
                 And you won't do anything?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I'm doing all that can be done, Nikki -
                 discovering its secrets.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (tensely)
                 I know!  And that's quite wonderful.
                 But what if that ship came here not just
                 to visit the earth, but to conquer it!
                 To start growing some kind of a horrible
                 army.  And turn the human race into - into
                 food for it!  And kill the whole world.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (quietly)
                 There are many things threatening to kill
                 our world, Nikki.  New stars and comets
                 shooting through space.  Atmospheric changes.
                 A sudden cooling of the sun.  And even human
                 wars - that may release deadly global gases.
 
                                NIKKI
                 But those are theories, Arthur!  This is an
                 enemy - near us - and -
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (taking her arm)
                 There are no enemies in science - There are
                 only phenomena to study.  We are studying one.
 
                                NIKKI
                 You're not afraid?
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I'd be a traitor to human reason if I allowed
                 my fears to destroy what has come to us - or
                 let anyone else destroy it.
                      (softly)
                 I want you to believe in my way, Nikki - the
                 way of the mind.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (nervously)
                 I've admired you tremendously, Arthur -
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (intensely)
                 Not admiration - Faith.
 
                                NIKKI
                 You have it.
                      (she smiles nervously)
                 I'm so terrified I can barely walk.  I'll
                 - I'll totter off to my room and type your
                 notes.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (softly)
                 Thanks.
 
                      (She starts away)
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
52     INT. NIKKI'S ROOM
 
       She is typing at her desk, her note book propped up in
       front of her.  A sheaf of typewritten pages is beside
       her machine.
 
       The door opens.  Captain Henry enters.
 
                                HENRY
                      (watching her type)
                 Want to take a rest?
 
                                NIKKI
                      (without looking up)
                 Can't.
 
                                HENRY
                 I'll rub your neck.  It'll relax you.
 
                      He comes behind her and
                      massages her neck and
                      shoulders gently.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Please, I can't concentrate - when you
                 do that.
 
                                HENRY
                 Maybe you're concentrating on the wrong
                 thing.
 
                      She finishes the last line of
                      typing, pulls the page out of
                      the machine, puts it on a pile
                      of copy.  She covers the pile
                      with a large book.
 
                                NIKKI
                 I'm bushed.
                      (she smiles at him)
                 That feels good.  Please don't tire yourself.
 
                                HENRY
                      (massaging, and trying
                       to get a look at the
                       copy over her head)
                 Couldn't.
                      (casually)
                 Have there been any accidents up here in the
                 last two months?  Anybody shot, stabbed or
                 had an ulcer removed?
 
                                NIKKI
                      (covering the copy casually
                       with another book)
                 No.  That what-is-it in the greenhouse is
                 our first diversion.
 
                                HENRY
                      (smiling)
                 I brought up thirty-five units of blood
                 plasma two months ago.  What's become of
                 it?
 
                                NIKKI
                 Why nothing.  It's here.
 
                                HENRY
                 I wondered why they're not using it on
                 Dr. Aligari.  They're giving him blood
                 transfusions.  No plasma.  Two live
                 donors.  Any ideas about that?
 
                                NIKKI
                      (moving her neck and
                       shoulders away)
                 Thanks for the massage.  You're really
                 very good at it.
 
                                HENRY
                 It's just a sample.
                      (firmly)
                 Relax your neck muscles.
                      (she does)
                 That's fine.
                      (he starts massaging her
                       shoulders, speaking casually
                       as he does)
                 What's Carrington doing with thirty-five
                 units of plasma, Nikki?
 
                                NIKKI
                 Ask him.
 
                                HENRY
                 I will.
                      (gently)
                 Just close your eyes - and float.  It's
                 good for you.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (wearily)
                 I'm really exhausted.
 
       She closes her eyes, sighs and "floats."  Henry makes a
       quiet sudden move toward the pile of copy she has
       hidden under the two books.  The gesture catches Nikki
       by surprise.  She stares for an instant unable to
       believe his perfidy and then leaps to her feet, full of
       outrage.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Give that back!  It's private.  You're
                 not allowed to - !  Give that back or I'll - !
                 Oh, you're horrible, a cheap, underhanded
                 army spy!
 
       She has flung herself at him, clawing for the papers in
       his hand.  Her physical assault is too violent for
       Henry to ignore.  He puts an end to it by sending a
       short right into her stomach.  She doubles up with a
       groan.
 
                                NIKKI
                 You hit me!
 
                                HENRY
                 Only in the stomach.  Won't leave any marks.
                      (Nikki sinks into her chair,
                       staring at him as he reads
                       the copy.  His voice grows
                       quiet and serious)
                 So that's it!  Holy Ike - five of them!
                      (he looks up from his reading
                       and stares back at her, his
                       voice curt)
                 You deserved that punch!
 
                                NIKKI
                      (softly)
                 I wanted to tell you.  But I couldn't.
                 I gave my word.  I'm glad you - did what
                 you did.  I'm very glad.
                      (she smiles wearily at him)
                 You can finish the massage now - Pat.
 
                                HENRY
                 I've got a few other things to finish
                 first, baby.
 
                      He walks out.
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
53     INT. CARRINGTON'S LABORATORY
 
       The door opens.  Captain Henry, Lt. Dykes, Dr. Redding
       and Dr. Ambrose enter.  They look into a seemingly
       empty room.
 
                                HENRY
                      (calling)
                 Dr. Carrington.
                      (Carrington comes out from behind the
                       screen)
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I'm afraid I'm rather busy right now,
                 Captain.  Might I ask you to -
 
                                HENRY
                      (cutting in)
                 I've learned that you found a dog in
                 the hothouse - bled white by our Visitor.
                 And you didn't report it.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I didn't consider it necessary.
 
                                HENRY
                 No?  But it was necessary to let two
                 friends of yours go in there and get
                 killed!
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (evenly)
                 I did what you would have done.  I
                 put them there as guards.  I was a
                 guard myself.  Their deaths were
                 unavoidable.  Whoever was in there
                 would have been killed.
 
                                HENRY
                 I also understand you're doing a
                 little gardening.
 
                      Carrington remains silent.
                      Voorhees and Laurenz
                      emerge from behind the
                      screen and stand at
                      Carrington's side.
 
                                HENRY
                 You might have notified me - instead
                 of letting me find it out from Miss
                 Nicholson.
                      (Carrington scowls at this
                       bit of news.  Henry adds sharply)
                 Where are they?
 
                      Carrington and his two cohorts
                      are silent.  They stand staring
                      at Ambrose and Redding.  Dykes
                      has stepped behind the screen.
 
                                DYKES
                      (reappearing)
                 This way to the nursery, Pat.
 
                      Henry, Ambrose and Redding
                      step behind the screen.
 
 
54     SCREENED IN TABLE
 
       Captain Henry and Lt. Dykes stare at the box of earth.
       Rigged up over it are four plasma containers out of
       which blood is dripping slowly.
 
       Carrington appears.
 
       Henry points at the plasma containers.
 
                                HENRY
                      (grimly)
                 That's what your late colleagues are
                 doing - in the greenhouse.  This is
                 a distinct improvement.
 
                                AMBROSE
                      (quietly)
                 We have read your notes, Arthur.
                 I think you should have consulted
                 the rest of us.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (coldly)
                 I have all the help I need.
 
                                REDDING
                      (his eyes on the
                       sprouts in the
                       earth box)
                 I consider the situation extremely
                 serious, Dr. Carrington.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (softly)
                 Your opinion has not been asked,
                 Dr. Redding.
 
                                REDDING
                      (quietly)
                 It has - by Captain Henry.  And I've
                 given it to him.  I'll repeat it to
                 you.  We're facing something
                 unpredictably dangerous.  The creature
                 in the green-house is obviously
                 multiplying itself - in this identical
                 fashion.  It will need more blood for
                 its operations.  It will make every
                 effort to obtain what it needs.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 It has been imprisoned and
                 immobilized.
 
                                REDDING
                 We don't know its powers....or its
                 resources.  We can not be sure of
                 our safety - or of something even
                 more important - the world's safety.
                 We have no knowledge of how much it
                 can multiply.  A thousand creatures -
                 or ten thousand of the sort we've seen
                 could -
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (interrupting)
                 I'm not interested in your fantasies,
                 Dr. Redding.
 
                                AMBROSE
                 Redding's right.  The thing has to be
                 destroyed, Arthur, and its progeny
                 along with it.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Never.
 
                                HENRY
                      (ignoring Carrington)
                 What do you think is the best
                 procedure, Dr. Redding?
 
                                REDDING
                 We'll analyze these things in the box
                 first, and see what sort of gas or
                 chemical has the quickest effect on
                 them.  And then use it in the greenhouse.
 
                                AMBROSE
                 A high electric voltage should be
                 able to accomplish what we want.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (coldly)
                 You're talking like a frightened
                 school boy, Dr. Ambrose.
 
                                AMBROSE
                      (angrily)
                 Two men have been killed!  And there's
                 more killing ahead.
 
                                HENRY
                 Electricity sounds good to me.  We'll
                 shoot it into the greenhouse and -
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (interrupting angrily)
                 I forbid - any destruction!
 
                                LAURENZ
                 It would be an outrage!
 
                                VOORHEES
                      (at the same time)
                 A cowardly betrayal of science!
 
                                HENRY
                      (grimly)
                 This isn't science!  This is a
                 military action against an enemy
                 invader.  Go ahead, gentlemen.  Get
                 MacAuliff, Lieutenant.
                      (to Redding)
                 Mr. MacAuliff will be in charge of
                 the electrical operations.
 
       The door opens and the post's radio man, Ezra
       Hendrix enters.
 
                                HENDRIX
                      (excitedly)
                 I got your message through, Dr.
                 Carrington!  And the answers are still
                 coming.  I had to take them in shorthand.
                      (he starts reading)
                 Fogarty to Henry.  Carrington informs
                 me Martian alive.  You are directed to
                 make every effort to keep it alive, and
                 protect it against any injury.  General
                 MacLaren arriving tonight with
                 fourteenth squadron - and full government
                 personnel including Secretary of State.
                 Chief of staff already here.  Under no
                 circumstances take action against
                 Martian until our arrival at post soon
                 as weather permits.  Confirm instantly.
                      (Hendrix looks up)
                 There's one for you, Doctor.  Fogarty
                 to Carrington - give Henry all
                 cooperation needed to insure survival
                 of creature you describe.  Army and
                 science chief regard your captive most
                 important in human history.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 You have your orders, Captain Henry,
                 and I have mine.  I consider them sane
                 and intelligent.
 
                                HENDRIX
                 I got to get back.  That loon
                 Skeely's got a story longer than
                 the Bible he wants me to send.
 
       Henry starts with Hendrix for the door.
 
                                EDDIE
                 What do we do, Pat?
 
                                HENRY
                 We get on that radio and try
                 changing the Army's mind.
 
       He walks out.
 
                                              DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
55     INT. ROOM OCCUPIED BY HENRY AND HIS CREW. 1 A.M.
 
       MacAuliff and Barnes are sleeping on cots.  Captain
       Henry is preparing to lie down.  He goes to the
       window and looks out at the wildly whirling snow.
 
                                HENRY
                      (muttering)
                 That stinkin' wind!
                      (he turns toward
                       one of the cots)
                 You think our plane's still in
                 one piece, Mac?
 
       There is no answer from the sleeping MacAuliff.  The
       door opens and Eddie comes in.  He wears his flying
       suit.  He carries a Kerosene hurricane light.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (wearily)
                 Baby, am I bushed!  That bitchy wind
                 cuts you in half.
                      (he hands Henry
                       the lamp)
                 Mind filling this up?  Burned dry.
                 You'll need it outside. Blacker than
                 Fogarty's heart.
                      (he starts
                       removing his suit
                       as they talk)
                 Anything new?
 
       Henry starts filling the lamp out of a large
       kerosene can.
 
                                HENRY
                      (grimly-quoting)
                 Fogarty to Henry.  Your attitude
                 inviting court martial.  Fogarty
                 to Henry.  Your hysterics are
                 unbecoming to officer - also black
                 mark for entire air corps.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (wearily)
                 That pook head!  He thinks we're
                 running a ministrel show.
                      (he has lain down
                       on the cot)
                 When do I stand guard again?
 
                                HENRY
                 Four hours.
 
                                EDDIE
                      (snuggling
                       into pillow)
                 In that case, excuse me.
                      (he sighs and
                       mutters sleepily)
                 Remember Guadalcanal - those nice
                 warm nights?
 
       Henry has lighted the hurricane lamp.
 
                                HENRY
                 If this rotten weather would only quit
                 for a minute - they can come in and
                 court martial me all they like.
                 Hendrix says it won't blow itself out
                 for two more weeks.  He was up here
                 once with -
 
       A snore comes from Eddie and Captain Henry stops
       talking.  He sits down on a cot to remove his shoes.
       There is a knock on the door.  Henry goes to it and
       opens it.  Nikki comes in.  She is in a night robe
       and slippers.  She carries a small toilet kit and
       a blanket.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (brightly)
                 Have you got room?
 
                                HENRY
                 Come in.  I was just going to bed.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Thought I'd join you - if you don't
                 mind.
 
                                HENRY
                 Don't mind at all.
 
                                NIKKI
                 I brought my own blanket - if
                 you have an extra cot.
 
                                HENRY
                 I think we can - arrange something.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (sitting down
                       on a cot)
                 This one's empty.
 
                                HENRY
                 It's mine.
                      (she starts
                       to get up)
                 Perfectly all right - you can use it.
 
       He sits down beside her.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (nervously)
                 You don't mind sleeping with one
                 of the men.
 
                                HENRY
                 It's not my usual preference.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (laughing a little
                       loudly)
                 Mine either.
 
                                HENRY
                      (frowning)
                 Shh.  No sense in waking them up.
                 They're very tired.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (solemnly)
                 Sorry.
                      (he puts his arm
                       around her as she
                       peers at the sleepers)
                 I'll try not to disturb them.
 
                                HENRY
                 You can lie down, if you care to.
 
                                NIKKI
                 I can't.
 
                                HENRY
                 Why not?
 
                                NIKKI
                 I'm scared to death.  The minute
                 I lie down, I jump up.
 
                                HENRY
                 Maybe I can relax you, baby.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Please - no massages.
 
                                HENRY
                 Can't you think of me as something
                 beside a masseur?
 
                                NIKKI
                 Yes.
                      (she looks at
                       him nervously)
                 Please make love to me.
 
                                HENRY
                      (holding her)
                 You're shaking.
 
                                NIKKI
                 I know.  It'll take my mind off -
                 what's making me shake - that what-
                 is-it.
 
                                HENRY
                      (gently)
                 You're very sweet.  Perfect skin,
                 perfect nose - everything perfect.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Thank you.
                      (she stares
                       at him and
                       adds softly)
                 Please go on.
 
                                HENRY
                 Your mind isn't on it.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Yes - it is.  Honestly it is.
                 You said I was perfect.
 
                                HENRY
                 If you lie down you'll stop
                 shaking, baby.
 
                                NIKKI
                 I won't.
 
                                HENRY
                 Just try it.
 
                                NIKKI
                 You -- you can't make love to
                 me if I'm lying down.
 
                                HENRY
                 Yes I can.  It doesn't interfere
                 at all.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Pat -- do you really love me?  Or
                 are you just talking because I
                 asked you to?
                      (Henry has turned his
                       head toward a clicking
                       noise coming from the
                       direction of MacAuliff's
                       bed.  Nikki frowns at
                       him)
                 Now whose mind isn't on it?
 
                                HENRY
                      (looking at her)
                 Darling.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (smiling nervously
                       at him)
                 I understand perfectly.
 
                                HENRY
                 What?
 
                                NIKKI
                 A room full of kibitzers and a
                 monster floating around -- it's
                 a little difficult kissing a
                 girl under such conditions.
 
                                HENRY
                      (his ears cocked at the
                       continuing clicking)
                 You're wonderful.
 
       He kisses her.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (after the kiss)
                 That's very -- relaxing.  I feel
                 much better.  I'll -- I'll lie
                 down, it you don't mind.
 
       She lies down on the cot.  As she does, Henry stands
       up.  She looks at him with some surprise.
 
                                HENRY
                 That clicking.  Sounds like.
                 No -- it couldn't be --
                      (he smiles tensely at
                       the recumbent Nikki)
                 Excuse me.
                      (he goes to MacAuliff's
                       bed and shakes him
                       gently)
                 Mac, Mac -- wake up.
                      (MacAuliff opens
                       his eyes)
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 What's the matter?
 
                                HENRY
                      (gesturing toward
                       the clicking)
                 Hear that?
 
       MacAuliff listens for a second, then sits up swiftly.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 The counter!
 
                                HENRY
                 I thought so!
 
       MacAuliff jumps up and grabs at a duffle bag that lies
       at the foot of his bed.
 
                                NIKKI
                 What is it?
 
                                HENRY
                 The Geiger counter.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Why should it be clicking now?
 
                                HENRY
                 There's something moving around
                 that's radio active.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Oh, no -- no!
 
       MacAuliff lifts the counter out of his duffle bag and
       stares at it.  It continues to click, its rhythm
       accelerating slightly.  Henry darts to the
       intercommunication panel at his desk.
 
                                HENRY
                      (pushing a button)
                 Ericson!  Ken!  This is Pat.
                 Come in -- quick!
 
       A moment's silence.
 
                                ERICSON'S VOICE
                 Ericson here --
 
                                HENRY
                      (rapidly into
                       speaker)
                 Any trouble down there?
 
                                ERICSON'S VOICE
                 Not a thing, Pat.
 
                                HENRY
                 Who's on duty outside?
 
                                ERICSON'S VOICE
                 Dr. Ambrose and what's his name,
                 the carpenter.
 
                                HENRY
                 Beat it aut there, as fast as
                 you can.  Check that rear door
                 and call me back!
 
                                ERICSON'S VOICE
                 Will do.
 
       Henry turns to MacAuliff and Nikki who are staring
       fearfully at the counter.  The clicking has continued
       to gain in volume and metre.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 It's getting stronger.
 
       Henry grabs a pillow from the bed and an ice axe from
       his desk.  He runs to the door, opens it and
       cautiously peers down the hall.  MacAuliff and Nikki
       watch him tensely.
 
                                HENRY
                      (after a moment)
                 Nothing.  Not a sign --
 
       Nikki gives a long sigh of relief.
 
                                NIKKI
                 My heart's pounding like a horse
                 running away.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (shaking the counter)
                 Suppose this thing's gone nuts?
 
                                HENRY
                      (dropping the
                       pillow and
                       ice axe)
                 I sure hope so.  Let me see it.
                      (he takes the
                       counter; the
                       clicking is now
                       quite rapid)
                 It looks okay.
 
       There is a movement outside the window.  No one in the
       room sees it.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Maybe Dr. Carrington is
                 experimenting some more.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (hopefully)
                 That's possible.  Shall I call
                 him?
 
       The intercom speaks.
 
                                ERICSON'S VOICE
                 Everything's in order outside,
                 Pat.
 
                                HENRY
                      (into intercom)
                 Thanks, Ken.
 
       He snaps the intercom shut.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (eyes glued on
                       the counter)
                 I sure don't get it.
 
                                HENRY
                 Call Carrington, Nikki.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (pressing a
                       switch on the
                       intercom)
                 Dr. Carrington -- Dr. Carrington.
                 This is Nikki, Arthur.
 
       A moment's pause, then Carrington's sleepy voice comes
       from the intercom.
 
                                CARRINGTON'S VOICE
                 Yes, Nikki?
 
                                NIKKI
                 I'm in Captain Henry's room.
                 His Geiger counter is counting
                 Geigers like mad.  He wants to
                 know if it might be picking up
                 anything that you're doing.
 
                                CARRINGTON'S VOICE
                 No. What's the reading?
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Eight point six.  And going up.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (repeating into
                       intercom)
                 Eight point six.  And going up.
 
                                CARRINGTON'S VOICE
                 I'll be right down.
 
       The intercom snaps off.  Suddenly the Geiger counter
       starts purring like a rattlesnake.
 
                                HENRY
                      (his voice rising)
                 Eddie!  Barnes!  Get up!
                      (Dykes and Barnes
                       sit up in alarm)
                 Grab your guns -- axes are
                 better -- Nikki, take this!
                      (he seizes the
                       mattress on
                       his cot and
                       pushes it at
                       Nikki)
                 Sit in the corner -- hold that
                 over you!
                      (to MacAuliff)
                 Where's your tommy-gun?
 
                                MACAULIFF
                 Here!
 
       He pulls tommy-gun from under his bed and brandishes it.
 
                                DYKES AND BARNES
                 What's up?
                 Where is it?
 
       A CRASH from the window is their answer.
 
                                HENRY
                 Pillows!  Get those pillows in
                 front of your faces!
 
       A second CRASH sends the entire window hurtling into
       the room.  The Creature springs into their midst.
 
       GUNS ROAR.  The Creature moves toward MacAuliff.  His
       tommy-gun chatters at it point-blank.  It strikes at
       the tommy-gun, knocking it out of MacAuliff's hands,
       and sending MacAuliff sprawling.
 
       The Creature jumps after MacAuliff.  It is balked for a
       moment by Henry who strikes it with his ice axe.
 
       A bullet hits the light.  Only the dim light of the
       kerosene lamp remains.
 
       The Creature whips its knifed hand at Henry's face.
       Henry partially blocks the blow with his pillow which
       shreds in the air.  Henry staggers back against the
       wall.  He almost knocks over the hurricane lamp.  He
       picks it up and dashes it at the Creature.  Flaming
       kerosene spatters over it.  As it stands burning torch-
       like in the middle of the room Barnes moves forward
       and strikes a mighty blow with his axe.  The blow
       misses.  Instantly the Creature wheels and seizes Barnes
       by the throat.  Barnes screams once.  His scream gurgles
       away.  Dykes, holding his entire cot in front of him
       as a shield, rushes forward followed by Henry.  They
       smash at the monster which, still holding Barnes with
       one tentacle, retreats to a corner of the room.
 
       It is the corner in which Nikki has been crouching.
       She screams.  The Creature whips its free talon at her
       and secures her by the arm.  Still afire, it starts
       dragging its two victims toward the window.  Nikki's
       screams fill the room.  Once more Henry charges forward
       with his ice axe and sinks its pointed end into the
       Creature's head.
 
       The Creature stops, drops Nikki and lashes at Henry.
       This time its arced knife-fingers slash Henry's wrist.
       Henry drops the axe and falls back.  Dykes, still
       shielded by his cot, has at the same time grabbed
       Nikki's ankle and pulled her away.  MacAuliff has
       picked up the can containing the remainder of the
       kerosene.  He throws it on the Creature.  The blaze
       surges up.
 
                      Parts of the room have caught fire.
                      The Creature picks up Barnes and
                      springs out the window into the
                      storm.
 
                      For a moment its motion through
                      the night is etched in fire.  Then
                      the wind and snow extinguish the
                      flames.  The Creature disappears.
 
                      Dykes moves quickly from Nikki to
                      bend over Henry who is kneeling in
                      silent agony, clutching his
                      lacerated forearm.
 
                      Dykes snaps on a flashlight.
 
                                DYKES
                      (panting)
                 You all right, Pat?
 
                                HENRY
                      (with difficulty)
                 Yeh.
                      (he nods toward Nikki)
                 How about her?
 
                                DYKES
                 Fainted.  Her arms cut.  I think
                 she's all right, though.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (his fingers on Nikki's pulse)
                 Yes, she's all right.
 
                                HENRY
                 Barnes - he died quick, I think.
 
                                DYKES
                 So do I.
                      (he points his flashlight
                       at the floor)
                 That thing won't make much of a meal
                 of the poor guy.  Most of his blood's
                 in here.
 
                      There is a knock on the door.
 
                                CARRINGTON'S VOICE
                 It's Dr. Carrington.
 
                                HENRY
                 Come in.
 
                      Dr. Carrington enters.  Dykes'
                      flashlight focuses on his face.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (blinking at the beam)
                 I heard shots - what happened?
 
                                HENRY
                 Dr. Carrington, I want everyone in
                 this camp to assemble in the radio
                 room immediately.  Fully dressed.
                 Bring medical supplies, provisions,
                 and every weapon we've got.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 Your window - is it - was it the - ?
 
                                HENRY
                 It was.  I'll give you all a full
                 report in the radio room.  Get going
                 Doctor - you, too, Eddie.  Round
                 everybody up.  Get 'em barricaded
                 before it comes back!
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
56     INTERIOR RADIO ROOM - 2:30 A.M.
 
       Beyond the radio room is a short underground passage
       leading into the generator room.
 
       All the members of the expedition, save Henry, MacAuliff
       and Hendrix are in the radio room.
 
       Chapman is putting final touches on a bandage on Nikki's
       arm.
 
       Two workers are nailing shut the trap door that leads to
       the observation tower.
 
       Henry enters with Hendrix and MacAuliff following.
 
                                HENDRIX
                      (to Henry)
                 ...not during the storm, Captain.
                 But soon's it blows over I can get
                 the transmitter out of your plane
                 and rig up a two-way communication
                 with Dutch Harbor.
 
                      Henry nods.  MacAuliff has
                      taken two Geiger counters
                      from a ruck-sack in the
                      corner.  He returns to Henry.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to MacAuliff)
                 Got 'em?
                      (as MacAuliff shows him
                       the counters)
                 Eddie!
 
                      Dykes turns from where he
                      has been supervising the
                      workers at the trap door.
 
                                HENRY
                 I'm going to station you and Mac at
                 each end of the corridor.  Take a
                 counter along.  If it starts clicking,
                 report back here on the double.
 
                                DYKES
                      (feelingly)
                 You bet.
 
                                HENRY
                 I'll put Nikki on the intercom.
                 She'll keep checking with you, so
                 we'll know if you get taken by surprise.
 
                                DYKES
                      (wryly)
                 That'll be a big help...
                      (He goes out
                       with MacAuliff)
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Nikki)
                 Got that, Nikki?
 
                                NIKKI
                 Yes.  Where's the intercom?
 
                                HENRY
                      (pointing)
                 Over there.  Hendrix'll show you.
 
                      Nikki pulls a chair over to
                      the intercom panel.  Hendrix
                      moves to show her the levers
                      that will connect her with
                      Dykes and MacAuliff.
                      Skeely emerges from the
                      generator room and crosses
                      to Henry.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Hey, Ceptain, what's the sense of
                 everybody huddling in here?  Let's
                 set some acetylene torches and hand
                 grenades and stuff and rush the greenhouse.
 
                                HENRY
                 It isn't in the greenhouse.  I just
                 checked.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 How did it get out, Captain?
 
                                HENRY
                 Burned its way out.  There's a
                 big hole in the wall.  Still hot.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (incredulous)
                 Burned its way through an iron wall?
 
                                HENRY
                 It's radio-active.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (solemnly)
                 Probably can generate enough heat to
                 burn its way through anything.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (into intercom)
                 All right, Eddie?  Over.
 
                                EDDIE'S VOICE
                 Nothing yet.
 
                                NIKKI
                      (into intercom)
                 All right, Mac?  Over.
 
                                MACAULIFF'S VOICE
                 All quiet here.
 
                      At twenty second intervals,
                      Nikki, Eddie and MacAuliff
                      repeat the same ritual.
 
                                SKEELY
                 I still say we ought to corner that
                 thing in the greenhouse.  That's were
                 it's growing its stuff -- it'll go
                 back there --
 
                                ERICSON
                      (growling)
                 Corner it with what, you dumb joker?
                 Insect powder?
 
                                AMBROSE
                      (coming up)
                 I've got enough cable to reach the
                 nursery, Captain.  Suppose we electrocute
                 it?
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 It might be immune to electricity.
 
                                REDDING
                      (coming up)
                 It's not.  I tried it, on one of those
                 horrible sprouts.
 
                      Carrington has been sitting
                      nearby, his head in his
                      hands.  He looks up angrily.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 You destroyed them!
 
                                REDDING
                 Only one.  It disintegrated under
                 five hundred volts and burnt to an
                 ash.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                 I forbid you to do any more tampering!
                 Our orders are clear.  We are to wait --
 
                                HENRY
                      (curtly)
                 I'm giving the orders.
 
                      Carrington looks at Henry for
                      a moment, then rises and goes
                      into the generator room.
                      Henry ignores him.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Redding)
                 I think you've got something, Doctor.
 
                                AMBROSE
                      (eagerly)
                 Shall I run the cable into the green-
                 house?
 
                                HENRY
                 Our pal isn't going back there.
 
                                AMBROSE
                 But those things in the greenhouse are
                 growing...They must need -- nourishment.
 
                                REDDING
                      (to Henry: protesting)
                 You can't anticipate its moves.  Its mind
                 is of a different nature than ours.
 
                                HENRY
                 A mind at war is always the same --
                 whether it's hatched in Tokyo or Mars.
                 We know the thing's objective.
 
                                SKEELY
                 What?
 
                                HENRY
                      (nodding at Ambrose)
                 Nourishment.  Blood, and all the blood in
                 the camp is in this room.  He'll be
                 coming down the pike any minute now.
 
                      As Henry speaks his eyes
                      have been roving around the
                      room.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 Perhaps we'd be wiser to disperse --
 
                                HENRY
                 He'd get us one at a time.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (eyeing Henry)
                 So what do we do?
 
                                HENRY
                 We give him a welcome home party.
                      (he points to the corridor
                       that leads to the generator
                       room)
                 In that tunnel.  And a great, big
                 hotfoot.
                      (he turns to Redding)
                 Got any chicken wire - cattle fence
                 wire -- any kind of wire webbing?
 
                                REDDING
                 Yes -- rolls of it.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Ericson)
                 Ken, take two men and help Doctor
                 Redding bring the wire out.  Lay it in
                 that passage way.  Then string it along
                 the roof.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Like a fly trap!
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Ambrose, as Ken
                       follows Redding out)
                 Splice your cable to the webbing.  And
                 fix up an operating switch on a long wire -
                 about thirty feet.  How many volts can
                 you give me?
 
                                AMBROSE
                 Over a thousand.
 
                                HENRY
                 That enough?
 
                                AMBROSE
                 I earnestly hope so.
 
                                HENRY
                 Got going, Doctor.
 
                      Ambrose runs out.  Nikki's
                      exchanges with Dykes and
                      MacAuliff have been continuing
                      at regular intervals.  Now
                      Nikki turns to Hendrix.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Take over for me, please,
                 Mr. Hendrix.
 
                      Hendrix sits at the intercom
                      and starts checking with the
                      sentinels as Nikki goes to
                      Henry.  She pulls at his sleeve.
 
                 Pat, don't you feel it?  It's getting
                 cold.
 
                                HENRY
                      (paying no attention)
                 Everybody who's not working get back
                 in the generator room.  Make it snappy,
                 please.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Pat, I tell you I'm getting cold.
 
                                HENRY
                 You sick?
 
                                NIKKI
                 No, you dunce.  It's cold.  The heat
                 must be off.
 
                                HENRY
                      (calling to Chapman)
                 What's the thermometer reading?
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (glancing at a wall thermometer)
                 Fifty-four.  I thought it was
                 getting chilly.
 
                                SKEELY
                 It sure is.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (still staring at the
                       thermometer)
                 It's going down fast.
 
                                HENRY
                      (placing his hand over
                       a heat vent)
                 There's no heat at all coming
                 through the vents.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 We've got three furnaces.  They
                 couldn't all break down at once.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (looking at the thermometer
                       over Chapman's shoulder)
                 Going down.  Forty-nine!
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 Someone better go to the furnace room.
 
                                HENRY
                 No, Doctor.  There's nothing
                 wrong with the furnaces.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Must be, Henry.  Why aren't they working?
 
                                HENRY
                 Because they've been turned off.
                 By our visitor.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Holy Ike.  He's gonna freeze us out!
 
                                HENRY
                 And come in after us when we're
                 numb or dead with cold.
 
                                SKEELY
                 What a practical joker.  Reminds me
                 of General Rommel when we were "it."
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (reading from the thermometer)
                 Forty-five now.
 
                                SKEELY
                 And it's sixty below outside.
 
       Redding, Ericson and two other scientists have emerged
       from the storeroom with the wire rolls.  They start to
       execute Henry's orders.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Chapman)
                 How many flying suits are there,
                 Doctor?
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 Eight, counting yours.  And one
                 electric blanket.
 
       The telegraph instrument starts to chatter.
 
                                HENDRIX
                      (calling)
                 Nikki.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Coming.
 
       She replaces Hendrix at the intercom panel.  Hendrix
       starts taking down the telegraph message.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Chapman)
                 Leave me one for Nikki.  Take the
                 others in the generating room and
                 tell the folks to take turns
                 wearing 'em.  Ten minute shifts.
 
       Chapman moves to obay.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Our friend's quite a boy.  Figures all
                 the angles.
 
                                HENRY
                      (staring at the wiring)
                 Lucky thing we got Edison and
                 Einstein on our side.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (quietly)
                 Wonder if they're going to be enough.
 
                                HENRY
                      (equally quietly)
                 I was wondering the exact same thing.
 
                                ERICSON
                      (working)
                 My fingers are getting numb.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (walking up and down to
                       warm himself)
                 I remember once, in Accra, in
                 equatorial Africa --
 
                                ERICSON
                 Shut up.  Nobody's listening.
 
                                HENDRIX
                 Message for you Captain.
 
                                HENRY
                 Hold it.
                      (to Chapman who is returning
                       for another load of flying suits)
                 Got any rubber boots in that storeroom?
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 Plenty of them.
 
                                HENRY
                 Get us four pairs, will you.
 
       Chapman goes to the storeroom.
 
                                SKEELY
                 What're the boots for?
 
                                HENRY
                 So nobody gets burned accidentally
                 when I turn the juice on.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (calling after Chapman)
                 Make that five pair, Doctor!
 
                                DYKES' VOICE
                      (over intercom)
                 It's coming!
 
                                NIKKI
                      (relaying the warning)
                 Pat!  It's coming!
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Nikki)
                 Call Mac in!
                      (to the wire workers)
                 Almost finished?
 
                                REDDING
                      (working frantically)
                 Another minute..
 
                                AMBROSE
                      (calling from the other
                       end of the corridor)
                 All ready on this end!
 
       Henry has moved to the door.  He opens it.  MacAuliff
       and Dykes come running in.  Henry shuts and bolts the
       door behind them.
 
                                DYKES
                      (panting)
                 The counter's going.  The reading's
                 low, but it's going up.  Oh, boy,
                 it's cold!
 
       He hands the counter to Henry.  Chapman has come out
       of the storeroom with the boots.  Skeely takes a pair,
       and the others are dumped at the entrance of the
       passage-way.
 
                                HENRY
                      (jerking his head toward the
                       generator room)
                 Nikki - back there.  Get going.
                      (to the others)
                 Get those boots on, boys.
 
       He starts to pull on a pair himself.  Carrington comes
       out of the generator room.  He looks at the cable
       hook-up Ambrose has made, then glances up quickly at
       the wire-web installed by Redding, etc.
 
                                REDDING
                 That does it.  All set, Captain.
 
                                HENRY
                 Okay, everybody in the back room
                 but Army personnel.
 
       Carrington strides up to Henry.  His face is working
       emotionally.  He is about to address Henry, when
       Hendrix speaks up.
 
                                HENDRIX
                 How about your message, Captain?
 
                                HENRY
                 Let's have it.
 
                                HENDRIX
                      (reading)
                 MacLaren to Henry.  Use every means
                 to save lives of expedition.  But take
                 no steps against captive.  Expect to
                 relieve you in three days.  Hold out
                 well as you can.  Your main objective
                 is to keep creature alive until our
                 arrival.  Congress, President, Chiefs
                 of Staff, all superiors consider
                 survival of captive creature greatest
                 triumph for our civilization.
 
                                DYKES
                 The biggest heroes are always back
                 of the lines, eh?
 
                                HENRY
                      (grimly)
                 Well - that's that.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (quietly)
                 How does that affect your plans, Captain?
 
                                HENRY
                 Not at all.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (intensely)
                 You can not ignore your orders,
                 Captain!  They come from sources
                 that know more than you!
 
       Henry finishes donning his boots.  He stands up, and
       glances coolly at Carrington.
 
                                HENRY
                 We'll discuss that some other time.
                      (pointing to the
                       rear door)
                 Inside, folks.
 
       Carrington stands glaring at Henry.  He makes an effort
       to control the fury in him.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (vibrantly)
                 You're defying orders from your superiors,
                 Captain Henry.  You've been directed
                 to preserve the life of this interplanetary
                 creature at all costs.
 
                                DYKES
                      (from the thermometer)
                 The temperature is now thirty above.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Perfect for ski-ing.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (tensely to Henry)
                 You are an officer in the United
                 States Army in charge of a military
                 mission.  You have received instructions
                 from your general - and from every
                 department of the government on how
                 to proceed.
 
                                HENRY
                 It's no fun breaking orders, Doctor.
                 But my duty -
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (cutting in sharply)
                 Your duty is to the Army you represent!
 
                                HENRY
                      (quietly)
                 My first duty as a man is to the
                 human race.  There's an enemy of it
                 coming after us.  I'm going to kill it.
 
       Redding enters from the corridor.  He hands Henry a
       switch on the end of a long wire.
 
                                REDDING
                 Here's your operating switch.
 
                                HENRY
                 Thanks.
 
       Redding glances curiously at Carrington and returns
       toward the rear room.  Dykes is standing by the
       intercom panel.  He pushes a button.  A subdued
       squealing comes out of the communicator.
 
                                HENRY
                      (sharply)
                 What's that?
 
                                DYKES
                 I've got the intercom open to the
                 greenhouse.  Listen to them.
 
       As he talks the room fills with an insistent mewing
       as if from a myriad of voices.
 
                                HENRY
                 Your friends sound hungry, Carrington.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (as the voices rise)
                 They must be big boys now.
 
                                DYKES
                 The wild carrots are coming - !
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (his voice rising in anger)
                 You're doing more than breaking Army
                 orders, Captain!  You're robbing the
                 human mind!
 
                                HENRY
                 You can testify to that effect at my
                 court martial, Doctor.
 
                               CARRINGTON
                      (tensely - and controlling
                       himself again)
                 A secret has come to us, greater than
                 any secret ever revealed to science.
                 It must not be destroyed!  It must
                 be studied - and learned.
 
                               HENRY
                      (quietly)
                 I saw it, Carrington.  It's not
                 something to put under glass -
                 and examine.  And there are thousands
                 more of them hatching.  They'll
                 reproduce like weeds.  They'll
                 tear the world apart.
 
                               CARRINGTON
                 That doesn't matter!
 
                               HENRY
                      (softly)
                 It kind of matters to me.
 
                               CARRINGTON
                      (growing wilder)
                 Knowledge is more important than
                 life, Captain.  We have only one
                 excuse for existing - to think,
                 to find out, to learn what is unknown.
 
                               DYKES
                 We haven't a chance to learn anything
                 from that pookey Martian, except a
                 quicker way to die, Doctor.
 
                               HENRY
                 I'm ordering you back, Carrington.
 
                               CARRINGTON
                      (full of a curious fury)
                 It doesn't matter what happens to
                 us!  We're not animals.  We're a
                 brain that thinks!  Nothing else
                 counts, except our thinking.  We've
                 thought our way into nature.  We've
                 split the atom -
 
                               DYKES
                 Yeah, and that sure made the world
                 happy, didn't it!
 
       The mewing out of the wall speaker increases.
 
                               HENRY
                 I've ordered you out, Carrington.
 
                               CARRINGTON
                      (wildly)
                 We owe it to the brain of our
                 species to stand here and die
                 without destroying a source of
                 wisdom!  Captain, I beseech you.
                 Science, government, the Army -
                 civilization has given us orders.
 
                               HENRY
                      (grimly)
                 They're wrong order.  They come
                 from people who don't know what
                 they're talking about.
 
                               SKEELY
                 I'm with you there, Henry.  In a
                 pinch I always put my money on a
                 little man - against all top brass.
 
                               CARRINGTON
                      (wildly to Henry)
                 You set yourself above all human
                 progress, above all science!
 
                               HENRY
                      (quietly)
                 I set myself against an enemy,
                 Carrington.
 
                               MACAULIFF
                 Come on, Doctor.  You've said your
                 piece.  This is one time when
                 science doesn't blow up the world
                 ...just to see what makes it tick.
 
                               DYKES
                      (suddenly)
                 The Geiger!
 
       He picks up the counter.  It is clicking more
       rapidly.
 
                               HENRY
                 Inside, Carrington.
 
       Dykes seizes Carrington.  The Doctor goes with him.
 
                               CARRINGTON
                      (from the door into the
                       underground passage)
                 You're fools!  You'll never hurt it!
                 It's wiser, stronger -
 
                               DYKES
                 Shut up - !
 
       He pushes Carrington into the passage into the
       generator room.  Nikki, Chapman and Hendrix follow.
       Dykes shuts the door behind them and then rejoins the
       group in the radio room.  It consists of Henry,
       MacAuliff, Ericson, Skeely and Dykes.  Henry turns
       and sees Skeely.
 
                               HENRY
                 Sorry, Skeely.  These are front lines.
                 No civilians allowed.
 
                               SKEELY
                 That does not include the Press,
                 Captain.
 
                               HENRY
                 Get in with the others, Skeely.
                 You don't belong here.
 
                               SKEELY
                      (grinning)
                 I didn't belong at Alamein or
                 Bouganville - or Okinawa.  Just
                 hung around as a kibitzer.  I am
                 also a very good obit writer.
                 Ignore me, please.
 
       Henry grins and decides to ignore him.  He turns to
       Dykes.
 
                               HENRY
                 You got the Geiger, Eddie.
 
                               DYKES
                 Yeah, no change.
 
                               MACAULIFF
                 The temperature is now twenty-two.
 
                               HENRY
                 Keep moving around.  That'll help
                 a little.
 
                               ERICSON
                      (trying to keep his
                       voice casual)
                 Excuse me, Pat, but wouldn't it
                 be a better idea to wait at the
                 other end of the tunnel.
 
                               HENRY
                 No, Ken.  We receive in here.
 
                               DYKES
                 Any reason, Pat?
 
                               HENRY
                 Psychology.  Our boy seems kind
                 of smart.  He's going to notice
                 an empty room - and a lot of fence
                 wire laid.  And sit down to think
                 it over - for a few hours.  But
                 if it finds us out here waiting,
                 he'll chase us back into the trap.
 
                               SKEELY
                 Providing we are able to move.
 
                               HENRY
                 That's right.
 
                               SKEELY
                 Frozen bait, eh?
 
                               MACAULIFF
                 How can it get cold so quick?
                      (to Dykes)
                 You're turning blue.
 
                               HENRY
                 Keep moving, boys.
 
       They pace.
 
                               ERICSON
                 Must be zero.
 
                               DYKES
                      (from the thermometer)
                 Was.  Next stop five below.
 
                               MACAULIFF
                 Come, Mr. Martian - and get some
                 nice Scotch blood - 110 proof.
                 Nothin' like it for babies!
 
                               ERICSON
                      (pacing)
                 Cut it out - !
 
                               MACAULIFF
                 I never thought I'd be in a hurry
                 to see that lad again.
 
                               ERICSON
                      (gesturing toward
                       the intercom from
                       which the mewing noises
                       are still issuing -
                       now in a sudden
                       crescendo)
                 Those things give me the fantods.
                 Okay if I shut it off, Captain?
 
                               SKEELY
                 No, don't.  I like the gooseflesh.
                 Keeps me warm.
 
       There is a moment or two of silence.  The men keep
       moving and swinging their arms.
 
                               DYKES
                 I don't hear the Geiger.
 
                               HENRY
                 It's going.
 
                               ERICSON
                 Faster?
 
                               HENRY
                 Two points.
 
                               DYKES
                 Then he's on his way!
 
                               MACAULIFF
                 Maybe.  I got a worry.
 
                               DYKES
                      (to Henry, saluting
                       like a courier)
                 Report from the front, Captain.
                 Brother MacAuliff has a worry.
 
                               MACAULIFF
                 It's no joke.
 
                               ERICSON
                      (tensely)
                 Spill it!
 
                               MACAULIFF
                 What if it can read our minds?
 
                               DYKES
                      (pacing)
                 It's going to be sore when it
                 gets to you - a blank page.
 
                               MACAULIFF
                      (angrily)
                 They're working on telepathy in
                 this country ain't they?  So they've
                 probably got it on Mars, considerin'
                 the superior type of carrots they
                 produce.  So it knows everything
                 we're sayin' and thinking and it'll
                 wait till we're froze stiff in our
                 own trap before it -
 
                               HENRY
                      (sharply)
                 It's coming closer.
                      (the mewing has
                       stopped.  There
                       is silence.  The
                       Geiger counter
                       is heard clicking)
                 Up two more points.
 
                               DYKES
                      (pats Henry on the back)
                 A real strategist.  You'll be a
                 general yet.
 
                               SKEELY
                 Not a chance.  Not enough fat
                 in his head.
 
                               ERICSON
                      (staring at the counter
                       in Henry's hand)
                 It's standing still now.
 
                               DYKES
                 Getting its wind.
 
                               HENRY
                 Keep moving -
 
                               SKEELY
                      (as he paces)
                 I remember the first electrocution
                 I ever covered.  Ruth Snyder and
                 Judd Grey.  I'll never forget how
                 Madam Snyder bounced in the chair
                 when they gave her her last permanent.
                 We were all watching her eyes and -
 
                               HENRY
                      (sharply)
                 Hold it!
 
       Skeely becomes silent.  The quickened clicking of the
       Geiger fills the room.
 
                               DYKES
                      (softly)
                 Thar she blows!
 
                               HENRY
                      (his voice precise)
                 When it comes in, you get into
                 the passage first, Skeely.
                      (he points to the
                       opened passage door)
                 You next, Ken.  Then Mac, then
                 Eddie.  Got that?
                      (the men nod)
                 Don't start falling back till its
                 in the room and sees us.  I'll
                 carry the switch.  Take care when
                 I turn the juice on that you don't
                 touch the walls.  You'll get
                 electrocuted if you do.
 
                               MACAULIFF
                 What if the thousand volts aren't
                 enough, Pat?
 
                               DYKES
                 Five hundred burned one of the
                 sprouts.
 
                               MACAULIFF
                 You can kill a baby with a fly
                 swatter - you need a baseball bat
                 for a man.  How do we know it
                 won't walk right through.
 
                               HENRY
                      (curtly)
                 We don't know.  But we'll find out.
                 All set?
 
                                DYKES
                      (quietly)
                 Yes, sir.
 
       The Geiger counter is now clicking loudly.  Holding
       axes and hatchets in their gloved hands, the men take
       their positions as Captain Henry indicated.
 
                                HENRY
                      (quietly)
                 If the voltage doesn't stop it,
                 keep swinging at its arms.
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (suddenly)
                 It's outside!  It's coming in!
 
       A creaking of wood comes from the doorway.
 
                                SKEELY
                 Yeah, we got a caller.
 
                                HENRY
                 Wait till it shows - before you move!
 
       At this moment the lights go out.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (in the dark)
                 What the holy -- !
 
                                MACAULIFF
                      (calling in the dark)
                 The juice is off!
 
                                ERICSON
                      (bawling out in the dark)
                 Put on the lights.
 
       The Geiger clicking and the mewing fill the darkness.
       The outline of the door begins to glow in the dark, as
       the Creature burns away at it.
 
                                NIKKI'S VOICE
                      (yelling)
                 Pat!! Pat!  Carrington's
                 disconnected the generator!
 
                                HENRY'S VOICE
                 Mac!  Come with me!  Eddie -
                 hold that thing back as long as
                 you can!
 
                                DYKES
                 Roger -
 
                                REDDING'S VOICE
                      (calling down the
                       passageway)
                 Captain Henry - Watch out -
                 Carrington's got a gun!
 
       We hear the sound of feet crashing against the wire
       webbing as Henry and MacAuliff run along the tunnel.
       The doorway's outline continues to glow more brightly.
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
57     INT. GENERATOR ROOM
 
       It is entirely dark.  Henry's flashlight stabs into the
       room.  It swivels around quickly, pausing briefly on
       Nikki's panicky face, flashing over the frightened
       faces of the others, then finding Carrington.
       Carrington stands with a gun in his hand, staring
       wildly.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (as the flashlight
                       hits him)
                 I'll shoot!  I'll shoot if anyone
                 touches that generator!
 
       Henry's response is to charge forward.  He grabs the
       revolver with one hand, and hits Carrington with the
       other.  Carrington falls unconscious, alongside the
       generators.  Henry seizes Carrington's revolver.
 
                                HENRY
                      (as he retrieves
                      the revolver)
                 Mac!  Redding!  Get those
                 generators connected!
 
       He darts out as Mac and Redding turn their flashlights
       on the generator and fall to work.
 
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
58     INT. RADIO ROOM
 
       The redly glowing door begins to fall inward.  As it
       topples, Dykes' voice is heard.
 
                                DYKES
                 Never mind the guns.  Use your
                 axes!
 
       The Creature stands revealed in the doorway radioactivity
       causes it to shimmer weirdly in the dark.  It pauses a
       moment in the doorway, then moves toward the little
       group in the mouth of the passagway.
 
                                HENRY'S VOICE
                           (in the dark)
                 Fall back, fellows - Get going,
                 Skeely!  You nest, Ken!  Move!
 
       The group retreats in order down the passageway.  The
       Thing pauses at the entrance of the corridor.
 
                                MACAULIFF'S VOICE
                           (in the dark)
                 All connected - Okay, Pat --
 
       The tunnel lights begin to glow redly, revealing the
       Army group retreating over the fence wire.  The Creature
       is advancing toward them, but has not yet entered the
       trapped tunnel.
 
                                ERICSON
                 It's connected!  What're you
                 waiting for, Pat?
 
                                HENRY
                      (coolly)
                 I'm waiting to catch it in the
                 middle of the tunnel, Ken.
                 Take it easy, son.
 
       At this moment there comes the sound of a scuffling
       from the generator room.  A figure bursts out into the
       tunnel, as we here a chorus of "Grab him," "Shut the
       door," "Hold him - he's crazy," etc.  The figure is
       Carrington.  He pushes by Henry, Dykes and the rest of
       the Army group, and runs the length of the corridor.
       He comes to a halt at the far end of the corridor,
       facing the Creature.  Carrington, only a few feet away
       from the unearthly visitor, extends his arms in a
       pleading gesture.
 
                                HENRY
                      (during this)
                 Grab him!  Eddie!  Stop him!
 
                                DYKES
                 Too late.  Shall I go get him?
 
                                HENRY
                      (after a split
                      second)
                 No.  No, Eddie, don't.  Fall
                 back.
 
       The army group continues to retreat.
 
                                CARRINGTON
                      (his face dimly
                      visible in the
                      refracted light
                      of the Creature's
                      phosphoresence)
                 Listen to me - I'm your friend!
                 Look, my hands are in the air -
                 I have no weapons - I'm your
                 friend - you must understand
                 that.  You're wiser than I -
                 you must understand I'm trying
                 to help you - Don't come any
                 further.  They'll kill you!!
                 Look at me, I'm defenseless -
                 you must see that I don't mean
                 to hurt you - I want to know
                 you - to help you -
                 Believe me! You have a greater
                 intelligence than anything on
                 Earth - Use it - use it - look
                 at me and know what I'm trying
                 to tell you - I'm not your
                 enemy - I'm a scientist - a
                 scientist!
 
       The Creature has paused before Carrington's tirade as
       if studying him.  Now, without haste, it lifts one arm,
       and flicks its hand at Carrington's throat.  Carrington
       falls to the floor almost decapitated, his last words
       still gurgling in his throat. The Creature steps over
       Carrington's corpse and enters the tunnel.  It advances
       five or six steps.
 
                                HENRY
                      (crying sharply)
                 Watch out!  Here we go!
 
       He presses the switch in his hand.  A bombardment of
       huge sparks leaps from ceiling to floor.  The Creature
       is caught in the lightning flashes.  It stands
       motionless as the thousand volt bolts crack through it
       from head to foot.  In front of it stand the five men -
       axes ready, and weirdly visible in the spitting light.
       The Creature begins to glow like a filament, then
       bursts into flame.  It sinks to the ground.
 
                                HENRY
                 Don't move anybody!
 
                                SKEELY
                      (pointing a small
                       camera)
                 Keep that light going!  I got
                 him!  I got him!
 
       The Creature's form melts in the flames.  As it dwindles
       away, Henry ends the spark bombardment.  The lights of
       the passage come up full.  The men move toward the heap
       of ashes remaining of the Creature.
 
                                HENRY
                      (to Mac)
                 Go tell them it's over - and to
                 get the furnace going.
 
       As MacAuliff moves to obey, Chapman, Nikki and a number
       of the refugees come out of the generator room.
 
                                NIKKI
                 Dr. Carrington - what happened to him.
 
                                HENRY
                      (quietly)
                 He's dead.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (to Henry. Kneeling
                       over Carrington's
                       remains)
                 A clean sweep, Captain.  Both
                 monsters are dead.
 
                                               DISSOLVE
 
 
59     INT. RADIO ROOM 7 A.M.
 
       The wind is still blowing, the snow still swirling
       outside the tower windows.
 
       Hendrix sits exhausted at his radio sending panel.
 
       Skeely is hoarse and almost out on his feet with sleep.
       He drinks coffee.  A coffee pot is boiling over on an
       electric stove beside him.
 
       Captain Henry sits on the cot bed.  He is trying to stay
       awake.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                      (to Henry)
                 Those pills taking hold?
 
                                HENRY
                      (foggily)
                 I'll say.
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 Don't fight them.  Relax.
 
                                HENRY
                 I've got to --
 
                                CHAPMAN
                 That can all wait.  First you have got
                 to rest.  We all do.
 
       He goes out.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (drinking coffee)
                 She clear?
 
                                HENDRIX
                 Just a minute.
                      (into Mike)
                 Dutch Harbor, can you hear me?
 
                                VOICE
                      (back out of radio)
                 Dutch Harbor - reception clear.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (excited and hoarse)
                 I'm on!
 
                                VOICE
                 General Fogarty standing by for
                 Captain Henry.
 
                                HENRY
                      (eyes closed)
                 Coming -- I'm coming.
 
       Instead he sinks onto the cot bed.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (at the microphone)
                 North Pole, November 15 - Ned
                 Skeely reporting -
 
                                VOICE
                      (coming back)
                 General Fogarty standing by for
                 Captain Henry.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (into mike)
                 Tell General Fogarty to read it in the
                 papers.  Flash.  The world's greatest
                 battle was fought and won today by
                 the human race.  Here at the top of
                 the world a handful of American
                 soldiers and civilians wiped out the
                 first invasion from another planet.
 
                                VOICE
                      (over radio)
                 Captain Henry - come in.  General
                 Fogarty standing by.
 
       As Skeely continues to broadcast, Nikki enters.  She
       looks around sleepily.  She sees Henry stretched out
       on the cot bed, goes to him and starts shaking him
       awake.  But nothing will rouse him.
 
       Failing to bring Henry to wakefullness, Nikki smiles
       sleepily and stretches out in the cot beside him.  She
       closes her eyes.
 
       Henry opens his eyes and looks at her foggily.  He tries
       to embrace her but cannot.
 
                                HENRY
                      (drowsily)
                 Untie me, honey.
 
                                NIKKI
                 You bet I will. Tomorrow.
 
       Henry sticks his nose into her neck and falls happily
       asleep.
 
       During this Skeely is broadcasting.
 
                                SKEELY
                      (answering voice)
                 Stand by, all newspapers!  Flash
                 continued!  This first skirmish
                 for the possession of the earth
                 by the creatures from space was
                 won by the daring leadership of
                 Captain Patrick Henry.  Noah once
                 saved the world with an ark of wood.
                 Captain Henry performed a similar
                 service for our planet with an arc
                 of electricity.  But, ladies and
                 gentlemen of the globe - there is an
                 enemy hovering over our heads - an
                 enemy with an armada of flying saucers,
                 and an army of super human and
                 fantastic warriors.  Every citizen
                 of the world must become a sentinel
                 watching the skies.  Keep looking for
                 the next flying saucer - watch the
                 skies, watch everything over your
                 head - throw a ring of watch towers
                 around the earth - Keep looking -
                 looking - looking -
 
                                               FADE OUT
 
 
                        The End
