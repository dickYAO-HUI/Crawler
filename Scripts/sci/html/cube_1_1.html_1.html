At first we see an eye. Closed and slowly it opens up and looks
around. Later we get a full view of a man lying on the floor
in a strange-looking room. 4 walls, 1 ceiling, 1 floor. 6 sides
just like a cube. There is a kind of door on each side. Each
door has a handle. On the walls are weird-looking pictures.
They doesn't seem to look like anything seen before. The man
stands up in the middle of the room. The camera pans around him.
Then he makes some sounds and opens a door in one of the walls.
As he looks in to the open door, he sees a new room like the one
he is located in, but the light in the new room is blue. He
turns around and the door closes by itself. Then he opens the
door in in the floor. Under that door, there's a new room
excatly like the first, but in this room the light is red.
The door closes. He opens a new door in one of the walls.
The light in there is red. He looks back and then crawls into
the new room. As he lands on the floor in the new room it makes
a loud sound, and then the door closes behind him. He takes one
step, and then there is a loud sound. The man stands still.
Slowly he begins to bleed, and slowly his body begins to fall
apart. As the last parts of his body hits the floor, we see
a sort of trelliswork. First it moves to the floor, and
afterwards it is being folded up.

TITLE AND INTRO
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
A man lies on the floor. A door is open beside him. Slowly
we see a hand trying to find something to hold on to. A man
crawls up from the hole.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Hey...
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin closes the door in the floor. He sits down beside the
man lying on the floor and tries to wake him.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Hey...
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin stands up and opens a door in one of the walls. He
looks into a new room. Red light. He closes the door again.
The man from before is now awake. We hear a sound from one of
the other doors in the walls. Quentin stands beside the door
preparing to attack whatever that comes out from there. As
someone looks out, Quentin grabs her by the neck, throws her
to the floor and tries to beat her, until he realises that
it is a lady. The lady screams, and sits down in a corner
of the room.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">I'm sorry... It's alright, I'm not gonna hurt you.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">What do you want?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">I thought you were...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">What?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">I don't know...
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
We hear a loud sound and everybody in the room looks around.
As the sound stops, someone screams for help. Quentin opens
a door real fast. As the camera switches to a new angle, we
see a girl in a red room screaming for help. When she sees
Quentin she walks towards him.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">STOP!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin crawls into the room.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">What, what?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">It's ok, come here.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin helps Leaven into the room where the others are
located. Holloway helps Leaven out, but not good enough,
because Leaven falls and drops her glasses. Leaven sits up
against a wall and Quentin comes towards her.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">It's ok, calm down, evrything's gonna be fine.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">What was in there?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Just give me a minute to figure things out.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOOLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Why are you afraid of that room?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Just give me a minute I said.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The door in the ceiling is being opened. We see an old man.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">How many people are in this thing? Listen! We can't go
climbing around in here.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Why not?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">There's traps.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">What do you mean, traps?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Ubitraps. I looked into a room down there and something almost cut my 

head off!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The old man crawls down to the others, while Quentin talks
about the traps. Leaven breathes heavily.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Holy God, holy, holy God!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The old man sits down and begins to untie his shoe. Leaven
suddenly hugs Quentin. Holloway sits down beneath Worth.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Are you alright? Mister? Worth?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Holloway gets the attention from Worth.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Alright?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">I hit my head?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Let me take a look at that. It's ok, I'm a doctor, it doesn't
look bad.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The old man stands up.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What the hell are you doing?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The old man opens a door and now looks into a blue room.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Hey old man?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The old man, Rennes, throws his boot into the room. An
incinerator quickly burns the boot. Rennes pulls the boot
back and then the door closes. Rennes drops the boot on the
floor.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">Motiondetectors integrated in the walls. Tough to spot.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Oh God, oh God, oh God.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Rennes is on his way to open a new door.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Wait a second! Let's all just relax for a minute. Does anybody remember 

how they got here?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Long, nervebreaking silence.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Perogies! I was eating dinner. Perogies, cheese and potato. I ran out of 

sour cream and then I went to the fridge and then I... I don't know...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">You... Leaven?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">I... I just went to bed and then

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What about you?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">I just woke up here.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Middle of the night. It's like Chile. They always come in the
middle of the night.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Who?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Only the government can build something this ugly.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Oh, it ain't government.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Then what is it.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">I don't know.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Aliens!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Please, we're spooked anough as it is. Let's rule out aliens from now on 

and concentrate on what we know.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">My mom's gonna freak...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Rennes...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Just won't be there...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What do you think Rennes?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">We don't solve the act, sitting still. I'm moving at this straight line, 

till I get to the end.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Alright, I attend to agree.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Shouldn't we wait here? To see if anybody comes.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">No one is gonna come.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">There's a way in here, so there's gotta be a way out. We can avoid the 

traps using the boot. Holloway is it. What do you think? For an exit?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Ok.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">It can't be that simple.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">It ain't gonna be that simple. Take a look around. Take a
good long look around, see it. Coz, I got a feeling it's
looking at us.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">I just wanna wake up...
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven blinks with her eyes several times. Quentin sits down
beneath her.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Leaven, we can do this. We just have to stay calm, and work
together as a team. There's gotta be a lot of people
looking for us on the outside. I'm a cop, alright?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">You're a cop?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Yeah... I'm gonna get you out of here, I promise, but you
gotta be with me on this one...
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven nods.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Ok.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Rennes opens a new door, waiting for Quentin to give "signal"
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Boot it!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Rennes throws the boot, nothing happens.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">Clean.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Through several times of boot-throwing we see other rooms, with
other colors on the walls. On the way to a new green room,
Leaven notice some numbers in the passage between two rooms. A
loud sound is to hear.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">That one sounded closer.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">It's mechanical. Seems to come at regular intervals.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Maybe it's the ventilationsystem?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">No bets...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">No kidding, I'm boiling
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven looks at the numbers again: 566 472 737. Above these
numbers are some others: 476 804 539.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What is it, serial numbers?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Room numbers, they're different in each room.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Oh great, so there's only 566 million 400.000 rooms in this thing.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">There'd better not be! We have about three days without food and
water before we're too weak to move.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">They have to feed us, don't they?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Holloway!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Oh, we have heat, stress, physical exhaustion i.e. dehydration,
headaches, dizziness, disorientation, confusement. Mental process.
The body eventual begins to break down it's own tissue.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Rennes rips a button of Holloway's shirt.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">Suck on it... Keeps the saliva flowing.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Again the boot lands in a new room. This time, it's red.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">The air seems dry in there.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Trapped?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">Molecular chemical sensor.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Why the hell didn't the boot set it off.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">The boot's not alive. It detects hydrogen-sulfide extruded from
the skin.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">How come, you know so much about sensors, Renz?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">Rennes... Not Renz! It's french!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Fine, you're french. I'm asking how...
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Rennes opens a new door and throws the boot.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Rennes... Sensorexpert... With the right age... I don't believe
it...
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin laughs.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">This guy is The Wren...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">The what?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">The Wren. The bird of Attica. through the coop on six major
prisons.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">Seven!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">You're kidding right?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">You can get us out?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">Maybe.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">An escapeartist!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">Yes, I'm Harry "fucking" Houdini. The only reason I dragged you
so far, is cause I need your boots. If you're not smarting up
I'm gone like that. No more talking... No more guessing. Don't
even think about something which is not right in front of ya.
That's the real challenge, you gotta save yourselves from
yourselves.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Rennes jumps into the new room. We hear a click.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">RENNES
<p ID="dia">Merde.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Rennes gets acid in the face. He screams, and the door closes.
In the other room, the door begins to open.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Get him out!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Rennes' head is partly dissolved. He screams quietly, because
he has blood in his mouth. The others scream too. They lay him
in a corner. After a little while they look to him again.
He's dead, most of his head his been dissolved.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">So it was electrochemical or whatever, right? And he missed it.
The Wren... That's great, that's fucking great.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin turns the corpse of Rennes around with a foot.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Alright... It's time to reassess this place.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">I've been over it again and again, why would they throw
innocent people in here? Are we being punished?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">I've never done anything to deserve this!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Forget about all that! You can't see the big picture from in
here. So don't try. Keep your head down. Keep it simple.
Just look, look at what's in front of you.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">That's what he said.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Start with us. We got an escapeartist and a cop.
There's gotta be a reason for that. You're a doctor Holloway.
That gives you a function, a reason, right?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">No, it just makes me go: "Why me, and not one
of the ten million other doctors out there"!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Leaven. What are you?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Nothing, I jst go to school, hang out with my friends.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What else?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">There is nothing else. My parents are these people
I live with them... I'm boring.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">I think we have to ask the big questions: What does it want? What is it 

thinking?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">One down, four to go.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Why don't you tell us what your purpose is Worth!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">I've wondered that myself. I'm just a guy, I work in an
officebuilding, doing officebulding stuff. I wasn't
actually bursting joie de vivre before I got here. Life
just sucks in general.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">I can't stand that attitude.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Because, he's right.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What´s your purpose Quentin?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Kids.. Three of them... I haven't made my piece yet.
I'm getting out of here no matter what. That's where
my strength comes from. You people find yours wherever you
got it. For Christ's sake. What do you live for? Don't you
have a wife or a girlfriend or something?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Nope, I got a pretty nice collection of pornography

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Nice, nice. I ain't got anyone either, but I'm not giving
up. I'm pissed off. The came into our homes. They stripped
us bare. They took my rings. They took my... my amethyst.
I wanna know who's responsible.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Leaven, your glasses? You don't need them?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Only for reading.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Well, they took off her jewelry, but they must have put
these on you. If nothing is random... why are they here.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin opens a door in the wall. We see three numbers:
582 434 865. On the other side there's the numbers: 149 413 568.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Leaven, what do you read in school? Math?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">What can they mean?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven takes the glasses and begins to study the numbers.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">149?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven opens a new door. The numbers we see are: 645 372 xxx
-649
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Primenumbers. I can't believe I didn't see it before.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">See what?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">It seems like if any of these numbers of prime, then the room is
trapped. Ok, 645... 645, that's not prime. 372... no. 649...
Wait, 11 x 59, it's not prime either. So that room is safe.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Wait, wait, wait. How can you make that decision based on one

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">I'm not. The incinerator thing was prime: 083. The
molecularchemical thing had 137, the acidroom had 149.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">You'd remembered all that in your head?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">I have a facility for it.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Leaven, you beautiful brain... Boot it.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Holloway throws the boot. Nothing happens.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Ok, out of the way.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Brains before beauty.

Leaven jumps into the room............... Nothing happens......

<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The camera pans around for some time. First we see the numbers:
656 778 462, then we see Leaven thinking.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">How long have we been in here

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Nine or ten hours.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
We see a door closing. Then we see Leaven rubbing her eyes.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">How do you know?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">5 'o clock stubble. the last thing I remember was shaving.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">I guess I missed breakfeast... or lunch... or whatever

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Now don't worry. I'll be home in time for dinner.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">If we get out, I'l make you dinner.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">You got a date.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin opens a door and Leaven looks at the numbers inside.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Doing good.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">I need to smoke! I could smoke a butt of a sidewalk.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Holloway... Just real yourself in a bit. Come on. Were moving
along, things are looking up.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Ok. You're right, I quitted smoking years ago. I just need to
be occupied.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Talk to me. Have a conversation. What kind of doctor are you
anyway?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Uh, you know, the free kinda... Er, come on help me. Tell me
about your rugrats.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Ok. We have three boys. Nine, seven and five.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Oh, good God. Poor woman. There's no way I'd survived that.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">She didn't either................. She's not dead, we're just
separated.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">I'm sorry, I can't just shoot the breeze.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">These numbers aren't prime.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Ok. Clear.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Excuse me, sorry.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">You could try and help me out here buddy.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">No, I couldn't
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The group crawls into the new room. Shortly afterwards they are
in a green room, with everyone looking down in a new room.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">This one is trapped too.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin closes the door.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">We have to backtrack?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin looks up.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Not yet.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Oh, no.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Everyone looks up on the door. the Quentin looks at Leaven.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Read them to me.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin takes of his shirt. Leaven is ready to hold it.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">What are you? His coatrack? Oh please.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin begins to crawls up to the door. As he wants to open
the door, he says:
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">It's stuck!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
As Quentin opens the door, a guy falls down and almost hits
Leaven. Quentin jumps down and the new guy stands up.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">This room is green.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Kazan begins to knock his head into the wall.

<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Holloway.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Holloway now looks at Kazan.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Hi there.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Holloway puts a hand on Kazan's forehead.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">This room is green.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Yes it is.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">I wanna go back to the blue room.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Is it shock or what?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">I think he's mentally handicapped.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">I like the blue room.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Jesus Christ!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">He almost broke my neck.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Hey there, are you all alone? Do you wanna hold my hand, honey?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">Butter first, then honey, Kazan. Butter first then honey.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">How did he survive?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">I wanna go back to the blue room.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">There's lots of blue rooms. We'll find another one to you
real soon.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">This is just way too bizarre.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Will you just worry about your own numbers...
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven looks molested.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Go on, I'll look after him.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven points at the ceiling.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Safe, obviously. Since he almost fell on my head.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Shall we go for a walk? Kazan, do you wanna go for a walk?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
As Quentin begins to crawl up to the door. Kazan gets
terrified. He hits himself with the one hand on his head.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Erm' Quentin. Let's not make him do the climbing thing right away.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Holloway!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">Holloway.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The screen fades and next time we see something is in a new
room where Kazan opens a new door.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Could they have taken us all the way to New Mexico?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What are you talking about Holloway?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">I'm talking about: "Where do you hide something this big?" It has at 

least got to fill something.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Holloway stands walks over to Quentin and stands beside him.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">I'm sorry to shake your foundations Quentin, but you have no idea
where your tax-dollars go.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Free clinic doctors?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Only the military industrial complex can afford to build something
this size.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Holloway, what's the military industrial complex? Have you ever been 

there? I'm tellin' you, it's not that complex.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">And how would you know from where you are.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What do you think these establishments is? It's just guys like me. Their 

desks are bigger, but their jobs aren't. They don't conspide, they... buy boats. No, 

this place is... Remember Scaramanga? The bad guy in "The Man With The Golden Gun". 

It's some rich psyco's entertainment.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Is that what you think?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Clear!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Holloway crawls into the passage.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Ok, you're a cop. Single bullet theory. Right on.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
As Holloway lands in the new room, she starts to lose her
breath. It seems like she's being choken.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Gas!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Holloway! Get back here.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
But Holloway stays where she is.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">It's ok. I just swallowed my button.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">I hate this! I hate this!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Your boy's having a conniption sitting there.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
A door is being opened.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">It's like crème without coffee.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">She needs a break.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">She can do it.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Holloway crawls into Kazan and makes him touch her hair. And
then back to the other room.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">They don't look prime to me.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Is that your two bits worth, Worth?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Of course it's what is worth.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Well?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Well, he's right. Not prime.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin jumps into the new room.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">STOP! In front of you!!!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
A lot of wires or whatever is being shot down from the ceiling
and the slowly surrounds Quentin, rotates and Quentin
just jumps away before he gets split up into several pieces.
But it wasn't without pain. Quentin gets cut on one of his legs.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">What is it?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin gets back into the room.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">SHUT UP!!!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The door closes.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">I don't know what happened. it wasn't prime.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Quentin, hold still!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Somebody stop that rackets!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Worth.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Leave the boots.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Worth joins Kazan to make him shut up.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">And shut the fucking door!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The door closes.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">I had a feeling about that fucking guy. He knew about that trap.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">But these numbers aren't prime.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Then your numbersystem failed, but he knew.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Knew what? How could he know?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">You're the paranoid, think about it. His only function so far is
to kick us when we're down.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">So, he has a bad attitude. So you think that makes him spy.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Trust me on this, it's my job to read people like an x-ray.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The door opens and Worth comes in with Kazan. Worth holds him
for his eyes.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">He doesn't like red rooms.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Worth makes Kazan, sit by himself.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">So what happened?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Pmfh, you saw what happened!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Quentin!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">I guess the numbers are more complicated than I thought.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Maybe they mean nothing at all.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">No, it means they're more involved, the works for us up to now have just 

been bad, I just need more time with them.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">We need to rest anyway.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Well that's handy, like if there was nothing fucking else we could do.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The camera fades. Next time we see Leaven writing some numbers on a piece of metal.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Are they telling you anything?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">They're not Tarot-cards. Do you have any idea on how many variables I 

have to consider before I can decide from numbers this size!?!? They don't reveal 

themselves right away!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">They're like people.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Kazan pulls down his pants to pee.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Oh, gross.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Erm, not here honey, over in the corner.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Everybody looks at him.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Well, he's just peeing!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Jesus Christ!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Excellent! Now it totally reeks in here!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Worth laughs.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">And you find this all pretty funny, don't you?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin goes really close to Worth.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What's your fucking problem Worth? Even Holloway's holding up better than 

you. Get over there and help her with him. That's your job, babysitter!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Jawohl, Kommandant!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Somebody has to taka responsibility around here.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">And that somebody has to be you.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Not all of us have a luxury of playing nihilists.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Not all of us are conceded enough to play hero.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">It's the will to live, everybody's got it Worth, even you, especially you 

hiding behind that cynical front.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">The will to live. That's the warm, coasy feeling deep inside. Thanks 

partner, I'm a new man.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Arh, poor Worth: "Nobody loves me". If that's the chip on your shoulders, 

then why did you lug it all this way? Why didn't you just lie down and die!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin opens the door to the trap from before.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Do it. Show us you have some backbone and jump into the sushimachine. Be 

a man.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Everybody's waiting for Worth to answer. Finally Worth stands up.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Thought so.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Fuck you Quentin. I don't wanna die, I'm just being realistic. Do you 

think they just builded this thing so we could just walk out of it?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Do you think they would lay clues, if there wasn't a way out.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">You think we matter, we don't

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Put us out of your misery so we can get on and get out of here.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Oh, you're not getting out.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Yes, we are!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">There is no way outta here!!!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Long and nervebreaking silence.

<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Got ya.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">How... Do you know?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Answer the question Worth.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Oh, God!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Who are you?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">I am the poison. I designed the outer shell.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">What?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">The shell, the sarcophagus.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">You builded this thing?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Not this part, the exterior. I don't know anything about the numbers or 

anything else in here. I was contracted to draw plans for a hollow shell. A cube.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">A cube! Why didn't you tell us?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">For Gods sake, Worth. You knew what it was.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">No

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Worth! You're lying.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Not first.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Who's beyond it?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">I don't know.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Who hired you?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">I didn't ask. I never even left my office. I talked on the phone to some 

other guys like me. Specialists working on small details. Nobody knew what it was. 

Nobody cared.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Bullshit! You knew from square one. Look at him, he's up to his eyeballs 

in this thing.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">No Quentin. That's how they stay hidden. You keep everyone separated so 

the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. The brain never comes out in 

the open.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Whose brain?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">It's all the same machine right. Pentagon. Multinational coorporations. 

The police! If you do one little job. You build a widget in Saskatoon. The next thing 

you know, it's two miles under the desert, the essential component of a deathmachine. 

I was right! All along my whole life I knew it. I told you Quentin. Nobody's ever 

call me paranoid again. We gotta get out of here and blow the lid of this thing.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Holloway, you don't get it.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Then tell me, please, I need to know.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">It's maybe hard for you to understand, but there's no conspiracy. Nobody 

is in charge. It's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a masterplan. 

Can you grasp that? Big brother is not watching you.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What kind of fucking explanation is that?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">It's the best you´re gonna get. I looked and the only explanation I can 

come to is that there is nobody up there.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Somebody had to say yes to this thing.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">What thing? Only we know what it is.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">We have no idea, what it is.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">We know more than anybody else. I mean somebody might have known 

sometime, before they got fired or voted out or sold it. But if this place ever had a 

purpose, then it got miscommunicated or lost in the shuffle. This is an accident, a 

forgotten propetual, public, worksproject. Do you think anybody wants to ask 

questions? All they want is a clear conscience and a fat paycheck. I mean, I lead on 

my desk for months. This was a great job!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Why put people in it?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Because it's here. you have to use it or admit it's pointless.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">But it is pointless!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Quentin... That's my point.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">What have we come to? It's so much worse than I thought.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Not really, just more pathetic.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">You make me sick, Worth!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">I make me sick too. We´re both part of the system. I drew a box - you 

walk a beat. It's like you said Quentin is: Keep your head down, keep it simple, just 

look at what's in fron of you! I mean nobody wants to see the big picture. Life's too 

complicated. I mean, let's face it. The reason we're here is it's out of control.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin turns around.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Is that how we're ruining the world?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Daah! Have you been on glue all of your life. I felt guilty for ruining 

the world since I was like... seven. God! If you need someone to blame, throw a rock.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Now I feel better.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">That's why you stayed with us. To confess.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Still looking for someone to bust, Quentin?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin turns around again and begins to beat Worth.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Quentin, Quentin, STOP IT!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven grabs Quentin's arm.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">We need him.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What for?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Have you gone absolutely mad? He's the only one who knows nything about 

the place.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Worth falls to the ground. Quentin walks away.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Worth...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Hi...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">So there's this outer shell.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Yeah.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">And it's a cube, like this?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">I assume so.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Are there any doors?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">There's one door.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Where?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Wherever the doorguy put it. Six guesses and it's sealed from the 

outside.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">What are the dimensions of the outer shell?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">434 feetsquare.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven starts to take steps inside the room until she gets to Kazan.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">May I?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Come on. Side over.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">14 by 14 by 14.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">The inner cube cannot be flushed by the shell. There is a space.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">One cube?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">I don't know. It makes sense.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Well, the biggest the cube then can be is... 26 rooms heigh, 26 rooms 

across, so... 17.576 rooms.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">17.576 rooms? Oh, God that makes me queasy.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Descartes...
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven opens a new door and puts on her glasses.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Leaven, you are a genius!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
We see three numbers: 517 478 565
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Cartesian co-ordinates, of course, coded Cartesian co-ordinates. They are 

uses in geometry to plot points on a three-dimensional graph.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">In English. Slower.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Bonjour, these numbers are markers, a grid-referance, like altitude and 

longitude on a map. The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Then where are we?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">It works! Ok, all I have to do now is add the numbers together. The X 

co-ordinate is 19, Y is 26 rooms. So that places us... seven rooms from the edge.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Alright, let's go.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Just out of curuiosity. I mean don't hit me again or anything. But what 

are you gonna do when you get there?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Maybe we can get the door open.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Wrong.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">What we need to do is figure out how we get around the traps.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">I'm dealing with that Holloway. I'm looking for practical solutions here.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Well, you haven't found any yet!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">We cut the risk with the numbers and the boot. Worth will go in first.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">No he won't Quentin, we take turns!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Relax.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The camera fades. The first we see is someone nervous playing with his/hers button.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Is there room for two in there?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin crawls in to Leaven.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QIENTIN
<p ID="dia">What's the matter?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">These co-ordinates: 14, 27, 14.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What about them?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Well, they don't make sense. Assuming the cube is 26 rooms across, there 

can't be a co-ordinate larger than 26. If that was right, then we would be outside 

the cube.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven looks up, and looks around.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">No, not outside the cube.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">I guess that means we're not having dinner.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The camera fades. First we see the group opening the door in the floor.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">Trap, trap, trap. TRAP!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
We see a blue room. Just after Kazan says trap the last time. A lot of spears come 

out from the walls until the room is filled with spears. In the end the spears go 

back again.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">TRAP!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The spears come again, and goes away in the end.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">(Whispers) It's soundactivated. BOOOH!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The spears come, and goes away. They close the door.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Lovely.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">How come the sound of the door-opening didn't set it off?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Must be reat to ignore it.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">So that's it. The edge is surrounded by traps.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Well, I guess we have to backtrack and try somewhere else.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Who knows how many detours we'll have to take. I say we cross the bitch.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Right.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">How many boots do we have left Holloway?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
They look at Kazan's feet. Just one boot left.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Get it off him. We know how it works, we just have to be quiet.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Pretty fucking quiet.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">I'm glad you're on sight Worth, because you're up.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Kazan makes a sound.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">And he's not coming.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Of course he is.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">No way!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">You're not leaving him behind.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">He's unpredictable. When we get to the edge we can come back for him, but 

he will get somebody killed here. Am I right?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Shame on you. Will you look at yourselves. What have you turned into? 

They may have taken our lives away, but we're still human beings. That's all we've 

got left.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">We'll come back for him.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">That's a lie and you know it.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">He'll be quiet.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin opens the door and puts Worth down there. He hangs in the ceiling by himself 

now with a boot in his mouth. He crawls down the wall. Meanwhile we hear something 

nearby. As it's no longer is to hear. Worth opens a door, nothing happens, and crawls 

in. Leaven is up next. Afterwards Holloway. Next is Kazan. As Leaven is in Worth and 

Holloway stands on the floor. Kazan crawls in the ceiling and afterwards he crawls 

the wrong way. Holloway goes to get him. Suddenly his pants are stuck in the handle 

on the floor. Holloway tries to unloose it. Next up is Quentin. Now all is in except 

Quentin. He is on his way. In the floor the door is opening. So Quentin hurries up 

and aren't safe as the handle stops turning. He waits to be speared. Nothing happens.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
 KAZAN
<p ID="dia">Hah!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Now the spears come again, Quentin just makes it into the passage. Now we are in a 

red room. Quentin grabs Kazan and almost beats him.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">You fucking fuck!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">That's enough!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">He's a trap!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Let him go right now!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Law of the jungle Holloway. He's a danger in the pack!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Let him go you nazi!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin lets go of Kazan.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What did you call me?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Quentin! You let that innocent boy go.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">You listen to me woman. Every day I mop up after your bleeding heart. The 

only reason why you exist is because I keep you! I know your type. No kids, no man to 

fuck you. So you go around outraged sticking your nose up in other peoples assholes, 

sniffing their business! You missed your boat Holloway. You are all dry up inside 

there aren't you? That's your fucking problem.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The others look shocked.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">How dare you say that to her? You don't know her Quentin. None ouf us 

know eachother here.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Oh, I do.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">No you don't!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">No wonder your wife left you. All that bottled-up anger. And a thing for 

young girls.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin slaps Holloway in the face. He looks insulted.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">God help you Quentin. Did you smack your kids around too?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Is anybody besides me interested in what's on the other side of that 

door?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Open it.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Door number six, not door number one, door number two.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Open the fucking thing.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">("singing") Sunshine.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Worth opens the door. Now we see something completely black. Only with a little light 

from rooms below and on the other sides. It's the edge, the shell.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">Nighttime.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">My old friend the shell.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Worth crawls into the passage.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">It's there. Morning!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Now we hear a gigantic echo.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Hang on to me.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin crawls in and Worth crawls into the room again.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Can't see shit. Nothing to hang on to.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin crawls back.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">We have to try something. We gotta see if the door's over there. Someone 

has to swing over there and take a look. We make a rope of our clothes. Take it off. 

I'll tie it onto myself.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Yeah, you're gonna go. You weigh like 500 pounds it'll snap in two 

seconds. I'm the lightest.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Forget it.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">I'll go.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">I'm going Holloway.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">She's right Quentin, you're too heavy. I'm the lightest after Leaven. 

Anyways it's my turn.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
As Quentin ties the clothes, Holloway and Worth talks together.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">How long did you know people we're put in here.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">A couple of months.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">That's not long , if you consider your whole life.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">I am.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">You opened my eyes Worth, that´s something.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">David.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">Helen.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">And such a Helen.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Holloway begins to crawl outside the room. She's almost crying.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">That's as far as you go.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">There's nothing down here. Hold tight. I'll try swinging over there. 

Place yourself I'm gonna try again. Ok, one more time.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Hurry, you're getting heavy.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Third time Holloway tries to swing over to the shell there's a big crash. The others 

now drops the grip of the rope. Quentin just reaches the end of the rope, as Holloway 

is falling. The others graps Quentins feet as he is almost out fo the room too.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">HOLLOWAY
<p ID="dia">What the hell is going on?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Get up here now!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Holloway crawls up. In the end Quentin can reach her arm. First Quentin smiles, 

Holloway smiles too. But then Quentin looks someway different. Holloway knows what is 

going to happen.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Quentin...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Do you got her?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Is she Ok?

Quentin drops Holloway and crawls back into the room.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">She... slipped.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">Holloway.

Leaven sits down i a corner. Quentin walks over to her.

<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Sssh! Come on Kazan. Kazan will you please stop doing that!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Don't even talk to me.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">We gotta get down to the bottom. It'll be easier to get on to shell from 

there. It's a long fucking way with only one boot. But we gotta do it, before we get 

too weak. You gotta keep cracking the numbers Leaven.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">I can't think anymore.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Sure you can. It's your gift.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">It's not a gift, it's just a brain.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Let her sleep for a while. We haven't slept for fucking hours.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Ok, one hour.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">How the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">An hour is as long as I say.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The group go to sleep. In the background weird music is to hear. After a little 

while, we see someone taking the boot away from Worth. Then we see a hand holding 

Leaven for the mouth. Then Quentin is bending towards Leaven and afterwards we see 

him carry Leaven. The next we see is a door closing.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">What are you doing?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">We have to make it down to the bottom. There'll be quiet there and you 

can concentrate.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Do you just wanna leave them?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">They're traps! We are the key. I get us down there. You think us out. 

Believe in me. Try to see what I see, how my mind works. THRASH! When I look into 

someone's head like a fucking x-ray. I looked through the walls. I dreamed him at his 

desk, designing everything. He can't let you solve the puzzle. There is a purpose. We 

are the purpose. The cube is us.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin begins to touch Leaven.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Quentin...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">We fit like numbers. A man and a woman. Two halves of the equation. I 

take you down. The perfect key.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin goes further and tries to touch her breasts.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">I'll slip you on the lock.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven runs away. Quentin stands up.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Leaven... It's time to go down.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin tries to catch her. Meanwhile a door is being opened. Worth comes jumping 

hitting Quentin to the floor. Kazan enters the room too. The door closes.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Get away from her. Leaven, they're fucking spy's. Him, the retard. 

Holloway had outside information about my family. She went too far.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">You dropped her.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Just go Quentin

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Give us the boot, you pig!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin turns around and suddenly hits Worth with the boot. Then he walks towards 

Leaven.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">You don't want the boot.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Then Quentin again hits Worth several times. Afterwards he opens the door in the 

floor.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">You wanna come with us Worth? Down the hatch.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin throws Worth down the hole in the floor. As Worth hits the floor, he starts 

laughing.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What the fuck's with him?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The others crawl down to Worth. He lies on the door, on the handle. As the camera 

switches angle, we see a corpse with the face down. Quentin turns the corpse with his 

foot. It's Rennes. Quentin drops the boot.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">How does he...?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">(laughing) It's The Wren, the old Renster.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">How could...?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">(laughing) We've been going in circles

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">That can't be.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin grabs Leaven and opens a door.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Where are we?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">I don't know.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Where are we???

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">You figure it out! You haven't done anything. All you do is freak out! 

YOU MURDERER!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven starts crying. Worth stands up and laughs. Quentin sits down.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">You were right Worth. There is no outta here.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin starts crying. Kazan comes and touches his hair.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">(crying) Get away from me.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Worth stands up.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Wasn't Rennes killed in that room?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Worth opens the door to were Rennes was killed. There's nothing. All we see is black. 

It's the edge, the shell.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">How come there's nothing out there.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">You see an edge.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">We were not at the edge before. Where's the room that killed Rennes?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Fuck off!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin throws the boot after Worth, but the boot does not him it's being thrown out 

of the room.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Oh, that was good.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What difference does it make? We're dead anyways.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">HEY! Listen to what I'm saying! There was a room there before! We haven't 

been moving in circles, the rooms have!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Of course.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">The rooms?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">That explains the thunder, the shaking. We've been shifting the whole 

time.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">It's the only logical explanation. I'm such an idiot.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">What are you on to Leaven.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Give me a minute. The numbers are markers point on a map, right?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Right.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">And how do you map a point that keeps moving?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Permutations.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven nods.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Permu... what?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Permutations. A list of all the co-ordinates the room passes through. 

Like a map that that tells you where the room starts, how many times it moves and 

where it moves to.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">The numbers tell you all that?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">I don't know. I've only been looking at one point on the map, which is 

probably the startingposition. All I saw, was how the cube looked like before it 

started to move.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Ok, so it's moving. How do we get out?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">27. I know where the exit is.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Where?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Stay away from me.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Back off, Quentin!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">I just wanna know, don't you wanna know?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">You remember that room we passed through before, the one with the 

co-ordinate larger than 26?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">What about it?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">That co-ordinate placed the room outside the cube.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">A bridge?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Right, but only in it's original position.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">What are you talking about?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Look, the room starts off as a bridge, then it moves it's way through the 

maze, which is where we ran into it, but at some point it must return to it's 

original position.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">So the bridge is just a bridge...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">... in a short period of time. This thing is like a giant 

combinationlock, when the rooms are in their startingposition ht elock is open. But 

when they move out of the linement the lock closes.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Well the size of us... It must take days to complete a full cycle.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">So when does it open?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Now we see Leaven doing some math again. Quentin crawls towards her.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Don't! We find it's original co-ordinates by adding the numbers, the 

permutations is found by subtracting the numbers. It's it. The room moves to 0, 1 and 

-1 on the x-axis, 2, 5 and -7 on y, and 1, -1 and 0 on z.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">And what does that mean.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">You suck in math? Ok, I need the roomnumbers around as a referencepoint.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">666... 897... 466...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">567... 898... ok?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Yes!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">And 545... Did you get that?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">656... 778... 462...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">That's enough. X is 17, y is 25 and z is 14. Which means this room makes 

two more moves before returning to it's original position.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Do we have time?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Maybe...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Then let's go.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Can you work out the traps in the system?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Fuck the traps, let's get to the bridge.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Well you threw out our last boot, you fucking idiot.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Technically I can identify the traps.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Technically?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">First I thought they were identified by primenumbers, but they're not. 

They're identified by a number that are the power of a prime.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Ok, so?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Can you calculate that?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">The numbers are huge.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">But you can, right? You can?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">I have to calculate to numbers of factors in each set. Maybe if I had a 

computer...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">You don't need a computer.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Yes, I do.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Figure it out!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Yes, I do!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">I'm not dying in a fucking ratmaze.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Look! No one in the whole world could do it mentally! Look at the number: 

567898545. There's no way I can factor that. I can't even start on 567. It's 

astronomical!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN

<p ID="dia">Factors...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">Three...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN

<p ID="dia">Gumdrop!

<p ID="dia">Kazan, I'll give you a whole box of gumdrops for each answer.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">Gumdrops come in bags.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">I'm gonna find him. What do you think?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">You don't have a lot of lives left.

We see Kazan in a red room. He's terrified. Then we see Worth entering a blue room, 

then we see Leaven step on a piece of glass, the one from her glasses. Then we see 

Worth in the ceiling of the red room with Kazan.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Kazan?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">I didn't move.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Yeah, good. Erm, you have to climb up here, ok?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">I don't like that.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven opens a door and studies the numbers.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">14... 26... 14... WORTH GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Five bags of gumdrops?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">27 bags total.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">27 bags, deal.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Come here Worth, this room's next move takes it to the bridge.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">We're coming.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Over here. Move it. We don't have much time come on.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Worth and Kazan crawls in to Leaven's room. Leaven closes the door. They just make 

it, before the room moves. As we see the group again, they lie down.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Worth...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Eaoh, it' better be it.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">It should be.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Where?
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven opens a door, there's nothing behind it. She closes it again.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Ooh, arh.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Give me a minute. Be patient. So guess what, this was the room we started 

in. I was right, we should never have moved in the first place.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The room starts to shake, it's moving. As it stops, Leaven opens the door. We see a 

red room.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">The bridge.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">Red...

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Kazan.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">KAZAN
<p ID="dia">38079

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Clear!!!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
They enter the red room. Leaven closes the door. Kazan opens a new door. We see 

daylight. Worth sits down.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Worth???

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Go ahead.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">What are you doing. You can't quit now. It's not your fault!!!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">I have nothing to live for out there.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">Was is out there.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Boundless human stupidity.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
In the background we hear a door opening.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">LEAVEN
<p ID="dia">I can live with that.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Leaven says some strange sounds, she rises. Behind her we see Quentin with a door 

handle. Quentin has stabbed Leaven in the back. He drops her to the floor. He's 

covered with blood. Kazan closes the door to the daily life.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Nooo!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Worth hits Quentin quite hard. But just after Quentin does the same to Worth.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">WORTH
<p ID="dia">Kazan get out to the door!
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Quentin stabs Worth with the handle. Worth falls to the ground. Quentin tries to 

reach Kazan.
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
</p><p><p ID="speaker">QUENTIN
<p ID="dia">Red, Kazan.
</p><p><p ID="act">
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Kazan opens the door. Meanwhile the room starts to move. As Kazan is outside the 

room, Quentin grabs his t-shirt. As he is just halfway out he can't move anymore. 

Worth holds Quentins leg. Quentin gets split up in two parts. Afterwards we see the 

room move. There's blood on the inner cube. In the room again we see Worth crawl 

towards Leaven. Halfway he stops moving he dies. The last we see of the movie is 

Kazan looking at the inner cube, before he turns around and disappears into the 

bright, white light.
