MONTAGE OF THE ORIGINS OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD

PROFESSR (V.O.)
Legend has it that it was written by the Dark Ones. Necronomicon ex 
Mortis, roughly translated, "Book of the Dead". The book served as a 
passageway to the evil worlds beyond. It was written long ago. When the 
seas ran red with blood. It was this blood that was used to ink the 
book. In the year 1300 AD, the book disappeared.

INT. CAR - DAY

Driving on a remote highway.

LINDA
So what's this place like?

ASH
Well it's a little run-down... but, uh, it's right up in the mountains.

LINDA
Are you sure it's deserted?

ASH
Oh yeah... I think so.

Linda giggles.

ASH
Whoa.

LINDA
(giggle)
Ow. 

ASH
So what do you think kid?

LINDA
I love it Ash.

LINDA
I feel funny about being here. What if the people who own the place 
come home?

ASH
They're not gonna come back. Even if they do we'll tell them the car 
broke down or something like that.

LINDA
With your car, they'd believe it.

ASH
Hey, what do you say we have some champagne hey baby?

LINDA
Sure.

ASH
After all, I'm a man and you're a woman, at least last time I checked.

LINDA
OK.

ASH
Hey! There's a... There's a tape recorder here.

LINDA
See what's on it.

PROFESSOR
(on tape)
This is Professor Raymond Knowby, Department of Ancient History, log 
entry number two. I believe I have made a significant find in the 
Castle of Candar. Having journeyed there with my wife Henrietta, my 
daughter Annie and Associate Professor Ed Getly. It was in the rear 
chamber of the castle that we stumbled upon something remarkable. 
Morturom Demonto, the "Book of the Dead". My wife and I brought the 
book to this cabin where I could study it undisturbed. It was here that 
I began the translations. The book speaks of a spiritual presence. A 
thing of evil that roams the forests and the dark bowers of man's 
domain. It is through the recitation of the book's passages that this 
dark spirit is given license to possess the living. Included here are 
the phonetic pronunciations of those passages. "Cunda astratta montose 
eargrets gutt nos veratoos canda amantos canda".

ASH
Linda? Hey Lind...


EXT. CABIN

ASH
Linda!?! Linda...


AT THE CABIN - DAY

ASH
It's gone. The sun's driven it away. Yeah. For now. Gotta... Gotta blow 
out of here for now...

EVIL FORCE
Join us.

ASH
Ah. Oh. Oh God. No. Oh no. No... no... No!!!! Gotta, I gotta get a grip 
on myself here.


AIRPORT - NIGHT

Annie
(to Crewer)
Thank you.

ED
Annie!

ANNIE
Hi!

ED
How'd the expedition go?

ANNIE
Great. I found the pages of the Book of the Dead.

ED
Yeah, I got your telegram. Thanks. So what condition are they in?

ANNIE
Take a look.

ED
They haven't aged a day in 3000 years.

ANNIE
Maybe longer.

ED
When do we begin the translations?

ANNIE
Tonight. Is everything all set with my father?

ED
Well, it should be but I haven't spoken with him in a week. There's no 
phone in the cabin. We'll take my car, it'll take us about an hour to 
get there. Annie you hinted in your telegram that your father was onto 
something in the first part of his translations. What has he found in 
the Book of the Dead?

ANNIE
Probably nothing. But just possibly, a doorway to another world?


INT. CABIN - NIGHT

LINDA
(possessed)
Dance with me.
(cackling)

ASH
Ahhhhhh Ehhh... yeah, just a...

ASH
You're going down. Chainsaw.

LINDA
Please Ash... please don't hurt me. You swore- you swore that we'd 
always be together. I love you.

ASH
Nooo!

LINDA
(possessed)
Yah! Your lover is mine and now she burns in Hell.

ASH
Oh yeah, alright... OK. 


INT. CABIN - NIGHT

Ash looks at his reflection in a mirror.

ASH
I'm fine... I'm fine.

MIRROR ASH
I don't think so. We just cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw. Does 
that sound fine?
(chuckle)

ASH
You bastards! You dirty bastards! Give me back my hand! Give me back my 
haaaaand!!


AT THE WRECKED BRIDGE - NIGHT

ANNIE
Excuse me. Excuse me. Is this the road to the Knowby cabin?

JAKE
That's right. And you ain't going there.

ANNIE
And why not?

ANNIE
There must be another way in. There's gotta be another road or 
something.

BOBBY JOE
Sure ain't no road. Why the hell do you want to go up there for anyway? 
Huh?

ANNIE
None of your business.

JAKE
(clap)
Hey! I just remembered. Why, yeah... that's right. There is a trail. 
You could uh, follow Bobby Joe and me.

ED
Sounds alright to me.

JAKE
But it'll cost ya.

ANNIE
How much?

JAKE
Forty fi...
(nudge from Bobby Joe)
Hundred bucks.

ANNIE
Tell ya what, you take my bags and you got a deal.

JAKE
Sure.
(dorky laugh)

ANNIE
(with an evil grin)
Heh heh.


INT. CABIN - NIGHT

ASH
Ah. Ah. That's right. Who's laughing now? Who's laughing now? Yahhhh! 
Ahhhh! 


TRAIL TO CABIN - NIGHT

JAKE
Jesus H. Christ... thought all she was talking about were those two 
Goddamn little bags.


INT. CABIN - NIGHT

ASH
Here's your new home. 
(BOOM!)
Aha!! Son of a... Arrgh!
(BOOM! BOOM!)
Gotcha didn't I you little sucker?! Old double barrel here... blow your 
butts to kingdom come. See if we don't...

JAKE
You little bastard! You gonna be alright honey?

BOBBY JOE
I-I don't know. I-I think so.

JAKE
You just sit still for a minute. You know this son of a bitch?

ED
No we thought her father was going to be here. That's why we decided -

ANNIE
Oh my God! Where are my parents? What the hell did you do to them? What 
the hell did you do to them?

ED
Annie, come here. Annie, come here... come here.

JAKE
We'll throw him in there. Crazy buck's gone blood seeking.

ASH
Wait. I made a mistake. Wait. Wait. Wait. I made a mistake.

JAKE
Damn right. Blackmail son of a bitch. 

BOBBY JOE
I hope you rot down there. 


INT. CABIN - LATER - NIGHT

BOBBY JOE
Oh shit!

JAKE
I know it hurts baby, but everything's gonna be fine. Now in about five 
minutes I'm gonna go fetch the sheriff and bring him-

ED
Checked all the other rooms. Folks aren't here. Maybe they never came.

ANNIE
But these are my father's things.

PROFESSOR
(on tape)
It's only been a few hours since I've translated and spoken aloud the 
first of the demon resurrection passages from the Book of the Dead.

ANNIE
Shhh... Listen up. This is my father's voice.

PROFESSOR
(on tape)
And now I fear that my wife has become host to a Candarian Demon. May 
God forgive me for what I have unleashed unto this earth. Last night 
Henrietta tried to... kill me.

ANNIE
No!

PROFESSOR
(on tape)
It's now October 1st, 4:33 PM. Henrietta is dead. I could not bring 
myself to dismember her corpse. But I dragged her down the steps... and 
I buried her. I buried her in the cellar. God help me, I buried her in 
the earthen floor of the fruit cellar.

ASH
Wahhhhhhhhhh!

JAKE
What the hell was that?

ED
Somebody's down there with him.

ANNIE
No, can't be.

BOBBY JOE
Let's get the fuck out of here.

HENRIETTA
(possessed)
Someone's in my fruit cellar. Someone with a fresh soul!

ASH
Ah! Ah! Let me out! There's something down here! Ah!

ANNIE
Let him out!

JAKE
It's a trick, I know it!

ANNIE
Let him out!!

ASH
Move it! Open those chains up!

HENRIETTA
(possessed)
Come to me.

ASH
Ah! Help! Help! Help me!

HENRIETTA
(possessed)
Come to sweet Henrietta. Hahaha.

ANNIE
Hurry!

ASH
Help! Help me please!

HENRIETTA
(possessed)
I'll swallow your soul.

BOBBY JOE
Do something!


INT. CABIN - NIGHT

ASH
There's something out there. That... that witch in the cellar is only 
part of it. It lives... out in those woods, in the dark... something... 
something that's come back from the dead.

BOBBY JOE
Plee! Please let's just get the hell out of here!

JAKE
We're going baby. We're going to get on that trail-

ASH
Nobody's going out that door, not till daylight.

JAKE
Now you listen to me -

HENRIETTA
(singing)
Hush little baby don't say a word, Mama's going to by you a mocking 
bird. If that mocking bird don't sing, Mama's going to buy you a 
diamond ring. If that diamond ring turns brass, Mama's going to buy you 
a looking glass. 

HENRIETTA
Remember that song Annie? I used to sing it to you when you were a 
baby.

ANNIE
Mother?

HENRIETTA
Unlock these chains. Quickly!

ANNIE
No.

HENRIETTA
You were born September 2nd, 1962. I remember it well because it was 
snowing. So strange it would be snowing in September.

ANNIE
That thing in the cellar is not my mother.

ED
(possessed)
We are the things that were and shall be again. Hahahahha. Steps of the 
Book. We want what is yours. Life! Ha ha ha ha! Dead by dawn. Dead by 
dawn.

HENRIETTA
(possessed)
Dead by dawn. Dead by dawn.

ED
(possessed)
Dead by dawn. Dead by dawn.

HENRIETTA
(possessed)
Dead by dawn.

ED
(possessed)
Dead by dawn.

HENRIETTA
(possessed)
Let me out.

JAKE
Thirsty son-of-a-bitch.

ANNIE
Where you going? Help us you filthy coward!

HENRIETTA
(possessed)
Quickly. Set me free. We live! We live still!


STILL IN THE CABIN - NIGHT

JAKE
That's funny.

BOBBY JOE
What?

JAKE
That trail we came in here on? It just ain't there no more. Like, like 
the woods just swallowed her up.

ANNIE
It's so quiet.

JAKE
What the hell was that?

ASH
Maybe something trying to force its way into our world.

BOBBY JOE
It's in there. 

ASH
We'll all go in together.

JAKE
Hell no. You're the curious one.

ANNIE
Hey. I'll go with you.


INT. CABIN - ANOTHER ROOM - NIGHT

JAKE
Shit. I told you there weren't nothing in here no how.

JAKE
Holy Mother o' Mercy.

ANNIE
Father?

SPIRIT
Annie. There is a dark spirit here that wants to destroy you. Your 
salvation lies there. In the pages of the book. Recite the passages. 
Dispel the evil. Save my soul. And your own lives!

BOBBY JOE
Jake. You're holding my hand too tight.

JAKE
Baby, I ain't holding your hand.

JAKE
Hey? Where's Bobby Joe?


INT. CABIN - NIGHT

JAKE
Hey? Where the hell is she? We gotta go out there and find her.

ASH
If she went out in those woods, you can forget about her.

ANNIE
What's wrong?

ASH
Felt like someone just walked over my grave. What's that picture? What 
is that?

ANNIE
In 1300 AD they called this man the, ah, hero from the sky. He was 
prophesied to have destroyed the Evil.

ASH
Didn't do a very good job... Can you find it?

ANNIE
Here it is, two passages. Recitation of this first passage will make 
this dark spirit manifest itself in the flesh.

ASH
Why the hell would we want to do that?

ANNIE
Recitation of this second passage creates a kind of rift in time and 
space. And the physical manifestation of this dark spirit can be forced 
back into the rift. At least that's the best translation that I can -
(shotgun reloading)

JAKE
Uh-huh. That's right. I'm running the show now. We're going to go out 
there in them woods and look for Bobby Joe. Once we find her we're 
getting the hell out of here.

ASH
No you idiot! You'll kill us all. She's dead by now. Don't you 
understand? With these pages, at least we have a chance.

JAKE
Bunch of mumbo jumbo bullshit. These pages don't mean squat. Besides, 
now you ain't got no choice. Now move!


EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

JAKE
Move.

ASH
Look. You're nuts.

JAKE
I said move!

ANNIE
No! You stupid fool!

JAKE
I'll blow your fucken head off.

ASH
Hey. No trail. Where to now?

JAKE
Bobby Joe! Bobby Joe!! Bobby Joe!!!

ASH
You'll get us all killed!

JAKE
Shut up!

ANNIE
Leave him alone!

JAKE
Get outta here... Bobby Joe!!!! Bobby Joe!!!!! Bobby Joe... Where are 
you, girl?

ASH
(possessed)
You're next. Annie!


INT. CABIN - NIGHT

ANNIE
No... no...

JAKE
Ahhhh!

ANNIE
I'm sorry!

JAKE
Get me another room. Get the axe. We'll kill it when it comes back. But 
first, pull this damn thing out of me!

JAKE
Ahhh! I can't breathe, I can't breathe. Hurry!

ANNIE
I'm trying! I'm trying!

JAKE
Ahhhh!

ANNIE
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

JAKE
Check outside the windows. Check the windows, he's probably right 
out... Ahhh! Help me! 

ANNIE
Oh God! Ahhhhh!

ASH
(possessed)
Ahhhhh!! Waahahaha! 

ASH
No! No wait! Listen to me! I'm alright now. That thing is gone! Damn 
it! I said I was alright! Are you listening to me? You hear what I'm 
saying? I'm alright! I'm alright.

ANNIE
OK, maybe you are. But for how long? If we're going to beat this thing, 
we need those pages.

ASH
Then let's head down into that cellar and carve ourselves a witch.

HENRIETTA
(possessed; cackling)
Hahahaha.


INT. WORKSHED

ASH
Groovy.


INT. CABIN - NIGHT

ASH
Those pages are down there somewhere.

ANNIE
"Nos veratos alamemnon conda."

ASH
(whistles)
Let's go. 

HENRIETTA
(possessed)
I'll swallow your soul. I'll swallow your soul.

ANNIE
(singing)
Hush little baby don't say a word, Mama's going to buy you a mock... 
mocking bird.

HENRIETTA
(possessed)
Hey! I'll swallow your soul! I'll swallow your soul! I'll swallow your 
soul!

ASH
Swallow this.
(BOOM!)

ASH
G -

ANNIE
I only completed the first of the passages and that was to make the 
Evil a thing of the flesh!

ASH
Finish it!

ANNIE
There's still the second passage. The one- the one to open the rift and 
send the Evil back!

ASH
Well start reciting it! Now!

ASH
Don't look Annie! Finish the passages! Get rid of it!

ASH
No!!!

EVIL TREE
We've won. We've won. Victory is ours.

ASH
You did it kid. By God... No!!!! Ahhhhh!! For God's sake! How do you 
stop it?


LATE MEDIEVAL ENGLAND

MAN
Slay the beast. It is a deadite!

MAN
Run! Back to the castle!
(BOOM!) 

KNIGHT
Hail he who has come from the skies to deliver us from the terrors of 
the deadites!

CROWD
Hail! Hail! Hail!

ASH
No! No! No!! No!!! No!!!! No!!!! No!!!

FADE OUT



THE END
