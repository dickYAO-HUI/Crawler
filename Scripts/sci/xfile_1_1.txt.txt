X-FILES - The Movie

SCENE 1 

NORTH TEXAS, 35,000 BC 

(We open in a snow storm. Two heavily bundled humans are running 
through the snow, following strange looking tracks which lead into a 
cave. They enter and, once inside, we see sparks fly as they whack a 
couple of rocks together and light torches with the fire. Like all good 
horror movie duos, they split up to continue their search. Soon after, 
one of them hears a strange shriek-type noise in the distance, but 
ignores it and moves on. He then encounters an ice wall, which holds a 
frozen human. Suddenly, the tracker is attacked by a creature we can't 
quite see, due to fast camera cuts. The creature and human roll around 
in combat, the creature slashing the man until he kills him. The man's 
friend appears and stabs the creature with something (looks like a 
stake, maybe his comrade's torch?) and the creature disappears into the 
darkness of the cave. The man looks down at his friend's lifeless form, 
then starts to look around for the creature. They find each other, a 
battle ensues, the man stabs the creature several times and finally 
kills it. From out of its wounds seeps a black oil which takes on a 
life of its own as it changes direction and begins to flow towards the 
man. It enters his body, crawling under his skin from his feet on up to 
his eyes. The man starts to moan and cry out in pain as the camera pans 
upwards leaving us in darkness.) 

SCENE 2 

NORTH TEXAS, PRESENT DAY 

(The darkness is now the view from underneath a boy, Stevie, as he 
falls through the earth, landing in an underground cavern. His three 
friends look down upon him.) 

KID 1
Hey, Stevie, you ok? 

STEVIE
I got... I got... (coughs) I got the wind knocked out of me. 

KID 2
Looks like a cave or something. 

(Stevie looks around and then wanders deeper into the cavern.) 

KID 1
Stevie? What's going on? 

(Stevie reappears with something in his hands, which he holds up for 
the others to see.) 

STEVIE
It's a human skull! 

KID 2
Toss it up here, dude! 

STEVIE
No way butt-wipe, this is mine. Anyway, there's bones all over the 
place, man. 

(Stevie admires the skull, then he looks down and sees a puddle of 
black oil under his right shoe.) 

STEVIE
What the...? 

(Suddenly, he drops the skull and grabs his stomach, looking ill. The 
black oil begins to crawl up his body and onto his face, creeping 
underneath his skin.) 

KID 1
Stevie? 

KID 2
Hey, Stevie, you okay? 

(As he looks up, we see his eyes cloud over with the oil.) 

KID 2
Hey man, let's get out of here. 

(The boys run away from the hole. The camera pans back to show that the 
scene is happening in a suburban area outside a large town. Fade to 
later the same day as fire trucks, marked as "Blackwood County Fire 
Dept.", pull up to the scene.) 

FIRE CHIEF
(looking down hole) Give me a fourteen footer! 

(A ladder slams down onto the bottom of the hole.) 

FIRE CHIEF
(on his radio) Captain Miles Cooledge, got a rescue situation in 
progress. I'll be the whole town HC. Rope's in the hole, (to his men) 
let's go, two down. 

(Two men climb down into the hole and crouch by Stevie, who is lying 
down in the dirt in the cavern.) 

FIRE CHIEF
(talking to radio) What ya got, TC? Talk to me. (static on radio) Do ya 
see the boy? Talk to me. (static) Come back, TC, do ya see the kid? 
(static) Jerry, check TC's radio. (he whacks the radio) TC? (static) 
Glen, South, in the hole. 

(A black helicopter flies in and lands at the scene as some of the 
firemen watch and wonder. Four men in biohazard suits exit and carry a 
person-sized container towards the hole. The fire chief starts to walk 
towards the helicopter as a man, Bronschweig, exits the chopper.) 

BRONSCHWEIG (to the fire chief, indicating the crowd that has gathered 
to watch the proceedings) Get those people out of here! 

(The chief and one of his men yell at the crowd to "Get back!" and they 
slowly move out of the way. Both the chief and Bronschweig start to 
walk towards the hole.) 

FIRE CHIEF
I sent four men down there for the boy. Report is, his eyes have turned 
black. Now we've lost communication with my men. 

(The men in suits carry the container, which now has the boy in it, to 
the helicopter, Bronschweig looks at the boy then follows the men to 
the helicopter, standing and watching them load him on.) 

FIRE CHIEF
What about my men? 

(Bronschweig turns and looks at him as the copter starts to take off.) 

FIRE CHIEF
What about my men?? 

(Several tanker trucks and semi-trucks pull up to the scene.) 

FIRE CHIEF
What the hell is this? 

(Bronschweig watches, and then walks behind one of the trucks where no 
one else can hear. He dials a number on his cell phone.) 

BRONSCHWEIG (in phone) It's Bronschweig. Sir, the impossible scenario 
that we never planned for? Well, we better come up with a plan. 

SCENE 3 

FEDERAL BUILDING, DALLAS, TEXAS 

ONE WEEK LATER 

(The scene opens with FBI agents on the federal building's roof. A 
helicopter lands and out comes Darius Michaud.) 

FBI GUY
We've evacuated the building and been through it bottom to top. There's 
no trace of an explosive device or anything resembling one. 

MICHAUD
Have you sent the dogs through yet? 

FBI GUY
Yes, sir. 

MICHAUD
Well, send 'em through again. 

(He begins to walk away, towards the edge of the roof, facing another 
building across the street.) 

FBI GUY
(to other FBI agents) All right guys, let's do it again. 

(Michaud looks at a building across the street where a lone person is 
walking on the roof. Cut to the other building where we see Scully 
talking on her cell phone.) 

SCULLY
Mulder, it's me. 

MULDER
Where are you, Scully? 

SCULLY
I'm on the roof. 

MULDER
Did you find anything? 

SCULLY
(irritated voice) No I haven't. 

MULDER
What's wrong? 

SCULLY
Well, I just climbed up 12 floors, I'm hot, I'm thirsty and to be 
honest, I'm wondering what I'm doing up here. 

MULDER
You're looking for a bomb. 

SCULLY
Yes, I know that, but the threat was called in to the federal building 
across the street. 

MULDER
I think they have that covered. 

SCULLY
Mulder, when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the rational purpose 
of providing that information is to allow us to find the bomb. The 
rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study the 
statistics, you'd find the model behavioral pattern for virtually every 
case where a threat has turned up an explosive device; and if we don't 
act in accordance with that data, if you ignore it as we have done, the 
chances are great that if there actually is a bomb, we might not find 
it. Lives could be lost .... Mulder. Mulder? 

(he appears behind her) 

MULDER
Boom. 

SCULLY
(startled) Jesus, Mulder! 

MULDER
Whatever happened to playing a hunch, Scully? The element of surprise, 
random acts of unpredictabilty? If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen 
or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilites, we may 
find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be 
programmed, categorized or easily referenced. (he pops a sunflower seed 
into his mouth) What are we doing up here, Scully? It's hotter than 
hell. 

SCULLY
I know you're bored in this assignment, Mulder, but unconventional 
thinking is only gonna get you in trouble now. 

MULDER
What makes you think I'm bored? 

SCULLY
You've gotta quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-
files. There's procedure to be followed now ... protocol. 

MULDER
Maybe we should call in a bomb threat to Houston. I think it's free 
beer night at the Astrodome. 

(Scully attempts to open the door) 

SCULLY
Aww, now what? 

MULDER
It's locked? 

SCULLY So much for anticipating the unforeseen. (Mulder tries to open 
the door and it opens easily, Scully smiles.) ... I had you. 

MULDER
No, you didn't. 

SCULLY
Oh, yeah. I had you big time. 

MULDER
You had nothing. Come on, I saw you jiggle the handle. 

(They exit the stairwell, next to the elevator at the bottom floor, a 
group of children is being led into the elevator.) 

SCULLY
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a definite moment of panic. 

MULDER
You've never seen me panic. When I panic, I make this face. 

(Mulder's face registers no emotion.) 

SCULLY
That was the face. 

MULDER
You didn't see that face. 

SCULLY
I saw that face. (she smiles) You're buyin'. 

MULDER
What? Coke, Pepsi, saline IV? 

SCULLY
Something sweet. 

SCENE 4 

VENDING ROOM 

(Mulder heads down to a room containing the vending machines, passing a 
man on his way out. He puts money in the machine, pushes a button, then 
another, then all of them, nothing comes out. He whacks the side of it, 
then shakes the machine, angry at losing his money. He happens to look 
beside it and notices that the machine is unplugged. He tries to open 
the door, it's locked. He calls Scully on her cell phone (555-0113). 
Cut to the lobby, where Scully is standing, waiting for her drink.) 

SCULLY
(answering her phone) Scully. 

MULDER
Scully, I found the bomb. 

SCULLY
(smiling) You're funny. Where are you, Mulder? 

MULDER
I'm in the vending room. 

(Mulder pounds on the door) 

SCULLY
Is that you pounding? 

MULDER
Yeah, you gotta get somebody to open that door. 

(Scully tries the doorknob, but it doesn't turn) 

SCULLY
Nice try, Mulder. 

MULDER
Look, Scully, it's in the soda machine, you've got about fourteen 
minutes to evacuate this building. 

(Cut back to Scully outside of the vending room, she looks down at her 
watch.) 

SCULLY
Come on, Mulder ... (slight laugh) 

(The camera pans to show that the machine is now open and filled with 
explosives. A timer is ticking down.) 

MULDER
Thirteen fifty-six, thirteen fifty-four, thirteen fifty-two, thirteen 
fifty. You see a pattern emerging here, Scully? 

(Scully looks down and realizes that the key hole has been welded 
shut.) 

SCULLY
Hold on, Mulder, I'm gonna get you out of there. 

(We see Mulder standing in front of the machine, "panic" written all 
over his face. Cut to Scully as she rushes back to the lobby and gives 
orders to the security guard.) 

SCULLY
I need this building evacuated and cleared out in 10 minutes! I want 
you to call the fire department and have them block off the city center 
in a one mile radius around the building! 

GUARD
Ten minutes? 

SCULLY
(she points at him with her phone) Don't think! Just pick up that phone 
and make it happen! (on her cell phone) This is Special Agent Dana 
Scully, I need to speak to SAC Michaud, he's got the wrong building! 

(Numerous police cars and firetrucks pull up to the building. Michaud 
exits a car and begins to hastily walk towards the building. Scully 
comes out to meet him.) 

MICHAUD
Where is it? 

SCULLY
He found it in the vending room. He's locked in with it. 

(Cut to Mulder sitting in a chair in front of the vending machine, 
staring at the bomb, still making his panic face. His phone rings, 
startling him. He lets out the breath he was holding and answers it.) 

MULDER
Scully, you know that face I just showed you? I'm making it again. 

SCULLY
Mulder, move away from the door, we're coming through it. 

(Scully and the bomb team cut through the door with a torch. The door 
is kicked open and everyone piles into the room.) 

MULDER
(to Michaud, as he points at the bomb) Tell me that's just soda pop in 
those canisters. 

MICHAUD
(looking at bomb) It's just what it looks like. A big I.E.D. (pauses) 
Ten gallons of astrolight. Okay, get everybody out of here, clear the 
area. 

FBI GUY
Come on, let's go. 

(Everyone leaves except Michaud, Mulder and Scully) 

MULDER
Somebody's got to stay with you. 

MICHAUD
(irritated) I just gave you a direct order. Now get the hell out of 
here and evacuate the building! 

SCULLY
Can you defuse it? 

MICHAUD
Yes I can. 

MULDER
We got less than four minutes to find out if you're right. 

MICHAUD
Did you hear what I said? (Mulder nods) Get out. 

SCULLY
Come on, Mulder. 

(She starts to leave, Mulder hesitates, looking at Michaud, then turns 
to follow her out. Cut to outside the building as people pour out onto 
the street. Cut back to Michaud sitting passively in the chair in front 
of the bomb. Cut to Mulder and Scully running out of the building. 
Mulder slows down and looks back.) 

SCULLY
Mulder, what are you doing? 

MULDER
Something's wrong. 

SCULLY
Mulder ... 

(Scully grabs Mulder by his arm.) 

MULDER
Something's not right. 

SCULLY
Mulder, get in the car, there's no time! 

POLICEMAN BY CAR
Go on, get in the car! 

(They get into the waiting police car. Shot of inside the building with 
Michaud sitting waiting for the bomb to go off, his face in his hands. 
Cut to the cop car as it drives off, Mulder turning in his seat to look 
at the building. The bomb explodes, sending Michaud flying backwards. 
The building is destroyed, cars are sent flying, Mulder and Scully's 
police car's windows explode as the car rocks from the blast, mucho Big 
Screen Destruction. Mulder and Scully slowly get out of the car and 
look at the damage.) 

MULDER
Next time, you're buying. 

SCENE 5 

FBI HEADQUARTERS 

WASHINGTON, DC 

OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL REVIEW 

(Scully is sitting in the office before a review board. Assistant 
Director Jana Cassidy is speaking to her. Assistant Director Walter 
Skinner is seated on the panel as well.) 

CASSIDY
In light of Waco and Ruby Ridge, there is a heightened need at the 
Attorney General's office to place responsibility as early as possible 
for the catastrophic destruction of public property and loss of life 
due to terrorist activities. Many details are still unclear, but we're 
under some pressure from the Attorney General to give an accurate 
picture of what happened so that she can issue a public statement. We 
know now that five people died, in the explosion. Special ... 

(Mulder enters the room, late, and Cassidy pauses, looking up at him, 
as do Scully and Skinner.) 

CASSIDY
.. Special Agent In Charge Darius Michaud, who was trying to defuse the 
bomb, three firemen from Dallas and a young boy. I'd like to begin this 
interview ... 

MULDER
Excuse me, excuse me, the firemen and the young boy, they were found in 
the building? 

CASSIDY
Agent Mulder, since you weren't able to be on time for this hearing, 
I'd like you to step outside so that we can hear Agent Scully's version 
of the facts so that she will not be paid the same disrespect. 

MULDER
We'd been told the building was clear. 

CASSIDY
You'll get your turn, Agent Mulder, please step outside. 

(Mulder looks at Scully, then leaves the room. He is now seated on a 
bench in the hallway, eating sunflower seeds, husks and all. Skinner 
leaves the hearing room and joins him in the hallway. Mulder stands 
up.) 

SKINNER
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully. 

MULDER
About what? (he sits back down) 

SKINNER
They're asking her for a narrative, they want to know why she was in 
the wrong building. 

MULDER
She was with me. 

SKINNER
You don't see what's going on here, do you? There's forty-five million 
dollars worth of damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No 
suspects have been named. So the story that's being shaped ... is that 
this could have been prevented. 

MULDER
They want to blame us? 

(Skinner sits down next to him.) 

SKINNER
Agent Mulder, you and I both know that if it looks bad, it's bad for 
the FBI. Blame has to be assigned somewhere 

(Mulder looks down at the ground, then looks up at Skinner.) 

MULDER
If they want somebody to blame, they can blame me, Agent Scully doesn't 
deserve this. 

SKINNER
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you. 

MULDER
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the SAC. I ignored a primary 
tactical rule and left him alone with the device. 

SKINNER
Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building, that 
you wanted to go back in. 

MULDER
No. 

(Both men stand as Scully leaves the hearing room and walks over to 
them.) 

SCULLY
(to Skinner) They're asking for you, sir. 

SKINNER
Thank you. (he leaves) 

MULDER
Whatever you told them in there, Scully, you don't have to protect me. 

SCULLY
All I told them was the truth. 

MULDER
They're trying to divide us on this and we can't let them. 

SCULLY
Mulder, they have divided us. They're splitting us up. 

MULDER
What? What are you talking about? 

SCULLY
I have a meeting with OPR day after tomorrow for reimidiation and 
reassignment. 

MULDER
But they're the ones who put us together. 

SCULLY
Because they wanted me to invalidate your investigations into the 
paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that now. 

MULDER
This is not about you, Scully. They're doing this to me. 

SCULLY
They're not doing this. (pause as she collects her thoughts) Mulder, I 
left behind a career in medicine because I thought that I could make a 
difference at the FBI. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now if 
they were to transfer me to Omaha or Cleveland, or some field office, 
it just doesn't hold the interest for me that it once did. Not after 
what I've seen and done. 

MULDER
(realizing what she's saying) You're quitting. 

SCULLY
Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too. 

(Skinner comes back out for Mulder) 

SKINNER
Agent Mulder, you're up. 

SCULLY
(to Mulder) I'm sorry. 

(Mulder begins to walk back to the boardroom) 

SCULLY
Mulder. (she hands Mulder his jacket, which he left on the bench) Good 
luck. 

(Mulder enters the hearing room. Scully pauses for a moment, then turns 
and leaves the building.) 

SCENE 6 

CASEY'S BAR, SOUTHEAST WASHINGTON, DC 

BARTENDER
(filling a glass) I'd say this just about exceeds your minimum daily 
requirement. 

(Mulder empties the glass and as he sets it down he knocks over some of 
the numerous other glasses on the bar.) 

BARTENDER
Whoa, you've gotta train for that kind of heavy lifting. Poopy day? 

(Mulder points his two index fingers at her, then points one finger on 
the bar as a sign that he wants another. She clears away all the empty 
glasses and places one on the bar to be filled. While he waits, Mulder 
looks over his shoulder and notices a man at the bar watching him.) 

BARTENDER
So, whaddya do? 

MULDER
What do I do? 

BARTENDER
Mmm hmm. 

(Mulder takes a sip from his new drink, puts it down and begins his 
tale.) 

MULDER
I'm the key figure in an on-going government charade, the plot to 
conceal the truth about the existence of extraterrestrials. (The 
bartender looks up at the last word, stops wiping down the bar, he now 
has her full attention.) It's a global conspiracy, actually, with key 
players in the highest levels of power, that reaches down into the 
lives of every man, woman, and child on this planet. (he laughs) So, of 
course, no one believes me. I'm an annoyance to my superiors, a joke to 
my peers. They call me Spooky. Spooky Mulder, whose sister was abducted 
by aliens when he was just a kid and who now chases after little green 
men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens or to anyone who 
will listen that the fix is in, that the sky is falling and when it 
hits it's gonna be the shit-storm of all time. 

BARTENDER
Well. I would say that about does it, Spooky. (takes the drink away 
from Mulder) 

MULDER
Does what? 

BARTENDER
Well, looks like eighty-six is your lucky number. 

(Mulder takes some money out of his wallet) 

MULDER
You know, one is the loneliest number. 

(Mulder looks over his shoulder again and sees the man is no longer at 
the bar. He then gets up, wavers a bit, walks to the men's room and 
finds it out of order. He knocks on the women's door and it's occupied. 
He goes out the exit into the alley and relieves himself just above a 
poster for the movie "Independence Day". The man from the bar, Dr. 
Kurtzweil, walks outside.) 

KURTZWEIL
That official FBI business? 

MULDER
What? 

KURTZWEIL
Bet the Bureau's accusing you of the same thing in Dallas. Standing 
around holding your yank while bombs are exploding. 

MULDER
(annoyed) Do I know you? 

KURTZWEIL
No, but I've been watching your career for a good while, back when you 
were just a promising young agent. Before that. 

(Mulder continues his business, then turns his head towards Kurtzweil, 
annoyed that he's still standing there.) 

MULDER
You come out here for a reason? 

KURTZWEIL
Yeah, I did. 

(Kurtzweil unzips his pants, steps up to the wall and begins to relieve 
himself. Mulder starts to walk inside.) 

KURTZWEIL
My name is Kurtzweil, Doctor Alvin Kurtzweil. 

MULDER
Am I supposed to know that name? 

KURTZWEIL
An old friend of your father's. 

(Mulder turns back around to look at Kurtzweil) 

KURTZWEIL
Back at the Department of State we were what you might call fellow 
travellers, but his disenchantment outlasted mine. 

MULDER
All right. 

(Mulder goes back into the bar, Kurtzweil quickly zips up and follows 
him inside. Mulder walks to the coat rack where his jacket is hanging 
and starts to put it on.) 

MULDER
How'd ya find me? 

KURTZWEIL
I heard you come in here now and again, figured you'd be needing a 
little drinkie tonight. 

MULDER
You a reporter? 

KURTZWEIL
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN. 

MULDER
You've got something to tell me, you've got as much time as it takes 
for me to hail a cab. 

(Mulder and Kurtzweil are outside now, Mulder is raising his hand to 
hail a cab.) 

KURTZWEIL
There's something you don't know about the bombing in Dallas. 

MULDER
What's that? 

KURTZWEIL
SAC Darius Michaud never tired, or intended, to defuse that bomb. 

MULDER
(skeptical voice) He just let it explode in his face, huh? 

KURTZWEIL
What's the question no one's asking? (Mulder puts up his arm to hail a 
cab.) Why that building? Why not the federal building? 

MULDER
The federal building was too well guarded. 

KURTZWEIL
No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it did 
have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a 
provisional medical quarantine office there, which is where the bodies 
where found. But that's the thing ... the thing you didn't know. The 
thing you'd never think to check. (pause) Those people were already 
dead. (Mulder looks at him.) 

MULDER
Before the bomb went off? 

KURTZWEIL
That's what I'm saying. 

MULDER
Darius Michaud was a twenty-two-year veteran of the Bureau. 

KURTZWEIL
Michaud was a patriot. The people he was loyal to know their way around 
Dallas. They blew that building to hide something, maybe even something 
they couldn't predict. 

(A Yellow Cab pulls up) 

MULDER
You're telling me they blew up that entire building just to hide the 
bodies of those firemen. 

KURTZWEIL
(nods) And one little boy. 

MULDER
I think you're full of shit. 

KURTZWEIL
(laughs) Do you? 

(Mulder enters the cab and closes the door, looking at Kurtzweil as he 
stands on the curb.) 

MULDER
Arlington, please. (the cab pulls away, Kurtzweil still standing on the 
curb watching him leave. As the cab drives off, Mulder seems to be 
contemplating their conversation, then he comes to a decision.) 
Actually, you know, let's go to Georgetown. Let's go to Georgetown... 

SCENE 7 

SCULLY'S APARTMENT, GEORGETOWN 

(In the darkness of her bedroom, Scully lies awake in bed, staring at 
the ceiling. She hears knocking on her door. She gets up and answers 
it, finding Mulder on the other side.) 

MULDER
Awww, I woke you ... ( he walks in) Did I wake you? 

SCULLY
No. 

MULDER
Why not? It's three in the morning... 

SCULLY
Are you drunk, Mulder? 

MULDER
I ... I ... I was until about 20 minutes ago, yeah. 

SCULLY
Was that before or after you decided to come here? 

MULDER
What exactly are you implying? 

SCULLY
Go home, Mulder. 

MULDER
No, get dressed, Scully. 

SCULLY
It's late. 

MULDER
Get dressed. 

SCULLY
What are you doing? 

MULDER
Just get dressed, I'll explain on the way. 

SCENE 8 

NORTH TEXAS (BLACKWOOD) 

(Two black helicopters fly across the moon. The area below them is a 
"hive" of activity as tanker trucks and tractors criss-cross the 
landscape, punctuated by large white tented domes. The copters land and 
a figure emerges from one, his clothes flapping in the copters' blades' 
backwash. He walks a short distance from the copter, stands and places 
a cigarette in his mouth. From behind his head, we watch him light his 
ciggie as he stares at two large white tents. Finally, the camera 
reveals his identity .... it's the Cigarette Smoking Man (hereby known 
as CSM, although I prefer to call him Cancer Man). Cue the audience's 
boos or cheers depending on your allegiance. He starts to walk toward 
the tents. Cut to inside one of the tents, many men, computers, 
readouts, equipment, a cylinder being wheeled by, then we see a hole in 
the ground, reinforced by steel as a man in a white bio-hazard suit 
climbs out. Another man helps him remove his head gear, revealing that 
it is Bronschweig. He looks over and sees CSM smoking his cigarette. 
CSM steps over some equipment and walks to Bronschweig.) 

CSM
You've got something to show me? 

(Scene cuts to inside the hole, CSM now in a bio-hazard suit, climbing 
down the ladder, Bronschweig already at the bottom.) 

BRONSCHWEIG
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the 
development, which is like nothing we've ever seen. 

CSM
Brought on by what? 

BRONSCHWEIG
Heat, I think. (they begin to walk down a staircase towards another 
area in the hole.) The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, in 
an environment that raised his body temperature above ninety-eight 
point six. 

(They open the door of the other area where more men in biohazard suits 
are working, the air inside giving off a steam associated with extreme 
cold. Bronschweig pulls back a curtain, showing a man covered in goo, 
barely breathing. CSM looks shocked.) 

CSM
This man is still alive. 

BRONSCHWEIG
Technically and biologically. But he'll never recover. 

(The camera pans down the man's body. We can see something moving 
inside his chest.) 

CSM
How can this be? 

BRONSCHWEIG
The developing organism is using his life energy ... digesting bone and 
tissue ... we've just slowed the process. (CSM keeps looking at the 
body in shock, his mouth agape.) Do you want us to destroy this one, 
too? Before it gestates? 

CSM
No, no. We need to try our vaccine on it. 

BRONSCHWEIG
And if it's unsuccessful? 

CSM
Burn it, like the others. 

SCENE 9 

MONTGOMERY COUNTY, MARYLAND 

(Nightime, an overhead camera shot shows cars driving along a road. Cut 
to inside The Bethesda Naval Hospital as Mulder and Scully walk down a 
hallway and reach a security desk.) 

CLERK
ID and floor you're visiting, please. 

MULDER
We're going down to the morgue. 

CLERK
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized 
medical personel. 

MULDER
On whose orders? 

CLERK
General McAddie. 

(Mulder signs the sign-in book, not sure what name he uses!) 

MULDER
General McAddie is who requested our coming down here. We were awakened 
at three AM and told to get down here immediately. 

CLERK
I don't know anything about that. 

MULDER
Well, call General McAddie. (he starts to walk away.) 

CLERK
I don't have the number. (Mulder stops.) 

MULDER
Well, then call the switchboard, they'll patch you through. 

(Clerk starts to fumble through some papers.) 

MULDER
Jesus, you don't know the switchboard number? 

CLERK
I'm calling my C.O. 

(He picks up the phone on his desk, Mulder puts his hand on the 
receiver's button, cutting him off.) 

MULDER
Listen, son, we don't have time to dick around while you demonstrate 
your ignorance of the chain of command. The order came directly from 
General McAddie, you call him. We'll conduct our business while you 
confirm authorization. 

(Mulder and Scully walk off, leaving the clerk standing with his phone 
in his hand. Knowing when he's beaten, the clerk believes Mulder.) 

CLERK
Why don't you head on down and I'll confirm authorization. 

MULDER
Thank you. (quietly to Scully) Why is a morgue suddenly off limits on 
the orders of a general? 

(They arrive in a room full of bodies on gurneys, wrapped up with 
sheets and tied with ropes. Mulder stops at one of them and looks at 
its toe tag.) 

SCULLY
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas? 

MULDER
According to the toe tag. (he starts to untie it.) 

SCULLY
And you're looking for ...? 

MULDER
Cause of death. 

SCULLY
I can tell you that without even looking at him. (she picks up a paper 
near the body's head and reads aloud.) "Concussive organ failure due to 
proximal exposure to source and flying debris." Mulder, this man's 
already been autopsied, you can tell by the way he's been wrapped and 
dressed. 

(Mulder pulls back the covering sheet. It sticks to a gooey substance 
which covers the body.) 

MULDER
Does this fit the description you just read me? 

(Scully walks around to join Mulder on the other side of the gurney, 
looks down and is shocked at the sight.) 

SCULLY
Oh my God. This man's tissue, Mulder ... 

MULDER
It's like jelly. 

SCULLY
There's been some kind of cellular breakdown. (she snaps on a pair of 
latex gloves, slides and pushes her fingers gently along the body.) 
It's completely edematous. There's been no autopsy performed here, no 
Y-incision, no internal exam. 

MULDER
You're telling me the cause of death on that report is false? That this 
man didn't die from an explosion or from flying debris? 

SCULLY
Mulder, I can't tell you what killed this man. I'm not sure anybody 
else could claim to either. 

(Mulder and Scully wheel the body into the lab.) 

SCULLY
Mulder, you knew before we got here this man didn't die at the bomb 
site. 

MULDER
I've been told as much. 

SCULLY
You're saying this is a coverup? Of what? 

MULDER
I don't know, but I have a hunch that what you're gonna find won't be 
categorized or easily referenced. 

(Mulder walks over by the door.) 

SCULLY
Mulder, this is gonna take some time. Somebody's going to figure out 
sooner or later, that we're not even supposed to be here. 

MULDER
We are being blamed for this man's death, I'd like to know what he died 
of, wouldn't you? 

(Mulder leaves the autopsy room.) 

SCENE 10 

DUPONT CIRCLE 

WASHINGTON, D.C. 

4:50AM 

(Scene cuts to a street, a garbage truck loading up as a taxicab drives 
past. Inside the cab is Mulder.) 

MULDER
(to cab driver)
Think that's it up here. 

(He's pointing to an apartment building swarming with cops. Cut to 
Mulder entering an apartment, cops are all over the place. He looks 
around, flips through a couple of magazines on a table marked as 
"National Gynecology & Obstetrics" and "Obstetrics & Gynecology". A 
detective passes by and looks at Mulder.) 

DETECTIVE
Excuse me. Can I help you? 

MULDER
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence? 

DETECTIVE
You have some kind of business with him? 

MULDER
Yeah, I'm looking for him. 

DETECTIVE
You're looking for him for what? 

(Mulder pulls out his FBI badge and shows it to him.) 

DETECTIVE
(over his shoulder to another detective) The feds are looking for him 
too. (to Mulder) Real nice business he's got, huh? 

(Mulder is looking through a bookshelf.) 

MULDER
What's that? 

DETECTIVE
Selling naked pictures of little kids on his computer. (Mulder stops 
and looks at him, obviously surprised by this development. He looks 
down at two books in his hand.) You looking for him for some other 
reason? 

(The first book in Mulder's hand is called, "The Four Horsemen Of The 
Global Domination Conspiracy", the other, "Countdown to the 
Apocalypse", both written by Kurtzweil.) 

MULDER
Yeah .. (pause) I had an appointment for a pelvic examination. (He 
looks up at the detective, gives him a goofy grin and the detective 
laughs.) 

DETECTIVE
You want a call if we turn up this Kurtzweil? 

MULDER
(gives the detective a tap on the arm.) No, don't bother. 

(Mulder leaves the apartment, then exits the building. He stands 
outside looking around, sees Kurtzweil standing at the entrance to the 
alley. He motions to Mulder to come closer. Mulder enters the alley.) 

KURTZWEIL
See this crap? Someone knows I'm talking to you. 

MULDER
(sarcastically)
Not according to the men in blue. 

KURTZWEIL
Well, what is it this time? Kiddy porn again? Sexual battery of a 
patient? 

MULDER
They want to discredit you, for what? 

KURTZWEIL
Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth. 

MULDER
Oh, that end-of-the-world apocalyptic garbage you write? 

KURTZWEIL
You know my work? (he smiles hopefully, but Mulder gives him a slight 
snort and smile, then turns and starts to walk away.) I was right about 
Dallas, wasn't I? 

MULDER
(he stops and turns around.) How? How were you right? 

KURTZWEIL
Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder? 

MULDER
Yeah, it was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the southwestern 
United States several years ago. 

KURTZWEIL
According to the newspaper, FEMA was called out to manage an outbreak 
of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with what the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to 
suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national 
emergency. Think about that! What is an agency with such broad-sweeping 
power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas? 

MULDER
You're saying it wasn't such a small outbreak. 

KURTZWEIL
No, I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus. 

MULDER
Well, what was it? 

(Another police car pulls up to the front of the building. Mulder and 
Kurtzweil walk farther into the alleyway.) 

MULDER
What was it? 

KURTZWEIL
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were 
recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare, a 
virus. 

MULDER
What killed those men? 

KURTZWEIL
What killed them I won't even write about! We have no context for what 
killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale at which it will be 
unleashed in the future. 

MULDER
A plague? 

KURTZWEIL
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a 
quiet war. The sytematic release of an indiscriminant organism for 
which the men who will bring it on still have no cure! They've been 
working on this for fifty years! While the rest of the world have been 
fighting gooks and commies, these men have been secretly negotiating a 
planned armageddon! 

MULDER
Negotiating with whom? 

KURTZWEIL
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a 
holiday, when people are away from their homes. The president will 
declare a state of emergency, at which time all government, all federal 
agencies, will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. FEMA, the secret government. 

MULDER
And they call me paranoid. 

KURTZWEIL
Go back to Dallas, Agent Mulder, and dig. Or we're gonna find out along 
with the rest of the country, when it's too late. 

SCENE 11 

MORGUE 

(Back at the morgue, Scully is conducting the autopsy. She cuts out a 
piece of the ribcage and holds it up to look at it. It's clear. All of 
a sudden, she hears footsteps and sees a soldier and two policemen 
silhouetted in the frosted window of the autopsy room. The soldier 
opens the door, looks around, but finds no Scully. The scene cuts to 
inside the refrigeration room where the bodies are being kept, Scully's 
slowly closing the door behind her. She removes her mask and gloves. 
Her cell phone rings, echoing off the walls, making it sound twice as 
loud as usual. She grabs it quickly and punches the button to answer, 
cutting off the noise.) 

MULDER
(over phone) Hey, Scully, it's me... 

SCULLY
(whispering)
Yeah? 

MULDER
Why are you whispering? 

SCULLY
(whispering)
Mulder, I can't really talk right now. 

MULDER
What did you find? 

SCULLY
Evidence of a massive infection. 

MULDER
What kind of infection? 

SCULLY
I don't know. 

MULDER
All right, listen to me. I'm going home and then I'm booking myself on 
a flight to Dallas. I'm going to get you a ticket too. 

SCULLY
Mulder .... 

MULDER
I need you there with me. I need your expertise. 

SCULLY
Mulder, I have a hearing tomorrow... 

MULDER
I can get you back in time for that hearing, maybe with evidence that 
will blow it away. 

SCULLY
Mulder, I can't! I'm way past the point of common sense here. 

MULDER
This has nothing to do with common sense. Scully? Are you there? 
Scully? (she has hung up on him. He slams the phone down in anger, 
opens the door to the phone booth and the scene cuts to the soldier 
opening the door to the refrigerated room where Scully is. He walks in, 
the sound of his boots echoing off the walls, and the camera pans down 
to show us Scully's hiding place
on the floor under one of the gurneys. A substance drips down from 
above, ewwwww.) 

SCENE 12 

DALLAS, TEXAS 

11:21 AM 

FBI FIELD OFFICE 

(The scene cuts to an airplane landing. Next we see Mulder walking down 
a hallway with the Field Agent.) 

FIELD AGENT
I'm afraid what you're looking for amounts to a needle in a haystack. 
This explosion was so devastating there hasn't been much that we've 
been able to put together just yet. 

(They've now entered the lab area, specimens lie on the tables and men 
in lab coats are working on them.) 

MULDER
Well, I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary really. Maybe 
something from the FEMA offices where those bodies where found? 

FIELD AGENT
Well, we weren't expecting to find those remains, of course, and we 
sent 'em off to Washington. 

MULDER
Well, anything from those offices that you haven't send off to D.C. 
yet? 

FIELD AGENT
Some bone fragments turned up in the sift this morning. We thought we 
had another fatality but we found out FEMA recovered them from an 
archeological site out of town. 

MULDER
Have you examined them? 

FIELD AGENT
No, they're just fossils, as far as we know. 

(Scully enters and stands by the doorway, Mulder sees her. He points at 
her and says to the field agent .... ) 

MULDER
I'd like you to let this person take a look at them, if you don't mind. 

(The field agent turns around, sees Scully and turns back to Mulder) 

FIELD AGENT
(sighs) Just let me see if I can lay my hands on what you're looking 
for. (he walks off) 

(While the field agent is collecting the samples, Scully walks over to 
where Mulder is standing and they talk quietly.) 

MULDER
I thought you said you weren't coming. 

SCULLY
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly not after spending a half an hour 
in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and 
tissue samples I took from the fireman. 

MULDER
And what did you find? 

SCULLY
Something I couldn't show to anybody else. Not without causing the kind 
of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now. 

(She looks over Mulder's shoulder at the field agent, seeing if he's on 
his way back before continuing.) 

SCULLY
But, what those men were infected with contains a protein code that 
I've never seen before. What it did to them, it did extremely fast. 

MULDER
How was it contracted? 

SCULLY
That I don't know. But, unless it can respond to conventional 
treatment, it could be a serious health threat. 

(The field agent returns with the fossils.) 

FIELD AGENT
Like I said, these are just fossils, but they weren't near the blast 
center so they're not going to tell you much. 

MULDER
(handing Scully a vial containing some bone fragments) Right, right, 
why don't you check this out. 

(Scully looks through the microscope, ominous music swells in the 
background and she looks up at Mulder, her eyes wide. Mulder turns to 
the field agent.) 

MULDER
You said you knew the location where these were found? 

FIELD AGENT
Show you right on the map. 

(He walks off towards the map, we presume, as Scully and Mulder look at 
each other. Mulder's lip curls slightly in a yeah-sure-it-was an-
archeological-dig sneer.) 

SCENE 13 

NORTH TEXAS (BLACKWOOD) 

(The camera pans up with a child as he climbs a slide and stands at the 
top, looking over a fence. The music swells again as we see the other 
side of the fence. Three large white domes stand in what appears to be 
endless desert. Next we see under one of the domes as someone removes a 
silvery tube from a hole (oxygen pump, I believe) as a person-sized 
container is swung over the hole via a winch. Bronschweig appears in a 
bio-hazard suit and looks at some gauges at the top of the container. 
He speaks to the men moving the container.) 

BRONSCHWEIG
I want all of these settings checked and recalibrated. I want a steady, 
negative two degrees celcius throughout the transfer of the body after 
I've administered the vaccine. 

(Bronschweig's hood is pulled up. Next we see him with his head fully 
covered by a see-through helmet at the bottom of the ladder leading 
into the hole. He walks down the stairs he led Cancer Man down, picks 
up the vaccine and turns to face the fireman's body. The chest area is 
empty, the alien entity once encased there is gone! Bronschweig's eyes 
swell to twice normal size and the music alerts us to his horror. He 
looks anxiously around the room for the alien, then whips off his 
headgear to get a better view. Finding nothing, he races towards the 
ladder and yells up to the men at the top.) 

BRONSCHWEIG
It's gone! 

ONE OF THE MEN AT THE TOP
What?! 

(Bronschweig begins climbing the ladder.) 

BRONSCHWEIG
It's left the body, I think it's gestated! 

(He stops climbing as he hears a noise and looks off to the side.) 

ONE OF THE MEN AT THE TOP
What's the matter? 

BRONSCHWEIG
Wait ... I can see it. (he climbs back down and stands at the bottom. 
We can see a figure glistening in the darkness.) Oh ... Jesus .... Lord 
.... 

ONE OF THE MEN AT THE TOP
Ya, ya see it?! 

BRONSCHWEIG
So much for little green men. (he begins to fumble with a pouch on his 
hip, taking out the needle and a small bottle with the green liquid 
vaccine.) I need you down here! 

(The two men at the top of the ladder look at each other, one nods and 
the other races away from the hole, we assume he's going for a bio-
hazard suit. Down in the hole, Bronschweig fills the needle with the 
vaccine and stands looking for the alien, but he keeps hearing noises 
and is not sure where they're coming from. He twists his head from side 
to side, trying to narrow it down. Suddenly we see a clear view of the 
alien, behind him, straight out of a '50's B-movie, looking like a guy 
in a cheap suit, missing only the zipper up its back. Personal opinion, 
natch. Its claws appear from out of its hand, somewhat like a cat. 
Bronschweig sees him, he hears the alien's blood-curdling and hair-
raising screech and in a flash the alien is all over him like a cheap 
suit, slicing his face with his claws. Bronschweig manages to stab the 
alien with the needle, it screams again and then Bronschweig drags 
himself back to the ladder and holds onto to it for dear life. A group 
of the men have now gathered at the top of the hole, one in a bio-
hazard suit.) 

BRONSCHWEIG
Help! I need help! 

(Suddenly the top part of the ladder is pulled aside, the cover is 
placed on and Bronschweig, who has begun climbing his end of the 
ladder, looks up.) 

BRONSCHWEIG
What are you doing?! 

(The hole starts to be covered with dirt.) 

BRONSCHWEIG
What are you doing?! Ohhh .... 

(From the darkness, the alien grabs him and pulls him down. We hear a 
scream ....) 

SCENE 14 

SOMERSET, ENGLAND 

(The scream was the playful yell of a small child playing in a lovely 
British garden with his friends. They run around for a moment or two 
then a woman, possibly the nanny, claps her hands as they run off. The 
camera pans to a man seated on the terrace of what appears to be a huge 
mansion, watching with a smile. It's the Well-Manicured Man (WMM). He 
sips his tea and gives a small chuckle at the goings-on. A servant 
appears from out of the mansion.) 

SERVANT
Sir, you have a call. 

(WMM looks disappointed. He walks inside and picks up a phone.) 

WMM
Yes? 

CSM (voice on the phone)
We have a situation. The members are assembling. 

WMM
Is it an emergency? 

CSM
Yes. A meeting has been set, tonight in London to determine a course. 

WMM
Who called this meeting? 

CSM
Strughold. He just got on a plane in Tunis. 

(From the garden comes a child's yell, not a playful one and WMM turns 
towards the window to look. He hangs up the phone and runs over to the 
window. One of the children is lying down and holding his leg. Concern 
on his face, WMM begins to quickly go outside to see what has 
happened.) 

SCENE 15 

LONDON, ENGLAND 

(We see the outside of a building, Albert's Hall in the background, I 
believe. A black car pulls up in front and WMM gets out. A servant 
holds the car door open for him.) 

WMM
Has Strughold arrived? 

SERVANT
Yes, they're waiting in the library, sir. 

(They enter the building and walk into a room where a group of men, 
usually known as The Consortium but now called The Syndicate since the 
movie's release, are gathered. In front of them, a monitor is showing a 
frozen image of Mulder and Scully as they entered the morgue. Strughold 
stands up.) 

STRUGHOLD
We began to worry. Some of us have travelled so far and you are the 
last to arrive. 

WMM
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg. 

(Pregnant pause while nobody answers "Gee, sorry to hear that.") 

STRUGHOLD
While we have been made to wait, we watched surveilance tapes which 
have raised more concerns. 

WMM
More concerns on what? 

STRUGHOLD
We have been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new effects 
in biology which have .... presented themselves. 

FIRST ELDER
The virus has mutated. 

WMM
Into what? 

STRUGHOLD
A new extraterrestrial biological entity. 

WMM
My God! 

STRUGHOLD
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual 
reevaluations for us about our place in the Colonization. 

(WMM begins to walk towards Strughold, barely containing his anger and 
amazement at their foolishness. Well, just a guess there!) 

WMM
This isn't Colonization, this is spontaneous repopulation! All our 
work! .... If it's true, they've been using us all along! We've been 
labouring under a lie! 

BARNEY MILLER GUY
It could be an isolated case. 

WMM
How can we know?! 

STRUGHOLD
We're going to tell them what we've found, what we've learned by 
turning over a body infected with the gestating organism. 

WMM
In hope of what? Learning that it's true? That we are nothing but 
digestives for the creation of a new race of alien life-forms?! By 
cooperating now, we are but beggers to our own demise. 

STRUGHOLD
Cooperation is the only chance of saving ourselves. 

CSM
They still need us to carry out their preparations. 

STRUGHOLD
We'll continue to use them as they do us. If only to play for more 
time, to continue work on our vaccine. 

WMM
(shakes his head) My lateness might just as well have been absence. A 
course has already been taken! 

CSM
There are complications. (he looks at the surveillance video and WMM 
looks as well) Mulder saw one of the infected bodies that we destroyed 
in Dallas. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him. 

WMM
Who? 

CSM
Kurtzweil we think. 

WMM
No one believes Kurztweil or his books. He's a toiler, a crank. 

FIRST ELDER
Mulder believes. 

CSM
Then Kurtzweil must be removed. 

STRUGHOLD
As must Mulder. 

WMM
Kill Mulder, we take the risk of turning one man's quest into a 
crusade. 

STRUGHOLD
Then you must take away what he holds most valuable. That with which he 
can't live without. 

(The scene cuts to Scully, looking out on a vast desert.) 

SCENE 16 

BLACKWOOD, TEXAS 

(Scully turns to face Mulder. We see houses behind him.) 

SCULLY
I don't know, Mulder. I don't see any evidence of an archeological or 
any other kind of a dig site. 

MULDER
This is where he marked on the map. Where he said those fossils were 
unearthed. (the camera pulls back to show our hereos as tiny figures in 
the left corner of the screen, the sky above huge and cloudy, the 
houses dwarfing them.) You're sure those fossils were infected with the 
same virus you saw at the morgue? 

SCULLY
Both sets of bones were porous, as if the virus or the causative 
microbe were decomposing it. 

MULDER
And you've never seen that virus before. 

SCULLY
No. 

(He looks down, dejected, then his gaze wanders to the side.) 

MULDER
Look at that. 

(They walk over to an oasis in the surrounding desert, a brand new 
playground.) 

MULDER
That look like new grass to you? 

SCULLY
Looks pretty green for this climate. 

MULDER
Uh huh. 

(They reach the playground, Mulder bends down and picks up a piece of 
the sod.) 

MULDER
Ground's dry about an inch down. This was laid recently. 

SCULLY
The equipment looks brand new too. 

MULDER
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks. 

(They both look around for any kind of clue and see 3 kids riding 
towards them on bikes.) 

MULDER
Hey! Hey! 

(Mulder and Scully walk towards the kids and they stop their bikes.) 

SCULLY
Do you boys live around here? 

KID
Yeah. 

MULDER
You see anybody diggin' over there? 

KID
We're not supposed to talk about it. 

SCULLY
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that? 

KID 2
Nobody. 

MULDER
Nobody? The same nobody that built that playground? Nobody buy you 
those new bikes, too? 

SCULLY
I think you better tell us. 

KID
We don't even know you. 

SCULLY
Well, we're FBI Agents. 

KID
You're not FBI Agents. 

MULDER
How do you know? 

KID
Cause ya'll look like door-to-door salesmen. (laughs) 

MULDER
(he pulls out his badge) Hey, you wanna buy a badge? 

(The kids all look at his impressive badge and spill the beans.) 

KID
They left about an hour ago, going that way. 

(He points, then the other two kids point in the same direction.) 

SCENE 17 

TEXAS 

(The camera pans stylishly alongside Mulder and Scully's brand new 
Oldsmobile Intrigue. Next we see inside as they chat.) 

MULDER
Unmarked tanker trucks. What are archeologists hauling out in tanker 
trucks? 

SCULLY
I don't know, Mulder. 

MULDER
And where are they going with it? 

(Scully's consulting her map.) 

SCULLY
That's the first question to answer if we're going to find them. 

(The stylish Intrigue screeches to a halt at a Stop sign.) 

MULDER
What are my choices? 

SCULLY
About a hundred miles of nothing in both directions. 

MULDER
Well, which way do you think they went? 

(Scully puts down the obviously useless map.) 

SCULLY
We've got two choices. One of them's wrong. 

(Mulder looks left down the long highway.) 

MULDER
I think they went left. 

(Scully looks to her right.) 

SCULLY
I don't know why, I think they went right. 

(They look at each other, Mulder looks to the right-side highway then 
begins drumming his fingers on the steering wheel as he stares straight 
ahead. The car takes off with a squeal. As usual, Mulder's taking a 
leap of faith and forging straight ahead. The road's unpaved and they 
leave a cloud of dust as they bump along.) 

MULDER
Five years together, Scully. How many times I been wrong? (she rolls 
her eyes, thinking, do you want a list?!) Never. (she looks at him in 
shock and mild humour.) Not driving anyway. 

(The car races ahead, towards we know not where. Miles and miles of 
nothingness. Soon, time has passed and nighttime has settled. The 
crickets chirp and the car suddenly stops. They've reached what appears 
to be a dead end. Scully undoes her seat belt, shoots Mulder a 
disgusted look, exits the car and slams the door shut. Ouch, be nice to 
that Intrigue, Scully, cost The Big Boys a lot of dough! Mulder gently 
closes his door as he exits. Scully stands in the beams of the car's 
headlights and turns around to properly berate him.) 

MULDER
I was right about the bomb, wasn't I? 

SCULLY
This is great, this is fitting. 

MULDER
What? (he pulls out the map.) 

SCULLY
I have to be in Washington, D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing, the 
outcome of which might possibly effect one of the biggest decisions of 
my life, and here I am in the middle of Nowhere, Texas chasing phantom 
tanker trucks! 

MULDER
We're not chasing tanker trucks, Scully, we're chasing evidence. (still 
consulting the useless map.) 

SCULLY
Evidence of what exactly? 

MULDER
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something. Bodies 
infected with a virus you yourself detected! 

SCULLY
Mulder, they haul oil in tanker trucks, they haul gas in tanker trucks, 
they do not haul viruses in tanker trucks! 

MULDER
Well, they may be hauling a virus in these tanker trucks. 

(She looks at him quizzically.) 

SCULLY
What do you mean? .... Mulder? .... What are you not telling me? (he is 
folding the map elaborately, avoiding her stare and her question.) 
Mulder? 

MULDER
(hesitant) The virus may be extraterrestrial. 

(She stares at him with her mouth open, he gives a small grin, looking 
like a little kid about to be yelled at by his mommy.) 

SCULLY
(rolls her eyes and turns her head) I don't b ... Mulder, I don't ... 

(Her words are cut off by the sound of a train crossing's warning bell, 
which is a good thing for young ears out there in Movieland. Ask me by 
email what she actually said before the movie's rating was changed, hoo 
boy! Anyway, as the train approaches, they both turn to look and then 
Mulder walks towards the tracks.) 

SCULLY
What? (she holds her arms out by her sides, asking what the heck he's 
getting worked up about) Mulder, what?! 

(She stands behind him as they both watch the train go by. Its cargo 
includes white unmarked tanker trucks. He turns to face her, their eyes 
meet and together they race back to the car and hop in, a team again 
and off in pursuit of The Truth once more. The car follows next to the 
train as it races towards its destination. Soon, the car stops and 
Mulder and Scully get out, looking at something we can't see yet.) 

SCULLY
What do you think they are? 

MULDER
I have no idea. 

(They continue to stare at the unseen sight, then begin to walk towards 
it. The camera now pans over the crest of the hill Mulder and Scully 
have begun to walk down and we see white domes appearing to glow in the 
middle of a desert, surrounded by a cornfield. Out of the darkness of 
the night, they arrive at the cornfield and walk through it.) 

SCULLY
This is weird, Mulder. 

MULDER
Very weird. 

SCULLY
Any thoughts as to why anybody would be growing corn in the middle of 
the desert? 

MULDER
Well, those could be giant Jiffy-Pop Poppers. 

(They arrive at the huge domes, look at each other then proceed. Mulder 
opens one of the dome's doors and a blast of air from inside shoots 
out. They enter, Mulder's tie askew from the wind, Scully's raven locks 
flowing in the breeze. When they close the door behind them, fans on 
the ceiling suddenly blast on, startling them. They walk further in. 
Inside the dome it's all metal, stark and futuristic. The sound of 
Scully's boot heels echo in the structure as they walk along a raised 
walkway. To either side of the walkway are box-like structures, they 
appear to be grids from the camera's eye view above.) 

SCULLY
It's cool in here. The temperature's being regulated. 

MULDER
For the purpose of what? 

SCULLY
Mulder, I think we're on top of a larger structure here. This is some 
kind of a venting system. 

(Mulder stops and turns to Scully.) 

MULDER
You hear something? You hear that? 

(He steps down off the raised walkway, towards the grids and she 
follows behind him.) 

SCULLY
I hear a humming... 

MULDER
Umm-hmm. (agreeable noise.) 

SCULLY
Like electricity, high voltage maybe... 

(Mulder puts his fingertips on one of the grids, then bends down and 
places his ear on it, listening.) 

MULDER
Maybe... 

(As he listens, Scully looks up towards the roof.) 

MULDER
Maybe not. 

(He lifts his head and follows her gaze to the roof. Suddenly, flaps in 
the roof open up.) 

MULDER
Scully? 

SCULLY
Yeah? 

MULDER
Run!! 

(The vents in the floor grids begin to blast open one by one, hundreds 
of bees pour out into the air, seeming to head for the roof's open 
vents, but clouding the air with their quantity. Mulder and Scully grab 
their jackets and pull them over their heads as they run towards the 
door which led them in. Mulder has a good lead on her and twists around 
as he runs to see where she is.) 

MULDER
Scully! 

SCULLY
I can't see! 

(Mulder turns back and runs towards Scully.) 

MULDER
Grab my hand! 

(He grabs her arm and they run toward the door, stopping before they 
exit to stamp their feet under the doorway's fans to remove the bees 
from their clothing. They finally run out the door, Scully's hair a 
tangled mess as they brush themselves off.) 

MULDER
Did you get stung? 

SCULLY
I don't think so. 

(Their attention is drawn to a strange sound. They both walk away from 
the dome and stare into the corn. A light appears, could it be a UFO?! 
Nope, it's the searchlight from one of two black helicopters! Mulder 
and Scully begin to run through the crops to escape the copters. Huge 
Big Screen action as the camera pans over the helicopters, the lights 
play over the corn as they seek out our heroes, Mulder runs, Scully 
runs, Scully crouches in the tall corn, Mulder soon follows suit, then 
calls out to her as he can't find her.) 

MULDER
Talk to me, Scully! Sculllllllyyyyy! Dammit! Scully! Scully! Scully! 
Scully! (he runs from crouching spot to crouching spot, calling her 
name in desperation.) 

SCULLY
Mulder! (she tries to follow the sound of his voice.) 

MULDER
Sculllllllyyyyy! 

SCULLY
Mulder! 

MULDER
Can you hear me?!!!! 

(He continues to run, calling her name again and again.) 

MULDER
Scully! Scully! Scully! 

SCULLY
Mulder! 

MULDER
Scully! Scully, talk to me!!! 

(Scully pops out of the corn, not far from him, they run towards each 
other, then as a team they begin racing towards their car. Suddenly, 
Scully turns around, noticing the silence.) 

SCULLY
Where'd they go? 

(The helicopters have disappeared. Mulder grabs her shoulder, pushing 
her onwards.) 

MULDER
Come on. 

(They climb back up the hill. The domes and corn are silent again.) 

SCENE 18 

OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL REVIEW 

WASHINGTON, DC 

(We see A.D. Jana Cassidy looking at some papers then checking her 
watch. Scully is late for her hearing. In the hallway, A.D. Skinner 
stands watch, his hands on his manly hips (sorry, personal opinion!). 
Scully arrives, brushing down her unruly suit. She spots a mirror and 
after a glance at Skinner she quickly straightens herself up as best 
she can in the mirror. Skinner enters the hearing room.) 

SKINNER
She's coming in. 

(He holds the door open for Scully as she enters the room and walks 
swiftly to her seat, her hair still not quite in place.) 

A.D. CASSIDY
Special Agent Scully? 

SCULLY
Yes, I apologize for making you wait. I have new evidence. 

A.D. CASSIDY
Evidence of what? 

(Not answering the question, as she doesn't really know herself, Scully 
pulls an evidence bag out of her briefcase and holds it up. She speaks 
cautiously, knowing she'll be taken to task for her actions.) 

SCULLY
These ... are fossilized bone fragments that I've been able to study 
... that were gathered at the bomb site in Dallas. 

A.D. CASSIDY
You've been back to Dallas? 

SCULLY
Yes... 

(The scene cuts to Casey's Bar as Mulder arrives and seeks out 
Kurtzweil who is seated in a booth. Mulder slides into the booth, all 
wide-eyed and nervous about the news he brings. They speak softly, to 
keep the curious at bay.) 

KURTZWEIL
You found something? 

MULDER
Yeah. On the Texas border, some kind of experiment, something they 
excavated and was brought there in tanker trucks. 

KURTZWEIL
What? 

MULDER
I'm not sure ... a virus, I think. 

(Kurtzweil appears stunned, it's hard to tell as he's always so bug-
eyed and excited. The scene cuts back to the hearing.) 

SCULLY
.... and I also have reason to believe that ... there may have been 
some involvment by Special Agent In Charge Michaud. 

A.D. CASSIDY
Those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully. 

SCULLY
Yes, I know. 

(Back to Casey's Bar) 

KURTZWEIL
You saw this experiment? 

MULDER
Yeah, but we were chased off. 

KURTZWEIL
What did it look like? 

MULDER
There were bees ... corn crops ... 

(Kurtzweil appears shocked/excited/confused, you choose. Back to the 
hearing.) 

A.D. CASSIDY
...and you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this 
claim of yours to the crime? 

SCULLY
Nnn ... not completely conclusive ... I hope to but we are ... in the 
process of ... we're working towards gathering that evidence. 

(During this hesitating speech, the camera shows us something poor 
Scully can't see. Somehow, through the huge fans and shaking off at the 
domes, the corn field chase, the run for their car, the drive to the 
airport, the airplane ride, the drive to the hearing and even Scully's 
last suit brush off ... a single dedicated bee has managed to hide 
under the collar of Scully's jacket and it now begins its slow ascent 
up and over her shoulder towards the back of her neck.) 

A.D. CASSIDY
Working with ...? 

SCULLY
(hesitating)
...with Agent Mulder. 

(Back to Casey's Bar.) 

MULDER
What are they? 

(Kurtweil pauses as he doesn't have a sweet clue.) 

KURTZWEIL
What do you think? 

MULDER
A transportation system. Transgeneric crops that are polygenically 
altered to carry a virus. 

KURTZWEIL
That would be my guess. 

(He dabs his mouth on a napkin, looks around, gets up and starts to 
walk away. Mulder is stunned and gets up to follow him.) 

MULDER
Guess? What do you mean "your guess"?! Hey! 

(Mulder grabs Kurtweil's shoulder and turns him around to face him.) 

MULDER
You told me you had answers! 

KURTZWEIL
Yeah, well... I don't have 'em all... 

MULDER
(disgusted)
You didn't know my father... 

KURTZWEIL
Like I told you, he and I were old friends... 

MULDER
(angrily)
You've been using me! You've been using me to gather information for 
your god-damned books! 

(Kurtweil is looking left and right to see if anyone is paying 
attention as Mulder's voice has risen.) 

KURTZWEIL
Lower your voice! 

(Kurtzweil leaves through the back exit. Mulder follows him into the 
alley.) 

MULDER
Kurtzweil? Kurtzweil! 

(Kurtweil stops and turns to Mulder.) 

KURTZWEIL
Yeah, well, you'd be shit out of luck if it wasn't for me! You saw what 
you saw 'cause I led you to it! (he stabs Mulder in the chest with his 
finger for emphasis.) I'm putting my ass on the line for you ... 

MULDER
Your ass?! I just got chased through Texas by two black helicopters! 

KURTZWEIL
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These 
people don't make mistakes! 

(Kurtweil walks off leaving Mulder to ponder it all. Mulder hears 
footsteps above him on the fire escape. He looks up and we see it's The 
First Elder, not sure if Mulder can tell as the sun is in his eyes. 
Mulder stalks off, appears to open the doorway to the bar and next we 
see him enter his apartment.) 

SCENE 19 

MULDER'S APARTMENT 

(Mulder goes right to his desk and pulls open a drawer. He fumbles 
around for something, then pulls out a family photo album we've never 
seen before. When did this dysfunctional family ever take the time to 
capture a Kodak moment?! Apparently quite often as Mulder thumbs 
through a few pages and finds what he's looking for .... a picture 
taken at a family picnic ... a young Kurtzweil stands with a grin on 
his face and a drink in his hand. Mulder stares at the proof in his 
hand. Kurtzweil DID know his father, he told him the truth. Mulder sits 
and stares for a moment, there's a knock on his door, Scully doesn't 
wait for an answer and opens the door. She stands there looking like 
she's been figuratively and literally put through the wringer. Her 
jacket is undone and her shirt is untucked.) 

MULDER
What's wrong? 

SCULLY
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately. 

(Mulder turns his body away from her, throws his head back, his eyes to 
the heavens with a this-can't-be-happening attitude.) 

SCULLY
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation. 

MULDER
You can't quit now, Scully. 

SCULLY
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not even to tell you in person, but 
... 

MULDER
We are close to something here! (he finally turns in his chair to look 
at her) We're on the verge! 

SCULLY
You're on the verge, Mulder. Please don't do this to me. 

(Mulder leaps out of his chair and walks over to Scully.) 

MULDER
After what you saw last night, after all you've seen, you can just walk 
away? 

SCULLY
I have, I did, it's done. 

MULDER
I need you on this, Scully. 

SCULLY
You don't need me, Mulder. You never have. I've just held you back. 

(Mulder looks at her with that hurt puppy dog look in his eyes. She 
drops her eyes from his and turns to leave.) 

SCULLY
I gotta go. 

(He waits for a moment, then Mulder follows her out into the hallway.) 

MULDER
You wanna tell yourself that so you can quit with a clear conscience, 
you can, but you're wrong! 

(She stops and turns to face him.) 

SCULLY
Why did they assign me to you in the first place, Mulder? To debunk 
your work, to rein you in, to shut you down ... 

MULDER
But you saved me! As difficult and as frustrating as it's been 
sometimes, your goddamned strict rationalism and science have saved me 
a thousand times over! You've kept me honest ... you've made me a whole 
person. I owe you everything ... Scully, and you owe me nothing. 

(Through this speech, Scully looks at him in shock as his honesty flows 
out. Her eyes begin to fill with tears.) 

MULDER
I don't know if I wanna do this alone... I don't even know if I can ... 
and if I quit now, they win. 

(Scully's tears begin to silently flow. Her lovely bottom lip quivering 
with emotion, she falls into him, holding him tightly as his arms 
enfold her. She closes her eyes as her tears fall onto his shoulder. 
She pulls back and kisses him on his forehead, then gently rests her 
own forehead on his, still crying. Mulder slowly pulls her face back so 
he can look at her, his hands resting on the back of her head. She 
looks into his eyes, her hands resting on the back of his head as well. 
Her tears flow, her lip quivers, she sees something in his eyes which 
tells her they're both thinking the same thing, at least to me, anyway. 
They both lean in for The Kiss ... lips do touch for a brief, shining 
second ... then she suddenly grabs the back of her own neck and says 
...) 

SCULLY
Ow! 

MULDER
(thinking he's done something wrong) I'm sorry. 

SCULLY
Something stung me. 

(Mulder reaches down and plucks out the bee, holding it in his fingers, 
its little legs squirming in the air.) 

MULDER
Must've gotten in your shirt. 

SCULLY
Mulder ... something's wrong. 

MULDER
What? 

SCULLY
I'm having lacinating pain in ... 

MULDER
What? 

SCULLY
... my chest. 

MULDER
Scully ... 

SCULLY
My motor functions are being affected. 

(She begins to fall into Mulder and he grabs her.) 

MULDER
Scully ... 

(Mulder gently but quickly lays her down upon the hallway floor) 

SCULLY
My pulse is thready ... a funny taste in the back of my throat. 

MULDER
I think you're going into anaphylactic shock. 

SCULLY
No ... I have no alergy. 

(Mulder runs into his apartment and grabs the phone. He dials 911 with 
the emergency button.) 

MULDER
(on phone)
This is Special Agent Fox Mulder, I have an emergency! I have an agent 
down! 

(Next we see Scully being placed on a gurney.) 

PARAMEDIC 1
Can you hear me? Can you say your name? 

PARAMEDIC 2
She's got constriction in the throat and larynx. 

PARAMEDIC 1
Passages are open. OK. Let's get her in the van right away. Look out. 
Coming through. Watch your back. 

(Scully is loaded into the ambulance.) 

MULDER
She said she had a funny taste in the back of her throat. But there was 
no pre-existing allergy to bee sting. Now the bee that stung her might 
have been carrying a virus. 

PARAMEDIC 1
Virus? 

MULDER
Will you tell that to the doctor? 

VARIOUS PARAMEDICS VOICES
"... virus ... advise ... reaction ... stat! 

MULDER
What hos ... what hospital are ... (the ambulance door closes, Mulder 
goes to the driver) What hospital are you taking her to? 

(The ambulance driver just looks back at him. He pulls a gun and fires 
at Mulder's head. Mulder falls. Seconds later, another ambulance, the 
real one, pulls up. The scene cuts to an airport runway as a cargo 
plane lands. The ambulance pulls up, and soldiers move out a familiar-
looking person-sized container. It's Scully! She's moved into the plane 
as we see Cancer Man lighting a ciggie, waiting inside the plane. The 
soldiers run off, the door closes and we see Cancer Man take a drag. 
The screen goes black, we hear voices.) 

SCENE 20 

HOSPITAL 

FROHIKE
What are you doing? 

LANGLY
Reading his chart. 

FROHIKE
Put it down. 

LANGLY
I'll put it down when I'm ready. 

BYERS
I think he's coming out of it. 

LANGLY
He's coming to. 

(The screen now shows a close-up view of our boys, The Lone Gunmen, as 
they hover over Mulder's hospital bed. Mulder is being fed oxygen 
through a tube in his nose, his head wrapped in bandages.) 

FROHIKE
Hey, Mulder? Mulder? 

MULDER
Oh my God. Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow ... Toto! 

(Frohike's not pleased with the joke, but at least his friend is all 
right. Mulder tries to sit up and winches in pain, holding his head.) 

MULDER
What am I doing here? 

BYERS
The bullet grazed your brow and (by itself?) your temporal plate. 

LANGLY
A few centimeters to the left and we'd all be playing harps right now. 

FROHIKE
You've been unconscious since they brought you in. 

MULDER
(shooting up in the bed) Where's Scully?! 

BYERS
We put together you called 911. That call must have been intercepted. 

FROHIKE
Scully had a reaction to an Africanized honeybee we found in your hall. 

(Frohike holds up a vial containing the bee.) 

MULDER
I've got to get to her. 

(Mulder attempts to stand up, is woozy and staggers a bit before 
sitting right back down. His door opens and Skinner walks in, going 
quickly to the staggering Mulder and helping to hold him up before he 
falls on his butt.) 

SKINNER
Mulder, easy, easy... look, you're staying right here. 

MULDER
You don't understand, this goes all the way back to Dallas. 

SKINNER
Tell me where she is, I'll find her. 

MULDER
I don't know where she is! But I can think of someone who might. 

SKINNER
You leave here unprotected, how far will you get? How far will they let 
you get? Because they'll know the minute you walk out of here! 

LANGLY
What can we do? 

(Mulder half-looks around at Langly, thinks a minute then formulates a 
plan.) 

MULDER
You can strip Byers naked... 

BYERS
What?! 

(Mulder reassures him they haven't slipped into a gizzie-penned fanfic! 
Newsgroup joke, ask if you need explaining.) 

MULDER
I need your clothes. 

(Mulder begins to tenderly remove his head bandage, winching again. 
Next we see Langly, Frohike, and Mulder, disguised as Byers, exit the 
room. The guard outside the room looks in and sees "Mulder" lying on 
the hospital bed and Skinner pacing beside him talking into his cell 
phone. The three men walk down a hallway, Mulder's suit just a teeny 
bit too small for him and he picks up his cell phone.) 

MULDER
(into phone) It's Mulder... 

(Langly closes the exit door behind Mulder. Next we see Mulder running 
down a nighttime street, ditching his jacket as he runs. The scene 
changes to an alleyway as Kurtzweil walks along, his senses alert to 
any footsteps behind him. He goes to open what we assume is the 
alleyway door to Casey's Bar and is shocked to be confronted by .... 
The Well-Manicured Man!) 

SCENE 21 

CASEY'S BAR 

WMM
Dr. Kurtzweil, isn't it? Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil? 

(Kurtzweil backs away, turns around and begins walking quickly down the 
alley. A black car pulls into the other end of the alley, trapping him. 
The driver gets out, Kurtzweil stares in shock and concern and we cut 
to inside Casey's Bar as Mulder bursts in the door. He looks around the 
bar for Kurtzweil, but doesn't see him. Mulder leaves through the back 
door, entering the alleyway. He sees WMM and his driver slamming the 
trunk of their car closed. WMM turns to face Mulder.) 

WMM
Mr. Mulder. 

MULDER
What happened to Kurtzweil? 

WMM
He's come and gone. 

MULDER
I want to know where Scully is. 

WMM
(holds up a small pouch) The location of Agent Scully and the means to 
save her life. (gesturing to the car) Please.... 

(Mulder contemplates this offer for a minute, then figuring he has 
nothing more to lose, he walks to the car as he and WMM never take 
their eyes off each other. They each open their own doors and enter the 
car. It takes off immediately. As they cruise past The White House, WMM 
hands Mulder the pouch.) 

SCENE 22 

INSIDE WMM'S CAR 

MULDER
What is it? 

(As WMM speaks, Mulder opens the pouch and pulls out a small bottle of 
green liquid and a piece of paper with this written on it)


South 83 Lat 

East 63 Long 

WMM
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. 
It must be administered within 96 hours. That leaves you little time to 
reach those coordinates. 

MULDER
You're lying. 

WMM
No. Though I have no means to prove otherwise. The virus is extra-
terrestrial. We know very little about it except that it was the 
original inhabitant of this planet. 

MULDER
(unbelieving) A virus... 

WMM
What is a virus, but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living 
in a cave, underground, until it mutates ... and attacks. 

MULDER
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease? 

WMM
No. For God's sake, you've got it all backwards! AIDS, the Ebola virus, 
on an evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the 
planet long before the dinosaurs. 

MULDER
(smiling in disbelief) What do you mean walked? 

WMM
Your aliens, Agent Mulder. Your little green men arrived here millions 
of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been lying dormant 
underground since the last ice age in the form of an evolved pathogen, 
waiting to be reconstituted by the alien race when it comes to colonize 
the planet -- using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense, 
nothing but a weak vaccine. Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even 
the best men, men like your father, could not let the truth be known. 
Until Dallas we believed the virus would simply control us, that mass 
infection would make us a slave race. Imagine our surprise when they 
began to gestate. 

(Mulder lets it all sink in, the driver eyes look at him through the 
rear-view mirror. Darn good driver if he ain't watching the road!) 

MULDER
Why are you telling me this? 

WMM
For the sake of my own children. Once it's learned what I have told 
you, my life will be over. 

(WMM looks ahead, possibly at the driver. Mulder looks at the driver.) 

MULDER
Where's Dr. Kurtzweil? (no response) I'd like to get out of the car 
now. (to the driver) Stop the car! 

WMM
Driver. (the car pulls to a stop in yet another alleyway.) The men I 
work with will stop at nothing to clear the way for what they believe 
is their stake in the inevitable future. I was ordered to kill Dr. 
Kurtzweil, as I was ordered to kill you. 

(Suddenly, WMM grabs a gun (from his lap?) and shoots the driver in the 
back of the head, BLAMMO! Mulder recoils.) 

MULDER
Ow! 

WMM
Trust no one, Mr. Mulder. 

(WMM opens his own door and exits, holding the door open.) 

WMM
Get out of the car. 

MULDER
Why? The upholstery is already ruined. 

WMM
Get out of the car! (Mulder scoots over to WMM's door and exits the 
car.) You have precious little time. (Mulder slams the door shut 
angrily.) What I've given you the alien colonists don't yet know 
exists. The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its 
introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy 
the delicate plans we have so assiduously protected for the last 50 
years! 

MULDER
What do you mean, "may" have? 

WMM
Find Agent Scully. Only then will you realize the scope and grandeur of 
the project. Go. Go now! 

(WMM points his gun in Mulder's face. Mulder starts to walk away, WMM 
opens his door again, a rat scuttles past, WMM reenters the limo, 
closes the door and it explodes, knocking Mulder off his feet. He sits 
on the ground watching the flames burn, then pulls out the pouch and 
checks to see that the bottle is still intact. It is. He puts it back 
in the pouch, gets up and after one last look at the burning car, 
begins to run for his life.) 

SCENE 23 

WILKES LAND, ANTARCTICA 

48 HOURS LATER 

(Through the vast whiteness of the snow-covered land we see a small 
black dot. It's Mulder driving a Sno-Cat. He wipes away the 
condensation forming on the inside of his window and squints his eyes 
to see where he's going. The camera shows his vehicle leaving tracks in 
the virgin snow. He whacks his gas gauge and it keeps flipping back to 
empty. He checks the coordinates again, stops the Sno-Cat and holds up 
a hand-held thingy which tells him he's at the exact place he's 
supposed to be. He looks out the window at a hillside, sighs and we 
next see him struggling up the hill. He reaches the top, slips a 
little, then hunkers down and looks at a base of some kind in the 
distance. He whips out a pair of binoculars and looks through to see 
more Sno-Cats lined up, one of them moving. It stops, he adjusts the 
power to see closer and spots Cancer Man in the vehicle. He puts the 
binoculars away and starts to walk towards the base. It soon turns into 
a jog as he gets closer, but he suddenly falls through the ice as it 
collapses beneath his feet. He falls quite a way through a snowy 
tunnel, then lands in an icy crevice. He takes a minute to catch his 
breath, stands up slowly and peers down a hole leading off from the 
crevice, steam rising from it. He positions himself so he can crawl 
down this hole and turns around at the end so he drops feet-first onto 
a huge metallic structure. It's a type of hallway and on either side of 
him are containers of some sort. He whips out his flashlight to 
investigate further. Wiping the snow away from one of the containers, a 
cryopod, he spots a prehistoric man encased in ice.) 

(Meanwhile, back on the surface, a Sno-Cat drives up, Cancer Man seated 
inside, and it stops. Cancer Man looks at Mulder's abandoned Sno-Cat 
and takes a slow puff of his ciggie.) 

(Back under the ice, Mulder finds stacks and stacks of these coffin-
like cryopods, piled row upon row. He walks further into the structure 
and finds an area opened up, somewhat like a hospital's operating 
theatre. He stands in the middle and looks in awe at the huge structure 
before his eyes. Hundreds, more than likely thousands of these rows 
stand before him. Where to begin looking for Scully? A movement catches 
his eye near the bottom of the rows. A rack of these cryopods are 
moving as if on a conveyer belt. He looks through his binoculars, but I 
can't tell you what he sees, it's very vague! Must have seen something 
though as he springs into action. He begins to maneuver his way down to 
the moving cryopods, hanging by his hands, his feet dangling over the 
edge. Suddenly, he loses his grip and shouts ...) 

MULDER
Oh, shit! 

(... as he begins to fall helplessly. He falls down the side of a wall, 
sliding out of control until he lands harshly on a ledge, hanging by 
one hand as he teeters over the edge. A bottomless well of metal lies 
below, the belly of the beast-ship. Using his legs and feet to anchor 
himself, he makes his way around the edge-corner and ends up sitting, 
catching his breath. The flashlight in use again, he slides gently over 
a huge cylinder, landing on a walkway. At the end, he finds an empty 
cryopod ... containing Scully's clothes and her cross necklace. He 
grips the necklace in one hand and sets off determined to find her. He 
comes upon a rack of the cryopods, shining his flashlight from one to 
another, a frozen face in each caught by his beams. The eyes on each 
one are open in shock, their mouths held open by a tube, a picture of 
silent horror. Finally, the flashlight lands on his quarry .... Scully! 
Using his hand and then the butt of his flashlight, he begins to hammer 
at the ice keeping her captive.) 

(Back above the ice, we see a Sno-Cat driving, then we cut to somewhere 
else inside the base, a flurry of activity as soldiers scurry about and 
Cancer Man barks instructions.) 

CSM
Secure the station! I want everyone else down below! If you're not 
armed, arm yourselves! We have a breach! 

(Cut back to Mulder who has now hauled off a piece of a nearby cryopod 
and is pounding on the ice as he desperately tries to save her from her 
ice-coffin.) 

(Cut to Cancer Man hustling his men down some ladders.) 

CSM
Let's go, let's go! 

(Back to Mulder as he finally breaks through the ice releasing an ocean 
of goo which encased her naked body. He pulls away the few remaining 
shards of ice and stares at her face. Is he too late? Mulder unwraps 
the bottle of vaccine and fills the needle. He injects the vaccine into 
Scully and it's effect is immediate. Within the tube connected to her 
mouth a liquid appears to retreat from her body, the tube begins to 
shrivel and die.) 

MULDER
Scully? 

(As he goes to touch the now dead tube and pull it from Scully's mouth, 
a violent shaking takes over the ship, a reaction to the vaccine's 
unwanted intrusion.) 

(Cut to Cancer Man in a room full of equipment and monitors. A man is 
seated in front of a monitor showing a graph of some kind.) 

MAN LOOKING AT GRAPH
There's a contaminate in the sytem! 

(Cancer Man looks at the graph in shock.) 

CSM
Mulder has the vaccine! 

(Back to Mulder. The cryopod hallway he's in begins to fill with steam 
as it shoots out from the floor and ceiling. Mulder turns back to 
Scully and sees her move. He grabs the tube and begins to drag it out 
of her throat. Once it's all removed, and it's a long sucker, so it 
takes a sec or two, Mulder stares at her, waiting for a sign of some 
kind.) 

MULDER
Breathe! Scully, can you breathe?! 

(Scully begins to cough, spitting out what's left of the slimy goo. 
Finally she starts breathing on her own, gasping for each sweet taste 
of oxygen. She tries to speak and barely manages a weak ..) 

SCULLY
Cold ... I'm cold. 

MULDER
I'm going to get you out of there. 

(He starts to whack away at the ice with a metallic cylinder next to 
him, probably shaken loose by the rocking and rolling the ship is still 
experiencing.) 

(Cut to the graph/monitor room, sparks flying from various machines as 
the men are tossed like ragdolls. It's time to give up the ship, boys.) 

CSM
Abandon your posts! Evacuate! 

(Cancer Man walks towards one of the ladders the men are now scrambling 
down. Another man stops and says ..) 

MAN
What's happened?! 

CSM
It's all gone to hell! 

MAN
But, what about Mulder?! 

CSM
He'll never make it! 

Cut back to Mulder as he gently lifts a naked Scully out of the 
cryopod, her body glistening with goo, and lays her down on the floor. 
Next we see him carrying her. She's now wearing some of Mulder's 
clothing, right down to a pair of boots, don't ask me where THEY came 
from! He reaches the bottom of a metallic shaft, sunlight beaming down 
upon them.) 

(Cut to outside as an alarm sounds and men race out from the domes, 
running for the various Sno-Cats. Cancer Man gets into one, his mouth 
dangling open in shock as it "all falls apart". The vehicles drive 
off.) 

(Back to Mulder and Scully as he drags her up a ladder. Far below them, 
the defrosting has begun and water drips down the walls.) 

(From above, we see the Sno-Cats leaving, one passing within inches of 
the top of a shaft leading to our hereos.) 

(Cut to inside where Mulder and Scully have found a momentary resting 
place. Scully is coughing and weak. Mulder urges her on.) 

MULDER
We gotta keep moving. Come on! 

SCULLY
I can't. 

MULDER
Yeah, you can. 

(Mulder picks her up and carrys her in a fireman's lift, over his 
shoulders. He walks down a row of crypods, all ominously dripping with 
water from the defrosting ice. He spots a vent.) 

MULDER
Scully, reach up and grab that vent! 

(Suddenly, he spots movement in one of the pods. The creatures within 
have begun to stir. The vaccine has affected the whole structure, as 
the bodies were all obviously attached to the one creature.) 

MULDER
Scully, grab the vent! (no response) Scully? 

(He looks at her face on his shoulder, she's passed out. Mulder slides 
her off his shoulders, placing her on the floor and checks for a pulse. 
The creatures nearby, still encased in the swiftly melting ice are now 
violently thrashing about and emitting their high-pitched screams. With 
one eye on the creatures and one eye on Scully, Mulder begins 
performing a mean version of CPR.) 

MULDER
Please, breathe. Breathe ... breathe .... BREATHE! 

(Scully begins to cough and splutter as she regains consciousness.) 

MULDER
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe! 

(She begins to try and speak, he has to place his ear almost on her 
mouth to hear.) 

SCULLY
I had you big time. 

(She smiles at him. No time for jokes, Scully, the aliens are coming! 
As Mulder pulls her to her feet, the ice-encased cryopods around them 
start to crack open as the creatures within begin to break free. He 
holds her up to the vent above her.) 

MULDER
Grab the vent. Pull! PULL! 

(Scully grabs the vent and pulls herself up. Mulder starts to climb up. 
One of the aliens breaks the pod and reaches out with its hand for 
Mulder. It grabs Mulder's leg. Scully stops and turns his head.) 

SCULLY
Mulder! 

MULDER
Keep moving, Scully! 

(Mulder kicks it away and pulls himself up. They both climb through the 
tunnel, Mulder yelling encouragement from behind.) 

MULDER
Go! Go! Come on! 

(He keeps checking behind him as the alien screams continue, looking 
for any which may be chasing them. The light at the end of the 
proverbial tunnel gets brighter as they climb on.) 

MULDER
Almost there, keep going! 

(They pull themselves up to where Mulder first stopped after he fell 
through the ice, a slight turn in the vent. Just as Mulder clears the 
turn, an alien lashes out from behind but is cut off by the twist in 
the tunnel. They step over the part where Mulder first fell all the way 
down and make their way out the hole he originally made. Scully falls 
onto the snow, exhausted and Mulder perches next to her on one knee. He 
hears a sound and looks around for the origin. It's the ice ... it's 
cracking under their feet! He grabs Scully and throws one of her arms 
over his shoulder as they begin to run away. He stops for some ungodly 
reason and looks back seeing vents of steam starting to shoot out of 
the ice. They begin to run again as the ice begins cracking and falling 
away causing a huge crater to form. Suddenly the crater overtakes them 
and they disappear into the hole, but next we see them shoot into the 
air and slide off of the surface of the rising ship. They land on the 
edge of the crater. Mulder watches the spaceship as it flies overhead, 
his face glows with a heart-melting grin of childlike wonder and awe. 
Scully's face is turned towards the snow, too tired to move, as Mulder 
says, almost along with the audience ...) 

MULDER
Scully, ya gotta see this! Scully! 

(It's quiet, it's barely a mutter above a whisper, but we hear ...) 

SCULLY
I see it. 

(Spent from exhaustion, Mulder drops his head into the snow. Scully, 
finding the strength God gave 20 hearty men, scoots her body over to 
cover him from the freezing cold. She lifts his into her arms and 
cradles him as the camera pans back to show two lone figures perched 
alone on the edge of the bottomless crater left by the departing 
spaceship. Cut to Washington and don't start with me on how they got 
out of the Antarctic, there was extra gas can in the Sno-Cat, I don't 
know!) 

SCENE 24 

OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL REVIEW 

WASHINGTON, DC 

(Scully is seated before the review board, her lovely face marked by 
the effects of her ordeal, frostbite and scratches.) 

CASSIDY
In light report on the report I've got before me and in light of the 
narrative I am now hearing, my official report is incomplete -- pending 
these new facts I'm being asked to reconcile. 

(While she speaks, we see a man entering the field office where the 
fossilized samples were kept. In the darkness of the closed office his 
flashlight lands on the tray containing the samples and he takes it 
away.) 

CASSIDY
Agent Scully, though there is now direct evidence that a federal agent 
may have been involved in the bombing, the other events you've laid 
down here are too incredible on their own, and quite frankly 
implausible in their connections. 

SCULLY
What is it you find incredible? 

CASSIDY
Well, where would you like me to start? 

(As we hear them speak, over the next couple of passages, we cut to 
somewhere in America's heartland as a freshly-painted tanker truck is 
prepared. The new sign painted on the side reads "Nature's Best Corn 
Oil". Next we see soldiers with flame torches setting a corn field 
ablaze.) 

CASSIDY
So many of the events described in your report defy belief. Antarctica 
is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I-- I can't very well submit a 
report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. 
Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic 
terrorism. 

SCULLY
No, they don't. 

CASSIDY
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of any 
organization with an attributible motive. I realize the ordeal you've 
endured has clearly affected you. But the holes in your account leave 
this panel with little choice but to delete these references to our 
final report to the Justice Department--until which time hard evidence 
becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an 
investigation. 

(Scully stands up and walks over to the board, positioning herself 
directly in front of A.D. Cassidy. She places the vial containing the 
bee found in Mulder's hallway on the table, Cassidy picks it up and 
looks closely at it.) 

SCULLY
I don't believe the FBI currently has an investigative unit qualified 
to pursue the evidence in hand. 

(Scully then turns and leaves the room. Skinner looks at Cassidy, then 
the entire panel turns to stare at him. What are ya gonna do about 
THIS, Skinner?) 

SCENE 25 

THE CAPITAL MALL 

(Mulder is sitting on a bench by the reflecting pool reading a 
newspaper. He stares at a headline
"Local Hanta Virus Outbreak In Northern Texas Contained", looks up and 
sees Scully walking toward him. When she arrives, he hands her the 
paper.) 

MULDER
There's an interesting work of fiction on page 24. Mysteriously, our 
names have been omitted. They're burying this thing, Scully. They're 
just going to dig a new hole and cover it up. 

SCULLY
I told OPR everything I know. What I experienced, the virus, how it's 
spread by the bees from pollen in transgenic crops. 

(He gets up and starts to walk away. She joins him.) 

MULDER
You're wasting your time, Scully. They'll never believe you, not unless 
your story can be programmed, categorized, or easily referenced. 

SCULLY
Well, then we'll go over their heads. 

(He stops and turns to her.) 

MULDER
No. No. How many times have we been here before, Scully? Right here. So 
close to the truth and now with what we've seen and what we know to be 
right back at the beginning with nothing. 

SCULLY
This is different, Mulder. 

MULDER
No it isn't! You were right to want to quit! You were right to want to 
leave me! You should get as far away from me as you can! I'm not going 
to watch you die, Scully, because of some hollow personal cause of 
mine. Go be a doctor. Go be a doctor while you still can. 

SCULLY
I can't. I won't. Mulder, I'll be a doctor, but my work is here with 
you now. That virus that I was exposed to, whatever it is, it has a 
cure. You held it in your hand. How many other lives can we save? Look 
... (she clasps his hand) ... If I quit now, they win. 

(Hand in hand they walk off into the sunset .... sort of anyway.) 

SCENE 26 

FOUM TATAOUINE, TUNISIA 

(A helicopter flies over the vast desert. We then see CSM walking next 
to a cornfield, a native man yelling something in Tunisian into the 
crop. From out of the corn comes Strughold. He walks over to CSM.) 

STRUGHOLD
You look hot and miserable. Why have you traveled all this way? 

CSM
We have business to discuss. 

STRUGHOLD
We have regular channels. 

CSM
This involves Mulder. 

STRUGHOLD
Ah. That name, again and again. 

CSM
He's seen more than he should have. 

STRUGHOLD
What has he seen? Of the whole he has seen but pieces. 

CSM
He's determined now. Reinvested. 

STRUGHOLD
He is but one man. One man alone cannot fight the future. 

CSM
Yesterday, I received this. 

(From out of his pocket, he pulls a telegram and hands it to Strughold. 
He reads it then drops it to the ground and walks away. CSM looks down 
at the telegram. It reads


"X-FILES RE-OPENED. STOP. PLEASE ADVISE. STOP." 

CSM looks up, then walks away. The camera pans above the scene to show 
the huge cornfield in the middle of the desert ...) 

THE END
