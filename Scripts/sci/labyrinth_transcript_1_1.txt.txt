SARAH:    ONCE UPON A TIME,
SARAH:    THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL
SARAH:    WHOSE STEPMOTHER ALWAYS MADE HER STAY HOME WITH THE BABY.
SARAH:    THE BABY WAS A SPOILED CHILD.
SARAH:    HE WANTED EVERYTHING FOR HIMSELF,
SARAH:    AND THE GIRL WAS PRACTICALLY A SLAVE.
SARAH:    BUT WHAT NO ONE KNEW
SARAH:    WAS THAT THE GOBLIN KING FELL IN LOVE WITH HER
SARAH:    AND GAVE HER CERTAIN POWERS.
SARAH:    SO ONE NIGHT,
SARAH:    WHEN THE BABY HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY CRUEL TO HER,
SARAH:    SHE ASKED THE GOBLINS FOR HELP.
          [SNORING]
GOBLIN:   LISTEN!
SARAH:    "SAY YOUR RIGHT WORDS," THE GOBLINS SAID,
SARAH:    "AND WE'LL TAKE THE BABY TO THE GOBLIN CITY,
SARAH:    AND YOU WILL BE FREE."
GOBLINS:  AH!
SARAH:    BUT THE GIRL KNEW THE KING OF THE GOBLINS
SARAH:    WOULD KEEP THE BABY IN HIS CASTLE FOREVER AND EVER
SARAH:    AND TURN IT INTO A GOBLIN,
SARAH:    SO SHE SUFFERED IN SILENCE
SARAH:    UNTIL ONE NIGHT
SARAH:    WHEN SHE WAS TIRED FROM DOING HOUSEWORK
SARAH:    AND HURT BY THE HARSH WORDS OF HER STEPMOTHER
SARAH:    AND SHE COULD NO LONGER STAND IT.

GOBLIN:   IT DOESN'T EVEN START WITH "I WISH"!
SARAH:    OH, TOBY, STOP IT!
SARAH:    I WISH I DID KNOW WHAT TO SAY
SARAH:    TO MAKE THE GOBLINS TAKE YOU AWAY.
