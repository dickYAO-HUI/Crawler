1 EXT. OUTER SPACE
The vastness of space. Suddenly a hole in the sky opens with a flash and a SPACESHIP rumbles into view. ON its hull the letters NSEA PROTECTOR. Magnificent, though on closer inspection it shudders ever so slightly, denoting pre-CGI model work on a budget. We're watching a TV show. 
LAREDO (V.0.)





We're exiting the time knot now sir!





2. INT. NSEA PROTECTOR COMMAND DECK - SPACE
5 Members of the crew of the NSEA PROTECTOR sit in the large circa - 1979-"high-tech" cabin. All of them human except for DR. LAZARUS, a purple reptilian-looking alien. LAREDO is a 9 year old boy. The crewmates exchange relieved smiles.
CHEN





We're alive.





LAREDO





We made it, Commander. We made it!





LAZARUS (THE ALIEN)





By Grabthar's hammer, we live to tell the tale.





COMPUTER (0.S.)





Systems register functional. 





TAWNY





All systems are working, Commander. 





They all turn to look at THE COMMANDER, who turns to reveal himself dramatically. Good looking. His acting is classic Charlton Heston take-no-prisoners style. He looks around the command deck, worried, almost sniffing the air.
COMMANDER





I don't like it. (beat) It was too easy... 





LAREDO





Wait. Oh no. Theyre everywhere!
(Alarm Blaring)





His radar lights up with dots. First a few, then HUNDREDS.
LAREDO





They're everywhere. There are time knots opening everywhere. 





Suddenly an EXPLOSION rocks the ship.
TAWNY





A trap.





LAZARUS





We're surrounded, Commander.





The actors flop around with the simulated explosions, but it is obvious the ship is not moving. They leap about, but not in time with each other.
CHEN





It's a core meltdown sir. It can't be stopped





Fred runs to a spot just in front of the camera and faces to stage left, posing. 
The Commander turns to his advisor, Lazarus.
LAZARUS





Surrender may be our only option.





COMMANDER





No! Never give up ... NEVER surrender.'





LAREDO





Your orders sir? ... Sir, your orders?





The Commander sits in close up; steely determination. Finally, a decision.
COMMANDER





Activate the Omega 13.





FADE TO BLACK
Then suddenly - THE PICTURE GOES WHITE, LEADER, LEADER NUMBERS APPEAR, with a STUDIO COPYRIGHT notice.
PULL BACK TO:
3 INT LARGE AUDITORIUM
ENTHRALLED LEGIONS of mostly spotty faced male adolescent FANS staring into camera. For a moment all is silent. A few are sobbing. Then a BURST OF THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE... We're at a SCIENCE FICTION CONVENTION. The enthusiastic crowd of FANS continue cheering as the master of ceremonies GUY takes the stage.
GUY





Well? ... Huh? ... Well, there ya are. Huh? Yeah!





The crowd cheers as the Galaxy Quest Convention #18 logo comes up.
GUY





Yeah! Yeah! ... Thats what Im talking about. (beat) You are the first people to see the lost GALAXY QUEST episode 92 - two parter, since it was originally aired in 1982! Huh? Yeah! All Right!





The audience applauds
GUY (CONTINUED)





And now, the moment you've all been waiting for ... The intrepid crew of the NSEA PROTECTOR!





4 BACKSTAGE
Here we meet the REAL LIFE ACTORS all dressed as their TV alter egos... GWEN DEMARCO, beautiful, in a sexy and improbable body suit. ALEXANDER DANE, (DR. LAZARUS) wearing green alien prosthetic makeup. FRED KWAN, doing a logic puzzle. 
We close on Alexander, sitting in front of a mirror, softly brushing his face with a makeup brush.
FRED (OS)





... Red Scarf. Black Shoes. Wait. White scarf, black buttons, white shoes.





TOMMY (reading a paper)





Now where the hell is he? An hour and a half late. An hour and a half! 





GWEN (looks through curtain) 





I mean, this is unreal! They're going to start eating each other out there.





TOMMY





Oh, did you hear? He booked another appearance without us?





GWEN





You're kidding. 





INT AUDITORIUM
GUY (given the stretch sign again)





Uh. Uh. Oh.





INT  DRESSING ROOM
Gwen turns to notice Alexander staring into a makeup mirror, eyes roaming over his alien green makeup and scaly rubber features with a mournful expression.
ALEXANDER





Dear God.... How did I come to this?
 





TOMMY





Not again...





ALEXANDER





I played Richard III...





FRED





Five curtain calls...





ALEXANDER





There were Five curtain calls! I was an ACTOR once, damn it. Now look at me ... LOOK AT ME! I cannot go out there, and I wont say that stupid line one more time. I cant ... and I wont.





GWEN





Well, Alex, at least you had a PART. Okay? You had a character people loved! I mean, my TV Guide interview was six paragraphs about my boobs and how they fit into my suit. No one even bothered to ask me what I DO on the show.





FRED





You had the, Wait, wait I'll think of it...





GWEN (RESIGNEDLY)





I repeated the computer, Fred. 





Suddenly the rear stage door opens and JASON NESMITH ("The Commander") strolls in, all exuberance and charm.
JASON





Whew! Your Commander is on deck. Ha Ha. Wow, that smog is thick today, huh? Am I too late for Alexander's panic attack? ... 
(looks at Alexander, who throws down stuff with a clatter) 
Apparently not. You know, you should get that looked at (referring to Alexs head). 






CONVENTION STAGE 
On the stage, Guy continues to stall...
GUY (OS)
Lets take a look at a few more clips.
BACKSTAGE  
The others surround JASON, fighting.
JASON





Okay, what did I do? Hmmm?





The audience is chanting in the background "We want the crew, we want the crew."
JASON





What?





6a CUT TO  INT THE AUDITORIUM
GUY (OS)





(Over a film clip showing the Commander defending Alex.)
For those four seasons, we developed the same affection for the crew as the crew had for each other. 





INT THE DRESSING ROOM
GUY (OS CONTINUING)





These werent just adventurers exploring space. Friends  These were friends. 





GWEN





Unbelievable.





TOMMY





You are so full of it, man!





JASON





Its not a big deal. These guys put a little set in their basement. Im there about an hour. Its nothing, Gwen.
(approaching Gwen)
They wanted the Commander.





Suddenly bright light streams in. They all turn to see ALEXANDER skulking out the exit. 
TOMMY





There he goes  





JASON





Alexander, wait a minute. Grab him! Grab him!





A beat, then they all run to catch Alexander, TACKLING HIM.
 
ONSTAGE  
Chanting "We want the crew  we want the crew"
Guy gets a "thumbs up" cue from a stagehand.
GUY





Okay!





The fans applaud and whistle.
GUY





Yeah! Here we go!





INT DRESSING ROOM
Jason is coaxing a coat-clad Alexander back into the room.
JASON





Come on, old friend, old friend.





ALEXANDER





You stole all my best lines? You cut me out of episode two entirely?





GUY (OS)





Tawny Madison, my personal favorite.





GWEN (pushing past Jason and Alexander)





Excuse me!





GUY





Gwen DeMarco!





The crowd cheers as Gwen leaps out onto the stage and does a small dance, with a high kick to show she still has it.
CROWD





YEAH!





In the background is a film clip of Gwen, as Tawny Madison, repeating computer commands.
GUY





Yeah, thats what Im talking about! Lets hear a warm welcome ... for crack gunner, Laredo, Tommy Webber!





CUT TO  DRESSING ROOM
Jason and Alexander are struggling.
JASON





You will ... go out there.





ALEXANDER





I wont. And nothing you can say will make me.





JASON





The show must go on.





ALEXANDER





Damn You! Damn You! I wont say that stupid line one more time.





GUY (OS)





Ship's Tech Sergeant Chen... Fred Kwan!





GUY (CONTINUED) (O.S.) 





Tev'meck ... Alexander Dane





11 ON STAGE - 
Alex bounds up on stage, bowing deep with grace and humility. The stage trained British actor.
GUY





Yeah! All right!





ALEX AS LAZARUS ONSCREEN





"By Grabthar's hammer, you shall be avenged.'"





Alex cringes, desperately unhappy
GUY





Yeah! All right!





CROWD VOICE





That guy can act.





GUY





And finally, my ... my fellow Questarians, the brave Commander of the NSEA PROTECTOR... Peter Peter Peter Peter Peter Quincy Quincy Quincy Quincy Quincy Taggart Taggart Taggart Taggart ... JASON NESMITH.





Jason appears and a SPOTLIGHT follows him.
Jason raises his fist encouraging the FANS to cry out ... A woman screams "We love you, Commander".
JASON/JASON ON SCREEN/EVERYONE 





"NEVER GIVE UP, NEVER SURRENDER... DAMN THE RESONANCE CANNONS, FULL SPEED AHEAD.'"





The fans go crazy. The actors exchange glances.
GUY





The Commander and his crew will be signing autographs on imperial decks "b" and "c" near the coke machines.





Jason is upset because his microphone has been cut off.
GUY (moving through the fans)





Excuse me, pardon me. Crew member coming through. Fans - right? Hey, Gwen, 





TOMMY (TO GUY)





Oh, hey, man. I want to thank you for that nice intro you gave us today. Um-





GUY





Guy. You probably dont remember me, do you? Its the sunglasses, right? I was on the show in 82  episode 81. Got killed by a lava monster before the first commercial AAAAh!
Listen  uh  Maybe I could sit in and, oh, sign a couple of autographs?





One of many fans dressed as "Dr. Lazarus" steps up to Alexander and salutes him with crossed fists.
FAN





"By Grabthar's hammer, by the suns of Warvan, I shall avenge you!"





Alexander ignores this, grabs the photo from his hand, signs it, thrusts it back. The next fan steps up.
FAN





"By Grabthar's hammer, by the-"





He signs and thrusts it back before he can even finish.
ALEXANDER





Next!





JASON AT A SEPARATE TABLE
Talking dramatically to a group of fans. A YOUNG BOY watches WIDE EYED.
JASON





Had I moved an inch to the left the beast would have killed me. On the other hand, my crew was in danger...





YOUNG BOY





How did you know what to do?





JASON





Come on! Without my crew, I'm not a Commander, huh.





He pokes the kid in the belly.
JASON





I think we all remember what happened to that beast on Enok 7, right?





The fans make happy nerdy "we sure do" noises.
CASTMEMBERS TABLE
Gwen shakes her head appreciatively.
GWEN





You gotta admit, they really do love him.





TOMMY





Yeah, almost as much as he loves himself.





They watch as Jason fields another question from a fan.
CLOSER ANGLE - JASON'S TABLE
Bored with the constant queries of his fans, Jason glances over to see Gwen smiling at him. She quickly looks away, self-conscious. Jason doesn't even take his eyes off Gwen as BRANDON steps forward, his brow knit with serious matters.
BRANDON





Excuse me, Commander, Hey!
Commander, I was wondering if you could help settle a dispute my crew and I seem to be having. Um, if you remember, in "The Quasar Dilemma", 





JASON





Excuse me for a minute, fellas.





Jason exits. Brandon turns to his friends, frustrated.
BRANDON





I hadn't even gotten to the relevant conundrum...





THE CAST TABLE 
Gwen answers a question from a shy GIRL.
GIRL





Miss Demarco? ... In episode 15, "Mist of Delos 5?" I got the feeling that you and the Commander kind of had a thing. Did you?





GWEN





No. The Commander and I NEVER had a thing.





JASON (over her shoulder)





That's her story.





Gwen looks up to see Jason. The girl giggles and exits. Jason smiles at Gwen. 
Rolling her eves Gwen rises and walks off. 
JASON





Gwen, Gwen. Gwen.





Undaunted, Jason follows, but runs into the five ALIENS. Their leader MATHASAR bows respectfully then follows along as Jason pursues Gwen.
MATHASAR





Commander, 





JASON





Excuse me.





MATHASAR





I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we need your help. 





JASON





Oh, oh, oh. Is this about that gig tomorrow? Just hammer out the details with my agent, and make sure theres a limo at my house. Last time I did one of these gigs they shoved me in the back of a Toyota. Remember, mums the word.





MATHASAR





I... certainly, but-um mum  mum  mum -





Jason catches up to Gwen. 
PHOTOGRAPHER





Look here and  Beautiful.





He takes a picture of all the fans, as Jason catches up to Gwen.
He spins her around dramatically.
JASON
Crewman Madison, The mist of this strange planet is filling my head with such thoughts. 
He leans in for a tortured kiss... Some fans gather, delighted by the impromptu show. But Gwen steps aside.
GWEN





It was cute when I didn't know you.





She exits. Jason tries to pretend that doesn't hurt.
CONVENTION FLOOR
But Jason takes refuge in the-
14 MEN'S ROOM
Jason enters to witness the incongruous sight of four MANK'NAR beasts at the urinals taking a MANK'NAR piss. Jason enters a stall and sits on the lid, trying to get a moment to think. But two CYNICAL 20-SOMETHINGS enter, laughing their assess off. He can hear their voices echo from the other side.
CYNICAL GUY 1





What a FREAK SHOW, man. Oh, this is HILARIOUS.





CYNICAL GUY 2





Bunch of losers! Beggin for autographs at 15 bucks a pop.  These guys havent had a real acting job for 20 years. This is all theyve got. Did you check out Nesmith?
 





CYNICAL GUY 1





He actually gets off on those retards thinking he's a space Commander! Yeah, Oh, and his friends...





CYNICAL GUY 2
I know, they cant stand him. Did you hear them ragging on him in there?!! "Commander furry!..."
CYNICAL GUY 1





Dude. He has no idea he's a laughingstock... Even to his buddies. Hes pathetic. 





CYNICAL GUY 2





Ooh, come on. Come on. The Galaxy Quest Dancers are almost on.





CYNICAL GUY 1





Whoo! Full speed ahead, Lieutenant.





They exit, their laughter ringing in Jason's ears.
15 CONVENTION FLOOR - JASON'S TABLE
Jason is back at his table signing autographs in a foul mood. He scribbles his name irritably, avoiding contact with the fans as BRANDON and his group of aficionados approach him.
BRANDON





Hey, Commander, uh. So, as I was saying, 
... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b (to Kyle) could you get this ... deck B for Gamma override. The thing is that online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?





JASON





It's just a television show. Okay? That's all. 





BRANDON





Heh heh  Cause we were wondering if the quantum flux, now just listen on this 





JASON





There IS no quantum flux and there IS no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship! You got it?





Jason notices that all eyes are turned on him. The hall has become deathly quiet. Jason rises abruptly and exits through the hall. Brandon and the fans do their best not to take this personally.
15A INT. GWEN'S HOUSE
Gwen is cooking something intricate and delicious as she talks to Alex on the phone. Her house is tasteful and bright on a budget.
GWEN





I mean it. I Mean it, Alex. Ive never seen him lose it like that. Not to a fan. I mean it was just weird.





15B INT. ALEXANDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Alexander is walking around the living room, talking on the phone, with his headpiece still attached.
ALEXANDER





Gwen, I have said for years he's mentally unstable.





He stands and moves to the refrigerator. Nothing but a hunk of very rank cheese which he sniffs disdainfully.
GWEN





(a beat, back to Jason...)
I  Im worried. It just was not like him.





16 INT. JASON'S DEN - NIGHT
Jason sits on the edge of the couch, staring at the TV, sipping scotch, flipping channels. He stops at the conclusion of an episode of GALAXY QUEST. As Commander Taggart makes a heroic speech. Jason mouths the words along with his alterego.
COMMANDER TAGGART (ON TV)





As long as there is injustice, whenever a Targathian baby cries out, wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars ... We'll be there. This fine ship, and this fine crew ... Never give up! Never surrender!





Jason takes another drink and we fade to
17 INT. JASON'S LIVING ROOM - NEXT MORNING
Jason sleeps, on the floor under the coffee table, hungover, dead to the world. There is a Knocking on the door. He barely moves. Every indication is that he's dead. More knocking. He stirs enough to groan. The knocking continues ... Jason opens his eyes and sees THE ALIENS standing outside his patio door, looking in at him. He groans, gets up from under the table and makes his way wearily to the door.
18 EXT. JASON'S HOUSE
Jason opens the door in his underwear, drooping bloodshot eyes, squint of a headache ... There before him are THE ALIENS dressed in their perfect GALAXY QUEST attire. Jason stares at them, bleary eyed. With earnest respectful faces, the five salute him in the classic "GALAXY QUEST" style. 
JASON





Can I help you?!





The leader, MATHASAR, steps forward. Speaks quickly.
MATHASAR





Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach in protocol, 





JASON





Right. You shouldnt come to my house.





MATHASAR (CONTINUING)





... but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula. Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been disastrous. 
Please Commander, you are our last hope.
(beat)
We have secured our limousine.





JASON





What? ... Oh, oh, oh, oh, um. Its the thing for the thing thats, um  (beat) Maybe I should get some pants on. Come on in.





19 INT. JASON'S HOUSE
The four aliens stand on one side of the room. Jason, mostly dressed, hunts under his couch for something.
MATHASAR





Commander, I must say that standing here in your presence is the greatest honor we could ever have hoped to achieve in our lifetimes.





Mostly all they can see of Jason at the moment is his butt, as he is on his knees, looking for his shoes.
JASON





Thats  I really appreciate that. Would you guys look for another shoe that looks like this, please?





THE ALIENS look around for the other shoe, mostly by staring at the ceiling.
20 INT. LINCOLN LIMO
Jason sits in back with MATHASAR and the others, half-awake. The three men are seated across from Jason, and a dark-haired female is sitting next to him. Jason, ever the ladies man, eyes her appreciatively.
LAHNK





Sir, I am Lahnk, senior requisition officer. Before we travel to the ship, please let me know if you have any requirements. Weapons, documents, personnel...





JASON





Um  a Coca Cola? Do you have one of those?





One of the aliens nods to the other who opens a compartment in the limo and takes out a cola..
TEB





Sir, I am Teb. I would like to explain the history between our people and the Sarris Dominion in greater detail. 





JASON (to LALIARI)





Hey, how ya doin?





TEB





In the 5 million years following the great nebula burst our people were one...
 





JASON





Whats your name?





She just smiles and sits there.
JASON





Doesn't she talk?





TEB





Her translator is broken.





LALIARI says something, but it comes out a weird mix of sounds. Like a screaming baby inside a bagpipe.
JASON





Okey dokey... Ya know, guys, I had a late night with a Kreemorian Fangor Beast, so I'm going to just shut my eyes for a bit. But go on, I'm listening to everything you say. Okay? ...





Jason is asleep before Teb gets the next sentence out.
TEB (CONTINUING)
The limousine goes up an alley, stops, and lifts straight up into the air. A dog comes out and, looking upwards, barks.
FADE TO BLACK
FADE IN
21 INT. RECEIVING QUARTERS - PROTECTOR II
Jason is shaken softly by the shoulders. He opens his eyes to see a young female CREWMAN, LALIARI. We hear a low RUMBLE. This is the same female that was in the limousine, but now, with her translator working, we hear her speak normally.
LALIARI





Commander. Commander. I am sorry to wake you sir, but your presence is requested on the command deck.





Jason tries to reorient himself as she leads him forward.
22 INT. HALLWAY - THE PROTECTOR II
Laliari escorts Jason down the high tech hallway. Jason looks around, still holding his can of Coke.
LALIARI





Sir, Sarris has moved the deadline. We are approaching his ship at the Ni-delta now. He wants an answer to his proposal. I understand you have been briefed.





JASON





Yeah, I got most of it in the car. Sarris is the bad guy, right?





LALIARI





Yes sir he is a very bad man indeed. He has tortured our scientists, put us to work in the gallium arsenide mines, captured our females for his own demented purposes...





JASON





Okay I've got the picture. You have pages or do you want me to just wing this?





LALIARI





Im not sure I understand you...





MATHASAR approaches with other CREWMEMBERS.
MATHASAR





Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.





JASON





Good to see ya.





MATHASAR





Would you like to don your uniform?





JASON





You know what, Id like to skip that? I got this gig in Van Nuys in about a quarter of an hour. Is that all right?





MATHASAR





As you wish.





Another ALIEN comes running up out of breath.
EXCITED ALIEN 





Sir... It's Sarris. He's here.





EXT  SPACE
A ship that looks like a large-mouthed whale sails towards us.
INT  THE STRANGE SHIP
SOLDIER





General. I have just received word the Thermians have appointed a new commander to handle the negotiations.





SARRIS





What? 





23 INT. COMMAND DECK
A door slides OPEN and Jason and the others enter the COMMAND DECK ... It's straight out of the TV show. Blinking lights, consoles, the cool old tech displays ... But a bit dark. Jason looks around, genuinely impressed, still wearing his glasses.
JASON





This is just great. You know, usually it's just cardboard walls in a garage.





They lead him to the Commander's chair. He sits.
TEB





Sir, we apologize for operating in low power mode, but we are experiencing a hmmm reflective flux field this close to the galactic axis.





JASON





You know what I could use is a cupholder and a couple of Advil.





NAVIGATOR





We're approaching in five ticks, sir. Command to slow?





Jason looks toward the front window/view screen. Stars move past in a familiar display. 
JASON





Um, set it on screen saver two. 
(the NAVIGATOR looks confused)
Because, you know, we gotta - Oh, Im sorry to break the mood here, uh. Slow it down to Mark 2, lieutenant.





Then the VIEWSCREEN fuzzes to life with an image of... SARRIS - He's ugly and green hued. Black sharp teeth. A metal hand... He hisses... There is a beat as the aliens take in the sight, trying to well their courage.
SARRIS





I see fear. That is expected. 
(his voice RESONATES)
Ah, they bring a new Commander... 





JASON





Its good. 





SARRIS





Here are my demands.





JASON





Its scary. 





SARRIS





And if I do not hear what I like, 





JASON





Real.





SARRIS





Then there will be blood and pain as you cannot imagine.





Jason takes a sip of coke and checks his watch. 
SARRIS





First, 





JASON





Backwash.





SARRIS





I require the Omega 13... Second  I will require a technician 





JASON





(blasé, like a laundry list)
Okey dokey, okey dokey, Let's fire blue particle cannons full ... red particle cannons full. Gannet magnets fire them left and right. And let em run all chutes. And while youre at it why dont ya toss that at em, killer. 





Jason tosses the empty coke can to the gunner.
JASON





That should take care of old Lobster-head, shouldnt it?





He tosses the GUNNER the empty coke can, then before even waiting for the weapons to reach their target... ...he exits!
24 HALLWAY
Jason emerges and looks both ways trying to get his bearings. 
Several of the aliens chase after him as he enters the corridor, exchanging stunned glances, trying to absorb the magnitude of what just happened.
MATHASAR





Commander?... Where are you... going?





JASON





Home.





MATHASAR





You... You mean Earth?





JASON





Yeah. "Earth." I need to get back to "Earth," kids.





He turns a corner. Jason is oblivious to the muffled sounds of explosions, traces of the demolition going on outside.
MATHASAR





But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.





JASON





Yeah. Yeah. Long live... What's the name of your planet, again?





MATHASAR





Thermia.





JASON





Long live Thermia. This way?





MATHASAR





But what if Sarris survives?





JASON





Oh, I doubt it. I gave him both barrels.





MATHASAR





He has a very powerful ship. 





JASON





If you got any more problems with the guy, just, you know, give me a call.





Jason bumps his lag on something.
JASON





Ow!





MATHASAR produces a walkie talkie device for Jason.
MATHASAR





An interstellar vox.





JASON





A what? Hey.





MATHASAR looks him in the eye. A TEAR starts down his cheek. He HUGS Jason, then shakes his hand sincerely.
MATHASAR





How can we thank you, Commander? You - You have saved our people.





JASON





Yeah, okay. You know you kids have been great. You really have.
(opens the VOX)
This thing is real-lookin Hello. Hello.
(chuckles)





The aliens leave and Jason is left all alone in the room as the doors close.
JASON





Hey. Wheres my limo?





FADE TO BLACK
A spot comes on over Jasons head. 
Suddenly a CLEAR PLASTIC rises from the disk and conforms around him, ENCASING HIM IN A FLEXIBLE CONTAINER. There is only an instant to register surprise as the ceiling divides and an AWE INDUCING ROTATING STARFIELD is revealed... The WALLS pull back around him. And Jason finds himself surrounded by THE INFINITE VASTNESS OF SPACE. And his face is a MASK OF HORROR In the split instant as Jason in his pod is ROCKETED FORWARD INTO SPACE.
26 BLACK - JASON'S YARD
We pull back slowly from the iris of Jason's eye. He is now standing on the red disk in the middle of his own back yard. He stands there in shock, TEETH CHATTERING, SHIVERING IN WAVES AND WAVES from the incomprehension of what he's just experienced, unable to move from the spot.
28 EXT. COMPUTER STORE PARKING LIT - MORNING
Gwen, Alexander, Tommy, Fred and Guy perform for the store's grand opening. A small crowd is gathered, including Brandon and his gang, inspecting a mock up of the PROTECTOR.
GWEN





Take it from us... We've been all over the universe.





FRED





But we've never seen space age values like we've seen here ..... at





TOMMY





Tech Value electronics superstore





Alexander pauses, deeply ashamed. Gwen nudges him.
ALEXANDER (IN A MONOTONE)





By Grabthar's hammer, what a savings.





A few balloons are released into the air.
GUY





All Right! Yeah, lets hear it for the NSEA Protector.





28A COMPUTER STORE - LATER
The actors hand out pamphlets and sign the occasional autograph. Fred pats Alexander's back, who stares ahead, morose. Around the corner, JASON appears, looking around with a disoriented yet exhilarated twinkle in his eye.. He spots his friends and starts quickly toward the cast table but runs smack into the group of FANS led by Brandon. Brandon and Jason go down, along with an armful of GALAXY QUEST collectables.
BRANDON





Commander!... My apologies.





Brandon is nudged by his friend KYLE.
BRANDON





Evidently we had a miscommunication regarding the voyage, and that you didnt show up.





But Jason, still in a haze, simply gathers his things and walks off. The other nerds look at Brandon.
KYLE





He did it AGAIN!





28B ACTORS' TABLE
The actors look up to see JASON approaching.
ALEXANDER





Do you know what time it is? Why do you even bother to show up at all?





Jason has so much to say he can't get out a word. Gwen notices his wrinkled slept-in clothing, and wild eyes.
JASON





N  N  Not now, guys. I was there. I was up there. Remember yesterday at the convention? Those people dressed like aliens? They were aliens. They were termites or Dalmatians. I cant really remember because I was kinda hung over. But what they built was extraordinary. It was a huge spaceship. I got to fight this guy named Sarris, and I kicked his ass. 





The crew looks at Jason incredulously. They wonder what sort of nightmares he has when hes been drinking.
JASON





I know what youre thinking, but I can prove it. They gave me this.





He produces the interstellar vox. The thing blinks its little red light. He motions victoriously. The others exchange glances, then produce their own 
blinking voxes and set them on the table.
JASON





No, no, no, no, but can you talk to people in SPACE on those? (into Vox:) 
Protector this is the Commander. Over!





The others exchange glances. Alexander turns to Gwen.
Tommy rolls up his sleeve ready for a fight.
ALEXANDER





Oh, for Gods sake.





TOMMY





That's it, It's time to go.





Jason notices a label on his VOX that reads "Property of Brandon 
Wheeger." He looks around for Brandon.
JASON





This isn't mine. Wait, that kid, where is that kid?...





Jason looks up and sees the young woman we recognize as Thermian 
LALIARI. She's flanked by two young crewmen.
LALIARI





Begging your pardon, Commander, we come with news. Sarris lives. 
He was able upon your departure to make an escape. 





JASON





Listen. Tell them.





LALIARI





However he has contacted us, and wishes to negotiate a surrender. 





JASON





Sarris





LALIARI





We humbly implore you to come and negotiate the terms.





Jason looks at Laliari, then turns back to the others, his 
experience twinkling in his eyes.
JASON





Huh?? They want me back ... You want me back? Is this amazing? They want me back and I want you guys to go with me. Please. Dont even think about it. Lets go. Yes?





Alex begins picking up his stuff to leave. The others pick up and start to follow,
JASON





Youre  Youre going?
Alexander, this is not  Im not kidding here. This isnt some kinda prank. Im not kidding. No, guys, guys, listen. Come on. Gwen, Gwen, Gwen. Gwen, stop. Come here. You know me and Im a lot of things, but am I crazy?





She looks at Jason.
JASON





Gwen, you know me. I'm a lot of things but I'm not crazy.





GWEN





You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but its another thing to do it to your fans?...





Gwen shakes her head and walks off.
JASON





This is not a fan. This  This is a Termite.





The actors enter their Van.
INT VAN
TOMMY





You should have just let me hit him.
 





GWEN





Boy! I didnt know you could get that loaded.





FRED





I think we should have just taken the gig... I mean, who knows the next time he'll ask us.





ALEXANDER





Fred, he was drunk. Do you really think he was talking about a job?





They look at each other, each thinking the same thing  they needed work and Jason was the Commander, after all. As one, they exit the van hurriedly.
28E ELECTRONICS STORE
GUY is standing in an aisle, nuzzling a girl.
GIRL





But you live with your mother?





The actors hurry through the aisles to the back of the store. 
Gwen shouts to Guy.
GWEN





Did Jason come through here?





Guy points to the back.
GUY





Yeah. Hes in there. Hey. Guys.





29 INT ELECTRONICS STORE WAREHOUSE NEAR DOCK
Gwen, Alex and the others enter, and look around. Laliari is 
still in the room, alone. She lights up as they enter.
GWEN





Ah! We are coming too.





LALIARI





All of you wish to go to the ship?





GWEN





Yes. We wish to go to the ship You see, we work together, or not at all.





LALIARI





Wonderful! The Commander had me continue transmission in case you changed your mind. (to Vox) Protector, requesting four Interstellar pods for immediate departure.





GUY





Uh  me, too.





LALIARI





Five pods, for immediate departure.





There is a sloshing noise, and Gwen feels the plastic forming at her feet. She cant move her legs, and it continues creeping up her body. 
GWEN





Guys... Guys? 





Alex tries to step off the disk but It MOVES TO FOLLOW HIM.
ALEXANDER





What in the world...?





LALIARI





I look forward to meeting you all in person when we arrive at the ship. End transmission.





And with that, Laliari blinks and VANISHES. She was simply a 
HOLOGRAM TRANSMISSION. Full realization hits Gwen...
GWEN
Oh my God. OH MY GOD.
Fred, at the vending machine, turns.
FRED





Anybody got any change?





Fred turns just in time to see everyone else disappear.
30 INT. NSEA PROTECTOR DOCKING STATION POD BAY- DEEP SPACE
The room LIGHTS BRILLIANTLY with a series of flashes. In rapid 
succession the PODS arrive with a flash through a hatch In the 
ceiling. They unfold to reveal Gwen, Alexander, Tommy and Guy who 
stand paralyzed and teeth chattering. They look like a bunch of 
horrified bowling pins all facing toward...
A METAL HATCH - Beyond It they register the SOUND of WET 
FOOTSTEPS growing closer... Their eyes widen as they see the 
hatch open revealing a group of 3 HORRIBLE TENTACLED DROOLING 
SCREECHING ALIEN MONSTERS who surround our visitors, probing them 
with jagged devices. Then one of the monsters looks down at a 
mechanism on his belt.
The monsters all flip switches on their belts their forms become 
HUMAN, uniformed as ship's TECHNICIANS.
TECHNICIAN #1
Our most sincere apologies! We forgot about our appearance 
generators.
Then JASON appears in the doorway, wearing a big warm smile.
JASON
Guys! You CAME!...
They stand there, still paralyzed and terrified.
JASON
Who wants the grand tour?
Guy is now relaxed enough to let out the loudest most genuine 
SCREAM you've ever heard in your life. A beat.
JASON
Anybody else?
Then another streak of light, and Fred appears along side the 
others. He steps off of the disk, unaffected.
FRED
That was a hell of a thing. 
(to Jason, motioning to others)
What's wrong with them?
Jason smiles. Nothing gets to Fred.
JASON





I dont know. Come on.





31 INT. PROTECTOR DOCKING STRUCTURE - HALLWAY
Jason leads Gwen, Alexander, Tommy, Guy and Fred down the hall. 
They shuffle forward like recent hospital releases, looking 
around silent and dumbfounded at their surroundings, occasional 
involuntary JERKS of their limbs evidence of their horrifying 
journey.
JASON
That's right guys ... Just keep shaking it off. It gets better. Here, have some gum, It helps.
TOMMY
Wh... Where are we?
JASON
Twenty third quadrant of the gamma sector. Theres a map in the forward room. Come on.
Then MATHASAR appears coming down the hall with a small group of 
ALIENS. He has a warm smile on his face.
 
MATHASAR





Welcome my friends 





JASON





This is MATHASAR. Hes their leader.





MATHASAR





I am MATHASAR. On behalf of all my people I wish to thank you from the deepest place in our hearts.





JASON





MATHASAR, this is, uh, my crew.





The Thermians all stare at the crew, and MATHASAR reaches out to Alexander.
MATHASAR





Dr. Lazarus ... 





The Thermians whisper his name with awe.
MATHASAR





Lt. Madison ... 





They whisper her name and Gwen is just as much in awe as they are with her. MATHASAR leans down to kiss her hand.
MATHASAR





Young Laredo, how you've grown. 





MATHASAR





Tech Sgt. Chen... And....





The Thermians whisper, Tech Sargent Chen ... Tech Sargent Chen.
He looks at Guy quizzically, not sure who he is.
GUY





"Crewman # s..." Guy.





The Thermians, unsure, whisper "Guy".
GWEN





You... know us?





MATHASAR





(soft laugh)
I don't believe there is a man, woman or child on my planet who does not. In the years since we first received transmission of your historical documents, we have studied every facet of your missions and strategies.





TOMMY





Youve been watching the show ...





JASON





Lieutenant? Historical documents.





TOMMY





... historical documents from out here?





MATHASAR





The past hundred years our society had fallen into disarray. Our goals, our values had become scattered. But since the transmission, we have modeled every aspect of our society from your example, and it has saved us. Your courage and teamwork, and friendship through adversity. In fact, all you see around you has been taken from the lessons garnered from the historical documents.





GWEN





Is this a  a spaceship?





JASON





No. This is a starport FOR the ship. 
(a twinkle In his eye) 
Would you guys like to see the ship?





Fred nods yes, but the others stand there with their mouths open.
A door opens leading to a DOCKING POD. 
32 INT. DOCKING POD
They enter and the doors close, and the elevator starts moving. As it clears a wall, we see out the window A MAGNIFICENT AND BREATHTAKING VIEW OF THE ENORMOUS NSEA PROTECTOR DOCKED IN FRONT OF THEM... They all gawk at the amazing 
sight, their eyes wide like children. Only Fred calmly looks out the window. The others are in shock.
ALEXANDER





Oh my god.





As the view clears, they can see this beautiful ship docked in a huge spaceport, the numbers on the side reflecting those on the tiny model they had only known before.
ALEXANDER





Its real.





INT ABOARD THE SHIP, HAVING A SMALL TOUR
MATHASAR





The generator room.
The Beryllium sphere, of course.





The sphere is suspended and slowly rotating.
MATHESOR 
(CONTINUED)





And as we continue ...
The medical quarters are to the left.
We went through some trouble duplicating your cellular regeneration.





ALEXANDER





Jason, what have you gotten us into? 





TOMMY





What in hell is going on?





GWEN





What are we doing here?





FRED





Wow, the floors are so clean.





JASON





We're just here to negotiate this guy Sarris' surrender. Its no big deal.





MATHASAR





And the organ fabrication chamber is coming along nicely.





GWEN





Its no big deal? Are you crazy? We have to get out of here.





JASON





Oh, come on, guys.





GWEN





Jason, we are actors, not astronauts.





JASON





You guys want to go home? Fine. Say the word, and we'll all go home, pay our bills, feed our fish, fall asleep in front of the TV  and miss out on all of this. Come on. Do you guys wanna do that? Anybody? Gwen, come on, think about ... look at where we are. Were in space.
Alexander, this is the role of a lifetime. You guys wanna leave?





MATHASAR





We have enjoyed preparing many of your esoteric dishes. Your Monte Cristo sandwich is a current favorite among the adventurous. 





The crew looks at each other, making one of the most important decisions of their lives.
MATHASAR





The main barracks





Fred, walking beside Lalaini, is smiling. There is something there.
INT THE MAIN BARRACKS
TWO HUNDRED crewmen are lined up along both sides, bowing. Jason walks in between them.
JASON





At ease.





ALEXANDER
(awed)





Its like throwing gasoline on a flame...





Alex turns to Guy, who is smiling ear to ear.
ALEXANDER 
(CONTINUED)





What?





GUY





I'm just jazzed about being on the show, man.





INT THE ENTRANCE TO THE COMMAND DECK
They enter and gawk at the familiar hub, waiting for the show to start... not realizing they ARE the show.
MATHASAR





If you would all take your positions...





GWEN





Our what?





JASON





Guys - 





THE ACTORS





Oh, right... US! Yes, of course... US!





They take their positions, marveling at the familiar control 
panels in front of them. Tommy turns to Guy.
TOMMY





Look .. This thingy ... I remember  I remember I had it all worked out. This 
was forward, this is back ...





Jason is sitting in the Captains Chair, familiarizing himself with the palm controls.
MATHASAR





Commander, some of the crew has requested to be present at this historic event.





JASON





Sure. Bring em in.





MATHASAR motions and screeches, and a few CREWMEN enter, followed by a dozen 
More ... followed by FIFTY more. They stand around the periphery 
of the room, watching eagerly. Tommy turns to Guy.
TOMMY





No pressure, huh? Glad I aint the Commander.





COMMANDER





Laredo, take us out.





Everyone in the room turns their attention to Tommy. His 
sarcastic smile drops. He looks mortified. 
TOMMY





Excuse me?





JASON





They designed those controls after watching you. Take her out.





Tommy stares down at his control panel. It's pretty self explanatory, a throttle and a circular dial for direction. But daunting nonetheless.
TOMMY





Right. Right. Okay. Right. Right. Take her out.





Everyone's eyes are glued to him as he touches the computer screen. The ENGINES COME TO LIFE, a massive exhilarating sound. Tommy giggles nervously. His hand trembles as he pushes the throttle further. The ship starts to move. The actors exchange worried glances.
Tommy is very confident now, being in the element he was trained for as a child. He leans back, confidently grasps the controls and moves them.
42 EXT. SHIP
You can feel the WEIGHT of 'the giant craft as it eases forward, sliding through the sides of the dock.
43 COMMAND DECK
Everyone watches the forward monitor. Tommy turns the NAVIGATION DIAL slowly. Guy whispers to him...
As the ship ponderously passes through the spaceport, the windows are lined with personnel, all witnessing this departure, and all standing at attention. The ship begins to drift to the left. Tommy moves the controls, but its not enough, and the ship continues to drift.
The actors all lean to the right, trying to use body english.
GUY





Okay.





Guy taps Tommy on the hand.
GUY





You gotta move to the right. More to the right.





TOMMY





Would you sit your ass down?





GUY





Hit parallel





TOMMY





Move! You wanna drive this thing?





44 EXT. STAR DOCK
Indeed, the ship is slightly off course... It's like trying to get out of a tight parking space with concrete walls to either side. And the ship is veering ever so slightly into one of the walls. As the ship approaches the wall, the personnel move back.
Tommy turns the dial to correct ... But it looks like the momentum might carry the ship into the wall anyway ... Tommy PEGS the dial to the right ... The others hold their breath as the bow of the ship moves closer and closer to the wall ... Then ... It TOUCHES. The sound of a soft but high pitched SCRAAAAAAAPE.
All eyes are on Tommy. He doesn't know what to do... Should he continue forward, or back up, and scrape again for sure? The classic parking lot dilemma, magnified by ten thousand. Tommy grasps the throttle and moves it slightly forward... SCRAAAAAAPE. He keeps going, in too deep to back out now... And the ship continues to SCRAAAAAPE for a couple of horrible seconds as it 
completes the curve... And then it is free. The beautiful craft glides slowly out to open space... Jason and the others let out a sigh of relief.
48 EXT. SHIP
The ship glides out to space, only a relatively minor scrape of the paint job to show for the incident.
49 INT. DINING HALL
The crew and various aliens sit around the large table, eating an extravagant meal. MATHASAR makes a toast.
JASON





Oh. Mmm.





MATHASAR





How are you enjoying your steak, Commander?





JASON





Im really enjoying it. This is like corn-fed Iowa beef.





TEB





Yes. We programmed the food synthesizer for each of you based on the regional menu of your birthplace.





JASON





I dont care where you did it. It tastes great!





Alexander is spooning up wriggling insects from his bowl.
TEB





Are you enjoying your Kep-mok bloodticks Dr. Lazarus?





Alexander, miserable, toys with the bowl of living insects swimming 
in a disgustingly vomit-textured broth.
ALEXANDER
Just like mother used to make.
The insect jumps out of the spoon and lands in the plate. 
He pushes the bowl away, nauseated.
ALEXANDER





So, um  Tell me, MATHASAR, this Sarris person that were flying to meet, what does he want, exactly?





MATHASAR





He  uh  he heard about the device  the Omega 13.





TOMMY





Um  What is it? What does it do?





MATHASAR





We dont know.





TEB





We were hoping you could enlighten us.
 





Gwen chuckles nervously and looks aprehensively at Jason.
JASON





Oh, the Omega 13 device. We found that on the alien planet. We dont know what it does, either.





The Thermians all gasp
TOMMY





Well, why dont you just turn it on and see what it does?





The Thermians emit shrill screeches and nervous laughter.
TEB





It has at its heart a reactor capable of unthinkable energy. If we were mistaken in our construction, the device would act as a molecular explosive, causing a chain reaction that would obliterate all matter in the universe.





JASON





Has Sarris ever seen any of the, uh, historical records?





MATHASAR





NO, Thank God he has not.





JASON





Oh. So how does he know about the Omega 13 device?





MATHASAR





Our former Commander was not... Strong.





JASON





Former Commander?





MATHASAR





I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.





He nods to a Crewman who pushes a button. A wall panel moves aside to reveal a large VIEWSCREEN. An image appears with a lot of static, and the sound cuts in and out...
MATHASAR





The tape was smuggled off of Sarris ship. Originally, one of our own tried to lead.





SARRIS (ON MONITOR)





Is that all? After three days of this you still require incentive?





Sarris moves switches on the panel. The device pulls at the alien's limbs, twisting them horribly. Bones crackle.
ALIEN COMMANDER (ON MONITOR)





I have told you all I know. If you have any mercy within you, please, let me die.





SARRIS





When I grow weary of the noises you make, you shall die...





Sarris toys with his control panel. Mercifully the screen fuzzes up with static and we can only HEAR the bone chilling SCREAMS...
We PAN around the table, past GWEN, ALEXANDER, TOMMY, GUY...Their mouths open in horror as they watch the screen. MATHASAR looks sadky at them all.
50 INT. HALLWAY
The actors walk down the hallway, panicked. Jason is pursuing them.
JASON





Wait a minute, guys. Come on. Hold on a minute. You just cant leave. Give me some time to think.





ALEXANDER





He wants to think.





TOMMY





No, Jason. Thats a wrap. Theres nothing to think about.





TOMMY





No, Jason, that's a wrap! There's nothing to think about!





GUY





Listen, I'm not even supposed to BE here. I'm just Crewman #6. I'm expendable. I'm the guy in the episode who dies to prove that the situation is serious! I gotta get out of here.





MATHASAR comes running up, looking distressed.
MATHASAR





Commander...





JASON





We gotta prepare the pods for my crews departure.





MATHASAR





Begging your Commander's pardon, sir, but we cannot launch pods at the moment. Sarris will surely detonate any objects leaving the ship.





JASON





Sarris?





MATHASAR





Yes sir, he's here now. Your presence is required on the command deck.





Everyone reacts, alarmed, and we CUT TO:
51 INT. COMMAND DECK
The actors enter the empty deck followed by MATHASAR.
GWEN





There's nobody here. Jason...





MATHASAR





While my people are talented scientists our attempts to operate our own technologies under tactical simulation have been disastrous.





He leans over to Gwen's computer station as she sits, and pushes a button.
MATHASAR





I have raised Sarris on zeta frequency.





JASON





Still, MATHASAR, 





But he is interrupted by the sight of SARRIS appearing on the large VIEWSCREEN. Sarris now wears a metal eyepatch, and has a long scar across his cheek.
SARRIS





We meet again Commander.





The crew stares at Sarris. A frightening visage.
JASON





Hello Sarris... How are you doing?





SARRIS





Better than my Lieutenant. He failed to activate the ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.





He brings into view a stake with the impaled head of his former Lieutenant. 
JASON





Yeah. Well, you know, Id like to say Im real sorry about what happened before. The whole thing was just a (heh heh)misunderstanding. 





SARRIS (ANGRILY)





Deliver the device to me, or I will destroy your ship.





JASON





You know, um, wed like to do that, but frankly, Sarris, sir, we dont know what it is or even where it is.





SARRIS





You have ten seconds.





JASON





I dont  Ten seconds  I dont  There  You know, okay, gosh darn it! I give up. Its yours. You can have it. You have to give me a minute to put it in a box for you, okay? (beat) Gwen.





Jason motions to Gwen to cut the transmission. Gwen nods.
JASON





Dont panic. I've dealt with this guy before. He's as stupid as he is ugly. Come here.





He grabs Guy and sits him down at the armament console.
GWEN





Jason.





JASON





Not now, Gwen. Sit, sit, sit.





JASON (CONTINUED)





We're going to send everything we can at him, all right?





GWEN





JASON...





JASON





Not now. Gwen Push these red buttons and send everything we have towards him, okay?





GUY





Okay.





JASON





All righgt, Gwen.
(Clears throat)
Put me back on with him.





GWEN





Thats what Ive been trying to tell you. You ARE back on with him.





SARRIS





Perhaps Im not as stupid as I am ugly, Commander.





Jason turns to Gwen horrified.
JASON





I gave you the "kill" gesture.





GWEN





No, you gave me the "were dead" signal. I was agreeing with you. Like I know where the hold button is.





GUY





Hey, guys?
 





GUY





Guys ... Theres a Red thingy moving toward the green thingy. 





JASON





What?





GUY





Red thingy moving toward the green thingy!
 





Guy motions to the radar screen. The red blip is about to impact.
GUY





I think  I think we're the green thingy.





SARRIS





A little present for you, Commander.





JASON





We gotta get out of here. Move the ship. Turn it. Move! Lets go!





The ship is POUNDED BY A TORPEDO BLAST. Now, unlike the "run back and forth" shake-the-camera explosions of the TV show, the result here is jarringly BRUTAL, like side-slamming a Hummer at 70mph. The entire crew goes FLYING from their positions and into the walls. The lights FLICKER. 
They exchange glances, for the first time, bona fide FEAR In their eyes. This is REAL. Then ANOTHER blast sends them crumpled against walls and objects like rag dolls. The pain is palpable as they try to get back to their stations.
JASON





Tommy, Tommy! Lets go! Get us out of here! 





TOMMY





Jason, what do I do?





JASON





Go! Go! Go!





Tommy looks at the sparkling map of lights on his dash.
TOMMY





WHOO!





Tommy punches the red button. They all hold on for dear life as the ship roars forward, across the path of Sarris' ship.
GWEN





They're turning. They're COMING.





An explosion rocks the ship. Then another, and ANOTHER...
SARRIS





Thrust ahead, full! (beat) Fire at will.





JASON





Go faster, Tommy!





TOMMY





Im going as fast as I can.





GUY





Shes still behind us...





JASON





Well, uh, uh, press the turbo. I'm always saying "press the turbos", right?...





TOMMY





Oh, its right here.





JASON





Press it and hold it down.





He pushes the turbo. The ship begins to VIBRATE. Iy moves at a blinding sspeed.
TOMMY





Whoo!





COMPUTER





The enemy is matching velocity.





GWEN





The enemy is matching velocity.





ALEXANDER





We heard it the first time!





GWEN





Gosh! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the darn computer!





Suddenly an image of Fred down in the generator room appears on the side viewscreen. He's taking it all in stride.
FRED





Hi guys. Listen, they're telling me that the generators won't take it, the ship is breaking apart and all that. Just FYI.





The viewscreen goes black. The ship ROARS forward.
ALEXANDER





We've got to stop!





JASON





We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!





ALEXANDER





You cant hold a turbo down! It's for quick boosts





JASON





Oh! Like YOU know?





The ship GROANS and CREAKS. Then a loud KLAXON sounds.
GWEN





I remember that sound! That's a bad sound!





Jason looks forward. In the distance is an amorphous MASS...
JASON





Wait, wait, wait, wait. We might be able to lose them in this cloud here.





GWEN





I don't think that's a cloud...





As they approach, the "cloud" reveals itself to actually be thousands upon thousands of SLOWLY ROTATING OCTAHEDRONS.
JASON





Mathasar? What is that?





MATHASAR





It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.





Their jaws drop as they see the vast array of MINES.
TOMMY





Oh god ... Whoo!





THE FIRST MINE HITS, ROCKING THE SHIP... BOOM! Tommy SWERVES to avoid it, running into another mine. Then another. Tommy couldn't do worse if he were aiming for them.
ALEXANDER





Could you possibly try (BOOM!) not to hit (BOOM!) every (BOOM!) single (BOOM!) one!





TOMMY





Sorry, man. They're drifting toward us... I think they're magnetic!...





52 EXT. PROTECTOR
The ship HURTLES FORWARD through the mine field, taking considerable damage as the mines impact. PIECES of the ship fall off behind it...
52A INT. SARRIS' SHIP
Calm, Sarris watches the PROTECTOR fly into the almost certain death of the mine field. His LIEUTENANT flies ahead eagerly.
LATHE





Continue forward, sir?





SARRIS





Patience, Lieutenant ... Patience.





INT. COMMAND DECK
ALEXANDER





Weve gotta stop.
 





JASON





We're almost through this.





The ship is now VIBRATING HORRIBLY. It GROANS and CREAKS then ... RIVETS start to POP sending DEADLY PROJECTILES flying.
And then suddenly a LOUD GRINDING noise. Then SILENCE. The vibrating stops. Gwen looks up from her radar screen.
The ship tumbles end over end, and finally drifts to a stop.
JASON





You okay? You all right?





VOICES





Yeah!





JASON





Everybody all right? Wheres Tommy?





55 INT. COMMAND DECK
The deck looks dead and empty. Smoke is in the air. The lights 
are dim. The sirens have stopped. It's completely silent. The 
crew slowly emerges from behind panels and equipment, bruised and 
bloodied. Jason moves to Gwen.
They hear a GROAN. Tommy is crumpled against the wall, his arm 
twisted impossibly. He's in agony.
JASON





Tommy! Are you all right?





TOMMY





No, my arm is broke  No! Dont touch it. Dont touch it!





MATHASAR





I'll take him to medical quarters.





JASON





Thanks, Mathasar.





Alexander moves toward the door.
GWEN





Alex? Where are you going?





ALEXANDER





To see if there's a pub.





He exits. The others turn to Jason, their faces sooty, their clothing torn and bloody.
56 INT. SHIP STRATEGY ROOM
COMPUTER





...Forward thruster shaft, 87% damage... aft vector guards, 96% damage... Level 5 structural breaches in quadrants 32, 34, 40, 43, 58...





JASON





What about the engines?





COMPUTER





Forward thruster shaft  87% damage.





GWEN





Computer, what about the engines? Why don't we have power?





COMPUTER





The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.





GWEN





It's fractured...





JASON





Can it be repaired?





GWEN





Computer, can it be repaired?





COMPUTER





Negative. Damage to beryllium sphere irreparable. New source of beryllium must be secured.





GWEN





We need another one.





ALEXANDER (to Jason)





You broke the ship. You broke the bloody SHIP! 





JASON





Computer, is there a replacement beryllium sphere on board?





GWEN





Computer, is there a replacement beryllium sphere on board?





COMPUTER





Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists on board.





GWEN





No. We have no extra beryllium sphere on board.





TOMMY





You know, that is really getting annoying.





GWEN (deadly)





Look! I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. OKAY?





TOMMY (intimidated)





Sure, no problem.





Suddenly the door opens and seven Aliens enter, led by MATHASAR. They look VERY SERIOUS. Guy exchanges an "uh oh" glance with Tommy... But the aliens lower their heads.
MATHASAR





A thousand apologies. We have failed you.





JASON





How have you failed us?





MATHASAR (wracked with sadness)





We have seen you victorious in much more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...





Gwen shoots Jason a glance... TELL THEM.
JASON





No, MATHASAR. It is not your fault and its not the ships fault. Its-its-its-its my fault. We-we screwed  





GWEN





We're not the people you think we are.





MATHASAR





I don't understand.





Alexander gets up and walks toward Mathasar.
ALEXANDER





Dont you make any TV shows on your planet? Any theater, films?





MATHASAR





The historical documents of your culture... Yes, in fact we have begun to document our own history, from your example...





GWEN





No not historical documents... They're not all historical documents... I mean... surely you don't think Gilligan's Island is a...





MATHASAR and the others exchange sad glances...
MATHASAR





Those poor people...





TOMMY 





Oh, brother...





MATHASAR and the others exchange quizzical looks.
GUY





Were screwed.





GWEN





Is there no one on your planet who behaves in a way that is contrary to reality?





MATHASAR





Ah. You speak of...





Unable to bring the words to mind, he confers with his fellows.
MATHASAR





"Deception ..." "Lies."





MATHASAR





We have only recently become aware of these concepts. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy but deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.
(a worried beat)
But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.





He starts to laugh, and the other aliens join in.
Suddenly a VIEWSCREEN lights and we see Fred on the monitor from down in the generator room.
FRED (ON SCREEN)





Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?





JASON





Well do that!





GUY





All right!





Fred turns to two young TECHS next to him.
FRED





Thats  thats right, again. Come on, everybody. Group hug.





EXT ORBITING A RED PLANET
The ship lumbers slowly forward. In the distance we see the swirling globe of a colorful and mysterious PLANET.
 
35 INT. HALLWAY
Alex's young escort, QUELLEK, leads him down the hall. 
QUELLEK





Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.





ALEXANDER





Well good, that's very... nice.





QUELLEK (emotional)





By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-





ALEXANDER





Don't do that. I'm not kidding.





QUELLEK





I'm sorry, sir, I was only-





ALEXANDER





Just don't.





QUELLEK





...Yes sir.
(they come to a stop)





58 INT. SURFACE POD BAY - LATER
MATHASAR





Never give up. Never surrender.





Jason, Gwen, Tommy, Fred and Guy enter the small surface pod. Quellek, Alexander's protege, steps forward, hands Alex a device.
QUELLEK





Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper. I have programmed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.





QUELLEK (emotional)





Good luck on your mission, Sir. 





ALEXANDER





Thanks.
 





59 INT. SURFACE POD
Tommy pilots the craft as the pod approaches the beautiful and mysterious planet. Guy looks out the window nervously.
JASON





Youre doing good, Tommy.





Fred is calmly eating a snack and looking out the window like a tourist.
GUY





I changed my mind. I want to go back.





ALEXANDER





After all the fuss you made about not getting left behind on the ship?





GUY





Yeah, but that's when I thought maybe was the crewman that stays on the ship and something is up there and it kills me, but now I'm thinking I'm the guy who gets killed by some monster five minutes after we land on the planet...





JASON





Youre not gonna die on the planet, Guy.





GUY





Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?





JASON





It's... I don't know.





GUY





No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in.





GWEN





Guy, you HAVE a last name. 





GUY





Do I? DO I? For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
(hysterical) 





ALEXANDER (sighs)





Are we there yet?





60 EXT. SURFACE POD
The pod makes its way toward the surface.
JASON





Tommy!





61 INT. POD
The ship shakes as it lands. Everyone exchanges anxious glances. 
ALEXANDER





Pull Out!





The ship swerves around and lands smoothly between two rocks. Everyone is amazed.
Suddenly the HATCH opens with a loud PHHHHT of air decompression. Fred has opened it.
GUY





Dont open that! It's an alien planet! Is there air!? You don't know, do you!





Fred sniffs the air.
FRED





Seems okay.





Guy sighs.
62 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY
The six exit the craft tentatively. Guy looks around, apprehensive.
GWEN





Here we go.





JASON





Which way, Alexander?





Alexander looks down at his mapper.
ALEXANDER





This way... Wait, no, that way...





They turn in the opposite direction.
TOMMY





You were holding it upside down weren't you?





ALEXANDER





Shut up.





TOMMY





You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.





ALEXANDER





You think you could do better "Laredo?"





TOMMY





Hey, watch that "Laredo" stuff.





GUY





We're screwed... We're so screwed...





JASON





Come on, come on, come on. If we wanna finish this mission we have to use some self-control.





GWEN





Self control? That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...





JASON





Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you might have been able ... 





66 VALLEY BELOW - MINING OUTPOST
Below there is a small ABANDONED MINING FACILITY. Wind WHISTLES through various structures and power stations. In the center of the outpost sits a large shimmering boulder.
JASON





There it is. The Beryllium sphere.





ALEXANDER





Must be some sort of mining facility.





GWEN





Where are the miners?





GUY





Something BAD happened here.





TOMMY





Will you relax?





Jason scans the area with a pair of binoculars and sees a number of rocky spheres.
JASON





There they are  beryllium spheres. Lets go.





SuddenlyThey become aware of a SMALL BLUE CREATURE emerging from one of the structures. It's blue and looks somewhat like a human child. It moves to a small pool of water and begins drinking. Its movements are very quiet and tentative. Then a few more BLUE CHILDREN emerge and join the first. The crew ducks behind the rocks.
GWEN (smiling, amazed)





Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...





ALEXANDER





Could they be the miners?





FRED





Sure. They're like, three years old.





ALEXANDER





MINERS, not MINORS.





He pronounces the two words exactly the same. Fred looks at Alex like he's crazy.
FRED





You lost me.





GUY





I don't like this... I don't like this at all...





GWEN





Oh, they're so cute.





GUY





Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...





Then another blue creature emerges. This one limps, its leg is hurt. It moves forward, DRAGGING its bad foot along the ground, making NOISE.
EVERYONE





Awwww..... It's hurt...





Gwen rises up a little, tentatively waving at Limpy...
GWEN





Hi! ... Hi there little guy...





Guy PUSHES her down behind the rock before the creatures notice.
GUY





Jesus, Did you guys ever WATCH the show!?





The BLUE CHILDREN turn toward Limpy, and begin whispering in an alien tongue...
ALIEN CHILDREN 





Gorignak... Gorignak.... Nak nak!





GWEN





Aw, look. They're going to help the little one...





Indeed the others move to the hurt creature, cocking their heads to the side empathetically...
Then suddenly we see the aliens SMILE with SHARP RAZOR TEETH, their mouths SPREADING OUT IMPOSSIBLY ON THEIR FACES. They DESCEND on LIMPY, ripping him apart. We only see a GEYSER OF BLOOD from the center of the blue circle.... Our group is silent, horrified.
GUY





I am SO SICK of being right.





GWEN (stunned horror)





Let's get out of here before one of those things kills Guy.





JASON





Wait a minute. Were not going anywhere without a beryllium sphere. We need a plan.





Reluctantly, they all nod in agreement.
JASON





Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere. Tommy, get up on that ridge, and if you see them come back, give me a signal. All right?





GWEN





Why does this sound so familiar?





TOMMY





"Assault on Voltareck III." Episode 81, I think.





GUY





We're doing episode 81?





TOMMY





Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.





GWEN





How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?





GUY





We're doing episode 81, Jason?





JASON





It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 81 or not?!





GUY





BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!





FRED





Shh. Episode 51, right. Were doing episode 51, right. 





ALEXANDER





(interrupting)
This is ludicrous. Why are you listening to this fellow? Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?... He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow. (motions to Guy) No offense.





Gwen peers around the corner toward the spheres.
GWEN





Look. Theyre gone.





GUY





Whered they go, back inside?





GWEN





I dont know.





ALEXANDER





Nobody was watching?





JASON





All right. All right. Listen up. Heres the plan. Gwen, Fred, Alex and I will go down and get a sphere.
Fleegman, you set up a perimeter, and Tommy, youre the lookout. You see anything at all, you give us a signal. All right?





TOMMY





What kind of a signal?





JASON





Any kind of signal.





TOMMY





Okay, Ill do my hands like this ...
And caw, caw, caw.





JASON





What are you, an infant? Look. We have these. (shows the VOX)





TOMMY (chastened)





That  Sorry  





JASON





All right. Lets go.





EXT  THROUGH THE ROCKY DESERT to the mine
Jason is rolling in the dirt every few feet.
GWEN





Does the rolling help.





JASON





Uh  huh. It helps.





GWEN





Wheres your gun?





Jason stops and looks around for his gun. Alex and Gwen keep walking.
ALEX





It helps.





JASON





Shoot!





Tommy looks through the binoculars, watching the group head toward the Beryllium spheres. 
TOMMY





Oh!





GUY





What?





They start running forward.
CUT TO: The sphere
They start to roll the heavy sphere.
JASON





Never Give Up! Never Surrender!





GWEN, FRED AND ALEX TOGETHER





Oh, shut up!





Tommy looks through the binoculars, sees something and begins to run down the hillside.
TOMMY





Caw, caw, Jason. Theyre coming  Run, Jason, run.





The people pushing the sphere stop and look around. They see the blue meanies appearing from behind every rock.
TOMMY





Theyre everywhere. Theyre everywhere.





JASON





Come on. Lets go. Lets go.





They roll the sphere as fast as they can.
JASON





Hurry!





TOMMY





Theyre everywhere. Come on.





JASON





Dont look back! Dont look back!





GUY





Were not gonna make it.





Gwen stops and looks back, to see the blue babies closing in on them repidly. She screams and rushes to catch up.
GUY





I knew it! I knew it! I knew this was gonna kill me.





JASON





Hurry! Go, go, go. Come on. Push. Lets go. Go.





They shove the ball into the shuttle and Jason yells to go.
TOMMY





I got it. But its gonna take a few seconds.





GUY (Holding the sphere)





I got it! I got it!





ALEXANDER





Go ahead!





JASON





Theres no time. Get it. Get in.





ALEXANDER





Of course, I forgot, youve got to be the hero, havent you? Heaven forbid anybody else gets the spotlight! Oh, no, Jason Nesmith 





Jason punches Alexander out.
GWEN





Oh! Jason, Jason, come on! Hurry.





GWEN





Hurry!





JASON





Tommy, go! Go! Im in!





Jason falls out of the back of the pod.
GWEN





Help! No, no, no! Jason, please. Tommy, stop the pod. Stop it.





TOMMY





I cant stop it. Its on autopilot.





GUY





Go, leave him.





GWEN





NO!





EXT VIEW OF THE POD
The pod lifts off the ground, with a number of creatures clinging to it. 
INT SHUTTLE POD
Gwen and Alexander look back out the window at Jason amid the creatures.
ALEXANDER





Oh! Right! Of course, its always about YOU, isnt it!





The ship inexorably flies upwards.
Jason is lying on the ground and the creatures are gathered around him, talking. We see subtitles.
CREATURE 1





Thats strange ... 





CREATURE 2





It looks like a child.





CREATURE 1





What should we do?





CREATURE (OS)





Hit it with a rock ... and well eat it.





A creature raises a rock and strikes. 
FADE TO BLACK
FADE IN
We find Jason lying on his back, eyes closed. Hes still unconscious. Our POV shifts to a monster, almost all teeth, looking down at us. Back to a view of Jason, with the monster licking Jasons face with a huge tongue.
JASON





Oh, hey!





Jason rises quickly, struggling to get away. In the background we hear the constant chanting of the creatures. They are saying "Gorignack, Gorignack."
INT SHIP TRANSPORTATION ROOM
Gwen, Guy, Tommy and Alexander run in.
GWEN (ON THE COMMUNICATOT)





Jason? Jason? Can you hear me?





JASON





Yeah, Gwen. You got me.





GWEN





Thank God! Are you okay?





Yeah. As a matter of fatc Ive got Gorignak staring me in the face right now. But, you know what? I think I can take him.
GWEN





Jason, were going to use the digital conveyor to get you out of there.





JASON





The digital conveyor?





GWEN





Yeah.





JASON





You mean Im gonna be diced into cubes and sent up there in a million pieces?





FRED





Right.





JASON





Well, you know what? I think Ill take my chances with Gorignak.





GWEN





Were getting you out right now. Its perfectly safe, isnt it, Teb?





TEB





It has never been successfully tested.





JASON





What did he say?





GWEN





Hold, please.





TEB





Theoretically, the mechanism is fully operational. However, it was built to accomodate your Hm anatomy, not ours. But now that Sergeant Chen is here, he can operate it. It was designed watching his motions from the historical documents. 





FRED (STAMMERING)





I  I  I mean, I cant. I  I  I can supervise.





ALEXANDER





Jason, were gonna test it.





JASON





On what? 





TOMMY





How about that pig lizard?





JASON





Hey, Im doing all right with the pig lizard.





GWEN





Please, Fred. And hurry.





TEB





(High-pitched squeal)





Everyone looks at him for breaking Freds concentration.
TEB





Im sorry. Its very exciting to watch the master at the controls. The operation of the conveyor is more hmmm - hmmm art than science.





GWEN





Stand back, Jason.





Fred adjusts the controls and zeroes in on the pig lizard. He aligns a square over the image of the lizard, twists the controls and we CUT TO:
VIEW OF THE PIG LIZARD, SHUDDERING
Suddenly it sparks, flares and ... disappears.
INT Spaceship transportation room
The lizard suddenly materializes on the platform, but there is something wrong. Its ribs are sticking up in the air. The people in the room scream and groan.
JASON





What? What was that?





ALEXANDER





Uh  Nothing.





JASON





I heard some squealing or something.





GWEN





Oh, no. Everythings fine.





TEB





But the animal is inside out.





JASON





I heard that. It turned inside out?





The animal remains suddenly exploded.
TEB





And it exploded.





JASON





Did I just hear that the animal turned inside out and then it exploded? Hello?





GWEN





Hold, please.





JASON





Hey, wait a minute. Guys. Guys.





JASON





If the pig lizard is gone, why are they still yelling "Gorignak"?





TOMMY





Teb, hit the translation circuit.





He does, and the chanting changes from "Gorignak" to "Rock".
GWEN





Jason. I dont think the pig lizard was Gorignak. 





JASON





What the hell you talking about?





Jason hears a rumbling and slowly turns around to see the rocks gathering into a walking shape.
JASON





Oh, darn.





Jason takes off, with the rock monster hot on his tail.
JASON





Digitize me!





GWEN





Come on, Fred.





FRED





Not me.





GWEN





Come on. They based it on your hand movements.





FRED





Am I the only one who saw that thing inside out? No, no, no, no. I I  Im not that guy. Im not Tech Sergeant Chen. Im Fred Kwan and Kwans not even my middle name.





ALEXANDER





Freds no good, Jason. Youre just gonna have to kill it.





JASON





Kill it? Well, Im open to any suggestions.





TOMMY





Go for the eyes, like in episode 22.





JASON





It doesnt have any eyes, Tommy.





TOMMY





Go for the mouth or the throat, its vulnerable spots!





JASON





Its a rock. It doesnt have any vulnerable spots.





GUY





I know! You construct a weapon. Look around you. Can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?





JASON





A lathe? Get off the line, Guy. Alexander, youre my advisor. Advise me.





ALEXANDER





Well, youre just gonna have to figure out what it wants. What is its motivation?





JASON





Its a rock monster. It doesnt have motivation.





ALEXANDER





See, thats your problem, Jason. You were never serious about the craft.





JASON





Oh! Fred, can you hear me? Fred, are you there?





FRED





Kinda.





JASON





You can do it, Fred. Its up to you.





FRED





Oh, no, no, no, Jason Ill just - Ill just mess it up.





JASON





You did it for four years on the show. Do it now.





FRED





That was on the show. Im not that guy.





JASON





Fred, you never forgot a line. You never missed a mark.





FRED





Thats not me anymore, man.





JASON





It is you, Fred. You just stopped trying. You could do this, Fred. I know in my heart, youre gonna save my life.





FRED





I am?





JASON





No doubt about it, Fred.





The door opens to the room and Fred sees Laliani. 
JASON





Fred!





Laliani smiles at Fred.
JASON





Fred, can you hear me? Fred!





Suddenly Fred zips up his uniform, turns to the controls and, with a new-found determination, sets to work.
JASON





Fred? I dont wanna die down here. Digitize me, Fred. 





The rock monster falls directly on top of Jason.
CUT TO: INT Transportation room.
Jason suddenly arrives on the platform. Hes shirtless.
FRED





Oh, wow.





TEB





Tech Sergeant Chen.





JASON





Yeah!





Jason and Gwen hug, and Fred eyes Laliani.
JASON





Oh.





ALEXANDER





I see you managed to get your shirt off.





FRED





I did it.





JASON





Welcome back, Fred.





JASON





All right. Did we get the beryllium sphere installed?





TEB





Yes, we are back to full power.





JASON





Great! Engines and pods?





LALIANI





Fully operational.





JASON





Perfect! Well crank this sucker up. You can drop us off, and you guys can be back to your home planet before supper.





TEB





Oh, no, sir. We have no reason to go back.





JASON





Sure you do. Family, friends, come on.





TEB





We are all that is left.





The crew members all look at each other. None of them were told.
JASON





I didnt know that.





TEB





Sir, I have raised the command deck.





JASON





(INTO COMMUNICATOR)
Mathasar, meet us up on the command deck. Mathasar. Mathasar, Quellek! Why cant we reach them?





Suddenly, the door opens and Sarris troops come in, fully armed. Then Sarris enters. Guy faints.
INT COMMAND DECK
Jason is tossed into the room. All the other people are dragged in. MATHASAR is strapped to a table.
MATHASAR





Commander. Thank God youre alive. Now you will face justice, Sarris.





SARRIS





At every turn you demonstrate the necessity for your extermination.





JASON





Leave him alone.





SARRIS





You wish to save the life of this man?





JASON





Yeah. Yes.





SARRIS





Then tell me  what does it do? This Omega 13.





JASON





I dont know what it does.





Sarris backs away, disbelieving.
JASON





I said I dont know.





Sarris shocks MATHASAR, who turns momentarily into his tentacled shape.
SARRIS





Is it a bomb?





JASON





I dont know.





Sarris shocks MATHASAR again.
SARRIS





A booby trap?





JASON





I dont know.





SARRIS





Tell me.





JASON





I dont know.





SARRIS





Do you think Im a fool? That the commander does not know every bolt, every weld in his ship? (beat) Prepare a tear harness  for the female.





JASON





No, Gwen, no!





GWEN





You brute! Let go of me.





JASON
(GROANING)





Im not the commander.





SARRIS
(SOFTLY)





What did you say?





JASON





I said Im not the commander.
(getting up)
Leave them alone. Theres no reason to hurt them. They dont know anything.





SARRIS





Explain.





JASON





Gwen, show him the historical documents.





GWEN





Computer. Show the historical documents of the Galaxy Quest missions.





An episode begins to play. Sarris watches, understanding. He begins by chuckling, then laughing.
SARRIS





Wonderful. You have all done far greater damage than I ever could have. Bravo. Bravo. This is a moment I will treasure. Explain to him who you all really are. Tell him. Explain!





JASON





Mathasar, the  theres no such person as Captain Taggart. My name is Jason Nesmith. I am an actor. Were all actors. 





SARRIS





He doesnt understand. Explain as you would a child.





JASON





We  uh  we pretended. We lied.





MATHASAR moans with comprehension.
SARRIS





Yes! You understand that, dont you, Mathasar?





JASON





Mathasar, I  Im not a commander. I, uh. Theres no National Space Exploration Administration. We dont have a ship. 





MATHASAR (pointing to screen)





But there it is.





JASON





That ship is that big (indicating two inches).





MATHASAR





But inside, I see many rooms.





JASON





Youve seen plywood sets that look like the inside. Our beryllium sphere is  is wire with plaster around it. And our (chuckle) our digital conveyor is Christmas tree lights. Its a decoration. Its all fake. Just like me. 





MATHASAR





But why?





JASON





Its difficult to explain. On our planet we  uh  we pretend  to  to entertain and - . Mayhasar, I am so sorry. God, I am so sorry.





Mathasar gags.
Sarris





So now you know. Lieutenant Layhe. Hardwire the reactor core to overload. I would like to blow this troublesome vehicle to dust. 





MATHASAR





Sarris. What about my people?





Sarris





Yes! Far too simple a death for them, isnt it? Lathe, open an oxygen seal on level C. Let the air in a bit for our friends. 





JASON





Son of a  





Jason jumps on Sarris, but Sarris hits him with the shocking device and Jason goes down.
Sarris





Release them  into space.





COMPUTER





Core overload. Emergency shutdown overridden. Core implosion estimated in nine minutes. Core overload. Emergency shutdown overridden





The crew is being manhandled toward the airlock room.
GWEN





Hey!





ALEXANDER





Wheres the happy ending, Jason? Never give up? Never surrender?





Jason watches a guard manipulate the door controls. He has an idea,
JASON (TO ALEXANDER)





Maybe its about time you just backed off, you fin-headed monstrosity.





GWEN





Jason?





ALEXANDER





You what?





JASON





Youre starting to act like you did in episode 17, you scene-stealing hack.





Alexander tries to recall what happened in episode 17. That was so long ago. Realization dawns slowly.
ALEXANDER





Oh, right. Well, how does it feel, Jason? Was it worth it? You murdered us all.





JASON





Shut up!





ALEXANDER





Hundreds to die just because of you.





JASON





I told you to shut up.





GUARD (COMING CLOSE)





Both of you  get in there.





ALEXANDER





Hundreds to die just because you wanna play a big commander. You raving lunatic.





JASON





Then Ill see you in hell, wont I?





Jason pushes Alexander, and they begin fighting, punching each other back and forth across the room. The rest of the crew is watching astonished. They have no idea what has gotten into these two. On one punch, Alexander aims Jason toward a long pole-like device, which Jason picks up, unseen by the guard. He swings it at Alexander, who ducks just in time, and the guard, right behind Alexander, is a perfect target. Jason whacks him. 
ALEXANDER





Look out, Jason! 





Alexander pushes the guard away.
JASON





Get his gun. Get the gun.





Alexander dives for the gun. 
Guy jumps into the fray.
GUY





Take that!





Guy throws the guard in the chamber, to join his fellow. Just as they aim their weapons at the crew, the steel door suddenly comes down right on front of them. The crew looks at the guards, and the guards look at the crew, neither side capable of doing anything to the other.
Suddenly the door behind the guards opens and they are exposed to the vacuum of space. In a second, they are sent flying out of the craft by the air in the compartment. They are gone.
The crew turns to the door controls, and Fred is standing there, after pushing the right buttons.
FRED





Sorry, I was  Door was a little sticky. Did you see that? Ill get one of my boys up here with a can of WD-40.





Alexander hugs Fred, and the entire crew is happy, but they still have a problem. The core is still going to explode.
JASON (TO ALEXANDER)





You used to pull your punches.





ALEXANDER





You scene-stealing hack? Thank you.





JASON





Raving egomaniac?





ALEXANDER





Cant think of where I got that from.





GWEN





Guys. Look.





They see, on the monitor, the crew of the spaceship struggling to breathe.
GWEN





Theyre suffocating.





COMPUTER





Core overload. Emergency shutdown overridden. Core implosion estimated in eight minutes.





The crew races off. They have to do something. They just cant stand around.
SARRIS GUARD





General! Your transport is ready for departure.





Sarris turns away from Mathasar and leaves.
COMPUTER





Core overload. Emergency shutdown overridden. Core implosiaon estimated in seven minutes.





GWEN





Computer. Shut down the core.





COMPUTER





Unable. Memory checksums invalid. Core systems hardware damaged.





JASON





All right. Listen up. This is what we gotta do. 
Gwen, you and I were gonna get to the core and shut it down manually. 
Fred, take Guy and Laliari. You find that valve. Shut it off before those Thermians run out of air. 
Alexander, get to the barracks. Wedge a door open, in case they cant do that. 





ALEXANDER





Okay.





TOMMY





Wait, Jason. What about me? What do I do?





JASON





Youre gonna practice driving. Lets go!





TOMMY





Practice driving. 





Jason and Gwen are making their way through the hallways.
GWEN





So we get to shut down a neutron reactor.





JASON





Thats right.





GWEN





I hate to break it to you, Jason, but I dont know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a learning annex course I dont know about, Im pretty sure you dont know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.





JASON





Mo, I dont. But I know someone who does.





Jason flicks open his interstellar VOX
CUT TO EXT BRANDONS HOUSE
INT BRANDONS BEDROOM
His mother knocks on the door and opens it.
MOM





Brandon, honey. Garbage.





BRANDON (LOOKING THROUGH A MAGNIFIER)





Mother, Im quite busy.





MOM





Come on, Brandon. Dont make me ask you again.





BRANDON





Just ten more minutes. Okay, Ma, I promise.





MOM





Great.





Brandon hears a soft beep. He doesnt know where its coming from. He looks in the drawer, then he hears a soft voice.
JASON





(BEEP) Hello? Anybody there? ... Hello.





BRANDON (HESITANTLY)





Hello?





JASON (TO GWEN)





Got him.
(TO BRANDON)
Listen to me. This is Jason Nesmith. I play Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, NSEA Protector. We accidentally traded VOXes the other day when we bumped into each other.





Brandon now knows where the voice is coming from. He reaches for the VOX.
BEANDON





Oh? Oh, Commander, I see.





He picks up the VOX.
BRANDON





Okay.





JASON





Whats your name, son?





BRANDON





Brandon.





JASON





Brandon, I remember you, from the convention, right? You asked all those little technical questions about the ship ... And I was a little short with you?





BRANDON





Yes, I - I know, Commander, and I actually wanna  I just wanted to tell you that I - I though a lot about what you said. 





JASON





Its okay. Now listen.





BRANDON





But I want you to know that Im not a complete brain case, okay? I understand completely that its just a TV show. 





JASON





Hold on, wait a minute 





Brandon continues.
JASON





Wait a minute. Stop. Stop for just a second. Stop. Wait. Its all real.





BRANDON





Oh, my God! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!





JASON





The crew and I are in a lot of trouble, and we need your help.





CUT TO:
Alexander is sneaking around a corner in the passageway. 
COMPUTER





Core overload. Emergency shutdown overridden. Core implosion estimated in six minutes.





Alexander ducks into a doorway as guards come around the corner in front of him. Suddenly he hears a gasp and a light scream coming from above him. He takes a defensive stance, then notices that its one of the Thermians. He somehow recognizes the creature.
QUELLEK





Sir, its you. Thank Ipthar!





ALEXANDER





Quellek? What are you doing up there?





Quellek leaps down, activating his appearance generator, and he comes into the frame as a human.
QUELLEK





I avoided capture by using your Maktar stealth face.





Alexander feels, hey, whatever works.
QUELLEK





Where is everyone?





ALEXANDER (TAKING THE GUN)





Come with me. Ill explain on the way.





CUT TO:
Another part of the ship. Gwen and Jason are making their way through the ship with the guidance from Brandon.
JASON (INTO THE VOX)





All right. Were at level C, hallway five. Now what?





BRANDON





Um  go to weapons storage, your second left, through the passage. And that leads to a system of utiliti corridors through the bowels of the ship.





JASON (TO THE DOOR MECHANISM)





Open!





BRANDON





You know. Im gonna get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anyone else alive.





CUT TO:
Guy, Fred and Laliani coming around a corner, Guy holding a gun at the ready.
GUY





... 38, 39, 40.





They reach a doorway.
FRED





All we have to do is turn off the valve to the barracks.





They look through the window to see that the room is filled with Sarris guards, sitting around chatting. They cant get to the valve, and the situation appears hopeless.
CUT TO:
INT BRANDONS BEDROOM, COMPUTER SCREEN
Kyle is on the screen.
KYLE





Hi, Brandon.





BRANDON





No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. You still got the utility systems walk-through, right?





KYLE





Yeah. Ive got sectors one through twenty-eight. I think Hollister has the upper levels.





BRANDON





Great. Ill get everybody on-line.





CUT TO: COMMAND DECK  TOMMY
Tommy is watching the historical documents and practicing "driving".
LAREDO (ONSCREEN)





Pedal to the metal, Commander.





TOMMY





Pedal to the metal, Commander.





SARRIS SHIP
LATHE





General! I have just received word that the commander of the Protector and his command crew have escaped custody.





SARRIS





What?





Suddenly the windshield of the spacecraft is wetly struck by the body of one of Sarris guards. He glances at it dispassionately, then turns back to his Lieutenant. 
SARRIS





Find them!





LATHE





But sir! My men! The core implosion  





SARRIS (ANGRILY)





FIND THEM!!





CUT TO: JASON AND GWEN
JASON





All right, Brandon. I see five ducts in this room. Which way do we go?





BRANDON





Enter the passage second to your left. And just continue straight for 50 meters.





GWEN





Ducts? Why is it always ducts?





BRANDON





Uh = there will be a slight drop.





Too late  Jason and Gwen slide down rapidly. Gwen screams, but they land harmlessly into a passageway.
JASON





Thanks for the heads-up, Brandon.
(TO GWEN)
You okay?





CUT TO:
Alexander and Quellek, reaching the doorway, where they can see the ships crew.
QUELLEK





Theyre dying.





CUT TO:
Jason and Gwen. They reach a catwalk without guard rails.
JASON





Wait a minute. We gotta go across this thing?





BRANDON





Yes.





JASON





Dont look down.





BRANDON (EXCITEDLY)





What Id give to see what youre seeing!





What Gwen sees, looking down, is a slowly rotating fan that spans the entire core that theyre crossing.
JASON





What are you talking about?





BRANDON





You[re deep in the underbelly of the Omega 13! Oh, it must be spectacular!





GWEN





It  it doesnt look like much to me. Theres just these few walls and this dumb spinning fan that we have in every single 





Jason looks up and a look of incredulity crosses his face. He points and Gwen looks up, too.=
What they see is the inner works of the Omega 13, nodules, spinning and glowing, jets of light shooting throughout it.
JASON





Brandon. What does the Omega 13 device do?





BRANDON





Uh, many have believed that it is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying pretty much everything in about 13 seconds. But myself and others are convinced that what is it 





JASON





We gotta go - go!





BRANDON





is a matter rearranger, affecting a 13 second time jump to the past.





GWEN





Why 13 seconds? Thats really not enough time to do anything of any importance.





JASON





Itd be time enough to redeem a single mistake.





GWEN





What?





Suddenly laser blast around them and Jason and Gwen have to move  Hason fires back as he ducks around the bend.
JASON





Go, go, go, go.





CUT TO:
Fred, Guy and Laliani, outside the door/
FRED





We gotta turn off that valve. Their oxygens almost gone.





GUY





Listen. Ill go in. Ill create a distraction. Ive got this (referring to the gun). Im okay. Im gonna be able to hold em back long enough for the aliens to escape.





FRED





Thats suicide.





GUY





Im just a glorified extra, Fred. Im a dead man anyway. If Im gonna die, Id rather go out as a hero than a coward.





FRED





Guy. Guy, maybe youre the plucky comic relief. You ever think about that?





GUY





Plucky?





FRED





Oh, besides (chuckle) I just had thie really interesting idea.





GUY





Are you stoned?





CUT TO:
Alexander and Quellek
ALEXANDER





Gotta get her up, and give them some time.





QUELLEK





Sir  perhaps together  the Maktar chant of strength: Larak tarath.





Alexander figures its worth a try. And it might just work.
TOGETHER (PULLING ON THE DOOR)





Larak tarath. Larak tarath. Larak tarath. Larak tarath. 





The door comes open slightly, but its not enough.
CUT TO:
Jason and Gwen
JASON





All right, Brandon. Were across. Now what?





BRANDON





You wanna take a left and then just straight on through the chompers.





GWEN





The chompers???





They turn a corner and see the chompers, a set of large pieces of metal that are rhytmically clapping together, waiting to crush anything that comes between them.
GWEN





Well, screw that! 





JASON





How are we supposed to get through this?





BRANDON (TO HOLLISTER)





Hollister, do you have the sequence yet?





HOLLISTER





Okay, the sequence is  two-two-four-two-





GWEN





What is this thing? I mean, it serves no useful purpose for there to be a bunch of chompy, crushy things in the middle of a hallway!





Guards catch up to them. They have to move NOW!
GWEN





We shouldnt have to do this. It makes no logical sense! Why is it here!





JASON





Because its on the television show.





GWEN





Well, forget it! I am not doing it! This episode was badly written.





BRANDON





Okay, Commander. Now, as soon as the first crusher hits you 





JASON





It just did.





BRANDON





Okay. Go NOW. Go!





JASON





Go! Stop! Go! Wait a minute! Go! Go! Come on. Come on. Come on.





Jason drops his gun and it gets crushed like a piece of butter.
They reach the end.
BRANDON





Jump, commander. Jump!





They do, just in time, for flames shoot up out of the floor.
GWEN





Whoever wrote this episode should die.





CUT TO:
Fred, Guy and Laliani
Fred is setting up the digital conveyor.
FRED





This should be interesting.





He zeroes in on the Rock Monster and manipulates the controls.
INT THE CHAMBER
The guards are sitting around when suddenly there is a flash. The Rock Monster appears in their midst and they all stare for a few seconds. Then they all begin shooting at it, to no effect. 
FRED





Its the simple things in life you treasure.





GUY





Thats great. Now we better get -





Laliani and Fred look at each other, then Lalaini grabs Fred and kisses him. 
GUY





Hey, get a room, guys.





Then she massages him with tentacles. Fred smiles and gives himself up to it.
GUY





Whoa! Hey, Fred. Hey, Fred!





They fall to the floor.
Whatever they are doing is not visible, but 
GUY





Hey, thats not right! Oh.





CUT TO: The Rock Monster
It chases them out of the room and down the halls, until it breaks through the side of the ship, thrusting them all into space. The Rock Monster seems to have a smile on its "face" as it sees itself becoming a planet.
Fred makes it into the room and opens the valve.
QUELLEK





Sir! The pressure! Its normalizing.





ALEXANDER





All right!





The door opens and they enter to help the people.
TEB





We are saved!





EVERYONE





He has saved us!





Alexander marches forward to receive his praise.
YEB





Commander Taggart has saved us.





ALEXANDER





Its just not fair.





ALEXANDER (AFTER A SHORT MOMENT)





All right, Quellek, lets get back to the commander.





A laser blast hits Quellek in the chest.
QUELLEK





Im  Im shot.





He falls. The guard who shot him advances, raises his gun to get off another shot, but he misses, Then his gun jams.
Alexander and others manage to get Quellek out of the line of fire.
AKEXANDER





Quellek?





He looks at the wound.
ALEXANDER





Thats not too bad. Well get you to the medical quarters, and youll be fine.





QUELLEK





It has been my greatest honor to serve with you. I have been blessed, sir  I, I 





ALEXANDER





Dont speak, Quellek.





QUELLEK





Youll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we never before met, I always considered you as a father to me. 





ALEXANDER





Quellek. By Grabthars hammer, by the suns of Warvan, you shall be avenged.





Quellek dies, and Alexander feels the fires of anger well up inside him. He stands, goes out into the hall and charges the armed alien, with no regard for his own safety. Fortunately the gun is still jammed. Alexander reaches the man and pounds him to the deck.
CUT TO:
Jason and Gwen
GWEN





... 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19!





JASON





All right, Brandon. How do we shut this thing down?





BRANDON





Okay! Just push the blue button.





JASON





The blue button. Is that it?





BRANDON





Yeah. Why? Whats wrong?





JASON





Nothing. I just thought itd be more complicated than that.





As Jason raises the lid, the computer gives an update.
COMPUTER





Core implosion estimated in 20 seconds.





Jason pushes the button, but the clock keeps counting down. Jason pushes the button again and again.
JASON





Brandon, its not working. Brandon.





CUT TO:
EXT BRANDONS HOUSE
He is carrying out the garbage, with his mother standing guard. He puts the Garbage into a trash can.
BRANDON
Mother, I cannot stress enough the severity of the commanders predicament. 
MOM
Dont forget the recyclables!
Brandon runs back to resort the trash/
CUT TO:
Jason and Gwen, watching the closk steadily go down.
COMPUTER
Core implosion estimated in ten seconds. Nine ... eight ...
JASON
Gwen, I  
COMPUTER
... seven ... six ... five ... four ...
GWEN
Jason. Oh, Jason.
They hug for one last time.
COMPUTER
... three ... two ... one ...
Nothing happens! They look at the clock and see it has stopped on one.
GWEB
It always stops at one on the show. 
They laugh with relief.
Jason turns to leave. They have wsork to do.
GWEN
Um, what were you saying?
CUT TO:
Sarris ship
LATHE
Sir!
SARRIS
What?
LATHE
The core detonation sequence on the Protector has been aborted.
SARRIS
Impossible! Impossible! Lock a complement of implosion missiles under the Protector. Tear her apart.
IN PROTECTOR
The Thermians and the Earthlings are fighting the invaders, and they are winning. Alexander marches through the fray, striking out at any of the enemy who make a move. Jason catches up with him, as he is beating up one of them.
JASON
Hes finished, Alexander. Listen to me. Its okay. Its okay. The Thermians can handle it from here. We gotta go. Come on.
Alexanders reptile headgear has come askew, but he doesnt seem to notice  and neither does anyone else.
INT COMMAND DECK
Jason, Gwen and Alexander arrive at the command deck on the run.
JASON
We need that armor back up! Get me a forward view right now!
Alexander hurriedly takes his place at the console.
ALEXANDER
Plasma armor: engaged.
There is a rumbling throughout the ship.
JASON
All right, Tommy, see if you can lose em in thast minefield/
GUY
Mi  Mine field?!?
JASON
Pedal to the metal! Right now!
TOMMY
Pedal to the metal!
GUY
All right, lets go!
EXT VIEW of the Protector going into the cloud. Tommy is doing a lot better at avoiding the magnetic mines.
JASON
Good going, Tommy! Great going!
ABOARD SARRIS SHIP
SARRIS
Thrust ahead  full! Into the field/ GO!
EXT VIEW OF SARRIS SHIP ENTERING THE FIELD.
CUT TO: COMMAND DECK OF THE PROTECTOR
JASON
Tommy, can you get us closer to those mines?
TOMMY 
Closer???
Jason looks at Tommy with a slight smile on his face/ Tommys mind clicks, and he grins broadly.
TOMMY
I could try 
ABOARD SARRIS SHIP
LATHE
General, Ive lost them. The magnetism of the mine field is disrupting our instruments.
Sarris turns away in disgust.
LATHE
Wait! I see something.
(Pointing)
Yes, yes! There they are.
SARRIS
Get back on their tail.
LATHE
I cant, sir.
SARRIS
What? Why not?
LATHE
Because theyre coming right at us.
SARRIS
Fire at will!
INT PROTECTOR COMMAND DECK
GUY
Whoo! Were getting hammered, Jason/ Return fire?
JASON
No! Divert all energy to the armor!
SARRIS
How adorable! The actors are going to play war with me. 
GWEN
Sarris ship accelerating toward us at mark 2.
JASON
Accelerate to mark 4.
The ships are heading toward each other at a rapid rate.
SARRIS
Let me reminf you, sonny: I am a general. If you are counting on me to blink, then you are making a deadly mistake.
JASON
Well, let me tell you something, Sarris. It doesnt take a great actor to recognize a bad one. Yourfe sweating.
GWEN
Armor almost gone, Jason!
SARRIKS
You fool! You Failed to realize that, with your armor gone, my ship will tear through yours like tissue paper.
JASON
And what you fail to realize is that my ship is ... dragging mines.
EXT PROTECTOR
As the ship passes below our POV we see that, behind it, attracted to the ships metal but not able to catch up, are hundreds of the mines.
SARRIS
Oh, no! Turm! Turn!
Too late! The group of mines heads right for Sarris ship, tearing it apart. We see Sarris run away from the forward part of the command center and stop before a console. Then the ship explodes, lighting up space with a huge fireball.
GWEN
We did it!
Everyone cheers at the total destruction of the enemy ship.
TGOMMY
Yes! Yes!
Jason chuckles, then Mathasar comes through the door to the command center, walking with a crutch.
JASON
Mathasar! Oh, my God. Youre alive.
They hug/
JASON
Come here.
MATHASAR (LAUGHING)
The ship was a model as big as this. A very clever deception, indeed!
The entire Thermian crew cheers and laughs.
TOMMY
Set a course for home, Commander?
JASON
Can you do that?
YOMMY
Oh, yeah. Just point and click. But were gonna have to go through the bnlack hole. 
JASON
Any objections?
No one objects at all.
JASON
All right, set her up.
Jason notes that Mathasar has a sad look on his face/
JASON
Whats the matter, Mathasar?
MATHASAR
We were hoping you could come with us. M-my people have no commander.
JASON
Mathgasar, I think your people have a great commander.
Then he gives Mathasar the Falaxy Quest salute and bow. Mathasars people also salute and bow.
Mathasar whimpers and Teb salutes and bows.
JASON
All right, Tommy. Take us into the black hole.
Tommy manipulates the controls like an old pro, and the ship enters the vortex.
On the other side 
GWEN
Were out.
GUY
Were going home/
COMPUTER
Systems register functional/
GWEB
All systems are working, Commander/
ALEXANDER
Jason. Before the black hole, there was an energy surge from Sarris ahip.
JASON
Lets not worry about that right now, Alexander.
(seeing Fred enter)
Fred, what are you doing up here? Shouldnt you be downstairs until we dec 
(seeing Fred pull out as gun)
Hey, you know, you can put an eye out with that thing ... Fred?
Fred shoots Jason! Then he switches off a ?VOX, which he used to alter his appearance, and he becomes  he is - Sarris!
Sarris shoots Tommy, Gwen, Alexander, and Jason sees them fall. These are the people he loves, he realizes, so he musters the last of his strength to call out.
JASON
Mathasar! Activate the Omega 13!
Mathasar rises and turns it on, which brings an activate button up in front of Jason. He presses the button. The Omega 13 sends a signal throughout the universe and - time flips backwards.
GWEN
Were out.
GUY
Were going home.
Jason is the only one who remembers what went on just a few seconds before.
COMPUTER
Systems register functional/
GWEN
All systems are working, Commander.
ALEXANDER
Jason, before the black hole, there was an energy surge from Sarris ship.
Now Jason knew what that surge indicates. He watches the door that Fred will come through.
As Fred enters, Jason charges him, knocks the gun out of his hand and beats him to the ground. His crew, not knowing who it really was, cant understand why their Commander is going berserk.
GWEN
Jason! What are you doing? What are you doing?
JASON
Let go of me/ Let  Its not Fred. Thats Sarris. Listen to me. Im telling you, thats not Fred. Thats Sarris. Hes going to try to kill all of us.
"Fred" turns into Sarris and rises from the deck. Deprived of his gun, he pulls a huge knife and lunges at Jason, when hes suddenly struck a blow from the side and goes down. Inconscious.
Its Mathasar who has done the deed with his crutch.
MATHASAR
Never give up  never surrender.
TOMMY
Jason! Jason! I cant slow it down!
MATHASAR
Our ship is too big to enter the atmosphere. We need to separate or we will die.
JASON
We gotta do it. Its our only hope, Mathasar. Thank you.
MATHADAR
Crew to the secondary deck.
GWEN
Mathasar.
He turns and she throws him a kiss.
MATHASAR
Goodbye, my friends.
GWEN
Fred. Get up to the command deck. Were separating.
Fred and Laliani are running through the hall when they meet Mathasar. Hed sees that they are holding hands and smiles, sending them on their way. An ambassador!
The ships separate and Mathasar takes command of his part.
MATHASAR
On, Teb. On.
The command portion of the ship is entering the atmosphere dangerously fast.
CUT TO: BRANDONS HOUSE  INT LIBING ROOM
Brandone mom and dad are on the couch, reading newspapers, and watching TV.
TV
This is the third day of the Galaxy Con, and Jason Nesmith and his entire crew are no-shows here at the big event. Much to the disappointment of all these fans, known as Questoids.
BRANDON
Bye. Be back soon.
MOM
Wait a minute. Hey, Bramndon, where are you going with all those fireworks?
BRANDN
Well, the Protector got super accelerated coming out of the black hole, and it site  nailed the atmosphere at mark 16, which, you guys know, is pretty unstable obviously, so were gonna help Laredo guide it on the vox ultra-frequency carrier and use Roman Candles for visual confirmnation, 
MOM
A-All right. Dinners at seven.
Brandon leaves and Mom turns to Dad.
MOM
Well, hes outside.
DAD
Hmmm.
The ship is plunging through the atmosphere. Roman candles are flying up from the convention parking lot, Brandon is standing there holding the vox as high as he can. 
The ship comes in over the horizon and skims over Brandon, so close that its wind blast knocks him to the ground.
It lands in the parking lot at a high rate of speed, taking out a number of cars, then continues on through the building, ending ujp at the stage, where it settle in a cloud of smoke and dust.
The crowd waits to see what will happen next. The door to the craft opens with a hiss. The announcer takes his place at the microphone. Brandon, Kyle and their friends enter the hall.
Tommy ecits the craft, coughing.
ANNOUNCER
Lieutenant Laredo  Tommy Webber! Hi, Tommy!
The beautiful Tawny Madison, Gwen DeMarco. Yes! Yes! Wow! What effects!
Guy comes out, hair askew/

We see Sarris waking up.
ANNOUNCER

Commander Peter Quincy Taggart  Jason Nesmith!
JASON
Great driving, Tommy.
BRANDON
Yeah! Yes!
Suddenly, Sarris comes out, with a huge gun. The crowd reacts to him.
JASON
Quick! Quick, quick. Go, go, go.
He grabs Tommys gun, rolls away from Sarris , takes aim and fires. Sarris is hit and immediately dissolves into nothingness. The crowd cheers.
ANNOUNCER
Come on, give it up for the crew, the N.S.E.A Protector!
Jason walks up and takes Gwens hand, then they hug, and kiss, and Jason leans over her for a deep kiss.
ANNOUNCER
Ah, true love. Yes!
 
One of the girls in the audience faints.
ANNOUNCER
Theyre here for you folks. Give it up! What a show!
Jason raises his hands and the crows cheers him. Then he spots Brandon and his crew, and salutes them.
ANNOUNCER
Come on give it up. Give it all up  for the crew of your favorite show, Galaxy Quest!
Jason beckons to his crew to come forward to take their bows, the first time he has ever done this, and they are momentarily confused. They step forward and bow in unison.
JASON
Come on! Come on!
ANNOUNCER
Dont forget to buy the Galaxy Quest T-shirts on yur way out. Thank you.
