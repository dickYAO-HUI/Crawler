This is the revised
            treatment for a film written by Ray Bradbury in September,1981. This draft, although
            commisioned by the studio, was never filmed. The treatment is 64 pages in length. This first appeared on Dreamerwww.com.  The site is currently down.  When that site comes back up, I will redirect this back to the site that did all the work.

            __________________________________
Stars and our World in
            Space.
Down out of the stars
            comes a burning object, not quite  clear as yet.
It races across the
            world, even as the shadow of night moves across the earth's surface.
Below, in various
            cities of the world, we see that it is Christmas.
The children of Japan
            look up as: The bright star moves over in the twilight.
CUT TO:
India. The children of
            India stare up as: The burning object flies above.
CUT TO:
Moscow. Where children
            and their parents, coming from  church, look up, startled.
CUT TO:
Jerusalem, where Jew,
            Christian, and Moslem children run out, point up, watch as: The meteor-like fire runs
            across the stars.
In Paris, the same
            story, as sunset arrives, bringing the star.

            2. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981The children of Paris,
            The children, suddenly, of London, look up. The star burns away across the Atlantic,
            following the sun, keeping up with the rim of night, as Christmas Eve shadows across the
            seas and lands:
CUT TO:
Cape Canaveral! Twilight
            here, also. The Star has not as yet arrived.
            Far off we can hear carols being sung...Christmas lights at a distance, faint laughter.

            The CAMERA prowls over the landscape. We see the largest building in the world,
            silhouetted against the setting sun... the Vehicle Assembly Building where the Apollo
            rockets were fitted together and sent out to the launch-pads to go to the Moon.

            The CAMERA peers briefly into the cathedral interior of the VAB where, perhaps, in a far
            alcove we see that someone has set up a small Christmas tree, lit. Somewhere a radio is
            playing, a mere whisper of some carol or other. The giant hangar is empty. It is obvious
            that almost everyone has gone home early for the holiday.

            The CAMERA prowls inside for a moment, and we may well see, standing tall, in the shadows,
            the titanic ghost shapes of Apollo rockets, motionless and waiting.

            3. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981The CAMERA moves out into sunset dune territory, scans
            the various gantries which are deserted. The wind blows dust over the lone machineries.
            The CAMERA finds and reads, quickly, a sign which says: ABANDON IN PLACE, No
            Further Activity Authorized. Perhaps we can hear an echo of the old sounds,
            voices counting down, the merest murmur of machineries, radios, computers.
THE VOICES




Oxygen check.....hydrogen
                    check.....ten minutes to launch.....etc., etc.....





The sounds rise and fall
            in the sound of surf from the nearby sea. The CAMERA moves up, up, up along an Apollo
            gantry.
A VOICE




...seven...six...five...four...
                    three...two...one...we have ignition!





There might be a mighty
            blast, but instead an explosion of -- wings'
Birds fly up from the
            dunes in a great bang of flying!
Click, click, click,
            click, a MAN with a camera rises up to photograph this ascension.

            The birds wheel and fly off.

            The MAN continues to photograph them in the sunset light. Then he stops, checks his
            camera, looks around, moves off. The CAMERA follows him along the dunes, past the  
            abandoned gantry where only the wind sounds now.  He blinks up at the vast metal
            machineries as he passes,  his face full of remembrance.

            4. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981A car goes along the road a hundred yards off, a
            Christmas tree tied to its top. Voices sing, raggedly: "Me wish you a Merry
            Christmas, we wish you a Merry Christmas...."
The MAN snaps a picture
            of the sign: ABANDON IN PLACE. He reads the sign, quietly, shakes his head. Surf pounds
            the shore!
He backs into view, near
            a road, closer to the Vehicle Assembly Building, snapping his camera, when:
Whoom! a car almost gets
            him.
The car stops. A MAN
            calls to him.
THE MAN




Hey, Atkins, what you
                    tryin'
                    to do, get killed for Christmas?





ATKINS peers in, shakes
            hands. The MAN has a car full of laughing singing kids.
ATKINS
            Carl! Hey--great!
THE MAN




I thought you were with
                    NASA in Washington?




ATKINS
            (nods)




They sent me down to
                    photograph:
                    Christmas at Canaveral!




THE MAN




What Canaveral? Where?
                    
                    (snorts, laughs
Ah, well -- there's plenty
                    of
                    Christmas! Right, kids!?
                    Make it Merry!

            5. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981The car drives off, the children laughing, singing.
            Leaving ATKINS to murmur to himself, waving at them:
ATKINS
            Merry....
Then, something jerks his
            gaze. He glances at the sky. A star is there, very bright, on the horizon.
ATKINS
            Venus? No. Wrong place -- it ---
The star moves. It rushes
            down, becomes a saucer shape.
            And as ATKINS watches:
The saucer hurtles toward
            the Vehicle Assembly Building.
ATKINS gasps, because:
The VAB doors are
            thundering wide, as if signaled to receive this visitor!
The craft flies down! And
            --
Flies right through the
            vast gates of the Vehicle Assembly Building to vanish inside!!!
Stunned, ATKINS watches
            as:
In the cathedral
            interior, the spacecraft hovers, sinks, sets down.
Even as the great gates
            thunder to shut in the craft!
ATKINS leaps through as:
            the gates slam.
The craft glows in the
            dark.
ATKINS circles, staring
            at it. He whispers to himself:
ATKINS
            Wait! I know this!

            6. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981He moves around the vast craft, memory shadowing his
            face.
ATKINS
            Thirty years ago. Yes!
A sound startles him. A
            nearby elevator hums and drifts up in the strutworks, a shadow inside it.
He runs, stops, stares
            up: as the elevator slides into the shadowly heights.
ATKINS stares from the
            elevator to the spacecraft, then jumps, runs, punches a second elevator button. The second
            elevator slams its door wide, he leaps in, goes up.
On the way into the dark
            mountainslopes of machinery, he stares up at -- That other elevator, carrying its alien
            cargo up and on up into yet darker cathedral heights.
It reaches the top of the
            Vehicle Assembly Building a good ten seconds ahead of him. Distantly, we see and hear its
            door clang wide, and a shadow move.
Reaching the top, ATKINS
            runs by the other elevator, checking it. He glances up and around at further staircases.
He emerges on the roof of
            the VAB as the last light of day fades.
He looks around at
            emptiness. The wind mourns up here, as lonely as the wind out in the dunes among the
            abandoned rocket pads.
A sound jerks him about.
It is the other elevator
            -- going back down into the shadows






"THE DAY THE
            EARTH STOOD STILL II"/ Bradbury
                                                
            7. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981400 feet below. Both elevators, in fact! He has been
            tricked. Obviously, someone has pushed the button on the second one and leaped out to let
            it go down by itself. Cursing, ATKINS races to a third bank of elevators, and has to wait,
            while, far below, the other two elevators reach their destination.
Sliding down out of the
            darkness, he emerges and looks around at silence and shadows. Whoever led him up to trap
            him on the roof, was gaining time. They have had a full minute or more to vanish. They are
            indeed gone.
A VOICE
            Hey!
A building ATTENDANT
            stares down from a catwalk above. The spacecraft glows and hums, with the small Christmas
            tree nearby.
The ATTENDANT, stunned,
            says:
THE
            ATTENDANT
            Who put that gift under my tree?
CUT TO
            DARKNESS.
A slam of brakes. A car
            arrives outside.
ATKINS is waiting for
            this arrival outside in the blowing night.
The arrival is the VAB
            DIRECTOR, who glares at ATKINS.
DIRECTOR
            You've been drinking, of course?!

            8. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981He looks into ATKINS' face, sniffs, shakes his head.
DIRECTOR




No. Damn. Now, who shut
                    those doors?




He is glaring at the vast
            doors now.
ATKINS
            I wish I knew.
The DIRECTOR.opens the
            small door in the great gate, steps through. And stops, shocked as:
We see what he sees: the
            spacecraft, a light unto itself, filling the great church-like interior.
DIRECTOR
            (to ATKINS)
            You just got your job back.
ATKINS
            I didn't know I was fired.
More officials arrive to
            confer. For now, only a few people know of the alien spaceship's landing...ATKINS, plus
            the ATTENDANT, plus the handful of Canaveral people gathered here.
The question is asked:
            why did the craft land here, this place, at this hour?
CHRIS ATKINS almost
            responds. A shadow crosses his face. He has half-remembered something about the visiting
            ship. But he remains silent.
The great VAB doors are
            locked, the various officials warned. For now, no one beyond the Base must know of this
            strangely timed arrival.

            9. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981Someone aboard the craft came out, vanished -- where?
            ATKINS at last speaks up:
ATKINS




Maybe we won't search.
                    Maybe we wait for it to find us?




DIRECTOR
            And why should it do that?
ATKINS
            It knows one of us.
DIRECTOR
            Who?
ATKINS




Me. I think. My family.
                    Years ago. Maybe they didn't know I was here. Missed me. Come looking for me now. I've got
                    to follow.




DIRECTOR.




Sorry. I've heard stuff
                    like that from photographers for years. You'll do anything for a story.




ATKINS
            You must let me go!
He looks about,
            frustrated, then moves toward the ship.
DIRECTOR
            Now, hold on --
ATKINS, confronting the
            ship, whispers.
DIRECTOR
            --what?
ATKINS whispers again. We
            cannot hear what he says. We hear only a murmur, but --
The ship hums, whines,
            pulses, glows!
The officials, startled,
            turn.

            10. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981As the elevators, a11 of them, hum, racing up their
            separate shafts, empty!
The spacecraft pulses
            louder.
And the great doors of
            the Vehicle Assembly Building thunder wide.
The officials stare from
            the doors, to the spacecraft, to ATKINS.
ATKINS
            It wants me to go.
The DIRECTOR, stunned,
            can only agree.
DIRECTOR
            It most certainly does.
ATKINS hurries outside.
ATKINS
            You'll hear in one hour!
The doors slam shut on
            the shocked Canaveral staff.
As the doors BANG, a Jeep
            drives up, ATKINS' friend and co-photographer assistant, BARNEY, at the wheel.
BARNEY
            Hey, did I miss something?
ATKINS




Not much. Tell you on the
                    way.



(gets in
              Jeep)





Barney? If you were a
                    visitor from a strange world --




BARNEY
            I am! Los Angeles!
ATKINS




--just arrived here. What
                    would you do first?

ATKINS




Barney! I love you. Of
                    course, the nearest! Our hotel!




The Jeep roars away.
CUT TO:
At the hotel, busy,
            People coming, going, Christmas.
CUT TO:
The REGISTRAR,
REGISTRAR
            Yes, Mr. Atkins?
ATKINS




You know me, I'm here
                    four times a year from Washington. Could I see your registrations?




A long pause. The
            REGISTRAR scowls, ATKINS prompts him;
ATKINS
            Official business...?
The REGISTRAR hands it
            over. BARNEY arrives.
BARNEY
            Hey, have the marines landed?
ATKINS




No, but...Williams,
                    Harkins, Field, Webster, Shane, Robinson, Weiner, Nagidson... no...wait...




BARNEY
            What?
ATKINS
            There.

BARNEY
            How do you pronounce that?
ATKINS
            (softly)
            Klaatu barada nikto.
BARNEY can only blink at
            him, waiting.
ATKINS
            (almost to himself,
            murmuring)




Oh, my God....yes...a
                    long time ago.




BARNEY
            Man? Woman?
ATKINS
            I don't know.

Upstairs, he taps at 212.
            No answer. Under the door he sees a strange light, hears stranger electronic sounds. He
            goes back to BARNEY, who has gathered their equipment for the return to the Cape.
A party is in full flood,
            trimming a Christmas tree to one side of the lobby.
Friends call to ATKINS as
            he scans all the faces coming and going, looking for the Stranger from another world; man,
            woman, what?

ATKINS
            No, thanks --
ATKINS turns, ready to
            leave, when he looks down at:
The most incredibly
            beautiful crystal Christmas bauble ever seen. It glows and shines with an inner light, an
            inner sound, an inner music.
The light shines over his
            eyes, his cheeks, his face, warning and enchanting him to wonder. He looks from it:
To the delicate hand
            holding it, and the CAMERA moves down the long delicate arm to the person, the woman, who
            has handed him this incredible gift.
Faint music breathes from
            the crystal orb he holds in his hand.
stares up at him across

ATKINS




We're in touch now. It has
                    to be near the ship!





Outside the Vehicle
            Assembly Building, the first reporters have arrived. Word has leaked out. The newsmen are
            incensed at not being filled in; for that matter, being locked out. ATKINS is permitted
            in, but BARNEY is kept out with the other reporters.
Inside, ATKINS stares at
            the enigmatic ship.

            the words.
ATKINS
            Klaatu... barada...nikto!
The ship hums, vibrates.
            A seam appears where the door might manifest itself in the skin of the ship.
The men gasp. ATKINS
            waits.
But there is no further
            manifestation. The ship will not breech itself just yet.

            16. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981ATKINS' face lights with a thought which has just struck
            him.
ATKINS




Of course. Fool. It's not
                    Christmas Morning!




AN
            OFFICIAL
            What?
ATKINS nods at the ship.
ATKINS
            We open our Gift, then.
He turns to exit.
ATKINS




I'll check it out now.
                    Let you know.




He exits. The night is
            blowing with a wind that dies as he moves across from the VAB toward the dunes, where he
            thinks he has seen something.
Out on the dunes, waiting
            for him, looking at the gantries, and the huge building where her spacecraft lies quietly
            waiting, is the YOUNG WOMAN from the hotel, the YOUNG WOMAN who handed him the incredibly
            bright crystal that he placed upon the tree.
He stands looking at her
            in profile. She is dressed in slacks and a trim jacket with a scarf. Her hair blows
in the wind. It is a good
            clean profile that he sees, with a touch of luminous inner knowledge in the cheeks, in the
            brow, in the eyes.

            17. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981She is not startled when he arrives, nor, for a long
            while does she look at him. Then, very quietly, listening to far radio voices and musics
            that drift by in the night, Christmas carols coming and going, she says:
YOUNG
            WOMAN




In a few minutes, it's
                    your Christmas.




He catches the way she
            has phrased it. And instead of saying hello, introducing himself, he continues as if they
            were picking up a conversation dropped only a moment ago:
ATKINS
            Not yours?
The YOUNG WOMAN looks
            around at the sea and the land.
YOUNG
            WOMAN
            Not mine.
This quickens him. She is
            admitting throngs, half sensed, She is looking around at the dunes now, and the ruins of
            the old space pads.
ATKINS
            Do you like our world?
The YOUNG WOMAN looks,
            thinks, responds.
YOUNG
            WOMAN
            Some of it.
Her eyes are fixed to the
            rusting machines now. He looks with her.
ATKINS
            All of this was -- great -- once.

            18. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981She nods and muses on this truth.
YOUNG
            WOMAN




I know. What a shame.
                    What a waste.




ATKINS defends the land,
            the ruins.
ATKINS




It'll be great again some
                    day. We'll rebuild.




YOUNG
            WOMAN
Will you...?
She looks at him for the
            first time. It is an incredible face. The eyes take him down to the bone.
He almost backs off, she
            is examining him so clearly, so easily, so completely.
YOUNG
            WOMAN




Will I even be
                    here? For that matter -- will you?





Again the clear gaze.
Again, he almost pulls
            back. There is no threat in her voice, but he is vaguely uneasy.
ATKINS
            Unless something – happens.
YOUNG
            WOMAN




Ah! Things do happen,
                    don't they?




ATKINS




I'm not leaving, till I
                    change all this.




They look at Canaveral,
            the night, the sea.
YOUNG
            WOMAN
            Then, you're in charge here?

            19. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981He gazes into her face.
ATKINS
            You know I'm not.
YOUNG
            WOMAN
            (after a beat)
            That could change.
He senses that she might
            very well be the one to change it.
ATKINS




I lie in bed nights,
                    wishing I ran the world!




YOUNG
            WOMAN




What would you do if
                    someone gave it to you?




ATKINS
            I'd clean it all up!
YOUNG
            WOMAN
            Or destroy it...
ATKINS
            Yes. If I wasn't careful.
Far away there are sounds
            of celebration. A clock strikes midnight.
She turns to look and
            listen.
The wind blows over the
            dunes.
YOUNG
            WOMAN
            There. It's midnight.
ATKINS
            Time for a Second Annunciation?
She knows what he is
            speaking about. The knowledge of the Biblical Annunciation is in her glowing face as she
            turns back to him.
YOUNG
            WOMAN




What would you like to
                    have announced?

            20. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981ATKINS looks from her to the world far across the land,
            past the silent gantries.
ATKINS




That this Christmas morn,
                    we get the grandest gift that man ever got. That something incredible and wonderful is
                    about to happen, that will change us forever and be only for the good!




She is taken and pleased
            with her possible friend and pupil.
YOUNG
            WOMAN




Miracles do happen, you
                    know.
                    Repentance is possible.
                    The response can be mercy.
                    The result can be salvation.




ATKINS
            For me? For all of us?
YOUNG
            WOMAN




You first. You wi11 be
                    visited by three Ghosts.




ATKINS




My God. You know Dickens!
                    "The Christmas Carol."




She nods.
ATKINS
            Am I Scrooge, then?
YOUNG
            WOMAN




No, but perhaps there are
                    millions like him, nearby.




ATKINS
            (looks around)
            When do I meet the First Ghost?
She looks off at the VAB,
            and the ship hidden within, as if asking it the answer.

            (a beat, then)




I will tell you, during
                    the
                    night.




The wind rises, bringing
            with it far voices, bells, exclamations, laughter, the tolling of clocks,
Both turn to look around
            at the Cape, the sky, the far town, the Christmas lights,
ATKINS
            It's --
YOUNG
            WOMAN
            Yes. It's midnight. Time for --
She touches her wrist
            which is encircled with a silver band with miniaturized computer tabs engraved on it, And
            the lights on the far gantries spring on. They are like immense Christmas trees in the
            night.
ATKINS stares, stunned
            and incredulous.
The gantries blaze. The
            music of the world rises fitfully on the wind.
She steps and takes his
            face in her hands and kisses him very quietly on the brow. He is immensely moved by all of
            this.
ATKINS
            Merry Christmas...
YOUNG
            WOMAN
            (nods)
            I wish you well.
She touches his eyelids
            with two fingers.
YOUNG

            Stay there.

            moving away.
ATKINS
            Wait!
From the darkness we see
            her shape pause, we hear her voice.
YOUNG
            WOMAN
            Yes?
ATKINS
            Your name!?
She responds, further
            off, turning to send her voice back in the night wind.
YOUNG
            WOMAN
            Klaata.
He quickens, startled,
            feverish, eyes shut.
ATKINS
            Klaatu!?
YOUNG

            No!
We see her silhouette,
            further off.
YOUNG
            WOMAN
            Klaata. Klaatu's daughter.
She is gone. The dunes
            are empty. He opens his eyes.

            23. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981He looks down at:
Her footprints in the
            sand, which, in a sudden gust of wind, blow away, are erased, gone!
The Christmas-lit
            gantries, all along the Cape, go out, one by one!
He stands in the
            darkness, riven, as we
FADE TO
            BLACK.
Inside the VAB, the
            officials are sitting or standing in a half circle around the spacecraft.
ATKINS looms up behind
            them suddenly, stares at the ship for a long moment, then says, quietly:
ATKINS




Get some sleep. Christmas
                    
                    morning - I go in the ship.




He turns and moves off
            into the shadows. A door shuts.
At the hotel, there is
            quietness, shadows.
On the top of the tree
            which is still lit, is the incredible crystal bauble placed there hours before by ATKINS.
An ATTENDANT is shutting
            the tree lights off as ATKINS arrives.
The lights blink into
            darkness.
The ATTENDANT and ATKINS
            stand looking up at:
That amazing crystalline
            illumination brought as beauty from a far place.
ATTENDANT
            Hey... what's that connected to?

ATKINS




You may well ask,
                    son... you may well ask.




He reaches up, removes
            the bauble, to which the ATTENDANT objects.
ATKINS




It goes back on the
                    tree... 
                    at dawn.




ATKINS goes up to bed.
In the middle of the
            night, the bauble, which he has placed on the second pillow on the empty side of the bed,
            pulses with dim light, half-musical sounds.
ATKINS opens his eyes,
            and looks at:
The crystal, which burns
            and lowers its serene light.
ATKINS speaks to the
            light.
ATKINS
            Are you here?

            back:

            When do I see you again?
The crystal responds,
KLAATA'S
            VOICE




...after you have seen
                    the 
First Ghost.




ATKINS remembers the old
            Dickens tale.
ATKINS

The crystal murmurs and
            illuminates itself with response:

He nods, knowing what to

            Perhaps. If you deserve me,

Perhaps there will be
                    none.

Morning. Just before

            approaching dawn.
ATKINS is out on the
            dunes, his camera busy.
He finds something, looks
            down.
At the remnants of
            KLAATA's footprints, going off on their own path in the sand, from the last night.
He takes a picture of
            them, then turns to scan:
The empty gantries.
As the sun rises.
He turns to walk toward
            the VAB.
Inside, all is silence.
            The people have taken ATKINS at his word. Several guards lie asleep on their strewn mats,
            around the ship. The NASA OFFICIAL drowses, half-asleep, over a game of solitaire laid out
            on a cardtable nearby.

            27. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981ATKINS stands by the ship. His lips move. We cannot hear
            what he says. But we know the words from the way his mouth forms them, in pantomime.
The seam of the ship's
            portal splits, opens, with a soft humming and a grand illumination.
The NASA OFFICIAL opens
            his eyes, quickly, blinks, starts.

ATKINS
            Shh!
His finger to his lips,
            warning silence, ATKINS walks up, into the ship, which seals itself shut!
Circling in through the
            geometrically illuminated corridors, ATKINS arrives at the heart of the ship, where:
A crystalline oblong
            shape, a seven foot long object, glows in the center of a room. Inside the receptacle, or
            bright 'coffin' if you wish to use the word, suspended in light and shadow, lies a body on
            display.
At ATKINS' approach, the
            long oblong crystal pulses with somewhat brighter color.
ATKINS, above it, looks
            down, and is incredulous.
ATKINS




My God...! You are the
                    Ghost of Christmas Past!




A voice from within the
            oblong responds, quietly.
THE VOICE




...yes... a summer,
                    anyway....

Alive and

The light flickers. We

                punish. And leave you to lick your wounds. We have watched you, and wondered at you. So
                much that is good. So much that is right. Yet, so much that falters and fails.


ATKINS
            You've come to test us, then?
KLAATU'S
            VOICE
            The Great Graduation Examination, yes!
ATKINS
            And if we succeed?
KLAATU'S
            VOICE
            You move up in the Universe.
ATKINS
            And...failing...
KLAATU'S
            VOICE


...stay where you are, or
                move down to darkness. But, all your own doing. You have already lit your fuse. No
                need for us to light it. We can put it out, of course, and take some of your Toys away.
                The ones that threaten us and the Universe. After all, a Nursery is no place for such
                things.


ATKINS
            Are we that young, then?
KLAATU'S
            VOICE


Just out of the cave, the
                crib, just fallen from the Tree, and forgiveable, but dangerous. Enough. Gather the people
                for the Great Exam, or the Great Trial, the Test, mean? Gather all your optimists, bring
                all your cynics. We must hear the pros and cons, The Human Race For and Against the Human
                Race.

            31. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981ATKINS
            They won't come!
KLAATU'S
            VOICE




They will. When we have
                    frightened them somewhat.




ATKINS
            Nothing can frighten them!
KLAATU'S
            VOICE
            You think not?
The crystal oblong glows.
KLAATU's face, asleep,
            almost seems to smile. He murmurs.
KLAATU'S
            VOICE
            We have ways....
A soft chime rings. The
            humming stops. The crystal oblong swarms with shadows and goes dark.
As does the face of
            KLAATU.
ATKINS would say more,
            but, seeing this, stops, turns, pulls back, goes...
Out through the circling
            light and shadow of the corridors.
Outside the OFFICIAL is
            waiting. ATKINS says:
ATKINS




Call a press conference
                    for five this afternoon.




OFFICIAL
            We don’t want any press!
ATKINS
            (looks at the ship)
They do.
OFFICIAL
            It's Christmas Day!

            EARTH STOOD STILL II"/ Bradbury
                                              
            32. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981ATKINS
            Can't think of a better day for it.
OFFICIAL
            We—
ATKINS




That ship can
                    destroy this building, any time it wants.





OFFICIAL




My God! The building
                    cost 200 million do11ars!




ATKINS
            That ship is worth...
            (makes up a number)
            …seventeen billion dollars.
That goes it. The
            OFFICIAL is overwhelmed with such facts.
OFFICIAL
            Five? Hard to organize it by --
He stops, because:
The spacecraft has
            groaned like Marley's ghost, trembling with power!
OFFICIAL
            (swallows)
            Five.
He grabs a phone.
CUT TO:
Outside, the
            wilderness around the gantries. ATKINS looks up.
At the far top of one
            of the Apollo structures, he sees a small figure. It must be the one oerson he wants to
            see now.
He climbs up
            toward....KLAATA....who is waiting for him.






"THE DAY THE
            EARTH STOOD STILL II"/ Bradbury
                                              
            33. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981On top of the gantry, KLAATA does indeed wait for him.
They stand looking at the
            spread of the world, and beyond to the Vehicle Assemb1y Building where, on one vast
            300-foot side, the NASA officials have caused to be strung, in outline, a Christmas tree
            made entirely of wire and lit bulbs; a tree same 200 feet high, softly glowing in the
            overcast day.
ATKINS
            Will they come, do you think?
KLAATA
            (lightly)




The reporters? To the
                    news conference? They had better.




ATKINS




Or you'll teach them
                    reverse sums in 'take-away'?




She nods, the wind
            blowing her hair.
ATKINS
            What will you take away, first?
KLAATA
            (thinking)
Everyone must be surprised.
He stares at her as any
            man would stare at any woman who is a special windvane to a special weather that blows
            across the Cape this Christmas Day.
ATKINS
            My good sense is gone already.
She gazes at him quietly,
            reading his temperature.
KLAATA
            For awhile, I'll hold onto mine.
            (she gestures to the
            spread of Canaveral)
            We're out to save the World, aren't we?






"THE DAY THE
            EARTH STOOD STILL II"/ Bradbury
                                              
            34. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981He looks at the World, at her, and back to the Wor1d,
            laughing quietly at some small thought.
ATKINS




On your world, do women
                    have headaches?




KLAATA
            (laughs)
            Never!
ATKINS
            (stunned)
            What a world that must be.
KLAATA
            And here?
ATKINS
            (goes serious)
Men have headaches, all the time,
KLAATA
            War does that...
She touches his elbow,
            pulls gently,
KLAATA
            Shall we go find a cure?
ATKINS
            You're the teacher.

She turns at the top of
            the stair in the blowing wind, and gazes at him, nodding quietly.
KLAATA
            Yes. I am.
They go down into the
            world of Christmas,
The reporters begin to
            gather for the News Conference. Not many, of course. It's short notice. It's Christmas,
            Reporters are coming up from Miami, of course, and a few who can fly in from some of the
            Southern States in a few hours. Local TV will link into national TV, naturally. We see the
            accumulation of people at the Cape.






"THE DAY THE
            EARTH STOOD STILL II"/ Bradbury
                                              
            35. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981They are gathering outside the great doors of the Vehic1e
            Assembly Building.
Announcements are being
            made over TV, cross-country, around the world.
Coming downstairs in his
            hotel, ATKINS glances over at the Christmas tree, which a moment before was filled with
            ornaments.
The tree is empty of
            baubles, of light.
Only the crystal fire
            hangs at the top, a promising Star. ATKINS turns to a BELLHOP nearby.
ATKINS




Hey, Chuck, is Christmas
                    over already?




He nods to the tree. The
            BELLHOP stares, is astounded.
BELLHOP




Hey, who took off a11 the
                    ornaments!?




ATKINS turns to find
            KLAATA there. He glances back at the tree, and at her again. He suspects her of this.
ATKINS
            Well?
KLAATA




What are a few baubles?
                    It’s the spirit that counts, right?




Disquieted, ATKINS
            leaves.
The Press Conference
            convenes. ATKINS finds himself as interlocutor for a highly unlikely visitation, and an
            amusing, to almost everyone, concept:






"THE DAY THE
            EARTH STOOD STILL II"/ Bradbury
                                              
            36. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981THE INHABITANTS OF THE WORLD, BROUGHT TOGETHER IN SOME
            SORT OF RAMSHACKLE TRIAL, WILL BE ASKED TO PUT THEMSELVES IN THE DOCKET.
The arguments to be
            presented in this great J'Accuse case, where a11 mankind is involved, are as follows:
DOES THE HUMAN RACE
            DESERVE TO GO ON EXISTING?
or, conversely:
DO WE DESERVE, BECAUSE WE
            ARE EVIL AND HALF-MAD APES, TO BE ELIMINATED?
or, somewhere between:
CAN THESE BEASTS, FAIRLY
            FRESH FROM THE TREE AND THE CAVE, EVOLVE TOWARD SOMETHING MUCH MORE WORTHWHILE?
and
ARE WE HALF THERE
            ALREADY, AND WITH A LITTLE PUSH CAN WE MAKE IT UP THE SCALE INTO THE UNIVERSE?
or
IS IT A LOST CAUSE, LET'S
            GIVE UP ON OURSELVES?
The sun is beginning to
            set over Canaveral as the last of the Conference is being held.
The reporters, in jovial
            mood, make mild jokes. After all, this is a ridiculous media event. Nothing has been shown
            so far, nothing proven. Why should it all be taken seriously? Why should the bright
            speakers of the world come or go anywhere to prove or disprove Mankind's right to go on
            existing? Where's the threat, the proof?






"THE DAY THE
            EARTH STOOD STILL II"/ Bradbury
                                              
            37. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981At the height of the reporters' derision:
The great doors of the
            Vehicle Assembly Building thunder wide.
The spacecraft of KLAATU
            pulses with energy, heat, power! And the vast Christmas Tree, which we have seen earlier,
            strung and lit on the 300-foot side of the building, darkens, goes out, vanishes. It is a
            tree, we must explain, shaped only of lights, a sketch of a tree delineated by wires and
            bulbs.
But now, it is gone!
Its illumination vanishes
            from the faces of the reporters. At the same moment, across the land, the lights on
            hundreds of trees blink out, blink out, blink out. They darken as startled people look up
            in a swift montage.
At the end of which, as
            the reporters look up at the blank wall of the VAB, the great doors rumble SHUT.
Ending the scene.
Across the land in the
            next few hours, small things begin to vanish. In a series of montage CUTS, we move from
            home to home across country, across the world, as tiny objects, close at hand, begin to
            disappear.
In one home, a woman,
            sewing, misses her thimble.
In another, needles
            vanish.
Some children's metal
            toys simply 'blink' out of existence! Consternation. Wails of frustration!

            38. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981Meanwhile, on the TV screens of the world, on every
            station, we see CUT after CUT, a MONTAGE of war, guns, explosions, invasions, tanks, Jets,
            people fleeing on roads, devastated cities. Then, a quick series of CUTS of people in
            various cities, in various parlors:
A MAN
            Wait a minute--where's that?
ANOTHER
            MAN
Which army--
A WOMAN
Another war--?
A THIRD
            MAN
            Wait. That's Korea!
FOURTH
            No, Vietnam!
FIFTH
            No, the Maginoe Line, 1940!
SIXTH
            E1 Salvador!
CUT TO:
The interior of the ship,
            in a vast circle above Klaatu's crystal 'bed,' we see the same TV scenes repeated, a dozen
            times, a hundred times, on 200 screens above his resting place.
ATKINS and KLAATA,
            standing in shadow, look up at the devastation, hear the shrieks and explosions.
ATKINS
            Which country, which war, which year--?
KLAATA
            Every country, every war, every year.

            39. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981More montages of explosions, troops, tanks, planes.
KLAATA
            Can you tell them apart?
ATKINS stares, shakes his
            head.
KLAATA
            Manchuria, 1929.
            Turkey, 1922.
            France, 1918...
            Russia, 1942...
            Japan, 1944...Brazil...
            Argentina...Morocco...
            South Africa...Pakistan.
She points to all the
            images, which whirl and confuse themselves.
KLAATA




Different names, but
                    always the same terror, the same despair. We will stop that.




The images rush and
            shriek to a vast concussion.
WHICH she cuts across by
            touching a lever.
Darkness. Silence. The
            wars are erased.
KLAATU's crystal tomb
            glows quietly.
In the silence, ATKINS
            turns to look at KLAATA, questioningly.
ATKINS




You waited thirty years.
                    Why did you come back, now?




KLAATA
            We said we would.
ATKINS




You also said you'd
                    destroy Earth if we didn't behave. What are you waiting for?

            scenes blossom on the vast screens above KLAATU's 'bed.'
KLAATA




You've behaved better
                    than you think. That's why we delayed. You're strange people. You've actually done some
                    things right!




ATKINS
            Such as...?
KLAATA




Must I, from another
                    world, tell you? Thirty years ago people still died from polio, malaria, scarlet fever.
                    You've stopped all that. Your country invented new kinds of wheat and corn. You ship food
                    to 90 countries. Immigrants pour in to your land, 500 thousand a year. Why are they coming
                    here if you're as bad as you say?




ATKINS
            I didn't say...
KLAATA




No? You don't like
                    yourself, your world, your people. How peculiar that I find much to defend. All this,
                    that, there, didn't exist, thirty years ago. You’ve reached the Moon. You've touched
                    Mars and Jupiter and Saturn!




ATKINS
            And stopped touching...
KLAATA
            But you can do it again!
ATKINS




If I had my way...yes.
                    But I’m only one person.




KLAATA
            Ah, and so am I. But watch me!

            41. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981There is no threat in her voice, only wi11 and energy;
            much fervor, a great fire.
He turns to look at her
            face, and up at the screens.
ATKINS
            You going to teach them?
            (nods out at the world)




The world doesn't like
                    teachers, do-gooders.




KLAATA laughs.
KLAATA
            But, I'm here to do bad!
He is stunned. She
            continues, amused, gesturing at the landscapes.
KLAATA




I come not with Christmas
                    gifts, but to take away!




KLAATA searches the
            horizons on the screen.
KLAATA


There, see? That oil
                tanker. What if I took it and all the oil in the world away to celebrate New Year's?


ATKINS
            You'd be dead by noon tomorrow!
KLAATA
            Yes!?
She speaks this, first to
            ATKINS, then down at the semi-illuminated place where KLAATU half-sleeps.
KLAATA
            Yes?

            42. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981The crystal oblong beats three heartbeats of light. His
            voice whispers:
KLAATU'S
            VOICE
            No….
Then she is off, through
            the shadowed ship corridors.
ATKINS can only follow.
The great seal of the
            spaceship shuts.
KLAATA is on her way out
            of the building. BAR KY is there, and grabs ATKINS' arm.
BARNEY
            My God, all hell's broken loose!
ATKINS
            Wha--?
BARNEY




The whole world thinks
                    this is a plot by the United States to blackmail them!




ATKINS
            But don't they see--?
BARNEY




Not a damn thing. She'd
                    better do something spectacular, or--




ATKINS
            Spectacular?! God!
ATKINS leaves. Outside,
            KLAATA is waiting for him by his car.
ATKINS




My friend says, you'd
                    better work a miracle.

            43. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981She has been watching the quick images in her
            wrist-computer, news clips from around the world. She switches it off.
KLAATA
            Yes. I see. We11?




Has anyone missed the
                    thimbles yet? Or the needles?




ATKINS
            What?
KLAATA




Turn out your pockets.
                    Your coins, your money.




He turns out his pockets,
            shows her what change he has.
KLAATA
            Put one here.
He places a penny on the
            wrist-computer surface, which immediately hums and pulses with sums and computations.
            KLAATA touches a tab.
The pennies in ATKINS'
            open palm vanish.
ATKINS
            Hey! How'd you do that?
She touches her
            wrist-computer. An image of round fire is projected high on the side of the Vehicle
            Assembly Building.
KLAATA
            What's that?
ATKINS
            The Sun.
KLAATA




And Earth was once in
                    the Sun, yes, all your elements, everything? Everything in this building, every bit of
                    ground we stand on? Hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen.

            change hue, according to the element named.
KLAATA




If we can analyze the
                    Sun's elements, we can analyze anything. The copper in your pennies, the silver in your
                    pocket--




ATKINS
            Sum it up and wipe it out?
KLAATA
            Me could. We might.
She flicks off the great
            Sun image. He gets in the car. It won't start. He looks at her, suspiciously.
KLAATA
            Only if I say go, does it go.

            (it gets to him)




There are 300 million
                    cars in the world!




KLAATA




And sometimes, don't you
                    think, how nice it would be, if they all stopped?




ATKINS
            Nice.
            (a beat)
            ...Terrible.
KLAATA
            Go.
KLAATA has said go, the
            car goes, as she touches her wrist-computer and the engine juices itself.
ATKINS
            Go...yes...Go.

            45. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981They drive back toward the hotel. On the way, he says:
ATKINS




Can you make all the
                    needles ~n the world disappear?




KLAATA
            If we wished.
ATKINS




And the nails that hold
                    paintings on the walls?




KLAATA




We could make a million
                    pictures fall.




ATKINS
            What about nail files and scissors?
KLAATA




The fingernails of the
                    world will be longer next year.




ATKINS
            Why are you starting small?
KLAATA




Isn't it more interesting
                    to drop hints? Let the world know, bit by bit, doorknob by doorhinge by clothespin that it
                    is the time of Indian Giving, the time of taking back, the time of Uninventing all the
                    inventions, large and small, in the history of Man?




ATKINS
            God!
KLAATA
            Oh, God, indeed.
KLAATA then explains in
            some detail what their plan, her plan, KLAATU's plan, is. To let the panic grow in little
            starts and stops, little vanishings, little disappearances, at first unnoticed. Who cares,
            for instance, if all the

            the collar-stays? Or all the pennies which now burden us and are almost worthless?
Somewhere down the line
            – OIL!
But they are at the
            hotel.
Outside KLAATA's room, he
            prepares to leave, when she holds the door open and waits, She is obviously inviting him
            in.
ATKINS
            Klaata---?
KLAATA




We have worked more than
                    enough miracles for one day. Now, let's work our own.




ATKINS
            Still --
KLAATA




Time is running out. We
                    may never have a quiet moment again. And--




ATKINS
            And?
She laughs, gently.
KLAATA




My world waits for me to
                    bring your child back with me.




ATKINS
            (blinks)
            From just this one night?
KLAATA
            It is written.

            47. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981KLAATA goes in, pulling off her Jumper-top as she goes.
            The door is wide open. ATKINS glances around, embarrassed, hurries in, shuts the door.
In the midst of their
            love-making, she says:
KLAATA




Have you ever wondered
                    what a woman feels and thinks as she lies like this?




He nods.
KLAATA




Have you ever, for a
                    moment, wanted to be in her eyes, looking back at you?




He thinks, at last nods.
KLAATA
            Well.
She Couches his eyes,
            closes hers.
KLAATA
            So...
He is stunned,
            astonished, transfigured. They are separate but one. In their kissing, souls go back and
            forth, or so it seems. He breaks away at last.
ATKINS
            Can everyone on your world do that?
She nods.
ATKINS
            Does anyone ever get out of bed!?
KLAATA
            On1y to come nag at you Earthmen.

            48. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981Much later, lying side by side, she looks at the ceiling
            and says:
KLAATA
            It is written.
He looks at her, gently,
            questioning.
KLAATA




When I am home, if I
                    wish, I will have seven sons and seven daughters.




ATKINS
            All mine?
She nods.
ATKINS
            All in one year!?
She shakes her head.
KLAATA




In seven different years.
                    We women up there, are not quite the same as yours. We have an even greater talent for
                    survival.




ATKINS




Are you sure that my sons
                    and daughters are with you now?




KLAATA




Perhaps...you had better
                    make certain.




Whereupon he moves toward
            her again and they kiss and
FADE TO
            BLACK.
The next few days, a
            series of further 'take-aways' occur, ending with most of the cars of the world grinding
            to a halt. The world shakes its fists at the sky, but, the world gives in:

            49. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981It agrees to be put on trial. The defendants gather at
            Canaveral. The list of things that each country has done is impressive. The protestants
            sound much like KLAATA as she defended Earth against itself, to ATKINS. Harvests are up.
            Floods have been controlled. Disease has been conquered in most of the world. The computer
            is beginning to lift the burden of boring work from millions of people. The black middle
            class HAS grown, etc., etc.
In the middle of which,
            the intellectual leaders, on trial before the Universe, begin to bicker, put each other on
            trial. For the first time, KLAATU, having been silent for days, summons the leaders to a
            final confrontation. Two dozen men and women from various countries circle his crystal
            enclosure which glows with light.
Shadows come and go over
            KLAATU’s recumbent face as he accuses them, point by point:
KLAATU’s
            VOICE




Look at you! What
                    shall we take away next? What good will it do? Will you learn your lessons?




The CAMERA circles the
            faces of the embarrassed and somewhat ashamed leaders.
KLAATU continues:
KLAATU'S
            VOICE




If we destroyed your
                    airships you would fight on land. Rob you of your cannons, you'd use rifles. Seize your
                    rifles, you'd fire pistols. Steal your pistols and you'd make bows and arrows.

            50. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981KLAATU'S VOICE
            (continued)




Take your bows and arrows
                    and you'd make spears, axes, knives. Take it all away and you'd use fists. Cut off your
                    fists and you'd kick with your feet. Cut off your feet and you'd bite with your dumb
                    teeth. When, when, when will it end?




The leaders stare,
            stunned and silent, no response ready. KLAATU goes on:
KLAATU'S
            VOICE




You think that I,
                    Gort, my ship, are miraculous...
But you are
                    miraculous...if you wish! Have you no eyes? Don't you see the grand Universe? Have
                    you no hands, to touch and build all the great architectures that will save you Forever?
What's wrong with you?
Why - why are you so -
                    mean?




Silence. Half of the
            gathered leaders have their eyes shut, sealing out the sight and the sound of the man and
            the voice half-in, half-out of a technological tomb.
KLAATU'S
            VOICE




Must a half-dead man
                    teach you some final lessons?




His crystal oblong pulses
            with a single heartbeat.
KLAATU'S
            VOICE
            ...Klaata!...!
KLAATA moves forward from
            the shadows.
KLAATU'S
            VOICE




A gift is never
                    appreciated. We cannot give you your future. You must build and give it to
                    yourselves. But let us, at least, show it to you.




(quietly
            now)
            Klaata.

            51. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981KLAATA touches the controls. The
            spacecraft thrusts up
to hang above Earth,
            halfway to the Moon....
Where, suspended over
            Earth, KLAATA touches yet other computer tabs.
And the bottom side of
            the great Disc unshutters its eye, which is to say reveals itself as a great viewing
            crystal around which the military and power elite circle and gasp. For the whole continent
            of America, leaning into the shadow of night, can be seen below.
KLAATA touches a
            series of buttons and:
Out beyond, in Space,
            great platforms construct themselves. The power elite, stunned, watch as the--
Platforms fit Jigsaw
            within jigsaw, as pieces are brought up through the night heavens by Shuttle and by other
            rocket vehicles and Astronauts scramble out to unfold the puzzle and slot it back together
            into a mile-long flat mirror surface which blinks and burns with sunlight:
While below, on Earth, in
            great screens placed within the Ship's interior, we can see vast receiving Cups being
            welded into place, here, there, and about the continent. While still more platforms are
            built in Space, two thousand or three thousand miles apart, circling the Earth.
There is a great hum
            and stir of excitement amongst the captive audience as--

            52. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981KLAATA touches the final buttons
            to finish the work and ATKINS says:
ATKINS
            That's not real..,?
KLAATA
            (smiles)


No.....Holograms,
                three-dimensional projections of things that could be. Images of possible dreams.
There.


She touches a last lever.
The great Solar Platforms
            (for that is what they are) turn magnificently on their silent hinges.
And catch the Sun!
For they are high enough
            above the Earth to get the slanted rays of the Sun beyond the night planet!
KLAATA
            And here....and now...here.
She touches the controls.
The light beams flash
            down to Earth....
Are caught in the
            receiving Cups!
KLAATA looks upon her
            work and then says:
KLAATA




Now...let us light the
                    cities of the world.




She moves her hand over a
            territorial spread of continental land under her fingers, in miniature. The audience
            gasps.

            53. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981For below in the night world, from
            New York, then on to Boston and Philadelphia, and across country, city by city, town by
            town, lights up!
In a great flare and
            spread and flash of light, the entire American continent fires its town and city lights!
It is a magnificent
            moment, at which all can only stare, frozen in delight!
KLAATA moves her hand on.
The Ship tilts and moves
            in Space.
The Platforms flash and
            turn to drink more Sun!
And the cities of Europe
            light themselves, one by one.
It is like a scene,
            reversed, in which all the candles in a great hall or cathedral have been blown out but
            now, in a miraculous instant, relight themselves!
KLAATA lights all the
            night world of Earth.
ATKINS speaks at last,
            staring down.
ATKINS
            Can we do that?
KLAATA looks from him to
            the illuminated planet.
KLAATA




Yes! And when it's done,
                    no more navies protecting oil-lines, no more shortages, no more blackmail, no more need.
                    Only light, forever, all night every night for ten thousand years!




She touches a button and:
The Space Platforms blink
            out, fly apart, fragmented dreams.

            54. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981The lights of the world go out.
The faces staring down,
            turn dark.
KLAATA gestures.
The Ship lands back at
            Canaveral. There, with the solar display over, and the lights of the world gone dark...
            the leaders of the various nations fall into their old patterns of animosity, hatred,
            petty irritability:
Who will build the first
            platform?
Who will benefit most?
Can the solar platforms
            be used for war?
No reason why not!
Good reason, therefore,
            to build and--
The crystal tomb of
            KLAATU pulses and goes dark.
KLAATA turns on the
            leaders, stares at them, then gives instructions to the Ship's computers.
There is a great stir in
            the heavens of Earth.
More spacecraft arrive
            from out of the Universe!
Is the moment of utter
            destruction at hand?
With KLAATU perhaps
            finally dead in his dark crystal,
KLAATA makes the final
            motions:
And a thousand spacecraft
            thunder down!
ATKINS, seeing this,
            comments ironically:
ATKINS




Is this...the Ghost of
                    Christmas Future?




KLAATA
            (quietly, firmly)
            .…yes....

And in each city the

But, especially the
            children, those from six to eleven years old, are staring at the sky with its wonderful
            beauties and its great musics.
The ships suspend

The people wait. The
            children wait.

            all the children.

            56. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981At which moment, do we, or do we
            not, hear a voice from KLAATU's crystal tomb whisper:
KLAATU'S
            VOICE
Now!
KLAATA touches a
            light-source disc. She speaks. Outside, in the area near the VAB Building, the leaders of
            Earth hear her voice.
KLAATA




I hear you speak, but
                    what you are really saying is you do not believe in the future. You do not believe in the
                    future! Well, then. We will take it away from you....




She touches a control.
The spacecraft move down
            over the cities of the world.
And as they move in
            thunders, a music comes from them.
And the children of the
            world look up, here, there, everywhere, beyond!
The older people stand,
            transfixed.
The ships hover and
            glide, and are now only a few feet above the ground.
And the portals open, to
            an even grander music.
And the children begin to
            move.
As ATKINS watches on the
            screens inside the Ship, with KLAATA beside him.
And he sees children of
            friends, children we have seen earlier on, moving toward the strange craft.

            57. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981As the older people cry out but
            cannot move.
And the children of
            Chicago and New York and Moscow and Peking and Tokyo begin to go on board the ships. By
            the tens of thousands they move, happily, called by the music. The Pied Pipers of All Time
            are summoning them. They can only, gladly, go.
ATKINS watches,
            astonished and moved, as:
Children from every walk
            of life move toward the spacecraft. More of which land to summon:
Rich and poor alike. High
            and low. Children of the powerless as well as children of the powerful, the controllers of
            the world. Children of every color, shape, and size. But they all move gladly, not looking
            back. ATKINS cries out, at last:
ATKINS
            My God, you're inhuman!
KLAATA responds quietly,
            with sympathy, standing near him, directing the multi-illuminated computer under her
            fingers, watching the exodus of the young on the screens circling their heads:
KLAATA




No. We care. They are
                    your future. . . which we will deliver back into your hands if you deserve them. Do you
                    know your history? Thousands of years ago, your nomad tribal chieftans traded their sons
                    and daughters to insure against attack and war. We do them one better.

            stares:
As more ships fill, more
            children arrive.
KLAATA
            (stunned)




700 thousand, a million.
                    Rich, poor, weak, powerful, every color, every custom, every religion, everywhere.




She reads his face which
            is not as yet accepting.
KLAATA




What if we left them here
                    - for you to do what with? Burn and destroy with your ignorance, your hate, your blind
                    wars?




ATKINS
            (bursts out)




What are you - some sort
                    of - dumb optimist!?




She glances at the
            screens.
Outside, in various
            cities, we see the last of the children going aboard.
CUT BACK

KLAATA nodding, speaking:
KLAATA




Do I think you
                    will work and build and succeed in trying to earn back the future, deserve to have your
                    children among you once more?
(a beat)
Yes. You will.




ATKINS watches the
            screen. It is sinking in now. Slowly he says:
ATKINS
            We must.

The spacecraft are
            beginning to seal themselves up. KLAATA watches this, looks at ATKINS, says:

            Love me.
ATKINS




What else can I do?
                    You've stolen my child, too.




KLAATA
            (touches her front, quietly)
            No. It was given freely.
ATKINS
            (nods, shuts his eyes a moment)
            It was.
He opens his eyes, looks
            at the screens, at her.
ATKINS
            Can I go?
KLAATA




You're needed here. In
                    case they sometimes for a moment forget. Then you yell, for all the children. For your sons.




ATKINS
Sons?!!
KLAATA
            It is written.
She kisses him tenderly.
            They hold to each other. In a last moment, she looks up:

            EARTH STOOD STILL II"/ Bradbury
                                              
            60. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981Sees all the faces of all the
            parents in the world, standing, waiting, watching, unable to move. Then back to KLAATA as
            she says, quietly:
KLAATA




Oh, Pinocchio,
                    Pinocchio...if you act well, and learn to love each other, one day you will become real
humans.




He holds her at arm's
            length, nods, turns, walks. Then runs.
All the ships are sealing
            up!
ATKINS steps swiftly from
            KLAATA's ship.
KLAATA looks at:
The crystal oblong where
            KLAATU sleeps. It pulses with one great. impulse of light, sound, music.
She thrusts a lever.
And all the spacecraft
            move...up!
The spacecraft in Moscow
            hovers, then shoots straight up, up over and away from the Kremlin. We see the bright
            pear-shapes of the churches in Red Square diminish.
The spacecraft in Rome
            hovers and rises above St. Peter's. We see Bernini's columns fall away below!
The spacecraft over
            London, moves up along the walls of the Houses of Parliament, shoots by the face of Big
            Ben, and vanishes in the sky.
The spacecraft in India,
            bangs straight up away from the Taj Mahal.

            61. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981In China, away from the Great
            Buddha.
In South America, Rio,
            past and up from the Christ of the Andes!
In Paris, from the
            base of the Eiffel Tower to the top!
In New York, along up,
            up, from the foot of the Statue of Liberty past the head, the torch, and gone!
The people of Earth,
            intercut, shot after quick shot,
watch as:
The scores of
            spacecraft, in thunder, vanish into the clouds, into the stars. And as they fade, we hear
            KLAATU's voice (or his daughter's):
VOICE




Follow us. Follow!
If you succeed, you
                    will find your children, you will find and keep your Future.
What is your answer, 0
                    people of Earth? You who disbelieve in futures, and so have had it taken from you?
Speak!
No....act! 
                    Do!  Build.  Rise up! Live!
Well?




The last ships are
            gone.
Out among the
            gantries, ATKINS finds the stunned officials staring at the sky.
ATKINS
            Well?

            62. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981They are all looking at the stars
            in the almost midnight sky. Someone says:
A MAN




Do we follow, blast 'em,
                    grab our kids back?




A GOVERNOR, or an
            OFFICIAL, or the PRESIDENT, looks at the MAN as if he were mad.
GOVERNOR
            No!
            (a beat)




We'll go earn our way.
                    Deserve our future.




The GOVERNOR (or
            PRESIDENT) looks over at the VAB.
GOVERNOR




There's only one flag on
                    that building.




ATKINS
            Should be a thousand.
GOVERNOR




By this time next month,
                    there will be. A real United Nations, at last. And more... did it ever strike you... it's
                    like a big cathedral inside?




The doors are open. They
            look in at the emptiness where the spacecraft was and now all is vast and sepulchral.
GOVERNOR
            I wonder...
ATKINS




If we asked all the
                    rabbis in the world, all the Moslem prayer-leaders, all the Baptists, all the Buddhist
                    priests, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir ... and the Pope! to come here some Friday
                    night, some Saturday noon, some Sunday morning... to celebrate and remember our
                    children... would they come?

            63. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981The depths of the Vehicle Assembly
            Building stir with future shadows, songs, chairs, whispers, prayers, voices. ATKINS,
            seeing, half-hearing this, asks:
ATKINS




When do we start packing
                    to leave and go - straight up?




PRESIDENT
            (with quiet determination)
            Now.
ATKINS
            (somewhat doubtful)
            Not tomorrow?
PRESIDENT
Now!
He looks around at the
            gantries.
ATKINS' wrist-watch
            sounds off the hour.
ATKINS
            Midnight, sir.
PRESIDENT
            (blinks)
            Midnight?
ATKINS
            (quietly)
            Happy New Year.
One of the gantries, far
            away, takes fire with a ghost blaze, a spirit illumination, as a phantom rocket, in muted
            thunders, takes off.
The men stare around.
The PRESIDENT, ATKINS, in
            their minds' eye, see and hear: Ghost rockets thundering up the gantries, away.






"THE DAY THE
            EARTH STOOD STILL II"/ Bradbury
                                              
            64. Revised Treatment - 11 September 1981INTERCUT, the faces of all, the
            PRESIDENT, ATKINS. As gantry after gantry lights and ghost rockets rise! The PRESIDENT,
            imagining this, says quietly:
PRESIDENT
            Happy New Year.
ATKINS looks up as:
A final gantry blazes. A
            final rocket thunders.
We go with it, looking
            back at the faces of those men.
We start CLOSE UP, in
            their eyes, their faces, then go straight up for a swift ten thousand yards in seven
            seconds! And Earth falls away below, a small orb lost in the stars.
MUSIC
And:
THE END.
