Offered here is the actual cutting continuity script for Song of the South. Since each page was originally typed with a typewriter on legal size paper, I have manually re-input them into digital format to survive the test of time. In the interest of historical preservation, everything from language down to syntax errors and  exact monospacing have been reproduced.
