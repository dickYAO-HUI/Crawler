                              ERIK 
                    Who's there?

                              DEXTER
                    Are you asking me?

                              ERIK 
                    Are you spying on me?

                              DEXTER
                    No.  I m working on my mud 
                    fort.  What are you doing?

                              ERIK 
                    Planting vegetables.  Hey, 
                    thanks for moving in here.  Now 
                    the kids at school call me 
                    "faggot" and walk on the other 
                    side of the hall.

                              DEXTER
                    I have to live somewhere.

                              ERIK 
                    Yeah, well why don't you go 
                    inside until I get done working 
                    on my garden.

                              DEXTER
                    Why?

                              ERIK 
                    So I don't have to worry about 
                    catching something and dying!

                              DEXTER
                    It can't be transmitted 
                    through the air.

                              ERIK 
                    Yeah, well, just to be on the 
                    safe side, I think you should 
                    go inside.

                              DEXTER
                    But I m working on my mud 
                    fort.  

                         (Erik walks towards 
                         the fence).

                              ERIK 
                    Hey!  What would you do if I 
                    come over there and whooped 
                    your ass?

                              DEXTER
                    How long would that take?

                              ERIK 
                    About ten seconds.

                              DEXTER
                    I would wait until you were 
                    finished and then I'd continue 
                    working on my mud fort.

                              ERIK 
                    You mean you'd just let me 
                    beat you up?

                              DEXTER
                    I'd try to stop you, but I 
                    probably wouldn't be able to.  
                    I m not very big.

                              ERIK 
                    Well in that case it would 
                    only take five seconds.

                              DEXTER
                    So is that what you're gonna 
                    do?

                              ERIK 
                    Maybe later.  

                         (Erik walks away 
                         from the fence).

                              DEXTER
                    Hello.  Are you still there?

                         (Drops bag full of 
                         groceries)
                    Oh shit!  You son of a bitch.  
                    I warned you what would happen 
                    if you got all dirty again.  

                         (Dexter and his 
                         mother chase each 
                         other and wrestle to 
                         the ground laughing).

     Scene 6
     Erik is playing a TV video game.

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    There s some boys outside 
                    playing baseball.  If you made 
                    the effort to get to know 
                    them...maybe they're nice.  Oh, 
                    I m gonna go out with some 
                    girls from the office tonight 
                    so cook yourself a dinner in 
                    the microwave.  You know, have 
                    you thought anymore about 
                    Colorado?

                              ERIK 
                    I m not going to camp.

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    You know,  but if you just 
                    gave it chance you'd meet some 
                    nice friends.

                              ERIK 
                    Why can't I go see Dad?

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    Well, call him.  If he says 
                    yes, I'll put you on the next 
                    plane.  Go ahead.  You know, 
                    you and his little friend, 
                    Cindy, could go to the movies 
                    and get in for half price.  

                              ERIK 
                    She's twenty three Mom.

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    Oh amazing.  Old enough to 
                    drink.

                              ERIK 
                    Yeah, but she doesn't.

     Erik's mother turns off the video game.

                              ERIK 
                    Man, I was on world eight!

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    You know it s not good to 
                    spend too much time with these 
                    games.

                    All right, I got nothing 
                    against going fishing but I m 
                    not touching the worms.

                              DEXTER
                    I'll take care of the worms.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    I'll take care of the worms.

                              DEXTER
                    I will.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Yeah, let s see about that.  
                    Goodnight.

                              DEXTER
                    Got ya first!

     sides of the fence.

                              DEXTER
                    They ended up giving me two 
                    pints of blood.  I guess that s 
                    a lot for a baby.

                              ERIK 
                    My grandmother says you re 
                    going to hell.  She says you'll 
                    suffer eternal torture from a 
                    billion flames hotter than the 
                    center of the sun.

                              DEXTER
                    Then she must be some kind of 
                    genius.

                              ERIK 
                    What?

                              DEXTER
                    Well, my doctor is really 
                    smart.  And he says he has no 
                    idea what happens to people 
                    after they die.  If your 
                    grandmother knows, she must be 
                    a genius.

                              ERIK 
                    She's a clerk at K-Mart.

                              DEXTER
                    Maybe she's just an under-
                    achiever.

                              ERIK 
                    No, she's an idiot.

                              DEXTER
                    So maybe I won't go to hell 
                    after all.

                              ERIK 
                    Are you sure those germs of 
                    yours don't travel through the 
                    air?

                              DEXTER
                    Yeah, why?  
                         (Erik comes to the 
                         other side of the 
                         fence).

                              ERIK 
                    How old are you?

                              DEXTER
                    Eleven.

                              ERIK 
                    Jesus, you re a midget.

                              DEXTER
                    Well, if you look at the lower 
                    limit of what s considered 
                    normal for my age, I m only 
                    four inches shorter.

                              ERIK 
                    Oh.

                              DEXTER
                    So, do you know how to play 
                    battleship?

     Scene 12
     Dexter and Erik are playing  Battleship  together.

                              ERIK 
                    G-9.

                              DEXTER
                    Miss.

                              ERIK 
                    Damn!  Are you sure?

                              DEXTER
                    Yep.  D-7.

                              ERIK 
                    Miss.  
                         (Erik and Dexter 
                         play various games 
                         together--most are 
                         violent and deal with 
                         death, war and 
                         destruction.  
                         Dexter's watch alarm 
                         goes off).

                              DEXTER
                    I have to eat my lunch now.

                              ERIK 
                    Why don't you just eat 
                    whenever you re hungry?

                              DEXTER
                    Cause if I only ate when I was 
                    hungry I wouldn't be here.

                              ERIK 
                    Do you wanna go to Peterson's?

                              DEXTER
                    What's that?

                              ERIK 
                    It s a supermarket.  Food.  
                    You got any money?

                              DEXTER
                    In my bedroom.  What should we 
                    do with him?

                              ERIK 
                    You wanna burn him?

     Scene 13
     Dexter gets money from his bedroom.

                              ERIK 
                    Woah!  Where did you get it 
                    all?

                              DEXTER
                    Allowance.  And fines.

                              ERIK 
                    Fines?

                              DEXTER
                    It s a little hard to explain.

                              ERIK 
                    This is great!  Since I know 
                    where the store is, I'll be the 
                    navigator and you be treasurer.

                              DEXTER
                    What does the treasurer do?

                              ERIK 
                    Carries all the money and pays 
                    for things.

                              DEXTER
                    I m supposed to pay for both 
                    of us?

                              ERIK 
                    Well I m navigating for both 
                    of us--you want to be fair 
                    don't ya?

                              DEXTER
                    How far is Peterson's?

                              ERIK 
                    Why?

                              DEXTER
                    If I walk too far I get kind 
                    of tired.

     Scene 14
     Erik and Dexter are going down the river on a raft.

                              DEXTER
                    It seems to me the depth of 
                    the water would be the key.  
                    Obviously in the middle of the 
                    ocean a shark would win, and on 
                    dry land the lion would win.  
                    So how much water are we 
                    talking about?

                              ERIK 
                    Two and a half feet.

                              DEXTER
                    And how big is the shark?

                              ERIK 
                    Eleven feet.

                              DEXTER
                    I still say that the lion 
                    would win.

                              ERIK 
                    Wrong!

                              DEXTER
                    How can you be sure?

                              ERIK 
                    Cause they did research on it 
                    at Stanford University.  The 
                    shark won easily.

                              DEXTER
                    They just let two animals kill 
                    each other at a college?

                              ERIK 
                    No you idiot!  They just had 
                    them fight long enough to see 
                    who was gonna win, and then the 
                    trainers pulled them apart.

                              DEXTER
                    How?

                              ERIK 
                    Haven t you ever heard of a 
                    leash?

                              DEXTER
                    Never heard of a shark with a 
                    leash.

                              ERIK 
                    Well, there s a lot of things 
                    you've never heard of.  

                              DEXTER
                    Yeah, I guess that s true.

                              ERIK 
                    Hold on!

                              DEXTER
                    My mom says that every drop of 
                    water that lands in the water 
                    here eventually ends up in the 
                    Mississippi.

                              ERIK 
                    That means it goes to my dad.  
                    He's still in New Orleans.

                              DEXTER
                    What does he do?

                              ERIK 
                    You ever heard of a rock group 
                    called Led Zeppelin?

                              DEXTER
                    No.

                              ERIK 
                    Well, they re really famous.  
                    Do you know who the guitar 
                    player is?  

                              DEXTER
                    Your dad?

                              ERIK 
                    No.  A guy named Jimmy Page.  
                    My dad sold him his car 
                    insurance...for a Pontiac 
                    TransAm.

     Scene 15
     Peterson's supermarket.

                              ERIK 
                    Know what you re gonna get?

                              DEXTER
                    I don't know.  It s been a 
                    long time since I had any 
                    candy.  My Mom has me eating 
                    lots of vegetables.

                              ERIK 
                    C mere.  
                         (Erik opens candy 
                         bar for Dexter).

                              DEXTER
                    We allowed to do this?

                              ERIK 
                    Of course.  How else are you 
                    supposed to know what you re 
                    gonna get?

                              DEXTER
                    Hmm.  Wow!

                              ERIK 
                    Not bad, huh?  Well, get out 
                    your money.

     Scene 16
                    Erik and Dexter are coming 
                    home from Peterson's.

                    Hey, get out of the road!  Go

                    Three degrees to the right.  
                    And fire.

                              ERIK 
                    You missed.

                              BOY #2
                    Hey, how much did you pay for 
                    that faggot?

                              BOY #1
                    Hey, you guys just took a 
                    wrong turn.  This is a  no homo 
                    zone. 

                              ERIK 
                    I ain't a homo!  And neither 
                    is he.  He got it from a blood 
                    transfusion.

                              BOY #1
                    Well then what s that awful 
                    smell?

                              ERIK 
                    Well, you see we were walking 
                    across the grass and we 
                    accidentally stepped in your 
                    mother.

                              BOY #1
                    What d you say?  ...Can t hit 
                    us all with that.

                              ERIK 
                    I'll only be aiming at you.

                              BOY #1
                    C'mon then.

                              ERIK 
                    Hey, what about your little 
                    brother, huh?

                              BOY #1
                    What about him?

                              ERIK 
                    When he fell off the jungle 
                    school at school.  They had to 
                    take him to the hospital.  He 
                    could have caught something 
                    then.

                              BOY #2
                    Yeah, but he didn't.

                              ERIK 
                    But he could've.  Then 
                    everybody d be calling him 
                    faggot and queer!  And he d get 
                    sick and die!  And they d write  
                    homo  on his headstone!  Then 
                    when your mother went to bring 
                    him flowers she d see little 
                    Eddie Horner Homo!  And you 
                    know what the worst part about

                    like you who ain't sick thought 
                    it might be fun to just beat 
                    the shit out of him!

                    m yelling the same stuff at 
                    them.  Well they know I m not a 
                    faggot because a faggot 
                    wouldn't yell  faggot  back.  
                    Now that s who I should yell 
                    faggot to.

                    Well, this wouldn't be the

                    No.  I m getting kinda tired.  
                    I think I should go take a nap.

     Scene 17

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    Leave it.

                              ERIK 
                    Why can't I eat in the living 
                    room?

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    I don't get home for dinner 
                    that often and when I do, I 
                    want us to eat together.  That 
                    s part of being a family, isn't 
                    it?...You know some women saw 
                    that little AIDS boy down at 
                    Peterson's yesterday.

                              ERIK 
                    It s in the newspaper?

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    No.  Jan told me.  You know, 
                    I've seen him in the backyard 
                    there, but I didn't know he 
                    left the house.

                              ERIK 
                    The other day I heard him 
                    coughing .

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    Hmm?

                              ERIK 
                    I said I heard him coughing .

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    Oh, I don't think you have to 
                    worry about anything.  You know 
                    with that fence there, you re 
                    not going to catch anything.

                              ERIK 
                    What if he wants to come over 
                    and play?

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    Oh Erik, think of some excuse.  
                    You re so good at that.

                              ERIK 
                    What if I bump into him out in 
                    the street?

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    Well, it s common sense.  You 
                    just keep a safe distance.

                              ERIK 
                    What's a safe distance?

                    Well, then there s something I 
                    have to warn you about.

                              ERIK 
                    What?

                              DEXTER
                    She likes to call me  Sweetie. 

                              ERIK 
                    Sweetie?!

                              DEXTER

                    laugh.

                    Sweetie?

                              DEXTER
                    No thanks.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Are we ready for dessert then?

                              DEXTER
                    I'll try a little.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Yeah, I'll bet.

                              ERIK 
                    You didn't even finish your 
                    meatloaf  Love Muffins! 

                              DEXTER

                    She's not gonna hear me 
                    Sweetie!

                              DEXTER
                    Shh!  Be quiet!

                              ERIK 
                    Don t worry about it Sweetie!  
                    She's not gonna hear me!

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Here we go.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Dexter tells me you have a 
                    girlfriend.

                              ERIK 
                    Yeah, I did, but I had to dump 
                    her.  Spin. Spin. Spin.

                              DEXTER
                    His father has a girlfriend 
                    named Cindy.

                              ERIK 
                    Yeah, as soon as they get 
                    settled in their new apartment 
                    I may be going down there.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    How does your mom feel about 
                    this?

                              ERIK 
                    Um...actually we haven t 
                    really talked it out 
                    much...yet.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Hmm Hmm.  Well, I'd love to 
                    meet her.

                              ERIK 
                    She works quite a bit.  
                    Twenty, twenty-two hours a day.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    What does she do?

                              ERIK 
                    Uh, real estate.  And at night 
                    she works at the Mini-Mart.  
                    You know, the one downtown.

                              DEXTER
                    Twenty-five cents!  Gottchya!

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Damn!

                              DEXTER
                    Whenever I catch her twirling 
                    her hair she has to pay me a 
                    quarter.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Twenty-five cents, Miss!

                              ERIK 
                    Uh, are you gonna finish that?

                              DEXTER
                    Oh...um...

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Uh, well, the doctors say it s 
                    completely safe, Erik, but when 
                    it comes to other people s 
                    children, we've decided, um, 
                    not to take any chances.

                              ERIK 
                    Forgot.  I've got a plan.  
                    Just as soon as they find a 
                    cure, we re heading out to 
                    Baskin Robbins and order one of 
                    those monster sundaes where 
                    everybody just digs right in!

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    That s a good plan.  Excuse 
                    me.

                              ERIK 
                    What is it?

                              DEXTER
                    She's afraid that they might 
                    not find a cure in time.

                    Oh my god!  He's afraid of 
                    heights.

                              ERIK 
                    Oh.  Hey, what if they don't 
                    find a cure?

                              DEXTER
                    I m sure they will eventually.

                              ERIK 
                    But what if they re looking in 
                    the wrong place?

                              DEXTER
                    What d ya mean?

                              ERIK 
                    Well, have you ever seen that

                              MAN
                    Vermilion.  The flower. 

                              DEXTER
                    You want me to start eating 
                    flowers?

                              ERIK 
                    Shh!

                              MAN
                    I came here six years ago.  
                    Why?  A freak tribe.... 

                              ERIK 
                    We re not going to worry about 
                    what...flowers and 
                    leaves...maybe even pine cones.  
                    It can't hurt to try.

                              DEXTER
                    My mom has me eating lots of 
                    vegetables, especially 
                    broccoli.

                    they eat is fruits and 
                    vegetables.  What's the one

                              DEXTER
                    This is stupid.

                              ERIK 
                    About fifty years ago a doctor 
                    noticed some mold was growing 
                    on his bread.  He started 
                    feeding it to people.  
                    Everybody said,  This is 
                    stupid.   You what it turned 
                    out to be?  Aspirin. 
                         (Erik takes Dexter's 
                         temperature).

                    It s still a hundred-point-
                    two.  How are ya feeling?

                    Okay.

                    combined with Bubblicious.

                              DEXTER
                    I m not so sure I understand 
                    why you can try all of this 
                    stuff, too.

                              ERIK 
                    Don t you know anything about 
                    scientific method?

                              DEXTER
                    A little.

                              ERIK 
                    Well, you have to have a 
                    control group, so you can see 
                    if the results are uniform.

                              DEXTER
                    Are you the control group?

                              ERIK 
                    Yep.

                              ERIK 
                    Is Dexter here?

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Yes, he is, but he's grounded.

                              ERIK 
                    Why?

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Because he used up all his 
                    money buying candy.

                              ERIK 
                    Oh.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Hmm.

                              ERIK
                    Okay.  How long is he grounded 
                    for?

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Until tomorrow.

                              ERIK 
                    Okay.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    What's that?

                              ERIK 
                    Uh, we were going to play 
                    submarines.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Well, grounded is grounded so 
                    you re going to have to wait 
                    until tomorrow.

                    I understand.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Just a minute--okay?  Dexter, 
                    get your ass down here!  

                              DEXTER
                    Why?

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Cause I m changing your 
                    punishment.  You have to play 
                    with Erik.

                    Thanks Mom.

                              ERIK 
                    Grab yourself a paddle.

                              DEXTER
                    Terrible.

                              ERIK 
                    I suppose eating candy was a 
                    stupid idea...Hey, what d'ya 
                    think of this one?

                              DEXTER
                    I m wondering about something.  
                    Where do bugs go to the 
                    bathroom?

                              ERIK 
                    It s not on leaves.

                              DEXTER
                    How can you be sure?

                              ERIK 
                    Because bugs eat leaves.  Not 
                    even bugs are stupid enough to 
                    shit on their own food.  Well,

                              DEXTER
                    Hmm...Oh...Tastes like crap!

                              ERIK 
                    No shit.  Don t you know where 
                    bugs go to the bathroom? 
                         (Erik adds sugar to 
                         the  medicine ).

                              ERIK 
                    You can't be afraid to try.

     Dexter and Erik scare Dexter's mother.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Shit!  You got me...Dexter, is 
                    your friend Erik staying for 
                    dinner again?

                    I asked you a question.

                              ERIK 
                    Uh, Gordie Johnson asked me if 
                    I wanted to go to the mall with 
                    him.  And uh, I didn't think 
                    you'd mind.

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    Is um, is that that doctor s

                    Yeah.

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    Well, uh, you really...you 
                    should have left a note for 
                    me...Hmm.  You know, maybe 
                    Gordon would like to go with us 
                    to see the fireworks.

                              ERIK

                    one, two....three, that s a 
                    dime isn't it?  Oh dear.

                    There!

                    Oh, thank you very much.

                              DEXTER
                    Erik!

                              ERIK 
                    What?

     Dexter shows Erik a newspaper with the headline,  New 
     Orleans Doctor Finds Cure For Aids. 

                              ERIK 
                    Oh my god.  

     Scene 34
     Erik reads newspaper article aloud.

                              ERIK 
                    The mysterious Dr. Fishburn 
                    derives the extract from a 
                    plant found deep in the 
                    Louisiana Bayou, at a backwater 
                    location here that he refuses 
                    to reveal.  I knew it was a 
                    plant.

                              DEXTER
                    It says that the government is 
                    trying to suppress his 
                    findings.

                              ERIK 
                    The bastards!

                              DEXTER
                    Why would they do that?

                              ERIK 
                    Because they re embarrassed.  
                    I mean, think of all the money 
                    they spend each year and this 
                    Dr. Fishburn guy goes out in 
                    his backyard in his underwear 
                    one morning and picks up the 
                    cure for AIDS.  Hey, maybe your 
                    mom could drive us down there.  

     Scene 35

                    It s right here!

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Look, I don't want you to 
                    waste anything because 
                    something like this cannot 
                    happen and if it does then Dr. 
                    Jensen is gonna know about it 
                    before the National....

                              ERIK 
                    ...Examiner.

                              DEXTER
                    Why don't we call him.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    No!  Why don't we wait until 
                    your next appointment and you 
                    can ask him then.  This if for 
                    after lunch.  Oh, like I didn't 
                    see that!

     Scene 36

                              DEXTER
                    You said your dad lives in New 
                    Orleans, right?

                              ERIK 
                    Yeah.

                              DEXTER
                    Well, maybe he can get some of 
                    that secret extract and mail it 
                    to us.

                              ERIK 
                    Maybe it s already here.

     Scene 37
     Erik and Dexter go back to the "scary" looking plant.

                              DEXTER
                    That one again?  

                              ERIK 
                    Yep.

                              DEXTER
                    I just don't like it.

                              ERIK 
                    Look at that thing!  If that 
                    don't look like a plant from 
                    the bayou, then I don't know 
                    bayous!

     Scene 38
     Dexter tries the new  medicine. 

                              DEXTER
                    Oh...this is the worst yet.

                              ERIK 
                    Well grandma says that the 
                    worst it tastes the better it

     Scene 39
     The ambulance comes for Dexter.

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    I need to talk to Erik.  There 
                    s some kind of...kind of leaf 
                    that he took in today...

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    Erik has something to do with 
                    this?

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Erik has...

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    What are you talking about?  
                    Leaves?

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Erik!  Erik!  I need to know 
                    what you gave Dexter today.  I 
                    need to know what kind of leaf 
                    you gave him.  It s poisonous 
                    and he told me that you have it 
                    written down in a notebook.

                              ERIK 
                    Here s the one!  It says  Down 
                    by the river. 

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Down by the river.  
                    Where...this one?

                              ERIK 
                    Right where the bridge 
                    crosses!

     Dexter's mother goes to the hospital in the police car.

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    Back inside.  
                         (Erik's mother grabs 
                         his head and slaps 
                         him)
                    What were you thinking?    
                    What?! Tell me!  Tell me!  
                    Huh?!  Not measles.  Not 
                    chicken pox.  AIDS!  What were 
                    you trying to do, huh?  What 
                    are you trying to do?  Kill us 
                    both?  Huh?!  There s gonna be 
                    some big changes around here.  
                    Big changes!

     Erik's mother is talking to Dexter's mother on the 
     telephone.

                              ERIK'S MOTHER
                    Well, I don't really care what 
                    you think!  I don't want him 
                    over here.  I don't want my son 
                    over there.  I don't care that 
                    they re friends.  I don't want 
                    them associating with each 
                    other, period!  
                         (Erik's mother hangs 
                         up and talks to Erik)
                    Well, he's gonna be fine.  
                    Thank god.  But his mother is 
                    officially on notice.  If she 
                    allows him to see you I'm gonna 
                    have her ass thrown in jail.  
                    For you, come Monday morning 
                    your ass is going to summer 
                    camp.

     Scene 40
     Erik calls his father.

                              ANSWERING MACHINE
                    Hi there.

                              ERIK 
                    Hey dad?

                              ANSWERING MACHINE
                    Sorry we missed you.  Cindy 
                    and I are in Lake Charleston 
                    until Tuesday.  Call you as 
                    soon as we get back.

     Scene 41
     Erik tries to convince Dexter to go to New Orleans with him.

                              DEXTER
                    When we get down there, where 
                    are we gonna sleep?  What are 
                    we going to eat?

                              ERIK 
                    We don't gotta worry about 
                    that.  I already talked to my 
                    dad and he said we could stay 
                    with him.  I might even be able 
                    to talk him into taking us 
                    fishing .

                              DEXTER
                    I can't.

                              ERIK 
                    You have to Dex.  Tomorrow 
                    morning I m outta here!

                              DEXTER
                    I just think she'll be really, 
                    really worried.

                              ERIK 
                    She's already worried because 
                    your sick!  And you and I both 
                    know that the only thing that 
                    is going to make her happy is 
                    when we go to New Orleans and 
                    Dr. Fishburn has the cure.

     Scene 42
     Erik and Dexter run away from home.

                              DEXTER
                    
                         (In a letter to his 
                         mother)
                    "Dear Mom, I've gone with 
                    Erik.  But I've brought along 
                    my medicine so there s no 
                    reason to worry.  We plan to be 
                    careful and sensible.  Whatever 
                    you do, remember to tape 
                    Starwars, eight p.m., channel 
                    five.  I love you very much.  
                    Sincerely, Dexter."

     Erik and Dexter float down the river.

     Scene 43
     Erik and Dexter on the river.

                              ERIK 
                    He's the biggest fish in the 
                    world.  He weighs over 2,000 
                    pounds.  That s why they call 
                    him the Sturgeon General.  

                              DEXTER
                    What if he decides to tip us 
                    over?

                              ERIK 
                    He wouldn't do that!  One time 
                    this kid, he went swimming 
                    after eating, and he got a 
                    stomach cramp and he started to 
                    drown, but the Sturgeon General 
                    grabbed by the shirt and put 
                    him on the shore!

                              DEXTER
                    How fast do you think we re 
                    going?

                              ERIK 
                    About three miles an hour.

                              DEXTER
                    How far is it to New Orleans?

                              ERIK 
                    About twelve hundred miles.

                              DEXTER
                    How long will it take us to 
                    get there?

     Scene 44
     Erik and Dexter try to get a ride down the river.

                              ERIK 
                    Hey, where ya headed?

                              MAN #2

                              MAN #5
                    Peoria.

                              PONY
                    How much you got?

                              ERIK 
                    What?

                              PONY
                    Want a ride you gotta pay for 
                    the gas.  You know.  Where ya 
                    heading?

                              ERIK 
                    New Orleans.  I could give you 
                    twenty dollars.

                              PONY
                    Twenty bucks?  Man, you wanna 
                    go to New Orleans for twenty 
                    bucks?  I don't know, I think 
                    you re gonna have to do better 
                    than that.

                              ERIK 
                    Forty!  That s all I got.

                              JIMMY
                    Hey Pony, you ready to float?

                              PONY
                    Good thing Jimmy.  You locked 
                    and loaded?

                              JIMMY
                    Yep.

                              PONY
                    All right.  

                              ERIK 
                    All right.  A hundred and 
                    sixty two dollars.  Check my 
                    pockets.

                              DEXTER
                    Erik!  Erik!

                              ERIK 
                    Shut up Dex!

                              DEXTER
                    No Erik.  Look.  Look.  Look!

                              ERIK 
                    Let me handle this, 
                    please!...What do you say?

     Scene 45
     Erik and Dexter leave on Pony s boat.

                              ERIK 
                    We really took this moron Pony 
                    to the cleaners!  The money we 
                    gave him won't pay for half his 
                    gas!  

                              DEXTER
                    This boat is from New Orleans.  
                    He's on his way home.

                              ERIK 
                    Now what makes you think that?  
                         (Erik checks the 
                         back of the boat)
                         Shit!

     Scene 46
     First night on the boat.

                              ERIK 
                    Look how far we've 
                    gone....Dex.  You awake?  Dex.  
                    You awake?  Dex!  Awake?  

                              DEXTER
                    What?

                              ERIK 
                    I just said, look how far 
                    we've gone.  About five or six 
                    days and we'll be down there.

                              DEXTER
                    Maybe when we stop for gas I 
                    should call my mom.

                              ERIK 
                    You can't.  They'll trace the 
                    call.  We'll probably in Iowa 
                    about one tomorrow afternoon.  
                    Dex?

     Scene 47
     Second day on the boat.

                              ERIK 
                    Get up!  C'mon get up!

                              DEXTER
                    Why?

                              ERIK 
                    Get up!  Get up!  Get up!

                              DEXTER
                    I m too tired.

                              ERIK 
                    No you re not.  You re just 
                    bored.  C'mon!  C'mon!

     Scene 48
     Erik and Dexter go below deck.

                              ERIK 
                    They don't have Battleship.  
                    They don't have Monopoly.  They 
                    don't even have a deck of 
                    cards....Wait a minute.  

                              DEXTER
                    What is it? 
                         (Erik and Dexter are 
                         look at Playboy 
                         magazine).

                              DEXTER
                    Are you sure these girls are 
                    real?

                              ERIK 
                    Of course they re real.

                              DEXTER
                    I've never seen anyone that 
                    looks like this before.  My mom 
                    sure doesn't.

                              ERIK 
                    These aren't moms.  These are 
                    women.  This is what they re 
                    supposed to look like.

                              DEXTER
                    How do you know they re not 
                    computer animation?

                              ERIK 
                    Do computer animations like 
                    walks on the beach?  Do 
                    computer animations enjoy 
                    classical music?

                              DEXTER
                    She was born in 1975.

                              ERIK 
                    She doesn't look that 
                    old....Holy shit!  
                         (Erik finds money in 
                         the magazine)
                    There's gotta be three hundred 
                    dollars here!  

                              DEXTER
                    We should put it back.

                              ERIK 
                    Why?

                              DEXTER
                    They might think we re down 
                    here trying to steal it.

                              ERIK 
                    They don't even know we re 
                    down here.  
                         (The boys here a 
                         noise and put the 
                         money back).

                              DEXTER
                    They re here.

                              ERIK 
                    Don t give it to me!

                    my back?

                              DEXTER

                              ANGEL

                    Angel.

                              DEXTER
                    You misspelled your tattoo.  
                    It doesn't say  Angel  it says  
                    Angle. 

                              ANGEL

                              ERIK 
                    I said this sucks!

                              DEXTER

                    You pissed all over your 
                    sleeping bag.

                              DEXTER
                    No, it s sweat.

                              ERIK 
                    Sweat?  Well, you re 
                    shivering.  How can you be 
                    sweating when your cold?

                              DEXTER
                    I don't know.  I just do.

                              ERIK 
                    C mere, we'll get you in these 
                    clothes and into my sleeping 
                    bag.

                              DEXTER
                    Thanks.

                              ERIK 
                    Were you having a nightmare or 
                    something?

                              DEXTER
                    No.

                              ERIK 
                    What's the matter?

                              DEXTER
                    It happens sometimes.  When I 
                    wake up and it s dark.  
                    Astronomers believe that the 
                    universe is 18 billion light 
                    years across.

                              ERIK 
                    So?

                              DEXTER
                    Suppose you kept going another 
                    18 billion light years.  What 
                    if there s nothing out there?  
                    Suppose you kept going another 
                    trillion times further.  So far 
                    out you see nothing.  Because 
                    the light from the universe 
                    would be fainter than the 
                    faintest star.  Infinitely 
                    cold.  Infinitely black.  
                    Sometimes, if I wake up, and it 
                    s dark, I get really scared.  
                    Like I m out there.  And I m 
                    never coming back.

                              ERIK 
                    Here 
                         (gives Dexter his 
                         shoe)
                    Hold on to this while you 
                    sleep.  And if you wake up and 
                    you re scared, you'll say,  
                    Wait a minute.  I m holding 
                    Erik's shoe.  Why the hell 
                    would I be holding some smelly 
                    basketball shoe a trillion 
                    light years from the universe?  
                    I must be here on earth safe in 
                    my sleeping bag, and Erik must 
                    be close by.

                              DEXTER
                    Guess it s worth a try.

                              ERIK 
                    Want me to leave the lantern 
                    on?

     Scene 55

                              ERIK 
                    Come on!  We gotta get out of 
                    here!

Go back to sleep!

                    gave you the money you said we 
                    re going straight to New 
                    Orleans.

                              ANGEL
                    Well if you get there a couple 
                    of days later it s not going to 
                    kill you!

                              ERIK 
                    Shut up!   Angel! 

                              PONY

                    shit!  You want me to swim over 
                    there and knock you on your 
                    ass?

                              ERIK 
                    How long before you run out of 
                    pills?

                              DEXTER
                    Three more days.

                              DEXTER
                    I m not hungry.

                              ERIK 
                    Okay.  I'll go get the

                    Oh boys!  I think we need to 
                    have a little talk.  
                         (Boys continue

                    C'mon boys!  Listen up, huh?

                         through the opening 
                         in the fence).

                    or something?  Where s my

                         knife from Erik).

                              ERIK 
                    What in the hell are you 
                    doing?  Are you crazy?!

                              DEXTER
                    I m gonna die anyways, it 
                    doesn't matter if he hurts me!

                              PONY
                    You two.  What are you talking 
                    about?  What's he talking 
                    about?

                              ERIK 
                    He has AIDS!

                              DEXTER
                    You d be crazy to stab me.  My 
                    blood is like poison.  One drop 
                    could kill you.

                              PONY
                    Bullshit.  
                         (Dexter cuts himself 
                         with the knife).

                              JIMMY
                    Hey Pony!  
                         (Erik and Dexter 
                         start chasing Pony).

                              PONY
                    Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Get out man!  
                    Get the hell out!  Let em go!

                              DEXTER
                    My blood is like poison!

                              ERIK 
                    Pussies!  
                         (Pony and Jimmy run 
                         away).

                              DEXTER
                    Like the venom of a cobra.

                              ERIK 
                    Pussies!  Dex...you re like a 
                    damn super hero or something!  
                    That was rad.

     Dexter looks at his blood and sits down.

                              ERIK 
                    Here.  
                         (Offers Dexter his 
                         jacket to wrap his 
                         wound).

                              DEXTER
                    No!...No...I m feeling kind of 
                    sick.

     Scene 63
     Back at the bus station.

                              ERIK 
                    You gonna be all right while I 
                    go get the tickets?

                              DEXTER
                    Yeah.

                              ERIK 
                    You cold?  
                         (Checks to see if 
                         Dexter has a fever).

                              DEXTER
                    No.

                              ERIK 
                    What's the matter?

                              DEXTER
                    My blood is poison.

                              ERIK 
                    You have a virus, Dex.  You re 
                    gonna be exactly like everyone 
                    else as long as someone finds 
                    the cure.

                              DEXTER
                    Dr. Fishburn has the cure.

                              ERIK 
                    Here we go.

                              DEXTER
                    Are we in New Orleans?

                              ERIK 
                    C'mon.

                              DEXTER
                    Where are we?

                              DEXTER'S MOTHER
                    Come here.

                              DEXTER
                    Mom!  Sorry.

                              ERIK 
                    I was wondering if I could see 
                    Dexter.

     Scene 67

     Scene 68
     In Dexter's hospital room.

                              DEXTER
                    As long as I keep throwing up 
                    they re going to have to stick 
                    this feeding tube up my nose 
                    into my stomach.

                              ERIK 
                    Sounds gross.

                              DEXTER
                    It hurts.

                              ERIK 
                    Doesn't that?

                              DEXTER
                    Not nearly as much.

                              ERIK 
                    So you can't eat anything, 
                    huh?

                              DEXTER
                    Not right now.

                              ERIK 
                    Oh well...that s too bad 
                         (hands Dexter 
                         Butterfinger candy 
                         bars).

                              DEXTER
                    Hey, maybe you can crumble one 
                    up and put it into my I.V.

                              ERIK 
                    Yeah.  You know what?  I m 
                    gonna see if I can't sneak 
                    anymore leaves in here.

                              DEXTER
                    That s okay.  Dr. Jensen said 
                    that the stuff in the leaves 
                    wasn't real.

                              ERIK 
                    I know.  Your mom told me.

                              DEXTER
                    Hey, look at this.  Look at 
                    that.

                              ERIK 
                    This is you?

                              DEXTER
                    Yeah.

                              ERIK 
                    God, you were an ugly baby!  
                    Check it out, it s Angel!  
                         (Dexter begins 
                         coughing)
                    You all right?  I like the old 
                    man.  What's this do?

                              DEXTER
                    This one makes the bed go up.  
                    Or down.

     Scene 69
     Dexter and Erik pull their first hospital prank.

                              ERIK 
                         (Crying)
                    Come here!  He's...he's 
                    stopped breathing!

                              NURSE #1
                    What's the matter?

                              ERIK 
                         (Crying)
                    I was just talking to him and 
                    he stopped....he's dead.  
                         (Nurse #2 checks for 
                         a heart beat).

                              NURSE #1
                    I m sorry honey.  I guess we 
                    all knew this was coming.

                              ERIK 
                    No!

     Dexter  wakes up  and screams, scaring the nurses.

                              NURSE #2
                    Not funny!  Not even a little 
                    bit!

                              DEXTER
                    Guess we all knew this was 
                    coming.

     Scene 70

     Scene 71
     Dexter's hospital room.

                              ERIK 
                    By the power invested in me, I 
                    hereby order that the execution 
                    begin.

                              DR. JENSEN
                    Well, feeling better I guess.  
                    Yeah, you must be Erik.  So I 
                    guess your road to the Nobel 
                    Prize hit a few potholes?

                              ERIK 
                    More like the Grand Canyon.

                              DR. JENSEN
                    Okay, let s open wide and say  
                    Ah.   Does that hurt when you 
                    talk?  Well, let s see that 
                    hairy chest.

                              ERIK 
                    He knows he's dying.

                              DR. JENSEN
                    What?

                              ERIK 
                    We tricked the nurses into 
                    thinking that he was dead and 
                    Nurse Murphy said that everyone 
                    knew it was coming.

                              DR. JENSEN
                    So you tricked 'em?

                              ERIK 
                    Well, we pretended that Dexter 
                    stopped breathing and he jumped 
                    up and screamed and scared 
                    them.

                              DR. JENSEN
                    She must have hit the roof.

                              ERIK 
                    Yeah!  Dexter laughed his ass 
                    off!

                              DR. JENSEN
                    Well, that s what happened to 
                    it.  I thought he was just on a 
                    diet here.  Listen, history is 
                    full of very sick people who 
                    suddenly, for no reason at all, 
                    get better.  And when it 
                    happens we call it a miracle.  
                    From the moment I met you I 
                    knew that you are special and 
                    that you might be one of those 
                    people.  Yeah.  You know I m 
                    telling you the truth, don't 
                    you?  You can feel that inside, 
                    can't you?  Just don't let me 
                    down, okay?  I m counting on 
                    you to make me famous!

                              DEXTER
                    Mom.

                              ERIK

                              NURSE
                    Well the young boy was upset.

                              DR. JENSEN
                    Well don't you ever, ever, 
                    assume that one of my patients 
                    is going to die!

                    Mister!  My friend...he 
                    stopped breathing!  I think 
                    he's dead!

                              DOCTOR
                    Go get a nurse.

     Doctor checks Dexter and Dexter screams.

                              DOCTOR
                    Oh Shit!  Shit!  Oh my...Jesus 
                    Christ!  Oh...Oh you scared the 
                    living daylights out of me...Oh 
                    and we are amused, are we?  I m 
                    not laughing...do you see me 
                    laughing?  No?  Okay...Oh

                    Okay, it s my turn.  Here 
                    comes the breaker.  Don t

                              DOCTOR
                    I m terribly impressed.

                              ERIK 
                    He gets all the good ones and
