               EFFECT SHOT:  THE SHADOW OF THE THIN MAN!

               The shadow, grotesquely thin, is cast by one strong light 
               which reflects itself against a white cement wall.  When 
               we first see the shad-ow, it is standing upright, examining 
               some- thing which it holds in its hands.  Now the shadow 
               bends down and as it does so, CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL 
               CLYDE WYNANT in his work-shop.  He is a tall, thin man of 
               about fifty-five, with white hair.  He has a fine, sensi- 
               tive face.  He is a very successful inventor.

               A man who is capable of sudden fits of anger which he 
               forgets almost immediately, but which are quite terrifying 
               while they last.  Just now he is utterly absorbed in what 
               he is doing -- working on a delicately-wired part which 
               has to do with a new form of combustion engine that he has 
               invented.  (Through the entire scene, from the first shadow 
               effect, we hear the engine in operation as he is working 
               over it.)  Wynant is dressed in overalls, and possibly a 
               long shade over his eyes.  The shop itself is in the base- 
               ment of a small warehouse building, in the thirties between 
               First Avenue and the East River, in New York.  It is a 
               long and narrow machine shop, full of interest and character 
               in its mechanical layout.  Miniatures of engine-models of 
               various kinds -- vats of molten lead -- carbon racks -- 
               welding instruments -- delicate light bulbs, and such other 
               apparatus as composes a combination shop and laboratory of 
               this machine type.  WE HOLD A MOMENT on Wynant in the midst 
               of an experiment over the combustion engine. Then from the 
               background a workman named Tom, also dressed in overalls, 
               a man of about thirty-five, comes in from an adjoining 
               shop.  He comes toward Wynant.

                                     TOM
                         (hesitant -- in a mild tone)
                         Your daughter's here, Mr. Wynant.
                              (then, as Wynant 
                              doesn't seem to 
                              hear him, he speaks 
                              louder)
                         Mr. Wynant!

               Wynant, startled out of his absorption, drops a delicate 
               piece of metal (or whatever fragile wiring or part he would 
               be holding), and turns furiously on Tom.

               Wynant Haven't you any more sense than to shout at me like 
               that!

                                     TOM
                         I'm sorry...  but...

                                     WYNANT
                              (picking up the 
                              little piece -- 
                              its edges are 
                              spoiled)
                         Two weeks work gone for nothing.

                                     TOM
                         I just wanted to tell you...

                                     WYNANT
                              (interrupting)
                         I don't care what you wanted to 
                         tell me.  You're through!  Get 
                         your things and get out!

               The workman shrugs his shoulders and starts away.  WE PAN 
               Wynant to a bench on which there are several acetylene 
               torches.  He is examining the part as he goes, muttering 
               and growling to himself.

                                     WYNANT
                         It's a good thing I'm going away -- 
                         no peace -- no quiet.  Everybody 
                         interrupting me --

               PANNING SHOT -- DOOR TO SHOP.

               DOROTHY WYNANT comes to the door and looks in.  Tom is 
               seen taking off his overalls, preparatory to leaving.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Can we come in?

               Tom looks up as she speaks to him.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Did you tell him?

                                     TOM
                         Sorry, Miss Wynant.  He didn't 
                         give me a chance.

               Dorothy comes in, followed by ANDREW READE.  She is a young 
               girl of about twenty-one, spirited and high-tempered like 
               her father.  She has great natural beauty and distinction 
               ...  the crisp product of a strict finishing school.  She 
               is dressed in smart, simple street dress, with a fur coat 
               over it.

               Andrew Reade is a good-looking boy fresh from college.  He 
               gives an impression of reliability and common sense.  CAMERA 
               PANS WITH THEM as they go toward the workbench and Wynant.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Dad!

               Wynant straightens up, and as he looks and sees that it is 
               his daughter, his whole expression changes.  He forgets 
               his anger.  he is delighted to see her.

                                     WYNANT
                         Why didn't they tell me you were 
                         here?

               Dorothy kisses him.

                                     DOROTHY
                         I'm sorry to interrupt your work, 
                         but this is important.

               Wynant looks over at Andrew standing behind Dorothy.  Andrew 
               smiles at him.

                                     ANDREW
                         How are you?

                                     WYNANT
                              (to Dorothy - as he 
                              turns off the 
                              combustion engine)
                         Another young man.

                                     ANDREW
                         It's the same one.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (as if she were 
                              speaking to a child 
                              who didn't remember 
                              his lessons)
                         It's been the same one for three 
                         months.

                                     WYNANT
                         Forgive me.
                              (he shakes Andrew's 
                              hand)
                         How are you?

                                     DOROTHY
                         Take a good look at him, Dad.
                              (Wynant looks at 
                              Andrew and smiles)
                         Now please try to remember him...  
                         'cause he's going to be your son-
                         in-law.

               Wynant's look changes to one of serious interest.

                                     WYNANT
                              (surprised)
                         Well!

                                     ANDREW
                              (to Wynant -- feeling 
                              that Dorothy has 
                              spoken too bluntly)
                         That is, if it's all right with 
                         you.

                                     WYNANT
                         And if it isn't?

                                     DOROTHY
                              (to the front!)
                         He'll still be your son-in-law!

                                     WYNANT
                              (to Andrew, with 
                              humor)
                         You see how much we have to say.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (puts her hand on 
                              her father's arm)
                         Dad, this is what I really wanted 
                         to ask you....

               Andrew, knowing that she wants to talk to her father alone, 
               interrupts.

                                     ANDREW
                         Mind if I look around?

                                     WYNANT
                         Help yourself.
                              (he turns and calls 
                              off)
                         Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...
                              (he stops as he 
                              sees Tom is ready 
                              to leave)

               FULL SHOT -- INCLUDING TOM AT DOOR

               Tom is dressed in his street suit, ready to go out.  Wynant 
               stares at him in amazement.

                                     WYNANT
                         Where are you going?

                                     TOM
                              (dryly)
                         Home!

                                     WYNANT
                         Home?

                                     TOM
                         I'm fired.

                                     WYNANT
                              (indignantly)
                         Who fired you?

                                     TOM
                         You did.

               Dorothy laughs, Wynant shamefacedly joins her.

                                     WYNANT
                         Oh, forget it -- forget it.  Here 
                         ...  show this gentleman around...

               Tom beams at Wynant and starts to take his coat and hat 
               off as he speaks to Andrew.

                                     TOM
                         Right this way, sir.

               Andrew follows him out.

               CLOSE SHOT -- WYNANT AND DOROTHY

               She pulls her father down beside her on a bench, or possibly 
               she climbs up on the long work bench -- shoves the acetylene 
               torches to a distance -- and with her arms around him affec- 
               tionately, continues:

                                     DOROTHY
                         Mother's set her heart on a big 
                         church wedding.

                                     WYNANT
                              (parenthetically)
                         Yes, she would.

                                     DOROTHY
                         I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do 
                         it on one condition -- that you're 
                         there to give me away.

                                     WYNANT
                              (chuckling)
                         What would your mother say to that?

                                     DOROTHY
                              (obstinately)
                         This is my wedding.

                                     WYNANT
                         Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing 
                         ...  all of us there ...  your 
                         other and me and your stepfather?

                                     DOROTHY
                              (she evidently has 
                              no love for her 
                              stepfather)
                         He can stay home.  Please, Dad, 
                         won't you?

                                     WYNANT
                              (doubtful)
                         If you think it'll be all right.

               Dorothy jumps down from the bench happily.  She kisses 
               him, delighted to have won him over

                                     WYNANT
                         Wait a minute.  When is it going 
                         to be? I'm leaving town tonight.

                                     DOROTHY (SURPRISED)
                         Where are you going?

                                     WYNANT
                         It's a secret.  I can't even tell 
                         you, my dear.  I've got an important 
                         idea to work on.

                                     DOROTHY
                         A new invention?

                                     WYNANT
                         Yes.
                              (then significantly, 
                              and with measured 
                              tone)
                         And I don't want anybody to steal 
                         it from me.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (disappointed)
                         We were planning to be married 
                         right after Christmas.

                                     WYNANT
                         Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (brightening again)
                         It's a promise?

                                     WYNANT
                         That's one thing I won't forget.
                              (he looks at his 
                              watch)
                         Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be 
                         starting.

               Dorothy takes his watch while he starts to take off his 
               overalls.  There is an odd chain attached to the watch, 
               with links of gold, copper, and silver.  As he slips off 
               the overalls, he speaks to Dorothy without looking at her, 
               trying to keep a casual note in his voice.  CAMERA IS 
               PANNING DURING THE SCENE.

                                     WYNANT
                         How's your brother?

                                     DOROTHY
                              (she looks at her 
                              father 
                              affectionately, 
                              sorry for him)
                         He's all right.

               WE EITHER PAN NOW ON WYNANT, OR GO TO A FULL SHOT -- as he 
               goes to a washstand to clean up a bit.  The basin is on 
               the side of the room.  The washstand could, if desired, be 
               in a small closet, and the following dialogue is played 
               back and forth during this business.

                                     WYNANT
                         I'd like to see him.  Why don't 
                         you bring him down?

                                     DOROTHY
                              (dangling the watch 
                              chain)
                         You know how it is, Dad.  He's 
                         sort of under Mother's thumb.

                                     WYNANT
                              (brushing his hair 
                              a bit)
                         I know -- I know --

                                     DOROTHY
                              (still monkeying 
                              with the watch -- 
                              winding it)
                         You're not missing much.  He's 
                         cuckoo.

               Wynant comes back from the washstand -- CAMERA MOVING UP 
               FOR A CLOSEUP ON THE TWO.

                                     WYNANT
                         Like all the rest of us.
                              (he leans closer to 
                              Dorothy, speaking 
                              humorously)
                         Has this fellow...
                              (he indicates Andrew 
                              with a nod of his 
                              head)
                         ...has he seen the whole family?

                                     DOROTHY
                              (nodding and smiling)
                         And he still wants to marry me!

                                     WYNANT
                         He's a brave man.

               They look off as Andrew enters the shop again.

               MEDIUM SHOT --

               Andrew comes over to them with added interest and 
               admiration.

                                     ANDREW 
                                     (TO WYNANT)
                         I didn't know you invented that 
                         Smelting Process.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (she holds the watch 
                              and chain toward 
                              Andrew)
                         Look -- those are the first metals 
                         that came through.
                              (she indicates the 
                              links in the chain)

               Andrew looks interestedly at them as she dangles the chain 
               before him.  Wynant is feeling his shin bone.  He gives a 
               little grunt of pain.  Dorothy turns sympathetically to 
               him.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Poor Dad, does that still bother 
                         you?

                                     WYNANT
                         Only in bad weather.

                                     DOROTHY
                         But it isn't bad weather now.

                                     WYNANT
                         Better get home before it is.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (kissing Wynant)
                         Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare 
                         forget...  December 30th.

                                     WYNANT
                              (to Andrew, with a 
                              warm friendliness)
                         Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of 
                         Dorothy.  Show her that there is 
                         such a thing as a happy marriage.

                                     ANDREW
                              (sincerely)
                         I'll do my best.

               Dorothy and Andrew start out, saying last goodbye's to 
               Wynant and Tom.  WE TRUCK ON THEM

               AS THEY GO OUT TO:

               STAIRWAY FROM BASEMENT TO FIRST FLOOR - TRUCKING.

                                     ANDREW
                         All settled?
                              (Dorothy nods)
                         Grand!
                              (then, after a second)
                         Why did your mother ever divorce 
                         him?  He's swell.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Wel-l-l, it seems he has a 
                         secretary.

                                     ANDREW
                              ((understanding)
                         Oh.
                              (he turns to Dorothy, 
                              smiling)
                         I'll do my own typing!

               They have reached the top of the stairs now and are in a 
               long and narrow corridor, a service elevator at one end, 
               and a door leading to the street at the other.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (looking to street 
                              ...  it is snowing)
                         Dad's a good barometer...
                              (she sees a taxi 
                              draw up in front 
                              of the building)
                         Quick! -- Here's a cab.

               They exit to street.

               EXTERIOR STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON -- BLIZZARD

               It is a shabby, dreary street with warehouse and a deserted 
               brewery.  There is a driving snow-storm.  Dorothy and Andrew 
               come out as the cab is pulling up at the curb, and with 
               difficulty against the wind and driving sleet, they go 
               forward ready to take it.  The cab door opens and an 
               umbrella comes out and is opened, almost in their faces.  
               The umbrella completely covers the upper part of the man 
               who is carrying it.  He turns to pay the driver.  Dorothy 
               recognizes Macaulay and pulls up the umbrella to speak to 
               him under it.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Hello, there, Mr. Macaulay.

               CLOSEUP AT CURB -- THE GROUP

               Macaulay raises the umbrella, surprised.  He is a fussy 
               little bald-headed man of about forty, wearing glasses.  
               He recognizes Dorothy and beams.

                                     MACAULAY
                         How are you?
                              (then as the snow 
                              pelts down, he 
                              starts to hold his 
                              umbrella over her)
                         Here.  Get under this.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Thanks...  we're taking your cab.

               Dorothy climbs into the cab.  Andy follows her.  She 
               snuggles close against him, cold.

               Macaulay hands the driver a bill.

                                     MACAULAY
                              (to Dorothy)
                         Is your father still in there?

                                     DOROTHY
                         He's waiting for you.

                                     MACAULAY
                         Did he tell you where he was going?

                                     DOROTHY
                         He wouldn't say.

                                     MACAULAY
                         Tch-tch-tch --
                              (shutting the cab 
                              door)
                         Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant.
                              (then speaking to 
                              the driver as the 
                              driver is giving 
                              him his change)
                         You wouldn't drive slowly, so you 
                         don't get a tip.

                                     DRIVER
                              (grinning)
                         That's okay -- I took it!

               He grins again and swings off, leaving Macaulay looking 
               down at the change in his hand, indignant.  THEN WE PAN 
               WITH HIM as he enters the building.

               CORRIDOR FROM BASEMENT -- FULL SHOT.

               Wynant comes up the stairway and starts for the service 
               elevator as Macaulay comes in from outside.  Wynant is now 
               in a business suit, but has no hat or overcoat on.  He 
               doesn't see Macaulay.  He pulls open the door of the service 
               elevator.  Macaulay starts to run toward Wynant with little 
               fast steps, his bulky umbrella hanging from his arm.

                                     MACAULAY
                         Mr. Wynant...  Mr. Wynant!

               Wynant turns, his hand holding open the elevator door.

                                     WYNANT
                         Hello, there! Come on up with me.

               Macaulay follows Wynant into the elevator, panting a little.

               SERVICE ELEVATOR -- WYNANT AND MACAULAY.

               Wynant pushes the button and the elevator starts slowly 
               up.  The elevator shaft is visible through the wooden bars 
               of the elevator.  Wynant stands looking down at Macaulay, 
               amused and friendly.

                                     WYNANT
                         Did you get my money?

                                     MACAULAY
                              (he pulls a wallet 
                              out of his pocket 
                              and takes out a 
                              sheaf of new bills.  
                              He talks plaintively 
                              as he does so)
                         I do wish you'd tell me where you're 
                         going.

                                     WYNANT
                         I'm not telling anyone.

                                     MACAULAY
                              (protesting)
                         But suppose some business comes 
                         up...

                                     WYNANT
                         That's just why I'm going.

               Macaulay starts to count out the bills into Wynant's hand.

                                     MACAULAY
                         One hundred...  two hundred...  
                         three...

                                     WYNANT
                              (takes the sheaf of 
                              bills, impatient)
                         Never mind.

                                     MACAULAY
                         I wish you'd count them.  There's 
                         a thousand dollars there.

                                     WYNANT
                              (stuffing them 
                              carelessly in his 
                              pocket)
                         I trust you.

                                     MACAULAY
                         Isn't there anything else I can do 
                         for you? Have you bought your 
                         ticket?

                                     WYNANT
                         No.

                                     MACAULAY
                              (there is a good-
                              humored gleam in 
                              his eye.  He sees 
                              a chance of finding 
                              out where Wynant 
                              is going)
                         Well, let me do that for you.

                                     WYNANT
                         You might do that.  Get me a ticket 
                         for...
                              (he stops suddenly 
                              as he looks at 
                              Macaulay and sees 
                              the eager look in 
                              his eye -- realizes 
                              that he is about 
                              to give himself 
                              away)
                         No, you don't!

               They smile at each other.  The elevator has reached the 
               third floor by this time.  It stops.  Wynant gets out.

               THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR -- CLOSE AT ELEVATOR.

               Macaulay prepares to follow Wynant, but Wynant closes the 
               door of the elevator, leaving him in it.

                                     WYNANT
                         Thanks, and goodbye.

                                     MACAULAY
                         What'll I do if something comes 
                         up?

                                     WYNANT
                         Settle it yourself.  What have I 
                         got a lawyer for?

                                     MACAULAY
                         Is Julia going with you?

                                     WYNANT
                         No.

               Wynant reaches through the bar of the elevator door and 
               pushes the button inside.  The elevator starts going down 
               during the following dialogue. Macaulay stands inside, 
               bewildered and worried.

                                     MACAULAY
                         But what if you need more money?

                                     WYNANT
                         I left instructions with Julia.  
                         She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.

               Wynant strides out of the scene.  The elevator is beginning 
               to disappear, carrying Macaulay.

                                     MACAULAY
                              (with his face 
                              upturned, he goes 
                              on pleading until 
                              he disappears out 
                              of  sight -- he is 
                              calling up)
                         You don't tell me a thing.  I don't 
                         know where you're going.  I don't 
                         know when you're coming back.  I 
                         don't know how to reach you if any 
                         business turns up...!

               And the elevator goes down out of sight, his voice trailing 
               as it does so.

               WYNANT'S OFFICE -- TRUCKING AND PANNING ON WYNANT --

               As we pick him up leaning down in front of a small safe, 
               opening it.  He is talking to his bookkeeper, Tanner, as 
               he does so.  Tanner is a little man with a quick eye and 
               an eager manner.  He has his hat and coat on preparatory 
               to leaving for the day.  He is closing and locking some 
               cabinets as the scene ensues.

               (Wynant's office is of a solid rather old-fashioned type 
               such as would be found in a building of this kind.  It 
               should, in fact, have windows through which a display room 
               given to machinery can be seen)

                                     WYNANT
                              (as he opens the 
                              safe)
                         My daughter's going to be married, 
                         Tanner.  Nice young man.  She just 
                         brought him.

               Tanner listens preoccupied.  He seems a little nervous 
               about Wynant looking in the safe.

                                     TANNER
                         Well, congratulations.

                                     WYNANT
                              (talking right on)
                         I'm going to give her a wedding 
                         present.  Thought I'd better do it 
                         now, before I forget it.  I can 
                         drop them on my way to...
                              (by this time Wynant 
                              has pulled out a 
                              box and is puzzled 
                              to see it empty)
                         That's funny....
                              (he leans down and 
                              hunts through the 
                              different papers 
                              in the safe.  He 
                              doesn't find what 
                              he wants.  He turns 
                              to Tanner)
                         Where are those bonds?

                                     TANNER
                         Bonds, sir?

                                     WYNANT
                         I know I left them there.

                                     TANNER
                         Maybe Miss Wolf has them.

                                     WYNANT
                              (still worried -- 
                              wonders why Julia 
                              took them)
                         Maybe she has.

                                     TANNER
                              (picking up a baggage 
                              check from the 
                              table)
                         You're forgetting the check for 
                         your suitcase.
                              (Wynant takes it 
                              from him preoccupied)
                         It's at the Grand Central.

                                     WYNANT
                              (still preoccupied)
                         Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right --
                              (he goes out)

               As soon as Wynant goes out, Tanner looks after him.  He 
               seems worried.  He looks apprehensively back toward the 
               safe.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               A RADIO IN A NEW YORK APARTMENT -- CLOSEUP.

               This is Julia Wolf's apartment, a fashionable penthouse 
               furnished in very new modernistic style, but we do not 
               reveal it as we dissolve in.  We are merely HOLDING ON THE 
               RADIO AND A MAN -- JOE MORELLI -- who sits in front of it, 
               in his shirt sleeves. Morelli is a tough looking gangster.  
               He has the radio on.  He is looking at a copy of Vogue.  A 
               woman's voice comes over the scene from off stage.

                                     JULIA'S VOICE
                         How do you want it?

                                     MORELLI
                         Straight.
                              (turning a page of 
                              Vogue -- holding 
                              it up to the light.  
                              Through the 
                              transparent page, 
                              the corsets show 
                              through under the 
                              evening gowns)
                         Do women really wear them things?

               Suddenly there is the sound of a key in the door.  Morelli 
               looks up quickly, his hand going To what we know is his 
               gun, in his hip pocket --

               AS CAMERA PULLS BACK RAPIDLY TO REVEAL:

               FULL SHOT OF THE APARTMENT -- A PENTHOUSE -- PROCESS 
               GLASS.

               WE HOLD FOR A MOMENT as Morelli rises noiselessly and stands 
               there, alert and ready for anyone.  NOW CAMERA SWINGS 
               RAPIDLY OVER TO THE:

               DOOR -- CLOSE SHOT ON WYNANT.

               As he enters, having used his own key.  He still seems 
               occupied, and doesn't see Morelli as he comes through.  
               CAMERA SWINGS RAPIDLY BACK TO:

               CLOSEUP ON MORELLI -- BEFORE THE RADIO.

               He stands there, quietly menacing, his hand on his hip.

                                     MORELLI
                         You're in the wrong place, mister.

                                                                BACK TO:

               FLASH WYNANT -- CLOSEUP.

               Wynant looks off at him, surprised and angry.

                                     WYNANT
                              (sarcastically)
                         Am I?

                                                                BACK TO:

               FLASH MORELLI -- CLOSEUP.

               AS WE PAN HIM FORWARD a few steps.  He gives Wynant a savage 
               double-O.

                                     MORELLI
                         What's on your mind? What do you 
                         want?

                                     JULIA'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Who is it, Joe?

                                     MORELLI
                              (watching Wynant)
                         That's what I want to know.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE APARTMENT.

               As Julia comes into the room, with two drinks in her hand.  
               She is a woman of about thirty.

               She is in very elaborate lounging pajamas, her hair is too 
               well waved, her nails too red, her eyebrows too delicately 
               arched.  But she has the look of a hard businesswoman 
               underneath it all.  She looks disturbed as she sees it is 
               Wynant.

                                     JULIA
                         We're just having a little drink.

                                     WYNANT
                              (dryly)
                         So I see.

               Morelli looks from one to the other.  In Wynant's attitude 
               of displeased proprietorship, he gets his hint of who he 
               is.  he reaches for his coat over the chair and starts to 
               put it on.

                                     JULIA
                              (her eyes still on 
                              Wynant)
                         See you later, Joe.

               Morelli looks from one to the other, and then slowly gets 
               his hat and starts out.

                                     MORELLI
                         Sorry.  I didn't know I was talking 
                         to the boy friend.  S'long.

               He walks carelessly and arrogantly out of the door, slamming 
               it after him.

               CAMERA MOVES IN FOR A CLOSE SHOT OF JULIA AND WYNANT.  She 
               puts the drinks down.  She tries to ignore Wynant's very 
               evident displeasure.

                                     WYNANT
                         Who's that man?

                                     JULIA
                         He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I 
                         used to know.

                                     WYNANT
                         I thought you'd given up that sort 
                         of friend.

                                     JULIA
                         This is the first time I've seen 
                         him in years.  I didn't want him 
                         to think I was high-hatting him.

                                     WYNANT
                         I don't like him.

                                     JULIA
                              (moving over to 
                              him, trying to 
                              conciliate him)
                         Don't worry.  You won't see him 
                         again.
                              (she tries to take 
                              Wynant's coat and 
                              hat)
                         What happened? Did you change your 
                         mind about going?

                                     WYNANT
                         No.  I just came back for a second.  
                         I wanted to get those bonds.

                                     JULIA
                              (she controls her 
                              fear under an air 
                              of ignorance)
                         What bonds?

                                     WYNANT
                         The government bonds.  The ones 
                         you took from the office safe.

                                     JULIA
                              (smoothly lying)
                         Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell 
                         them a long time ago.

                                     WYNANT
                              (in a level tone)
                         I'd never tell you to sell those.  
                         I bought them for my daughter.

                                     JULIA
                         Don't you remember....

                                     WYNANT
                              (interrupting her)
                         Now see here, Julia.  You're 
                         counting a little too much on my 
                         being absent-minded.  You've been 
                         taking a little here and there for 
                         some time, and I haven't said 
                         anything about it.  But this is 
                         fifty thousand dollars!

                                     JULIA
                              (flying into a temper 
                              to try to hide her 
                              guilt)
                         Do you realize that you're accusing 
                         me of ....

                                     WYNANT
                         No one else had the combination of 
                         that safe.  You took them.  What 
                         did you do with them?

                                     JULIA
                              (in a fury)
                         What if I did take them? I'm sick 
                         and tired of seeing you hand out 
                         thousands of dollars to that family 
                         of yours....

                                     WYNANT
                              (cutting in)
                         That's my business.

                                     JULIA
                              (going on without 
                              listening to him)
                         supporting that gang of loafers! 
                         There's not one of them that cares 
                         a damn for you.  A wife who threw 
                         you out the first time your foot 
                         slipped.  They wouldn't raise a 
                         hand to help you.  And I've given 
                         my whole life for you.  If you 
                         kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? 
                         Out in the gutter!
                              (then defiantly)
                         Sure I took those bonds.  Who has 
                         a better right -- ?

               WE HOLD A MOMENT.   There is a slight pause, then Wynant 
               quietly, and unheeding all that she has said, starts for 
               the phone.  WE PAN HIM OVER AND HOLD as he picks up the 
               phone (but not the receiver as yet) and speaks off to Julia:

                                     WYNANT
                              (quietly)
                         I want that money right now, or 
                         I'll hand you over to the police.

                                     JULIA (O.S.)
                              (not believing that 
                              he will do it)
                         Go ahead!

                                     WYNANT
                              (lifts phone from 
                              receiver now -- 
                              still quietly)
                         They'll be pretty rough with 
                         you....with your record.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK, and Julia hurries into the scene.

                                     JULIA
                              (contemptuous)
                         That's a fine thing to throw up to 
                         me after all I've been to you....

                                     WYNANT
                              (in phone)
                         Hello ....  give me ....
                              (Julia grabs the 
                              telephone from 
                              him, in a fury.  
                              She puts it down.  
                              Puts the receiver 
                              in place.  They 
                              stand facing each 
                              other)
                         Well ....  ?

                                     JULIA
                              (in a surly tone)
                         I'll give it back to you ....  all 
                         I've got ....twenty-five thousand...

                                     WYNANT
                              (he takes her by 
                              the wrists, gripping 
                              her hard, trying 
                              to force the truth 
                              from her)
                         You're going to return every cent 
                         of it!

                                     JULIA
                              (flashing again)
                         I can't! I haven't got it!

                                     WYNANT
                              (quickly)
                         What did you do with the rest?

                                     JULIA
                         I never had it.

               THE TELEPHONE RINGS.

                                     WYNANT
                         Then someone was in with you.  Who 
                         was it? -- Who was it?
                              (Julia makes a move 
                              to answer the phone 
                              which rings again 
                              insistently)
                         I'll answer that --
                              (he picks up the 
                              phone)
                         Hello ...  hello ...

                                                                 CUT TO:

               TELEPHONE BOOTH -- PUBLIC PAY STATION.

               A weasel-faced little man, Nunheim, is in the booth at the 
               phone, but as he hears WYNANT'S VOICE say "hello", he very 
               quietly pulls down the hook for the receiver and places 
               the receiver gently on it.  He turns away.

                                                            CUT BACK TO:

               JULIA'S APARTMENT -- CLOSE SHOT AT PHONE AGAIN.

               Wynant is clicking the receiver up and down, as he repeats 
               several times, sharply:

                                     WYNANT
                         Hello ...  hello ...  hello ...  
                         HELLO ....

               Then, evidently hearing the sound of the receiver being 
               replaced, he impatiently puts the telephone down and turns 
               back to Julia.

                                     WYNANT
                         You don't need to tell me.  I have 
                         a pretty good idea.

               And with this WE PAN HIM as he puts on his hat and starts 
               to walk out of the apartment -- with determination and a 
               menacing purpose in his face.

                                     JULIA (O.S.)
                         What are you going to do?

               Wynant turns at the door and smiles - a terrifying smile - 
               and walks out.  The CAMERA SWINGS QUICKLY BACK TO JULIA.  
               She looks after him terrified as we

                                                     CUT OR DISSOLVE TO:

               A STREET AT NIGHT -- LIGHTING EFFECT.

               Wynant strides down the street, his long, lean, narrow 
               form casting a long shadow on the snowy pavement.  THE 
               CAMERA HOLDS IN A RUNNING SHOT ON THE SHADOW as it elongates 
               still further, and finally disappears.

                                                               FADE OUT:

               (NOTE: We should get the above shadow effect through heavy 
               snow, (via reflection of street lamps).  The idea and mood 
               here of the shadow of the "thin man" as it strides rapidly 
               through the night is purposely intended for a necessary 
               effect.)

               FADE IN:

               CLOSEUP OF A CHRISTMAS WREATH.

               The wreath is enormous, and under the conventional greeting: 
               "A MERRY CHRISTMAS", which is in silver across it, there 
               is a current unconventional greeting also in silver, which 
               reads:

                                 (This slogan to come)

               On sound track behind the shot an orchestra is playing 
               gaily.  Possibly an arrangement that Lombardo would make 
               on "JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE BELLS".  There is also the sound 
               of gay chatter and jingles of many cocktail shakers.  NOW 
               CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THE BAR OF A SPEAKEASY, or, to 
               be more up to date, the bar of a Biltmore or a Waldorf 
               Astoria Hotel.  It was against the glass of the bar that 
               the Christmas wreath was first shown.  It is about three 
               o'clock in the afternoon.  Almost all of the people sitting 
               on the high stools in front of the bar are women.  Several 
               bartenders are shaking cocktails.  The music, which, by 
               the way, comes from an adjoining tea dansant room, 
               continues.  There is a holiday air about the whole place.  
               A sophistication and a gaiety belonging to thirsty New 
               York of the present moment.  CAMERA RUNS DOWN THE LINE OF 
               THE BAR AND HOLDS AT THE END, where a bartender is placing 
               two cocktails on a tray held by a waiter.  WE TRUCK ON THE 
               WAITER as he takes the tray into the adjoining room.  The 
               room is quite filled with the afternoon tango crowd, and 
               several couples are dancing on the floor.  WE HOLD as the 
               waiter stops at a small table along the wall.  Dorothy and 
               Andrew are seated there.  Dorothy is looking very glum.

                                     ANDREW
                              (putting his hand 
                              on hers)
                         Cheer up, darling.

                                     DOROTHY
                         I'm sorry.

               Dorothy tries to smile, but it's a dreary attempt.  The 
               waiter puts down the cocktails and leaves.

                                     ANDREW
                              (holds up his glass)
                         Here's to us!

               He drinks his cocktail.  Dorothy takes a sip of hers.  
               Andrew goes on talking, trying to get her out of the 
               doldrums.

                                     ANDREW
                         By this time next year, we'll be 
                         two old married people ...  trimming 
                         the tree ...  hanging up the 
                         stockings for the children ...
                              (then as she looks 
                              up)
                         ...  well, the child, then.

               Dorothy tries to smile, but she is worried, and cannot 
               enter into his fun.  She puts her drink down.

                                     ANDREW
                         What's the matter, darling ...  
                         not sweet enough?

                                     DOROTHY
                              (listlessly)
                         It's all right.

               (NOTE TO VAN: If you want them to get up and join the 
               dancers, it can be done at this point.  After Dorothy says, 
               "It's all right", Andrew says, "Come on, let's dance.  
               I've got to get you out of the dumps somehow" -- and pulls 
               her to her feet.  The following scene continues now, as 
               follows, in a PANNING SHOT OF THEM DANCING.)

                                     ANDREW
                              (leaning forward -- 
                              serious now)
                         Darling, your father's all right.  
                         He'll turn up in time.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (turns to him -- 
                              suddenly distraught)
                         But tonight is Christmas Eve!

                                     ANDREW
                         He's just forgotten.  You know he 
                         forgets everything.

                                     DOROTHY
                         He's never forgotten a promise to 
                         me.  I'm worried about him.  I 
                         know something's happened to him.

               She looks off scene toward the bar.  Suddenly her attention 
               is riveted on someone.

                                     ANDREW
                         What could happen to him, darling?  
                         You mustn't worry....
                              (then as he half 
                              rises, he continues)
                         What is it?

                                     DOROTHY
                         Just a minute...

               She leaves the table -- her eyes still fixed eagerly on 
               the man she has seen.  WE TRUCK AND PAN WITH HER as she 
               goes forward to the bar.  And as she comes in, we see her 
               react eagerly as she confronts a good-looking man of about 
               thirty-five, tall, casual, and worldly wise, who is standing 
               in front of the bar, his face reflected in the mirror.  
               This is NICK CHARLES.

                                     NICK
                              (to the bartender)
                         Another Martini --

                                     DOROTHY
                         Hello, there!

               CLOSEUP AT THE BAR -- NICK AND DOROTHY

               Nick Charles turns to her.  He smiles at her.

               He hasn't the faintest idea who she is, but he's not going 
               to discourage such a pretty girl.

                                     NICK
                              (very cordially)
                         Hello!
                              (then over his 
                              shoulder to the 
                              bartender)
                         Make it two!
                              (then back to Dorothy)
                         How are you?

               Dorothy realizes that he hasn't any remembrance of her.

                                     DOROTHY
                         You know, we know each other.

                                     NICK
                              (heartily)
                         Of course we do! We've been friends 
                         for years.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (inspecting him)
                         Aren't you Nick Charles?

                                     NICK
                              (his face changes.  
                              He realizes that 
                              she does know him)
                         Yes.

                                     DOROTHY
                         You don't remember me.....  I'm 
                         Dorothy Wynant.

               The bartender sets the drinks on the bar before Nick, who 
               looks at Dorothy puzzled, trying to realize that this is 
               the child he used to know.

                                     NICK
                         Not that scrawny little....?
                              (he puts out his 
                              hand as if measuring 
                              a little girl's 
                              height)

                                     DOROTHY
                              (smiling)
                         Yes.

                                     NICK
                         How did you ever remember me?

                                     DOROTHY
                              (intently)
                         was fascinated with you....  a 
                         real live detective....  You used 
                         to tell me the most wonderful 
                         stories.  Were they true?

                                     NICK
                         Probably not.

               Andrew comes up to them.  Dorothy turns to introduce him.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He 
                         worked on a case for father.

                                     NICK
                              (shaking hands with 
                              Andrew)
                         Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill 
                         him.
                              (then to Dorothy)
                         How is your father?

                                     DOROTHY
                         That's what I was going to ask 
                         you.  he's disappeared!

                                     NICK
                         Disappeared!

                                     ANDREW
                              (to Dorothy)
                         Now don't say that -- he's just 
                         off somewhere working.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (to Nick)
                         I can't find him.  I've tried 
                         everything.  I thought you might 
                         know.

                                     NICK
                              (chuckling)
                         I don't know anything -- I've been 
                         in California for four years.  
                         What about his lawyer? Used to be 
                         a guy named Mac-- something.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Macaulay.

                                     NICK
                         That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.

                                     DOROTHY
                         tried him once -

                                     NICK
                         Why don't you try him again?

                                     ANDY
                              (digging in his 
                              pocket)
                         Here's a nickle.

               Andrew gives her a nickle and she goes off.

               Now that she has gone Andrew drops his pretense of 
               minimizing her father's failure to appear.  he steps up 
               close to Nick.

                                     ANDREW
                         She's got me worrying, too.

                                     NICK
                              (easily, as he 
                              reaches for his 
                              cocktail NOTE: 
                              During the entire 
                              play, Nick is always 
                              reaching for a 
                              cocktail!)
                         Don't start worrying about him.  
                         He's a good guy, but screwy.

                                     ANDREW
                              (impressed by what 
                              he has just heard)
                         Why did that man want to kill him?

                                     NICK
                         Said he stole his invention.

                                     ANDREW
                         Do you suppose.....  ?

               The bartender is placing more drinks in front of Nick.

                                     NICK
                              (to Andrew)
                         What?

                                     ANDREW
                              (deciding he is 
                              silly to get so 
                              worried)
                         Nothing.

                                     NICK
                         You better take a drink.

               He hands him one of the cocktails.

               As they start to drink, a commotion is heard offscene ...  
               a dog barking ...  men's voices raised in protestation ... 
               and a a woman's voice above it all.  It is NORA, Nick's 
               wife.

                                     NORA'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Asta! Where are you going? Asta!

               Bartenders, as well as Nick and Andrew, look off toward 
               the commotion.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               ENTRANCE OF THE BAR -- FROM THE CLOAK ROOM OR CORRIDOR.

               NORA CHARLES, Nick's wife, is coming through.  She is a 
               woman of about twenty-six...  a tremendously vital person, 
               interested in everybody and everything, in contrast to 
               Nick's apparent indifference to anything except when he is 
               going to get his next drink.  There is a warm understanding 
               relationship between them.  They are really crazy about 
               each other, but undemonstrative and humorous in their 
               companionship.  They are tolerant, easy-going, taking drink 
               for drink, and battling their way together with a dry humor.  
               Just now Nora has been shopping.  Her arms are full of 
               small packages.  Her hat is askew.  She is pulled along 
               bodily by a small white Sealingham on a leash.  A doorman 
               and a hat-check clerk are following her, protesting at her 
               bringing the dog into this fashionable hotel.  The dog is 
               exitedly barking.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Madame, you can't bring that dog 
                         in here!

                                     NORA
                         I'm not bringing him.  He's bringing 
                         me!
                              (then to the dog)
                         Asta!  Asta!

               But the dog pays no attention.  He pulls her like a streak 
               out of the scene toward the bar.

               Nora's packages are left in a trail behind her as she 
               stumbles after him.  The attendants follow after her, 
               picking up the parcels and protesting vehemently.

                                     ATTENDANTS
                         But Madame...  dogs aren't 
                         allowed.... It isn't only your 
                         dog...  but if we started....
                         Madame, you dropped your package....  
                         etc.

               BAR -- CLOSE SHOT

               As Asta, the dog, rushes in, still with Nora on the other 
               end of the leash.  The dog makes a bee-line for Nick, pulls 
               away and -- ker-plunk! -- he leaps clear up into Nick's 
               arms.  He is barking with delight.  He seems to have a 
               particular desire to lick Nick's nose.  Nora, more 
               dishevelled than ever and breathless, enters, panting.  
               She realizes that this was Asta's objective.

                                     NORA
                         So it's you he was after!

                         He's dragged me into every gin 
                         mill on the block.

                         I thought so.  He even tried to 
                         drag me into the gentlemen's --

                              introduce Andrew)
                         Oh, this is Andy --

               Nora and Andy smile at each other.

                                     NORA
                         How're you, Andy?
                              (hastening to add)
                         I don't usually look this way, but 
                         I've been Christmas shopping.

               One of the attendants who followed Nora comes up.  He hands 
               Nora several of her packages.

                              on the floor. He 
                              speaks to the dog)

                              him, wagging his 
                              tail, but making 
                              no move to obey 
                              him.  Nick speaks

                              fondly up at him, 
                              without obeying)
                         Well then, stand up!
                              (then triumphantly 
                              to Joe)
                         See?

               The attendant laughs and moves off.

               Dorothy comes toward them from the telephone booth.  She 
               seems a little more cheerful.  Andrew watches her anxiously.

                                     ANDREW
                         Any luck?

                         see him.

               Nick realizes that Dorothy and his wife have not met.  He 
               makes the introduction very casually, waving his hand to 
               indicate Nora.

               The two women smile in acknowledgment.  Nora looks at 
               Dorothy with warm interest.

                                     DOROTHY

                         to rush.

               CLOSEUP OF AN ICE BAG.

               Nick's hands are screwing the cover on the ice bag.  CAMERA 
               PULLS BACK TO reveal him in the bathroom of his suite at 
               the Normandie.  He has just filled the bag from the wash 
               basin which is full of ice.  THE CAMERA TRUCKS with him as 
               he goes into the bedroom and over to the bed.

               CLOSE UP OF ASTA.

               He is sitting on the foot of the bed, his head cocked, 
               looking anxiously at Nora at the other side of the bed.

               CLOSE SHOT - AT BED.

               Nora is lying on the bed, dressed as we saw her in the 
               last scene, except for her hat.

               Nick comes in and puts the ice bag on her head.  Nora opens 
               her eyes and speaks feebly to Nick.

               Asta, delighted that Nora is all right, rushes to her, and 
               licks her face.

               The doorbell of the apartment rings.  Nick starts into the 
               next room.  Nora looks off perturbed.  She doesn't feel up 
               to visitors.

               LIVING ROOM OF SUITE - (SKYLINE THROUGH WINDOWS)

               In one corner of the living room is an enormous Christmas 
               tree, without any ornaments on it.  The room is a mass of 
               boxes and excelsior.  Nick comes from the bedroom and opens 
               the outer room.  Macaulay stands outside, his eyes blinking 
               behind their glasses, in friendly welcome.  CAMERA MOVES 
               UP FOR CLOSE SHOT ON THE TWO.

                                     MACAULAY
                         I see.  I see.

                                     NICK
                              (coming over to him)
                         What's all the fuss about? Is he 
                         in hiding?

                                     MACAULAY
                         You know as much about it as I do.  
                         I haven't seen him in three months.

                                     NICK
                         No word at all?

                                     MACAULAY
                         He sends word through Julia Wolf 
                         when he wants money...  I give it 
                         to her and she gives it to him.

               The telephone rings.  Nick goes over to it, speaking to 
               Macaulay as he goes.

                                     NICK
                         So that's still on?
                              (he picks up the 
                              phone)

                                     NORA'S VOICE (O.S.)

                              in the next room)
                         Hello....  just a minute.

               Nick, who has listened on the phone, holds it out toward 
               Macaulay.

                                     NICK
                         It's for you.
                              (Macaulay gets up 
                              and starts for the 
                              phone)
                         Your office.

               Macaulay takes the telephone.  Nora appears in the doorway 
               to the bedroom.  She has a box of Christmas tree ornaments 
               in her hand.  The ice bag is tied on her head, slightly 
               askew.

               She is followed by Asta.

                         Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the 
                         house?
                              (she looks over and 
                              sees Macaulay at 
                              the phone)
                         Oh, it's you.

                              (into the telephone)
                         Yes?

               Then he turns to Nora.  In his desire to be polite, he 
               almost misses both the introduction to Nora, and his 
               telephone call.

                         How do you do?
                              (he turns hastily 
                              back to the 
                              telephone. Nora 
                              walks out of the 
                              scene, toward the 
                              Xmas tree)
                         What did you say?....  He is?....  
                         Where is he?  Very well.
                              (he hangs up and 
                              turns to Nick)
                         He's back in town....
                              (then as Nick looks 
                              mystified, he adds:)
                         Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting 
                         for me now.
                              (then realizing 
                              that Nora doesn't 
                              know what he is 
                              talking about)
                         Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but 
                         I've been so upset.  It's no joke 
                         working for a man like that.  I 
                         must be off.
                              (he starts for the 
                              door, which Nick 
                              opens for him)
                         Goodbye....  Goodbye,

                         S'long.

               Macaulay shuts the door after him only to open it again.

                                     MACAULAY
                              (sticking his head 
                              in)
                         Merry Christmas!

               He shuts the door again.

               During the above, Nora has started to decorate the tree.  
               She is standing on a chair, a couple of Xmas ornaments in 
               her hand, reaching toward the top or the tree.

                         once more, I'll kill 'em.

               Nick starts to the telephone directory.

                              directory for a 
                              number)
                         At least she'll be glad to know 
                         he's alive.

               Asta is sniffing around the bottom of the tree.

               CLOSE SHOT OF NORA.

               She has two different ornaments in her hand, trying to 
               decide which to put on the top of the tree.

                              indignantly)

               MEDIUM SHOT - JORGENSEN APARTMENT.

               Mimi Jorgensen, formerly Mrs. Clyde Wynant, is at the phone.  
               She is a slightly faded, but still very pretty woman of 
               about forty-one or two.  She is utterly feminine, with 
               bright, little ways of talking and moving.  She distrusts 
               all women, even her daughter Dorothy, and treats all men 
               with a flirtatious condescension, as if they were children.  
               The only thing she really has any emotion about is her 
               present husband, who she adores.  She is terrified that he 
               will leave her, knowing, although she won't admit it, that 
               he married her for her money.

               The living room of her expensive apartment reflects her 
               personality.  It is a modernized Victorian, full or 
               alabaster lamps, curved soft chairs and gleaming satin.

               Mimi is answering the telephone.  Dorothy stands in the 
               doorway, listening to her mother as she takes off her hat 
               and coat.  She is dressed in the same clothes in which we 
               saw her at the hotel.

                                     MIMI
                              (as she hears that 
                              it is Nick Charles, 
                              her voice takes on 
                              a flirtatious note)
                         How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. 
                         Jorgensen now....
                              (she sees Dorothy 
                              out of the corner 
                              of her eye, but 
                              pretends that she 
                              doesn't know she 
                              is there)
                         No, she isn't here.
                              (Dorothy moves toward 
                              the telephone)
                         Is it about her father?  Well, can 
                         I take the message?

                                     DOROTHY
                              (taking the phone 
                              from her mother)
                         Give it to me.

                                     MIMI
                              (into the phone, 
                              pretending surprise)
                         Oh, here she is.

               Reluctantly she gives the phone to Dorothy.

               She stands close to Dorothy, trying to hear the 
               conversation.

                                                                BACK TO:

                              (her face lights up 
                              with relief)
                         Oh, thank heaven.

                              Dorothy)
                         What is it? Has he found him?

                                     DOROTHY
                              (into the phone, 
                              not paying attention 
                              to her mother)
                         Do you know where he's living?
                              (for a moment she 
                              cannot help but 
                              feel hurt)
                         Oh....
                              (then she realizes 
                              how selfish her 
                              feeling is)
                         Well, at least I'm glad he's all 
                         right.  Thank you for calling.  
                         Goodbye.

               She hangs up.  Mimi eagerly questions her,

                                     MIMI
                         What is it?

                                     DOROTHY
                         Nothing.

               Gilbert comes into the room.  He is a boy of about seventeen 
               or eighteen.  He wears spectacles.  He is slight in build.  
               The two women don't notice him.

                                     MIMI
                         That isn't true.  It was about 
                         your father.  Where is he?

                                     DOROTHY
                         He's all right.  Isn't that enough?

                                     MIMI
                         No.

                                     DOROTHY
                         You just want money -- and you 
                         haven't any right to any more.  He 
                         made a big settlement on you.

                                     MIMI
                         That's gone long ago.  I've got to 
                         see him.  Where is he?

                                     DOROTHY
                         I won't have you hounding him any 
                         more for money.

                         for?

                                     MIMI
                              (to Gilbert, who is 
                              evidently her 
                              favorite of the 
                              two children)
                         What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! 
                         What did he say?

                                     GILBERT
                         He said that father's in town.  
                         He's been seeing Julia right along.

                                     MIMI (BITTERLY)
                         That woman!

                                     GILBERT
                         She could tell you where father 
                         is.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Mother ....  you couldn't do that.  
                         You couldn't go to her.

                                     MIMI
                         I didn't say I would.  But we've 
                         got to have money.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Did it ever occur to you that Chris 
                         might work?

                                     MIMI
                              (looking fearfully 
                              off scene)
                         Shush!

               CAMERA SWINGS RAPIDLY OVER TO:

               BACK OF A SOFA

               BIG CLOSEUP

               From the sofa a man rises with languid dignity.  It is 
               Chris Jorgensen.  He is younger than Mimi.  A very handsome 
               man, but one whom you could know at first sight that you 
               could not trust.

                                     MIMI'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Chris!

               Chris Jorgensen pays no attention to Mimi.  He throws 
               Dorothy a deadly glance and walks with hurt dignity out of 
               the room, carrying the newspaper he has been reading.  
               CAMERA PULLS BACK FOR THE GROUP AGAIN:

               DOROTHY, MIMI AND GILBERT

               Mimi looks after Jorgensen, fearfully.  She turns to 
               Dorothy.

                                     MIMI
                              (sharply)
                         You've hurt his feelings!

               She hurries out of the room after Jorgensen.  Dorothy looks 
               after them, disgusted.  Gilbert watches Dorothy with 
               detached, scientific interest.

                                     GILBERT
                         You know, you have an Oedipus 
                         complex and you won't admit it.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (this is the last 
                              straw)
                         Oh, please, Gilbert!

               She starts out of the room but Gilbert continues to talk 
               to her, although she is not paying any attention.

                                     GILBERT
                         The trouble with you is that you 
                         won't face facts.  I know I have a 
                         mother fixation...  but it's 
                         slight......  it hasn't yet reached 
                         the point of...

                                     DOROTHY
                         Oh stop it!  Stop it!

               Dorothy walks out.  Gilbert looks after her, bewildered by 
               her lack or scientific interest.

               JORGENSEN'S BEDROOM - MEDIUM

               Jorgensen is standing in front of the mirror, adjusting 
               his tie.  Mimi comes in, very much perturbed.  She goes to 
               him affectionately.

               Jorgensen realizes his power over her and uses it.

                                     MIMI
                         Don't mind what she says, Chris.

                                     JORGENSEN
                         How can I help but mind? I'm 
                         constantly humiliated...  just 
                         because I haven't money.

                                     MIMI
                              (eagerly)
                         I'll get some.

                                     JORGENSEN
                         You've said that for weeks.

                                     MIMI
                         I know.

                                     JORGENSEN
                         Why don't you go to see Julia?  
                         She handles his money.

                                     MIMI
                              (protesting)
                         Chris!

                                     JORGENSEN
                         All right.  All right.

                                     MIMI
                         I couldn't go near that woman.

                                     JORGENSEN
                         I said all right!

               He picks up his hat and coat from a chair.

               Mimi watches him anxiously.

                                     MIMI
                         What are you going to do?

                                     JORGENSEN
                              (easily)
                         Just what I said I'd do.

                                     MIMI
                              (in a panic, she 
                              pleads)
                         You wouldn't do that...  you 
                         wouldn't!

                                     JORGENSEN
                              (coldly - quietly)
                         Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.

                                     MIMI (ALMOST CRYING)
                         Chris -- Chris -- !

               But Jorgensen walks out.

               OUTSIDE JORGENSEN'S DOOR - HALL.

               Jorgensen strides out of the door and down the hall.  Mimi 
               comes to the door.

                                     MIMI
                         Chris!

               But Chris pays no attention.  Mimi, distraught, goes back 
               into his room.  As she closes the door, we see Gilbert 
               come out from behind the open door, where he has been 
               listening.

               JORGENSEN'S ROOM AGAIN.

               Mimi stands irresolute for a minute, then goes to the 
               telephone and dials a number.

                                     MIMI
                              (on telephone)
                         Miss Wolfe?  Well this is Mrs. 
                         Jorgensen...  I wonder if I may 
                         see you?

                                                                 CUT TO:

               JULIA'S APARTMENT - CLOSEUP AT PHONE

               Julia is evidently very much startled by Mrs.  Jorgensen's 
               calling her.

                                     JULIA
                              (hesitatingly)
                         Why yes ....  yes.....

               She puts down the telephone, thinking hard, worried by the 
               idea or Mrs. Jorgensen's impending visit.  Suddenly she 
               makes up her mind and hastily dials a number.

                                                                BACK TO:

               MIMI'S LIVING ROOM

               Mimi gets up from the telephone.  There is a look of grim 
               determination on her face.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               DESK OF JULIA WOLFE'S APARTMENT HOUSE.

               There is a clerk, standing behind the desk, and a telephone 
               operator at a small switchboard.

               Mimi is standing in front of the desk.

                                     MIMI
                         What is Miss Wolfe's apartment 
                         number?

                                     CLERK
                         Nine A.

               Mimi turns and walks across the lobby.  The CAMERA TRUCKS 
               with her.  As she goes toward the elevator, Albert Nunheim 
               is seen coming down the last steps of the stairs, out of 
               her sight.  He is a weasel-faced, little man with a long 
               nose, weak mouth, and a shifty look in his eye.  The clerk's 
               voice comes over the SOUND TRACK calling after Mimi.

                                     CLERK'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Who shall I say?

               CLOSEUP OF NUNHEIM ON STAIRS.

                                     MIMI'S VOICE (O.S.)
                              (shortly)
                         Miss Wolf expects me.

               As Mimi says "Miss Wolfe", Nunheim stiffens and pulls back 
               against the wall.  He waits there until he hears the sound 
               of the elevator door closing.

               He is evidently terrified by something that he has seen.  
               He waits to be sure that Mimi has gone up in the elevator 
               and then, with a furtive glance at the desk, CAMERA PULLS 
               BACK AND PANS WITH HIM as he sneaks out and down the stairs 
               on the other side of the elevator shaft leading down to 
               the basement.

               NINTH FLOOR OF THE APARTMENT HOUSE - TRUCKING SHOT

               Mimi gets out of the elevator and goes to the door of the 
               apartment 9-A across the hall.  She rings the doorbell.  
               There is no response.  She rings again, a lock or grim 
               determination on her face.

               EXT.  OF BASEMENT ENTRANCE OF APT.  HOUSE

               Nunheim comes out of the entrance, looks furtively up and 
               down the street.  He takes out a cigarette, lights it, and 
               then, with a pretense of being casual, walks off down the 
               street.

                                                                BACK TO:

               EXT.  OF DOOR OF APT.  9-A

               Getting no response to her ringing, Mimi is knocking on 
               the door.  She is furious with Julia for not letting her 
               in.  Still getting no answer, she tries the door.  She is 
               surprised to find it is open.  She looks up and down the 
               hall and then decides to investigate.  She walks in.

               LIVING ROOM OF JULIA'S APT.  -

               TRUCKING AND PANNING;

               Mimi comes into the room.  She shuts the door slowly behind 
               her.  She looks curiously around the room, interested to 
               see what kind of a place her ex-husband has furnished for 
               Julia.

               Seeing no one in the room, she goes through it toward the 
               bedroom.  As she gets to the door and looks curiously in, 
               she stiffens and screams.

               JULIA'S BEDROOM - FROM MIMI'S ANGLE

               On the floor of the ornate bedroom, Julia Wolfe's dead 
               body lies, stretched out.  She has been shot.  She is 
               dressed as she was when she answered Mimi's telephone call.

                                                                BACK TO:

               REVERSE CLOSEUP - MIMI IN DOORWAY

               For a minute, Mimi stands in the doorway looking down at 
               the body, rooted to the spot with horror.  Then she looks 
               around for the telephone, sees it beside the bed, and rushes 
               to it, CAMERA PANNING.

                                     MIMI
                              (telephoning)
                         Quick! Quick! Send somebody up 
                         here right away.  Something terrible 
                         has happened!

               She replaces the receiver.  For a second, she stands still, 
               her back to the body.  But her curiosity finally overcomes 
               her terror, and she goes slowly back toward the body.

               She stands looking down at Julia, a million speculations 
               and suspicions going through her mind.  Suddenly her eye 
               fastens on something in the dead woman's outflung hand. 
               Her eyes widen with horror.  She makes up her mind to take 
               the object, which we do not see. Looking around quickly to 
               see if no one has come in, she reaches down, takes it from 
               the girl's hand, and stuffs it in her hand bag.  She 
               straightens up, CAMERA PANNING QUICKLY UP FOR:

               CLOSEUP OF MIMI.

               She stands clutching her bag, her eyes wide with horror at 
               the realization of what that piece of evidence means.  She 
               is trying to formulate a plan of action as we:

                                                          SLIDE OVER TO:

               HOMICIDE BUREAU - POLICE HEADQUARTERS.

               Several officers are sitting around talking.

                         The way these dames get by with

               The telephone rings.  Another officer answers the telephone.

                              (sitting up)
                         That's me.

                                     2ND OFFICER (O.S.)
                              (He replaces the 
                              receiver and turns 
                              to the other officer)
                         Here you are.

               He gives the officer the paper.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                         What is it?

                                     2ND OFFICER
                         A dame -- murdered.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                         That's more like it.

               The 1st officer goes quickly out.

               MACAULAY'S LAW OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT.

               Macaulay is sitting at a flat desk, with some papers in 
               front of him.  A stenographer is taking dictation.  The 
               inter-office communicator buzzes.  Macaulay leans over 
               pulls the switch and listens.  A girl's voice comes over 
               the communicator.

                                     GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)

               With a puzzled frown, Macaulay picks up the phone.

                         right over.

               He gets up.

               SPEAKEASY - CLOSE SHOT OF NUNHEIM AND MARIAN.

               They are in a booth at a speakeasy.  Marian is a big-boned, 
               full-fleshed, red-haired woman of about twenty-eight, 
               handsome in a rather brutal, sloppy way.  Nunheim has a 
               satisfied smile on his face.

                         Where you been?

               A waiter comes and puts two beers in front of them.  He 
               stands waiting to be paid.

                                     NUNHEIM

                         I haven't got it yet.

               Marian gives him a dirty look and takes a quarter out of 
               her purse and throws it down to pay the waiter for the 
               beers.

               HALL - OUTSIDE JULIA'S APARTMENT

               Two old wispy cleaning women in aprons with pass keys on 
               thin belts are standing talking with their heads together 
               outside of Julia's apartment.

                                     1ST CLEANING WOMAN
                              (almost whispering)
                         What're you goin' to tell 'em?

                              with a dust cloth)
                         I guess you got to tell 'em 
                         everything.

                         fight a while ago.

               A police officer comes to the door of the apartment.  He 
               beckons to them.

                         All right, girls.

               Without realizing the humor of the "girls", they start in.

               STUDSY'S CABARET - FULL SHOT.

               It is in a flashy Broadway cabaret.  On the dance floor 
               about ten girls in practice clothes are rehearsing a new 
               routine.  A man is mechanically playing the piano for them.  
               Several waiters are decorating the room with greens and 
               Christmas wreaths.  It is late afternoon, and the place 
               has no customers in it.  The chairs are piled on the tables.  
               Morelli is sitting at a table.  The waiter is placing a 
               bottle of Scotch and a glass before him.  Studsy comes up 
               to the table.  Studsy is a powerfully built man of about 
               fifty who looks forty.  He is a little fat now, but not 
               soft.  Morelli looks up as he comes to the table.  CAMERA 
               MOVES UP FOR CLOSE SHOT ON THEM.

                                     MORELLI
                         How'yer, Studsy.

               He starts to pour a drink.

                                     STUDSY
                              (looking at Morelli 
                              very closely)
                         Diden you know Julia Wolfe?

                                     MORELLI
                              (a guarded tone in 
                              his voice)
                         Yeah.

                                     STUDSY
                         Somebody just bumped her off  I 
                         thought you'd like to know.

               Studsy walks away.  Morelli slowly drinks his liquor, his 
               eyes fixed on space, thinking hard.

               JULIA'S BEDROOM AGAIN - MEDIUM SHOT.

               The Medical Examiner, Dr. Walton, is leaning over Julia's 
               body.  An officer is sitting in front of Julia's desk, 
               looking through her papers and letters and throwing them 
               to one side as he reads them.  John Guild, a burly, laconic, 
               Special Investigator is in charge of the investigation.  
               He is questioning Macaulay, who is sitting facing him.

                                     GUILD
                         When was the last time you gave 
                         her money for Wynant?

                                     MACAULAY
                         Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand 
                         dollars.

                                     GUILD
                              (calling over his 
                              shoulder to the 
                              other officer at 
                              the desk)
                         Seen any signs of it, Bill?

                                     BILL
                         Nope.

                                     MACAULAY
                              (helpfully)
                         Perhaps it was a robbery.

                                     GUILD
                         And her with that sparkler on her 
                         hand, and thirty dollars in her 
                         purse?  Looks to me like our friend 
                         Wynant came to collect and ran 
                         into a little trouble.

                                     BILL
                         They say downstairs they haven't 
                         seen him in three months.

                                     GUILD
                              (sarcastically)
                         There's a lot of things they don't 
                         see in this place.
                              (he turns back to 
                              Macaulay)
                         And you say you haven't seen him 
                         or heard from him in that time?

                              (meticulously honest)
                         I said he hadn't written me.

                                     GUILD
                         Oh, then you did hear from him?

                                     MACAULAY

                              tell something 
                              which seems to 
                              incriminate Wynant)

                         He telephoned me today.

                              eagerly)
                         He did!

                                     MACAULAY
                         I wasn't in.  My secretary took 
                         the message.  He left word for me 
                         to meet him at the Plaza.

                                     GUILD
                         When was that?

                                     MACAULAY
                         About three.

                         Yes.  But he didn't show up.

               An officer comes from the living room.

                                     OFFICER
                              (to Guild)
                         His house and his shop is closed.  
                         And he ain't at any hotel.

                                     GUILD
                              (sarcastically)
                         You're not going to stop at that, 
                         are you?

                                     OFFICER
                              (sullenly)
                         No, sir.

               The officer goes out again.  Guild turns back to Macaulay.

                                     MACAULAY

                              Wynant)
                         I know he'll turn up as soon as he 
                         sees this in the papers.  You can't 
                         think he had anything to do with 
                         it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind 
                         of man that....

                         Do you know what they fought about 
                         that night he went away?

                                     MACAULAY
                              (frowning as he 
                              realizes that this 
                              sounds bad)
                         I didn't know they had a fight.

                         we need you again.

               Macaulay gets up to go.

               CLOSEUP - MEDICAL EXAMINER

               He is leaning over Julia's body.

                         Mr. Guild, here's something very 
                         interesting...

               As Guild walks into the shot, we:

               MEDIUM SHOT - JORGENSEN'S LIVING ROOM.

               Mimi is in the midst of telling her experience.

               Gilbert, Dorothy and Jorgensen are listening.

               Mimi still has her hat and coat on.  She has just come in.  
               She is seated, on the edge of her chair, enjoying the 
               recital.  Jorgensen stands at the window.

                                     MIMI
                         and there she was lying dead.  The 
                         police said she'd probably been 
                         killed about ten minutes before I 
                         got there.

                                     JORGENSEN
                              (turning around - 
                              speaking with quiet 
                              anger)
                         I thought you said you weren't 
                         going there.

                                     MIMI
                              (flustered)
                         Why, you said...

                                     JORGENSEN
                              (sharply interrupting)
                         Never mind.

                                     GILBERT
                              (who is tremendously 
                              interested)
                         Did they find any clues...  a gun 
                         or fingerprints or anything?

                                     MIMI
                              (very glibly -  
                              remembering what 
                              she has in her 
                              purse)
                         Not a thing.

                                     GILBERT
                         Was there much blood?

                                     DOROTHY
                              (distressed)
                         Don't.  It's horrible.

                                     MIMI
                         Nonsense! She got at she deserved.

                                     GILBERT
                              (to Mimi, not 
                              accusingly, but 
                              with scientific 
                              detached interest)
                         Did you kill her?

                         Gilbert!

                                     GILBERT
                         Why not? You had a perfectly good 
                         motive.

                                     MIMI
                         I hope you won't talk that way to 
                         the police when they come here.

               CLOSEUP OF JORGENSEN.

               There is a guarded look of terror in his eyes.

                                     JORGENSEN
                         The police.  I thought you said 
                         they'd finished with you.

                                     MIMI'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         They said they'd finished for the 
                         present.

               The thought that the police might come to the apartment 
               increases his fear.

               MEDIUM SHOT INCLUDING MIMI, DOROTHY AND GILBERT.

               Mimi is watching Jorgensen anxiously.

                                     GILBERT
                         Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at 
                         the Public Library.
                              (To Jorgensen)
                         Where were you?

                                     MIMI
                              (hastily, with her 
                              eyes still on 
                              Jorgensen)
                         Children, will you go into the 
                         next room? I want to talk to Chris 
                         alone.

               At that minute the front door bell rings.

               Mimi looks toward the door, wondering who it is.

                                     GILBERT
                              (going out to answer 
                              the ring)
                         I'll go.

                                     JORGENSEN
                         I'll be in my room.

               He goes quickly out.

               HALLWAY OUTSIDE JORGENSEN APARTMENT.

               Guild and Bill are standing outside the door of the 
               Jorgensen's apartment.  Gilbert opens the door of the 
               apartment.

                                     GUILD
                         Is Mrs. Jorgensen in?

                                     GILBERT
                              (delighted to see 
                              then)
                         Yes, come right in!

               The two officers go in and the door closes behind them.  
               From a door beyond, the service door of the apartment, 
               Jorgensen comes out, putting on his hat and coat as he 
               comes.  He doesn't wait for the elevator but starts down 
               the stairs.

               LIVING ROOM - JORGENSEN'S APARTMENT

               Guild is seated uncomfortably on one of Mimi's delicate 
               chairs, opposite Mimi.  Gilbert is standing, listening 
               eagerly.  Dorothy sits nearby, her mind deeply occupied.

               Mimi is a little frightened, but she hides it under a 
               pretense of wanting to do all she can to help.  Dorothy 
               sits listening.

                              (as scene picks up)
                         There are a few things we want to 
                         check up on.

                                     MIMI
                         I see.

                         You say you were in the room with 
                         the body from the time you 
                         discovered it 'til we came?

                                     MIMI
                         Why yes.

                                     GUILD
                         Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's 
                         hand?

                                     MIMI
                         No.

                                     GUILD
                         Are you sure you didn't leave the 
                         room...  that one of the bellhops 
                         or maids might not have been in 
                         there alone?

                                     MIMI
                              (grabbing at the 
                              opening he has 
                              given her)
                         I don't think so.  Of course I was 
                         terribly upset...  I hardly knew 
                         what I was doing.

                                     GUILD
                         The Medical Examiner seems to think 
                         that the body was touched.  He 
                         says it looks as if the girl's 
                         hand had been forced open after 
                         she was killed....

               CLOSEUP OF DOROTHY

               She is listening intently.

                                     GUILD'S VOICE (O.S.)
                              (Continued)
                         And we just found out she had a 
                         thousand dollars the night before.

               Dorothy looks toward her Mother, her eyes wide with horror.

                                     MIMI'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I'm sorry I can't help you.

                                                                BACK TO:

               MEDIUM  SHOT OF GROUP

               Guild rises and starts for the door.  Bill turns to follow 
               him.

                                     GUILD
                         That's all right.
                              (slight pause -- 
                              His eyes swiftly 
                              scrutinize the 
                              group)
                         Well, we'll be going.

                                     MIMI
                              (tonelessly)
                         Goodbye.

                              (dryly)
                         Goodbye.

               Guild and the officer go out.

               HALLWAY OUTSIDE JORGENSEN APARTMENT

               Guild and Bill come out, followed by Gilbert. 
               Guild goes to the elevator and rings the bell.

                                     GILBERT
                         Could I go down and see the body? 
                         I've never seen a dead body.

                                     GUILD
                              (for a minute he is 
                              curious, thinking 
                              there may be some 
                              reason)
                         Why do you want to?

                              (very serious)
                         I've been studying psychopathic 
                         criminology.  I have a theory.  
                         Perhaps this as the work of a sadist 
                         or a paranoiac.  If I saw it, I 
                         might be able to tell.

               The elevator comes up.

                                     GUILD
                              (pretending to be 
                              as serious as 
                              Gilbert)
                         That's a good idea.  But don't you 
                         bother to come down.  We'll bring 
                         the body right up here.
                              (he gets into the 
                              elevator)
                         Come on, Bill.

               They leave Gilbert, uncertain whether he is being kidded 
               or whether they mean it.

               MIMI'S BEDROOM - PANNING SHOT

               The door is closed behind her.  She goes to a small wall 
               safe and opens it.  Then she opens her bag and is about to 
               put the thing she took from Julia's hand wrapped in a 
               handkerchief, into the safe, when she is startled by 
               Dorothy's voice.

                                     DOROTHY'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         What have you got there?

                                     MIMI
                              (she turns in the 
                              direction of 
                              Dorothy's voice)
                         None of your business.

               Dorothy comes up to her mother and speaks accusingly.

                                     DOROTHY
                         You took that money from Julia's 
                         hand.

                                     MIMI
                         I didn't.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Then what are you hiding?

                                     MIMI
                              (with malicious 
                              relish)
                         It's a piece of evidence that's 
                         worth a great deal more than that.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (with bitter contempt 
                              for her other)
                         You hand that over to the police.

                         I'll do nothing of the sort.

                                     DOROTHY
                         All right, then.  I'll tell them.

                         I don't think you will.  It's your 
                         father's.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (shocked)
                         I don't believe it! You're lying!

                                     MIMI
                              (viciously pleased 
                              at breaking 
                              Dorothy's faith in 
                              her father)
                         There!

               She holds out the broken end of the watch chain that we 
               saw Wynant carry, wrapped in a handkerchief which is spotted 
               with blood.  Dorothy looks at it, and recognizes it with 
               horror.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (covering her face)
                         Oh!

                                     MIMI
                              (triumphantly)
                         Now do you believe me!

                                                       FAST DISSOLVE TO:

               LIVING ROOM - NICK'S APARTMENT.

               It is eight o'clock the same night...  about two hours 
               later.

               There is a party in full swing.  It is an odd assortment 
               of people.  There is a police captain there, a reminder of 
               Nick's old life.  A little prizefight manager with a big 
               fighter in tow.  Quinn, a dissipated looking man of about 
               thirty-five, and his wife, a rather faded woman of about 
               thirty-two, very jealous of Friend Husband.  Quinn is a 
               broker, and the only one in evening clothes.  Then there 
               is Foster, a big fat man, who sits near the radio, a glass 
               in his hand.  With every sip, he grows more sentimental, 
               as he listens to the program of Christmas carols that are 
               coming over the radio.  There is an improvised bar with 
               everything in the way of liquors and necessary 
               accompaniments on it.  Nick is moving among the people, 
               seeing that they are served.  Nick goes over to Mrs. Quinn, 
               giving her one of the drinks he is carrying.  Mrs. Quinn 
               is looking around rather fearfully at the curious assortment 
               of people in the room.

                                     NICK
                              (giving her a drink)
                         How are you doing?

                                     MRS. QUINN
                              (looking around 
                              disapprovingly)
                         Who are they, Nick?

                                     NICK
                              (easily)
                         All my old friends.

               He smiles and passes on to another group.  Among them is a 
               very rough looking man with a battered face.  He turns to 
               grin at Nick showing a mouth with several teeth missing.

                                     THE MAN
                         Hey, Nick.  I think your wife's 
                         great.

                                     NICK
                         Thanks.  I wanted you to see her...  
                         and I wanted her to see you.

               Nick goes on to speak to the Police Captain who is standing 
               talking to a very distinguished looking woman, in evening 
               clothes.

                                     POLICE CAPTAIN
                              (to Nick)
                         It's like old times, Nick.  Remember 
                         the fun we used to have when we 
                         were both flat broke?

                                     NICK
                         Do I!

                                     POLICE CAPTAIN
                              (with a sentimental 
                              sigh)
                         Those were the good old days.

                                     NICK
                         Don't kid yourself.  These are the 
                         good old days.

               Nick goes on his way to another group.

               The CAMERA PANS OVER TO NORA at the door.

               She opens it to admit Face Peppler.  He is a tough-looking 
               ex-convict.  He looks eagerly around the room.

                                     PEPPLER
                         Nick Charles here?

                                     NORA
                         Yes.
                              (calling Nick)
                         Nick!

                                     PEPPLER
                         You his wife?

                                     NORA
                         Yes.

                                     PEPPLER
                              (giving her an 
                              approving pat on 
                              the posterior)
                         He's a good guy.
                              (his eyes are eagerly 
                              searching the room 
                              for Nick)
                         He sent me up the river once.
                              (he sees Nick coming 
                              toward him, and 
                              with the greatest 
                              good will and 
                              enthusiasm, he 
                              greets him)
                         Hey, Nick!

                                     NICK
                         Hello, Face!

               Peppler It's a long time I don't see you.

                                     NICK
                         A long time.

                                     PEPPLER
                         Well, I needed the rest.

                                     NORA
                              (to Peppler - 
                              indicating Nick)
                         Was he a good detective?

                                     PEPPLER
                         I wouldn't know.  That time he 
                         caught me was a accident.  I led 
                         with my right.

                                     NICK
                              (laughing)
                         Come on.  Have a drink.

               He takes Peppler by the arm out of the scene as WE PAN 
               NORA TO THE TELEPHONE.  She picks up the receiver, her 
               eyes on the odd mixture of people assembled.

                                     NORA
                              (in phone - 
                              philosophically)
                         Don't bother to announce any more.  
                         Just send anybody right up.
                              (then as the clerk 
                              evidently tries to 
                              protect her)
                         I know.  But it's all right.  
                         They're his friends,

               TABLE - CLOSE SHOT

               Nick is pouring a drink for Face.  The little prizefight 
               manager comes up to him with a great hulk of a fighter in 
               tow.  (The contrast in sizes is amusing.)

                                     MANAGER
                         Like to buy a piece of this pug, 
                         Nick? I'll sell you twenty-five 
                         percent of him for five grand.

                                     NICK
                         Is he good?

                                     MANAGER
                         He's been knocking 'em cold.  He 
                         ain't afraid of nobody.
                              (the fighter reaches 
                              for a drink.  The 
                              manager turns on 
                              him fiercely)
                         Drop that, or I'll slug you.

               The fighter, cowed, meekly puts down the drink.  Nick 
               laughs, hands Peppler a drink.

                                     NICK
                              (to Peppler)
                         Here you are -- it's good stuff -- 
                         I got it before repeal.

               The girl in very beautiful evening clothes with a string 
               of pearls around her neck comes over to Nick and Peppler.  
               She holds out the pearls for Nick's attention.

                                     GIRL
                         Look, Nick.  Remember?  These are 
                         the ones you got back for me.

               Peppler looks at them with a professionally avaricious 
               eye.

                                     PEPPLER
                         Them real?

                                     NICK
                              (to Peppler, 
                              warningly)
                         Ugh-ugh!  This is your night off.

               Suddenly the music of the radio stops as it is switched to 
               another station.  The voice of a news broadcaster comes 
               over.

                                     ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

                         the latest news of the Julia Wolf 
                         murder.
                              (Nick turns as he 
                              tears this.  The 
                              CAMERA TRACKS with

                              toward the radio.

                              is listening 
                              there...  he is 
                              the one who has 
                              changed the station)
                         The police have found out that the 
                         beautiful blonde secretary was 
                         once a gangster's girl.  They are 
                         now looking for the gangster.  
                         Clyde Wynant, the girl's employer 
                         is still missing.  This case 
                         will....
                              (By this time, Nick 
                              reaches the radio.  
                              He abruptly turns 
                              the switch, changing 
                              back to a musical 
                              program.)

                         business?

               He hands the captain a drink.

                         Good case for you, Nick.

               Nick turns.

               Nora has admitted two young newspaper men who are standing 
               in the doorway.  Nick walks over to them.

                         to sober her up.

               Nora sticks up her nose, laughs, goes over to the table.  
               WE PAN as Nick leads the reporters there too.  Quinn and 
               one or two of the others also are imbibing.

                                     NICK
                              (as they get to the 
                              table)
                         Come on -- relax --
                              (then to Nora)
                         Give them a drink.

                         We need ice.

               Nick picks up a drink, already poured for himself.

                                     NICK
                              (looking at the 
                              glass in his hand)
                         What small glasses you have, 
                         Grandma.

               He goes off toward the service pantry with the drink in 
               his hand.

                                     ST REPORTER
                              (to Nora)
                         Listen, isn't he working on a case?

                                     NORA
                         Sure.  He's working on a case of 
                         Scotch.  Pitch in and help him.

               She goes off toward the service pantry.  Mrs. Quinn comes 
               up with her glass.  Quinn looks appreciatingly after Nora.

                                     QUINN
                              (to is wife, 
                              indicating Nora)
                         Isn't she grand?  I take off my 
                         hat to her.

                                     MRS, QUINN
                              (acidly)
                         Your hat!  You're getting 
                         conservative!

               SERVICE PANTRY

               It is a tiny room with cupboards, a sink and a miniature 
               Frigidaire.  Nick is getting ice cubes out of a tray.  
               Nora comes in with a glass in her hand.

                                     NORA
                         I'd better order some food.
                              (to Nick - as she 
                              takes receiver)
                         That sounds like an interesting 
                         case.  Wouldn't you like to take 
                         it?

                                     NICK
                         I haven't the time.  I'm much too 
                         busy seeing that you don't lose 
                         any of the money I married you 
                         for.

               She talks to Nick as she waits to get the connection.  She 
               watches him covertly as she she is sure that he would love 
               to go back to "sleuthing", and she'd enjoy being in on it 
               with him...she is trying to sound him out.

                         Sounds like a good case.  Girl 
                         mysteriously murdered.  No one 
                         knows who did it.  They haven't 
                         found any clues yet -- no gun -- 
                         no fingerprints --

                              interest)

                              (He looks at Nora 
                              and suddenly 
                              realizes that he 
                              is getting 
                              interested.  He 
                              jerks himself out 
                              of it)
                         I don't want to hear anything about 
                         it.

               He picks up the ice and Nora's drink.

                                     NORA
                         Isn't that my drink?

                         What are you drinking?

                         Rye.

               Nick drains the glass and puts it down.

                                     NICK
                         Yeah -- that's yours.

               He walks out as Nora turns laughing to the telephone.

               LIVING ROOM.

               Nick comes in with the ice.  The doorbell rings.  Nick 
               puts down the ice and starts for the door. As the CAMERA 
               TRUCKS with him he passes the telephone table.  Foster is 
               sitting there.  The radio music has put him in a sentimental 
               mood.

                                     FOSTER
                              (at telephone - to 
                              Nick)
                         I'd like to telephone my mother... 
                         wish her a Merry Christmas.

                                     NICK
                              (easily)
                         Go ahead, Foster.

                                     FOSTER
                         'Fraid I can't pay --

                         Forget it.

               CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN WITH HIM as he goes on to the door.  
               Just as he is about to open it, he hears Foster's voice, 
               o.s.

                                     FOSTER
                              (to phone)
                         Long distance -- give me San 
                         Francisco --

               Nick looks off, winces a little, good-humoredly. Then he 
               opens the door and is surprised to see Dorothy Wynant 
               standing there.  She is white-lipped, miserable and 
               desperate.  Nick looks at her, a little worried by her 
               harassed look.

                                     NICK
                         Come on in.

                                     DOROTHY
                         I've got to see you alone!

               Nick realizes that something is definitely the matter.

                                     QUINN (VOICE O.S.)
                         Hello, beautiful!

               Nick turns as he hears Quinn's voice.

               FULL SHOT -- GUESTS AND REPORTERS.

               Quinn is coming toward them, a drink in his hand.  His 
               eyes are fixed on Dorothy.  The two reporters also are 
               coming forward.  Their curiosity quite different from 
               Quinn's, for they realize her identity and the possibili- 
               ties of a story.

                                     NICK
                              (rushing her toward 
                              the bedroom)
                         Go on in there.

               He opens the door and she goes in.  Nick is about to follow 
               her when Quinn stops him.

                                     QUINN
                         Who's the little blonde?

                                     NICK
                         Used to bounce it on my knee.

                                     QUINN
                         Which knee?  Could I touch it?

               Nick laughs and enters the bedroom.  Quinn tries to follow, 
               as do the reporters who have come up, but Nick shuts the 
               door in their faces.  Quinn, startled, knocks on the door.

                                     QUINN
                              (knocking)
                         House detective!

               BEDROOM.

               Dorothy is standing near the bed.  She holds herself taut 
               and stiff.  She is determined that she is going to sacrifice 
               herself to save her father.  Nick comes up to her.

                                     DOROTHY
                         You heard about Julia Wolf?

                         Yes.

                              from her muff)
                         There.

                              the bed.  Nick 
                              looks at it, and 
                              then back at her. 
                              His look is very 
                              cool and unexcited)

                         What are you trying to tell me?  
                         That you did it?

                                     DOROTHY
                              (she has her story 
                              all set and she 
                              speaks with very 
                              convincing fervor)
                         Yes.  I hated her for coming between 
                         my mother and father.  She kept me 
                         from seeing my father.  I went 
                         down there to ask her where he 
                         was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I 
                         shot her.

                                     DOROTHY
                         She... she fell over backwards.

                                     NICK

                         shot, you know...  not back from 
                         it.  I knew you were lying.

               Dorothy breaks down, realizing that her attempt to take 
               the blame is futile.  Nick goes and holds her comfortingly 
               in his arms.

                                     NICK
                         Where did you get this gun?

                         I bought it in a pawn shop.

                                     NICK
                         Don't lie to me.

                                     DOROTHY
                         That's the truth.

               At this point Nora enters.  She holds a drink in her hand.  
               Nick looks up -- makes a little grimace at Nora.  Dorothy 
               turns and sees her.  She pulls away a little.

                                     DOROTHY
                         This is awful of me -- to make a 
                         nuisance of myself.

                                     NORA
                              (easily)
                         Don't be a dope.  Have a drink?

               Dorothy tries wanly to smile.

                                     DOROTHY
                         No thanks.

               She fumbles in her bag to find her powder.  Nick is looking 
               curiously at the gun, turning it over in his hand.

                         There's powder and stuff over there.

               Dorothy walks toward the table.

               Nora sees the gun now, is amazed.

                              drawer of a table)

                         it.

                         the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.

                              door to the living

                         those reporters see her. They might 
                         believe her.

               He goes out the door, and closes it hastily behind him.  
               Nora goes toward Dorothy.

               LIVING ROOM

               There is a hotel service table, piled high with food, in 
               the room.  The people here all eating, standing around 
               with drinks in their hands.  As soon as Nick opens the 
               door to come out, the reporters pounce on him.

                                     FIRST REPORTER

                         case.

               He goes off quickly toward the telephone.

                                     NICK
                         I'm not.  I don't know a thing 
                         about it, and I don't care a thing 
                         about it.  All I want is a drink.

               Foster has at last been able to get his mother in San

               The reporter comes rapidly into the shot.  He tries to 
               take the telephone from the other man.

               CLOSE SHOT AT TABLE

               Quinn is standing beside Nick.  The doorbell rings.

                                     NICK
                              (to reporter over 
                              at telephone)
                         Hey, don't do that!
                              (he is pouring a 
                              drink)
                         Now don't tell your paper that I'm 
                         working on anything, 'cause I'm 
                         not.

               Nick goes offscene toward the door.  The bell rings again.

                                     QUINN
                         He's just working on that little 
                         gal.

               FULL SHOT.

               Nick opens the door.  Mimi and Gilbert are outside. Mimi 
               instantly rushes in greets him effusively. Gilbert is left 
               standing in the door.

                                     MIMI
                         Oh, Nick... Nick!

                                     NICK
                         Hello, Mimi.

                                     MIMI
                         want to talk to you about something 
                         very important.

               The first reporter has forgotten his telephone call. He is 
               all ears.  Nick looks around desperately, and takes Mimi 
               roughly by the arm and rushes her into a doorway next to 
               the door of the bedroom.

                                     NICK
                         Come on in here.

               BATHROOM.

               As Nick brings Mimi into the bathroom, she looks around; 
               bewildered.

                                     NICK
                         Sorry.  This is the only place we 
                         can be alone; Won't you sit down?

               He waves airily off scene, presumably toward the seat, 
               Mimi follows the line of his hand, looks, starts and gives 
               him a cutting look.

               DOORWAY OF LIVING ROOM.

               Gilbert is standing hesitantly in the doorway. The first 
               reporter suddenly sees him.  He hasn't noticed him before.  
               He goes quickly to him.

                                     FIRST REPORTER
                         How do you do, Mr. Wynant.
                              (he takes Gilbert 
                              cordially but firmly 
                              by the arm and 
                              brings him into 
                              the room)
                         My name is Diamond. Come on in and 
                         have a drink.

                                     GILBERT
                         I don't drink.

                                     FIRST REPORTER
                         As a matter-of-fact, I don't either. 
                         I'd much rather talk...

               He starts for a quiet corner -

                                                                BACK TO:

               BATHROOM.

               Mimi and Nick are sitting on the edge of the tub.

                                     MIMI
                         Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely 
                         crazy to stay away at a time like 
                         this. No wonder the police think 
                         he has something to do with it.

                                     NICK
                         What do you think?

                                     MIMI
                         Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I 
                         could find him...  I have something 
                         very important to tell him.  
                         Macaulay won't help at all.  He 
                         thinks I just want money.

                                     NICK
                              (smiling at her)
                         Well, don't you?

                                     MIMI
                              (choosing to regard 
                              this as a joke)
                         You're always teasing.

               The door of the bathroom opens.  Foster starts to come in. 
               He stops suddenly as he sees Mimi.

                                     FOSTER
                         I beg your pardon.

               He backs hurriedly out.  Mimi moves closer to Nick, takes 
               his arm.

                                     MIMI
                         Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- 
                         won't you?

                                     NICK
                         Now, Mimi, there are a thousand 
                         detectives in New York.  Hire one 
                         of them.

                                     MIMI
                              (persuasively)
                         But he knows you.  All you have to 
                         do is get in touch with him, and 
                         tell him that Mimi says everything 
                         is all right... but that I've got 
                         to see him.

                                     NICK
                         I tell you again, I don't want any 
                         part of it.
                              (he goes and opens 
                              the door which 
                              connects with the 
                              bedroom)
                         Now you take Dorothy home and...

                                     MIMI
                              (furious)
                         Dorothy!  Is she here?

                              (startled by her 
                              tone)
                         Yes...

               Mimi pushes into the bedroom, past him.

               BEDROOM - MEDIUM GROUP

               Dorothy and Nora are sitting on the bed.

               Asta is between them.  Dorothy is patting Asta, still 
               looking very subdued and unhappy.  Nora holds out the glass 
               toward her.

                         If you finish this, you'll feel 
                         better.

               In the mirror in back of them, we see Mimi coming toward 
               Dorothy, a look of fury on her face.  Dorothy looks up at 
               her Mother as she comes into the  scene, a little terrified 
               by her Mother's expression.  Mimi comes right to Dorothy 
               and stands over her.  She is sure that Dorothy has told 
               Nick about the watch chain.

                                     MIMI
                         What did you tell him?  What did 
                         you tell him?

               Dorothy doesn't answer.  Her Mother slaps her viciously, 
               repeating the question.  Nick comes up from behind Mimi 
               and pulls her away.  Nora puts a protecting arm around 
               Dorothy.  There is a second of silence as Dorothy and Mimi 
               face each other, all of their mutual antagonism in their 
               eyes.  Asta starts barking.  Nora quiets him.

                                     NICK
                         She didn't tell me a thing.

                                     MIMI
                              (recovering herself)
                         I'm so excited I didn't know what 
                         I was doing.  Come on, Dorothy, 
                         we'll go home.

                              warm affection to 
                              Dorothy)
                         You can stay here you know.  There's 
                         plenty of room and we'd love to 
                         have you.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Thanks.  But I'll go home.

               She stands up to go.  Mimi looks around.

                         Where's Gilbert?

                                     NICK
                              (this is the last 
                              straw)
                         Gilbert!  Is he here too?
                              (he starts toward 
                              the living room)
                         We might as well be living in the 
                         lobby.

               Gilbert is sitting in a corner of the room with the two 
               reporters.  They have their pencils out, taking down the 
               rapid flow of words that come from Gilbert.

                                     GILBERT
                         There's a physiological as well as 
                         a psychological angle in my father's 
                         relationship with Julia Wolf that 
                         the police have overlooked.  And I 
                         think it explains everything.  You 
                         see, my father was a sexogenarian.

                         Of course.

               The reporter gets up, furious.  He throws his pad to the 
               floor.  Nick comes into the scene.  He goes to Gilbert.

                         Come on, son.

               He takes Gilbert by the arm and pushes him into the bedroom 
               and closes the door on him.  The telephone starts to ring. 
               The two reporters follow Nick as he goes toward the 
               telephone.

               BIG CLOSEUP - NUNHEIM AT A TELEPHONE.

               He is in a room telephoning.  The background is not 
               distinguishable.  He is evidently talking for the effect 
               on someone else in the room whom we do not see.  He looks 
               at the man out of the corner or his eye as he talks.

                                     NUNHEIM
                         Mr. Charles, I'd like to lay a 
                         proposition before you.  I can't 
                         discuss it over the telephone, but 
                         if you'll give me half an hour of 
                         your time... it's about the Julia 
                         Wolf....

               At that a hand comes in, covers the mouthpiece, preventing 
               any further conversation.  Nunheim, still in this BIG 
               CLOSEUP, looks o.s, at the invisible man and grins 
               sardonically.

               Then as he gets no answer, he hangs up.  The 2nd reporter 
               jumps to him.

               WIDE ANGLE - THE ROOM

               Nora comes out of the bedroom door.  Quinn comes up to 
               her.  Mrs. Quinn, starts listening.

                                     QUINN
                         Where's that girl?

                                     NORA
                         She's gone.

                         Out the back way.

               The two reporters, without a word, grab their hats and 
               coats and rush out. Quinn, too, brazenly starts to breeze 
               past his wife and follow them.  Mrs. Quinn steps in front 
               of him, slaps his face. Foster, again at the phone, whines 
               out:  "Hello, Ma!"  And simultaneously, during this 
               confusion, the radio starts to play "Silent Night, Peaceful 
               Night" -- as the police captain, the pug, Face Peppler, 
               and all others immediately join in with the song.  They 
               are all pretty tight by this time and sing at the top of 
               their lungs.  The effect desired is a screwy climax to 
               what has been quite a hectic, screwy situation. CAMERA 
               PANS WITH NORA as she takes it all in at a quick glance 
               and walks over to Nick. She puts her arms around him.  He 
               looks down at her, amused.

               CAMERA MOVES UP FOR A BIG CLOSEUP OF THE TWO.

                                     NORA
                         I love you, Nickie, 'cause you

               CLOSE SHOT OF BED - EFFECT SHOT.

               It is about an hour later the bedroom is dark for a second. 
               Then, Nora on one side of the big double bed, pulls on the 
               light on the small table beside her. She sits up a little 
               and looks over at Nick. He is soundly sleeping, his face 
               toward her. She has Dorothy on her mind and can't sleep 
               and she wants company.

                                     NORA

                              at her)
                         Are you asleep?

                         Don't you think you'd like to go 
                         back to detecting once in a while, 
                         just for the fun of it?

                         Maybe a drink would help you.

                                     NORA
                         No thanks.

                         Maybe it would if I took it.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK as he gets up out of bed and goes to the 
               bureau where there is a bottle and a glass. Asta jumps 
               down and follows him. Nick pours himself a drink. Asta 
               stands there, licking Nick's bare feet.

                                     NORA
                         Everybody says you were a grand 
                         detective.

                         of detective stories.

               Nora is determined to get Nick to help Dorothy.  She tries 
               another approach.

                                     NORA
                         That poor girl is in a tough spot.

                         There's nothing I can do to help 
                         her.

               Asta jumps on the bed, goes and curls himself up at their 
               feet.

                                     NORA
                         She thinks you can. It wouldn't 
                         hurt you to find out if you could, 
                         would it?

                         killed Julia and Dorothy knows it.  
                         And the police'll catch him without

                         At breakfast.

               He brings her the drink.  She takes it from him and he 
               gets into bed.

                         The man at the Aquarium said that 
                         he wouldn't take them back.

               Nora looks over at him, disgusted. She puts down the drink 
               and pulls out the light.  After a second, there is a knock 
               heard from the next room. Nora pulls on the light. She 
               turns to Nick.

                                     NORA
                         Did you hear a knock?

               Nick looks up.  The knock comes again.  Nora gets up, takes 
               a robe from the foot of the bed, pulls it on and goes out.  
               As she does so, Nick reaches over, takes her drink and 
               finishes it, then turns over again to go to sleep.

               DOOR OF LIVING ROOM,

               Nora has put on the lights as she came through the room.  
               She opens the door. Joe Morelli is standing outside. He 
               wears a black derby hat, which he doesn't remove and he 
               has his hands in the pockets of his close fitting black 
               over-coat. Nora looks at him with lively curiosity.  She 
               is too fond of adventure as well as too brave to scream 
               when she sees his menacing figure.

                                     MORELLI
                         Mr. Charles here?

                                     NORA
                         Yes.

                                     MORELLI
                              (his manner is very 
                              urgent)
                         I gotta talk to him... that's all.  
                         But I gotta do that.

               Nora looks at him for a second.

                                     NORA
                         You wait here.  I'll tell him.

               She goes toward the bedroom.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               THE BEDROOM.

               Nora enters, calling to Nick.

                                     NORA
                         Nick!  Nick!
                              (Nick stirs and 
                              opens his eyes)
                         There's someone to she you,

                                     NICK
                              (sitting up)
                         That's great.  I was afraid I'd 
                         have to go to sleep.

               But as Nora moves away to get back into bed, we see Morelli 
               has followed her into the bedroom and is standing pointing 
               a gun directly at Nick, with a menacing intentness in his 
               whole body.

               WIDE ANGLE - THE GROUP.

               Nora, entirely unconscious of Morelli's presence and the 
               gun in his hand, swings into bed beside Nick.  Nick is 
               looking fixedly at the gun.  Nora looks at him, amused by 
               his expression, not knowing the cause.

                                     NORA
                         You've got the funniest look on 
                         your face.

               She follows the line of Nick's gaze, and her eyes pop with 
               amazement as she sees Morelli with the gun.

               REVERSE ANGLE - CLOSEUP ON MORELLI.

               He holds the gun leveled at Nick.

                                     MORELLI
                         I gotta talk to you.  I want you 
                         to tell me something and I want 
                         you to give it to me straight.  
                         Get me?

               REVERSE CLOSEUP - NICK AND NORA

                                     NICK
                         Do you mind putting that gun away?  
                         My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a 
                         delicate condition.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               MEDIUM SHOT AGAIN - GROUP

               Nora looks at Nick, appreciating his humor in the midst of 
               his danger.

                                     NORA
                              (to Nick)
                         You idiot!
                              (Asta begins barking 
                              at Morelli)
                         Asta! Stop that!  Get down!
                              (she chases him off 
                              the bed.  Asta 
                              jumps down out of 
                              sight. Morelli 
                              still has his pistol 
                              pointed at Nick.)
                         Now, stay there.

                                     NICK
                              (to Morelli - seeing 
                              that Asta is down)
                         All right... shoot!
                              (then realizing the 
                              double meaning, he 
                              corrects himself)
                         I mean... what's on your mind?

                                     MORELLI
                         You don't need to tell me you're 
                         tough.  I heard about you.
                              (He puts the gun in 
                              his overcoat pocket)
                         I'm Joe Morelli.

               Nora watches the scene between the two men.  She is excited, 
               but apparently not frightened.

                                     NICK
                         I've never heard about you.

                                     MORELLI
                         I didn't knock Julia off.

                                     NICK
                         All right - you didn't.

                                     MORELLI
                         I haven't seen her in three months.  
                         We were all washed up.

                                     NICK
                         Why tell me?

                                     MORELLI
                         I wouldn't have any reason to hurt 
                         her.  She was always on the up and 
                         up with me.  But that dirty little 
                         Nunheim -- he got sore cause I 
                         clicked with her and he didn't, so 
                         he put the finger on me.

                                     NICK
                         That's all swell.  Only you're 
                         peddling your fish in the wrong 
                         market. I've got nothing to do 
                         with it.

                                     MORELLI
                              (his intense 
                              excitement 
                              increasing)
                         Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me 
                         you used to be O.K. That's why I'm 
                         here. Do  they....

                              (in a tone of polite 
                              enquiry)
                         How is Studsy?  I didn't know he 
                         was out of stir.

                                     MORELLI
                              (conversationally)
                         He's all right. He'd like to see 
                         you. But listen...  What's the law 
                         doing to me?  Do they think I did 
                         it, or is it just something else 
                         to pin on me?

                                     NICK
                         I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm 
                         not in this.  Ask the police.

                                     MORELLI
                              (sarcastically)
                         That'd be very smart.  That'd be 
                         the smartest thing I ever did. Me 
                         that a police captain's been in a 
                         hospital three weeks on account we 
                         had an argument.  The boys would 
                         like to have me come in and ask 
                         questions.  They'd like it right 
                         down to the end of their blackjacks.  
                         Now I come to you on the level.
                         Studsy says you're on the level.  
                         Be on the level.

                                     NICK
                         I am on the level. If I knew 
                         anything I'd....

               Over the SOUND TRACK there is a sound of knuckles rapping 
               sharply on the door.  Morelli's gun is in his hand before 
               the rapping stops.  His eyes seem to move in all directions 
               at once.

                                     MORELLI
                              (with a snarl to 
                              Nick)
                         What's that?

                                     NICK
                              (shrugging his 
                              shoulders)
                         This is your party.

               The sound of the knuckles come again, and someone speaks 
               outside.

                                     GUILD'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Open up.  Police.

                                     MORELLI
                              (as he raises his 
                              gun to fire at 
                              Nick)
                         You two-timing --

               Nick shoves Nora's face, knocking her out of bed and across 
               the room with his left hand, and throws a pillow at Morelli 
               with his right just as Morelli fires.  Nick sprawls out of 
               bed, making a dive for Morelli and catching his ankle. The 
               two men fall to the floor. Morelli clubs Nick with his 
               revolver, and Nick fights him with his one free hand.

               Guild, two policemen, and the hotel manager rush into the 
               room.  They pitch in and drag Nick and Morelli apart.

               CLOSE SHOT -- NORA ON FLOOR

               She is in a faint as Nick, comes quickly up to her.  The 
               hotel manager follows him and stands looking down 
               solicitously. Nick leans down over her.

                                     NICK
                         Nora.....Nora!

               She doesn't move.

               Hotel Manager What knocked her out?

                                     NICK
                         I did. She was in the line of fire.
                              (turns, points to 
                              liquor bottle)
                         Hand me that bottle.
                              (turns back to Nora, 
                              begins working on 
                              her)
                         Better get a doctor.

               The hotel manager goes quickly out. Nick tries to get Nora 
               to take a drink of whisky.  She opens her eyes. She puts 
               her hand up to her cheek where Nick hit her.  Then, as 
               Nick watches her anxiously:

                                     NORA
                              (indignantly)
                         You darn fool -- you didn't have 
                         to knock me out.  I knew you'd 
                         take him, but I wanted to see you 
                         do it!

               FULL SHOT -- INCLUDING GUILD, MORELLI AND TWO OFFICERS

               Morelli is standing handcuffed between the officers.  Guild 
               looks admiringly at Nora as Nick is helping her to her 
               feet.

                                     GUILD
                         There's a gal with hair on her 
                         chest.

               As Nick pulls Nora up, she looks at the coat of his pyjamas, 
               where a streak of blood has started to come through.

                                     NORA
                              (for the first, 
                              time horrified)
                         Nick... you're...

               Nick follows her eyes down. For the first time he realizes 
               that the bullet has touched him.

                                     NICK

                         me.

               Nick gets into bed.  Guild comes over - looks at the wound.  
               The CAMERA PANS AWAY from Morelli.

               Over the SOUND TRACK we hear the policeman slap Morelli's

               Nora comes back from the bathroom with some towels.  Nick 
               puts a towel over the wound, and sits propped up in bed.

               The policeman starts to search the room.  Guild decides to 
               change his tactics.

               Nora comes over with the drink for Nick.  She hands it to

               Nick, hearing this, chokes on his drink.

               BUREAU - CLOSEUP.

               Bob is searching in the drawers of the bureau.  He finds 
               the pistol that Nick left there and brings it to Guild.

               Guild takes the gun, looks at it and turns to Nick.  Nick - 
               not knowing whether or not the gun is evidence, is slightly 
               apprehensive.  He watches Guild closely.

               FADE IN:

               CLOSEUP OF CHRISTMAS TREE.

               It is noon. The sun is streaming in. Most of the bells on 
               the Christmas tree have been broken. There is one large 
               ball still intact.  Over the SOUND TRACK we hear the pop 
               of an air rifle.  The big ball splinters.

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Nick lying on the sofa in a 
               dressing gown, with the air rifle in his hand.  He uses 
               only his right hand on the rifle.  Across his chest, on 
               the left, there is the indication of bandaging underneath 
               his pajamas. On the floor beside him are piles of 
               newspapers.  The telephone is on a table near his hand. 
               The room is littered with tissue paper and ribbon from the 
               opened Christmas presents. There is a breakfast table at 
               one side, with the emptied dishes covered by a napkin.  
               Nora is sitting smoking.  She is wearing a very lovely fur 
               coat over her negligee.  She is reading a tabloid newspaper, 
               the headlines and pictures of which exploit the Julia Wolf 
               murder.

                                     NICK
                              (looking fondly at

                         This is the nicest present I ever 
                         had.

               Nora puts down her paper.  She comes over to Nick on the 
               sofa.  She has a bunch of holiday telegrams in her hand. 
               She starts to pick up the newspapers which almost cover 
               Nick.  She has a very lovely wrist watch on.  Nick sees it -- 
               takes her hand and examines it.

                                     NICK
                         I never saw that before.

                         You must admit I have good taste.

               Nora laughs.

                                     NICK
                         Yes.  I know all they know about 
                         the murder. And I'm a great hero.  
                         The Tribune said I was shot twice.

               As he talks, Nora throws the papers to the floor and sits 
               down at the other end of the couch, putting her slippered 
               feet comfortably in Nick's lap. She starts to open, the 
               telegrams.

                                     NORA
                         I read you were shot five times in 
                         the tabloids.

                                     NICK
                         That's not true.  He never came 
                         near my tabloids.
                              (he takes aim again 
                              with his gun)
                         That's one thing I always protect... 
                         my tabloids.

               As he is just ready to shoot, the CAMERA PANS over to his 
               target.  It is a large balloon that Asta is chasing around 
               the room.  We hear the "POP" of the RIFLE and the BALLOON 
               EXPLODES, to Asta's astonishment and chagrin.  Asta starts 
               looking for the lost balloon.

                                                                BACK TO:

               NICK AND NORA - CLOSEUP.

               The telephone rings - Nick reaches over and picks it up.

                                     NORA
                         Who's that?

                                     NICK
                         Macaulay.

               Nora reads the telegrams and hands them to Nick at the 
               other end of the sofa as she finishes.  He takes them as 
               she gives them to him, and throws them on the floor without 
               looking at them.

                                     NORA
                              (as she reads one)
                         Season's Greetings.  The Mallorys.
                              (she hands it to 
                              Nick. She is 
                              distressed)
                         I forgot all about them.

               She opens another telegram.  Nick throws the first to the 
               floor.  He looks at Nora in her fur coat.

                                     NICK
                         Aren't you hot in that?

                                     NORA
                         I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.
                              (she hands him 
                              another telegram)
                         The Kirbys.

                                     NICK
                              (taking it and 
                              dropping it on the 
                              floor)
                         Is that another Christmas present?

                                     NORA
                              (smiling at him)
                         Yes.

                                     NICK
                         Did I give it to you?

                                     NORA
                         Yes.

               Again this is news to Nick, but he takes it philosophically.

                                     NICK
                         I'm spoiling you.

               She tickles him with her foot.  Then she hands him another 
               telegram, which suffers the same fate.  Nick cocks his gun 
               again, preparing to shoot.  Nora has opened another 
               telegram.  Her manner changes.

                                     NORA
                         Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!
                              (Nick puts down his 
                              rifle, all 
                              attention.  Nora 
                              reads it aloud)
                         "Will you take charge of 
                         investigation on Julia Wolf murder.

                              (putting out his 
                              hand for it)
                         Let's see.  Where's it from?

                                     NORA
                              (looking at it as 
                              she hands it over)
                         Philadelphia.
                              (Nick is examining 
                              the telegram.  The 
                              doorbell rings.  
                              Nora starts for 
                              the door, talking 
                              as she goes)
                         Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?

                                     NICK
                              (thoughtfully)
                         I don't know.

                                     NORA
                              (still on way to 
                              door)
                         He wouldn't ask you to handle it 
                         if he were guilty.

                                     NICK
                         Your guess is as good as mine.

                                     NORA
                         Oh take it!  Please take it!

               By this time she is at the door. She opens the door to 
               Macaulay.

                                     NORA
                         Oh, hello.  Come on in.

                                     MACAULAY
                         Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't 
                         a very "Merry Christmas" for you.

                                     NORA
                         Oh, he's sitting up.

                                     MACAULAY
                         Good.

               Macaulay comes in and goes to Nick.

                                     NICK
                         How are you?

                                     MACAULAY
                         I hate to bother you when you're 
                         laid up.

                                     NICK
                         That's all right.

               Asta, delighted to see a visitor, jumps all over Macaulay. 
               Macauley is a little disconcerted by all this attention.

                                     NORA
                         Asta!  Asta!  Come here.

               She throws a ball and the dog chases it out of the scene. 
               Macaulay sits down near Nick.

               Asta comes back into the scene. He deposits the ball near 
               Macaulay's chair and stands looking eagerly up at him.

                                     NORA
                         Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.

                                     MACAULAY
                         That's all right.

               He leans down and throws the ball for Asta.

               Beside him on the floor is a miniature fire hydrant  He 
               looks down at it.

                                     MACAULAY
                         What a delightful toy.

               Nick looks down and sees it for the first time.

                                     NICK
                         Oh, it's a fire hydrant.

                                     NORA
                         Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.

               Macaulay, a little troubled, looks down at it, and then 
               unostentatiously moves his leg and his chair out of the 
               danger zone.  Asta returns, playfully and affectionately, 
               with the ball again.  Macaulay, with a forced smile, throws 
               it for him again.  Then Macaulay turns to Nick, reaching 
               in his pocket for a telegram.

                                     MACAULAY
                         I got word from Wynant this 
                         morning...

                                     NORA
                         So did we.
                              (correcting herself - 
                              indicating Nick)
                         I mean, Sherlock here.

               Nick hands Macaulay his telegram from Wynant.  Macaulay 
               reads it and looks at Nick.

                                     MACAULAY
                         What are the chances of getting 
                         you to do what he wants?

                                     NICK
                         Slim.

                                     NORA
                         Oh, please, Nick.

                                     MACAULAY
                         Would it help any if I could 
                         persuade him to meet you?

                                     NICK
                         It might.

                                     MACAULAY
                         He gave me a code message to insert 
                         in the Times, in case I wanted to 
                         get in touch with him.

                                     NICK
                         It wouldn't hurt to put it in.

               Nora beams. The telephone rings.  Nick picks it up.

                                     MACAULAY
                         I've done that already. He should 
                         appear, you know.  It doesn't look 
                         well... his staying away at a time 
                         like this.

                                     NICK
                              (in telephone)
                         Hello.... oh, just a minute.
                              (holding out the 
                              phone to Macaulay)
                         Police department?

                                     MACAULAY
                              (he looks surprised 
                              but takes the phone)
                         Hello....
                              (his face changes... 
                              he is startled)
                         Where?  In Allentown.
                              (he consults his 
                              watch)
                         Yes... When is the next train?  
                         Right - I'll get that.
                              (he slowly puts up 
                              the phone and turns 
                              to Nick and Nora)
                         Wynant's tried to commit suicide. 
                         They want me to come down and 
                         identify him.
                              (slowly he picks up 
                              his hat)
                         I guess this changes the whole 
                         story, doesn't it?  That looks 
                         like an admission of guilt.  And I 
                         had such hopes.  I thought if you 
                         got on the case, you'd be able to 
                         clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... 
                         the way she acted... I was sure 
                         that....
                              (he sighs)
                         Oh, well, well... it's no use 
                         thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to 
                         have wasted so much of your time.

               He goes quickly out.  Nora looks after him, and then turns 
               to Nick.  She is evidently depressed.

                                     NORA
                         Well, that's that.
                              (Nick starts to get 
                              up off the sofa)
                         Stay there, Nick!

                              (paying no attention)
                         It's not going to hurt me to get 
                         up.

                         You talk as if I were Asta.

                         All right, hard guy.  Get up and 
                         bleed on the rugs.

               Nick walks over to pour a drink.  Nora sits down and Asta 
               comes and puts his head on her knees looking sadly up at 
               her.

                         What's the trouble, Asta?  Your 
                         balloon busted?  So's mine.

                         The mystery's all gone. And I wanted 
                         you to find out who did it.

                              (surprised)
                         But Wynant --- ?

                         I don't believe he did it.

                                     NICK
                         No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm 
                         going to find out.
                              (he starts to untie 
                              his robe)
                         I'm tired of being pushed around.

                                     NORA
                              (feeling her jaw - 
                              standing up suddenly)
                         So am I.

                         Come on, Watson, we're going places.

               As he strides into the bedroom, Nora striding in perfect 
               imitation after him.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               EXTERIOR ENTRANCE, NORMANDIE HOTEL.

               Nick and Nora come through the door.  They have Asta on a 
               leash.  Guild steps up to them.

                                     GUILD
                              (beaming at Nora)
                         Good morning --

                                     NORA
                         Good morning, Lieutenant -
                              (Asta pulls her 
                              violently toward 
                              the curb. She goes 
                              after him, out of 
                              the scene, calling 
                              back apologetically)
                         Sorry.

               Guild and Nick follow Nora more slowly to the curb.

                                     GUILD
                              (to Nick)
                         You oughtn't to play this trick on 
                         me.  Running out when I was giving 
                         you time to rest up before I asked 
                         you those questions.

                                     NICK
                         You mean about that gun?

                                     GUILD
                         That ain't a gun any more.  The 
                         firing pin's busted - the -
                              (he breaks off)
                         Don't waste time talking about 
                         that.

               They join Nora.  She listens eagerly, not taking her eyes 
               from Nick and Guild. Through the whole scene, as they walk 
               down the block, when Asta pulls on the leash Nora stops 
               with him, and the two men, as a matter of course, stop and 
               wait for Nora, none of them ever looking at Asta. (IT IS A 
               TRUCKING SHOT ALL THE WAY)

                         have you working with us than 
                         against us.

                         It's a bargain then.  Anything you 
                         want to know?

               The leash tightens up and starts to pull Nora ahead.  The 
               two men quicken their steps to keep pace with her.  (They 
               are walking along a quiet street in the East Fifties, so 
               that there is not much traffic, and not many people.)

                                     NICK
                         What about the suicide?

                                     GUILD
                         Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't 
                         even have to go down.

                                     NICK
                         I thought it might be.  From now 
                         on, they're going to think that 
                         every thin man over six feet with 
                         white hair is Wynant.

               Again the leash pulls Nora over to the curb.  The three, 
               without interrupting their conversation, stand still, 
               waiting.

                                     NORA
                         Do you think that Wynant did it?

                         Looks like he planned, something.  
                         He shut up his apartment and his 
                         shop.

                         Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This 
                         is the way we figure it.  Wynant 
                         goes to Julia's apartment. He finds 
                         Morelli there... sees she's two-
                         timing him.  They have a fight. 
                         But he figures he don't want to do 
                         anything then.... Morelli might 
                         squeal.  So he goes away. He don't 
                         let his lawyer know anything has 
                         happened... he lets him go ahead 
                         and and hand over money to Julia 
                         to give to him, so that Julia will 
                         think it's all blown over. Then, 
                         when she don't expect it... he 
                         lets her have it.

               Asta completes his investigation and starts off down the 
               street again the three follow.

               Asta sees another hydrant and makes for it.

               But Nora is too interested to stop.  She drags him on.

                              passing taxi)
                         Taxi!

               A taxi drives up.  Nora starts to get in.

                         This may be a little rough - you'd

                         Catch me letting you go alone!

               She climbs determinedly in, pulling Asta after her.  Guild 
               starts to follow, but Nick pulls him away.  He closes the 
               door of the taxi and speaks to the driver:

                         Grant's Tomb.

               The cab starts off.  Nora shakes her fist back at Nick. 
               Nick charmingly lifts his hat and throws her a kiss, as 
               Guild hails another passing cab.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               OUTSIDE DOOR OF NUNHEIM'S APARTMENT.

               It is the fourth floor of a dark, damp building.

               The noise of the Sixth Avenue E1 can be heard even in the 
               hallway.  Guild and Nick come to the door.  Guild knocks.  
               There are sounds of hurried movement inside the room, then 
               a voice calls, in an irritated tone.

                                     NUNHEIM'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Who is it?

                         John.

               Nunheim hastily unlocks and opens the door.  He has no 
               coat on - he is evidently frightened.

                                     NUNHEIM
                         I wasn't expecting you, Lieutenant.  
                         You said you'd phone.

               Guild touches Nick's elbow with his hand, and they go in.

               LIVING ROOM OF APARTMENT.

               The room is shabby and dirty, with clothing, newspapers 
               and dirty dishes sitting around.  Through an open door, 
               the bedroom, with an unmade bed, can be seen.  In an alcove 
               there is a sink and a stove.  Marian is standing there 
               with a sizzling skillet in her hand.

               She is wearing a rumpled pink kimono and frayed pink mules 
               with lop-sided bows on them.  She stares sullenly at Guild 
               and Nick as they come in.  Guild does not introduce Nick 
               to Nunheim, or even look at Marian.  He keeps his hat on, 
               and Nick, seeing him, follows his example.  Guild pushes 
               some clothing out of the way to make a place for himself 
               at the end of the sofa.

                              (to Nick)
                         Sit down.

               Nick removes some newspaper from a rocking chair and sits 
               down.  Nunheim goes over to a table where there is about 
               two inches of whiskey in a pint bottle.

                                     NUNHEIM
                         Have a shot?

                         What's the idea of telling me you 
                         just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?

                                     NUNHEIM
                         That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's 
                         the God's truth.  Maybe I said 
                         hello to her or how are you or 
                         something like that when I saw 
                         her, but that's all I knew her. 
                         That's the truth.
                              (Marian laughs once,

                              in her face. Nunheim 
                              twists around to

                         I'll pop a tooth out of it.

                         Is that so!

               She swings her arm around and lets the skillet fly at his 
               head.  It misses, crashing into the wall.  Nunheim starts 
               after her.  Marian picks up a paring knife.  Nick puts his 
               foot out, without rising, and trips him.  Nunheim falls to 
               the floor.

                         to watch you two rough-house.

               Nunheim slowly gets up.  Marian starts for the bedroom 
               without looking at any of them.

                                     NUNHEIM

                         have so much trouble with this

                         That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody 
                         that says that is a liar.

               Marian goes into the bedroom and shuts the door.

               Marian comes out.  She is in street clothes and is carrying 
               a suitcase.

                                     NUNHEIM

                         I don't like crooks and even if I 
                         did, I wouldn't like crooks that 
                         are stool pigeons, and if I did

                         I still wouldn't like you.

               Marian starts for the outer door.  Nunheim tries to follow 
               Marian, but Guild catches his arm.

               Marian goes out and shuts the door, paying no attention to 
               Nunheim.

               Nunheim puts his hand over his face and begins to cry.

                         was here.  She'd remember.

               He gets up and quickly goes into the bedroom.  Nick goes 
               to the telephone and starts to dial.  Guild starts to search 
               the room.

               he means and makes a bee line for the bedroom.  In a second 
               he cones back. He takes the phone from Nick.

               A TELEPHONE BOOTH.

               Nunheim is talking into the telephone.  As he talks, he 
               watches the outside of the telephone booth to be sure that 
               no one is listening.  His voice is quiet but there is a 
               menacing urgency in his tone.

                                     NUNHEIM

                         minute.  I ducked out on 'em.  Now

               STREET IN THE WEST FORTIES.

               Nunheim jumps out of cab, pays the driver.

               It drives off. The street is deserted. By this time it is 
               about five o'clock and the early winter twilight has fallen.  
               WE TRUCK AND PAN as Nunheim looks at the numbers of the 
               houses.  A little way up the street he finds the number he 
               has been looking for.  He walks into a dark doorway.  Just 
               as he steps in, there is the crack of a pistol shot and 
               the flash of fire from the gun. Nunheim throws up his hands, 
               staggers forward to the street, his hand clutching his 
               heart.  Here he pitches forward -- dead.  The CAMERA stays 
               on the body.

               She starts at this, recognizing Nick's voice.  Again she 
               sticks up her nose, a little characteristic of hers in 
               matters concerning Nickie.  Then she snaps:

                                     NORA
                         It's lovely.  I'm having a copy 
                         made for you --

                                                                BACK TO:

               CLOSE TWO SHOT - NICK AND GUILD.

               Nick laughs, then -- seriously:

                                     NICK
                         What have you got?

               Nora's voice comes through, but she is evidently speaking 
               in a low whisper and the words are inaudible.

                                     NICK
                         Can't hear you -- little lou --
                              (an alert look comes 
                              into his eyes as 
                              he listens closer, 
                              getting what she 
                              is saying.  Guild, 
                              too, is interested.)
                         We'll be right up!
                              (Nick puts down the 
                              phone and turns to 
                              Guild)
                         She's up at Mimi's.  Jorgensen has 
                         disappeared.

               The two men rise.

                                                       FAST DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSEUP ON MIMI -- HER BEDROOM.

               She is seated facing Nick in her bedroom, although in this 
               opening dissolve we do not reveal him.  WE HOLD ON MIMI as 
               she speaks hysterically.

                                     MIMI
                         Chris may be at the club -- or 
                         somewhere -- I don't see that it's 
                         important --

                                     NICK (O.S.)
                         You should have told them he'd 
                         disappeared.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THE ROOM NOW as Mimi jumps up.  
               Nick is seated, questioning her.  Dorothy hovers behind 
               Nick.

                                     MIMI
                              (her manner and 
                              tone more distrait)
                         But he has nothing to do with it!

                                     NICK
                         That's not for you to decide. 
                         Everybody's under suspicion - 
                         especially running off like this --
                              (he picks up a 
                              picture of Jorgensen 
                              from the bureau)
                         The police will want his 
                         description.  Is this a picture of 
                         him?

               Mimi tries to take the picture.

                                     MIMI
                         I tell you -- he didn't do it.

                                     NICK
                         They'll want more than your word 
                         for that.

                                     MIMI
                              (coming forward and 
                              speaking slowly)
                         All right, then -- I'll tell them 
                         who did do it!

                                     DOROTHY
                              (with horror in her 
                              voice)
                         Mother!

                                     MIMI
                              (paying no attention)
                         And I'll give then proof!

               Dorothy turns and goes quickly from the room.

               HALLWAY OF APARTMENT.

               Dorothy comes out of the bedroom, blind with horror at 
               what her Mother is doing.  For a minute she stands there, 
               trying to collect herself.  Andy comes from the living 
               room, where he has been waiting for her.  He goes to her 
               and takes her in his arms. She looks up at him.

                                     ANDY
                              (with tremendous 
                              pity in his voice)
                         Dorry!

               For a minute she clings to him, crying,

                                     DOROTHY
                         Oh, Andy.

                                     ANDY
                         Don't cry.

                                     DOROTHY
                         I can't help it.  You don't 
                         know.....

                                     ANDY
                              (protectively)
                         Darling, you can't go through any 
                         more of this.  Now you get together 
                         your clothes and your skates and 
                         we'll go out to my family's in the 
                         country.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (she stops crying)
                         I can't.

                                     ANDY
                         You've got to get your mind off 
                         this.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (she pulls herself 
                              together)
                         You're sweet, but the only thing 
                         that you can do for me is to go.

                                     ANDY
                         Go!

                                     DOROTHY
                         And don't ever try to see me again.

                                     ANDY
                         What are you talking about?

                                     DOROTHY
                              (with rising 
                              excitement)
                         Please!  You can't get mixed up in 
                         this.

                                     ANDY
                         Do you think I care

                                     DOROTHY
                         You don't understand.  You don't 
                         know what's going to happen.

                                     ANDY
                         I only know I want to marry you... 
                         right now, and --

                                     DOROTHY
                         I can't marry you!  I can't ever 
                         marry you!

                                     ANDY
                         Dorothy!

                                     DOROTHY
                              (hysterically)
                         How would you like to have a couple 
                         of little murderers for your 
                         children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't 
                         it?  Maybe they'd murder each 
                         other...  keep it all in the family.  
                         That's what Father should have 
                         done.  He should have killed me 
                         and Gilbert... then we wouldn't 
                         have had this to go through.

                                     ANDY
                         You're talking like a crazy person,

                                     DOROTHY
                         Why not? I am crazy....the whole 
                         family's crazy.

                                     ANDY
                         Dorothy.... listen to me. I love 
                         you.  Don't you understand that?  
                         I love you.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Go away!

                                                                 CUT TO:

               LIVING ROOM - SHOOTING TOWARD HALL.

               Nora and Guild are waiting for Nick.  Gilbert is sitting 
               with a large book open in his hand.  Dorothy's voice comes 
               through.  The three in the living room cannot help but 
               hear.

                                     DOROTHY'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Go away!

               A door slams.  Andy is seen walking slowly past the living 
               room door, on his way out of the apartment.  Gilbert gets 
               up and goes quickly out.  Nora looks at Guild and sighs.

                                     NORA
                         Sleuthing isn't all fun, is it?  I 
                         feel so sorry for that poor girl -

               Nick comes in with the photograph of Jorgensen, which he 
               has taken from the frame.

                                     GUILD
                         Get anything?

                                     NICK
                         She's ready to talk.
                              (he hands Guild 
                              Jorgensen's 
                              photograph)
                         It won't do any harm, though - to 
                         find out where he is.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               DOROTHY'S BEDROOM.

               Dorothy is lying on the bed, face down.

               Gilbert walks up to her, his big book still in his hand.

                                     GILBERT
                         You know, you're wrong about all 
                         of your children being murderers...  
                         I've studied the Mendelian Law of 
                         inheritance and their experiments 
                         with sweet peas, and according to 
                         their findings... and they've been 
                         pretty conclusive... only one out 
                         of four of your children will be a 
                         murderer.  So the thing for you to 
                         do would be to have just three 
                         children...
                              (then as a thought 
                              comes to him)
                         ... no, no.  That might not work  
                         The first one might be the bad 
                         one.  I'll have to look that up.

               By this tine Dorothy gets up. She has a defiant look on 
               her face.

                                     DOROTHY
                         You needn't look it up.  I'm not 
                         going to get married and I'm not 
                         going to have any children.  From 
                         now on, I'm just out for the ride!

                                                                BACK TO:

               LIVING ROOM - MEDIUM ON GROUP.

               Mimi is showing Guild the watch chain.  Nick is watching 
               her closely. Nora is tense with interest.

                                     MIMI
                              (her voice quivering 
                              with forced emotion)
                         I took this from her hand.  It's 
                         Mr. Wynant's watch chain.
                              (Guild takes it 
                              from her)
                         I wanted to protect him.

               She breaks into tears.  Nick looks over at her sardonically. 
               Guild watches her with evident sympathy.  Guild gets up, 
               putting the watch chain carefully in his handkerchief.

                                     GUILD
                         I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. 
                         Charles?  He killed them both - 
                         Julia Wolf and Nunheim.

                                     NICK

                         This is enough for me.

               SERIES OF QUICK DISSOLVES:

               (a) POLICE RADIO ANNOUNCER AT MICROPHONE

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         Calling all cars - calling all 
                         cars - cover all

               ROADS LEAVING CITY - PICK UP CLYDE WYNANT -

               Clyde Wynant drag-net - pick up - etc.

               (b) GATE - GRAND CENTRAL STATION.

               A policeman stands at the gate scanning the passengers as 
               they go through. (Through this and ensuing vignettes, the 
               dull voice of the Police Announcer continues over the 
               flashes.  Entire effect designed to excitingly dramatize 
               the spreading of the net for the capture of Clyde Wynant.)

               (c) A PRINTING PRESS.

               It is running off police placards announcing the reward 
               for the capture of Clyde Wynant.

               (d) TELETYPE MACHINE.

               OVER THE MACHINE IS COMING:

               "Wynant wanted -- watch all stations -- boats and roads -- 
               description - thin man -- six feet -- white hair, etc., 
               etc."

               (e) NEWSPAPER TRUCK -- STREET CORNER.

               Newsboys are crowded around the back of the truck.  A man 
               is hurling packs of LATE EXTRAS down to the boys.  They 
               immediately begin calling out:

                                     NEWSBOYS
                         "Extra -- extra -- Wynant wanted 
                         in second murder --"
                         "Five Star Final" -- Wynant's ex-
                         wife produces murder evidence -- "
                         "Extra - extra -- double murder 
                         charge against Wynant --"

               Pictures of Wynant, most of them full length  (for the 
               desired effect of the tall, thin man) cover the front pages.  
               Second and third trucks can back into the scene, if desired.  
               Necessary, dramatically, to kick up the idea that the chase 
               for the killer is increasing to fever heat.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT ON NORA - AT WINDOW.

               She is at the window of their bedroom in the hotel Normandie 
               again.  We process through the window to get a background 
               of Central Park, South.  On SOUND TRACK from below we get 
               a carry-over of the newsboys' "Extra!  Extra!" from 
               preceding effects.  One shrill voice is heard in relief 
               against the others.  It is shouting: "Extra -- extra -- 
               police hunt Wynant --" Nora listens for a second and then 
               shuts the window, turning away from it.

                                     NORA
                         I wish they'd stop that.  It makes 
                         me fidgety. Do you think they'll 
                         find him, Nick?  He must be in New 
                         York....
                              (she stops short as 
                              CAMERA PULLS BACK 
                              and she sees Nick 
                              is in his overcoat, 
                              bending over Asta 
                              with a leash)
                         Where do you think you're going?

                                     NICK
                         I'm going to take Asta for a walk.

                                     NORA
                         He's just been for a walk.

                                     NICK
                         We're going sightseeing -- aren't 
                         we, Asta?

               He starts to go -- but Nora puts a hand on a bulge in his 
               overcoat pocket.

                                     NORA
                         What's that?
                              (she puts her hand 
                              in and pulls out a 
                              bunch of skeleton 
                              keys)
                         What are you up to?
                              (she puts her hand 
                              in and and pulls 
                              out a pistol - she 
                              unconsciously holds 
                              it, pointing at 
                              him)
                         Nickie - what is this?

                                     NICK
                              (putting his hands 
                              up)
                         Looks like a hold-up!

                                     NORA
                         What are you going to do?

                                     NICK
                         I've got hunch.  I'm going down to 
                         look at Wynant's shop, I want to 
                         find out why it's closed.

                                     NORA
                         Why shouldn't be close it? He went 
                         away.

                                     NICK
                         He went away lots of times when I 
                         knew him - but he never closed his 
                         shop. I've got a hunch something 
                         is up.

                                     NORA
                         You mean, he might be hiding there?

                                     NICK
                         I don't know...  This thing has 
                         got my goat. I've got to find out.

                                     NORA
                         Nick - I won't have you going down 
                         there.

                                     NICK
                         Say you're the one who got me in 
                         this!

                                     NORA
                         I know but this is different.  
                         He's a crazy man. He might kill 
                         you.

                                     NICK
                         I'll be all right.  I've got Asta 
                         to protect me.

                                     NORA
                              (waving him out)
                         Go on - go on - see if I care.  
                         But it's a dirty trick bringing me 
                         all the way to New York just to 
                         make me a widow.

                                     NICK
                         You wouldn't be a widow long.

                         You bet I wouldn't.

                         Not with all your money!

                              and for the first 
                              time really serious)
                         Nickie, take care of yourself won't

                         Sure I will.

                         Don't say it that way. Say it as 
                         if you meant it.

                                     NICK
                              (with mock solemnity)
                         Why, I believe the little woman 
                         cares.

                                     NORA
                         I don't care - I'm just used to 
                         you, that's all --
                              (Nick gives her an 
                              affectionate hug 
                              and a kiss. He 
                              calls to Asta. 
                              Nora turns to the 
                              dog, trying to 
                              hide her emotion 
                              under a pretense 
                              of clowning)
                         If you let anything happen to him, 
                         you'll never wag that tail again!

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. OF WYNANT'S SHOP - LIGHTING EFFECT

               The street is deserted. The light from the street lamps is 
               very dim.  A cab drives up before the shop.  The door of 
               the cab opens and Asta jumps out, and makes a bee-line for 
               a hydrant.  Nick follows him, still in his evening clothes.  
               He turns to pay he driver, who is looking dubiously at the 
               neighborhood.  Driver Sure this is the place you want?

                                     NICK
                         This is it.

                                     DRIVER
                              (looking 
                              apprehensively at 
                              the street)
                         You don't want me to wait, do you?

                                     NICK
                         No thanks.
                              (Nick pays him)

                                     DRIVER
                              (with a last look, 
                              he says dubiously)
                         Well .... good luck!

               He drives off.  The street is quiet.  Nick turns toward 
               the shop.  Nick stands for a second looking at the building, 
               then turns to Asta.

                                     NICK
                              (to Asta)
                         Ready?  Well, let's go.

               He goes to the front door of the shop.  He tries it.  It 
               is locked.  From his pocket he takes out a ring with 
               skeleton keys on it.

               Holding his flashlight on the key hole, he finally finds 
               the key that opens it.  He pushes the door slowly open.  
               He holds it open, looking back at Asta.

                                     NICK
                         You keep quiet now. Come on.

               But Asta doesn't like the looks of the place. He doesn't 
               move.  Nick snaps his fingers for him to come and Asta 
               finally, reluctantly follows him.

               INTERIOR BUILDING -- TRUCKING AND PANNING

               On Nick as he makes his way down the narrow little hall, 
               guided by his flashlight.  Asta trails, still reluctantly.  
               Nick is familiar with the old building so that he does not 
               lose time in reaching the rear, where he goes down the 
               steps, cautiously, to the basement.

               MACHINE SHOP AND STOREROOM IN BASEMENT - LONG SHOT

               (This room leads to Wynant's private work-shop as 
               established earlier.)

               Nick moves stealthily through the storeroom, flashing his 
               light here and there on crates, boxes of machinery, etc.  
               It is a weird scene, at any moment you must feel that 
               Wynant, or some foe will spring from behind the objects.  
               (His figure is mostly in silhouette during, the scene.  He 
               flashes his light in quick short flashes.)

               Nick sees a moving shadow.  Asta starts to growl.  Nick 
               whips out his gun.  Then throws the light of his flashlight 
               onto a pile of

               [NOTE: Sorry -- page missing. The "moving shadow" turns 
               out to be a cat.]

               nothing that will help him. He is starting out, when he 
               misses Asta. He calls him softly. We hear the dog whine.

                                     NICK
                              (to Asta)
                         Well, come along, then...

               Still the dog does not come. We hear him whine again.  
               Nick flashes his light around until it lights on the dog.  
               Asta is in the center of the floor.  He has his ears back.  
               He is sniffing at the floor. Nick keeping his flashlight 
               on Asta, comes back.  He leans down to the floor, running 
               his hand over the cement.

                                     NICK
                              (softly)
                         You're not a Scottish Terrier.  
                         You're a police dog.  New cement.

               He gets up briskly and looks around, using his flashlight, 
               to find a tool.  He finds an iron bar.  Placing the light 
               so that it falls on the floor.  Nick takes the iron bar.  
               He pounds on the floor.  Over the place where Asta was 
               whining, the cement gives out a hollow sound.  Nick takes 
               the bar in both hands, throws his whole strength into it, 
               trying to force it through the floor.  It finally goes 
               through.  Nick leans down, and a startled, horrified look 
               comes in his face.  He puts down the bar, picks up Asta, 
               who is flattened on the floor, watching him, takes his 
               flashlight and goes quickly toward the stairs.  He climbs 
               rapidly.

               CRANE SHOT -- FLIGHT OF STAIRS LEADING TO WYNANT'S OFFICE 
               ON SECOND FLOOR.  (AS EARLIER ESTABLISHED.)

               He uses his flashlight to find his way. The stairway, being 
               as old as the building, CREAKS as he walks.  WE CONTINUE 
               TO CRANE until he reaches the second floor and cautiously 
               enters the old office.

               WYNANT'S OFFICE - FULL SHOT.

               All is pitch dark as he follows his flashlight to the 
               telephone, dials the number, then extinguishes the light.

                                     NICK
                              (in telephone)
                         Hello, Lieutenant Guild, please... 
                         John?  This is Charles.  I'm up in 
                         Wynant's shop.  Well, I've found 
                         something... it's a body.

               He puts down the telephone.  Using his flashlight, he goes 
               to the desk and begins to look through the papers there.

               EFFECT SHOT -- CAMERA AT BOTTOM OF STAIRWAY, SHOOTING UP.

               On the figure of a man as it is quietly going up the same 
               stairway that Nick took, slowly going toward the office.  
               He has no light, but by his unhesitating steps, we gather 
               that he is familiar with the building. The steps creak a 
               little.

                                                                BACK TO:

               WYNANT'S OFFICE  - CLOSE SHOT ON NICK.

               He is still rummaging over the desk.  Suddenly he stands 
               rigid.  He has heard a step.  He puts out his flashlight 
               and whirls around to face the door.  At this instant, CAMERA 
               SWINGS OVER TO:

               THE DOOR

               As the man's figure appears.  As he starts to come in, 
               Nick's flashlight is thrown full on his face, blinding 
               him.  We see that it is Tanner.

                                     NICK'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Stick 'em up!

               Tanner, terrified by the light and the sharp command from 
               the darkness, puts up his hands.  Asta begins to bark.  
               Keeping the light full on Tanner's face, Nick swiftly 
               searches him.  Satisfied that Tanner has no gun, Nick goes 
               to an electric light switch.

                                     NICK
                              (as he does this)
                         Don't make a move or that dog will 
                         tear you to shreds!

               He switches on the light.  Tanner looks in, blinking 
               amazement and fear, first at Nick, and then at --

               BIG CLOSEUP OF ASTA

               He has crawled under the desk and lies there, looking out 
               fearfully.

                                                                BACK TO:

               MEDIUM ON NICK AND TANNER

               Nick grins a little at Asta's fear and Tanner's 
               bewilderment.

                                     NICK
                         Come on out, now.  He won't hurt 
                         you.
                              (then to Tanner, 
                              with a return of 
                              his brisk, 
                              professional tone)
                         Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?

                                     TANNER
                         No, Mr. Charles.

                                     TANNER
                         I had a key. I worked here... till 
                         they closed the shop.

                                     NICK
                         You worked here?

                         Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job 
                         as bookkeeper.

                                     NICK

                         bookkeeper!  When were you ever a 
                         bookkeeper?

                                     TANNER
                         That time you sent me up last ... 
                         I learned book-keeping at Sing 
                         Sing.  I figured it might be an in 
                         for me somewhere's.

                                     NICK
                         Somewhere's where they might go 
                         out and leave the safe open?

                                     TANNER
                         Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never 
                         touched that safe.  Them bonds 
                         that were missing... Julia took 
                         them.

                                     NICK
                         Trying to put it off on her?

                                     TANNER
                         Mr. Charles - she did - that's why 
                         he got sore at her and killed her.  
                         Listen, Mr. Charles --
                              (he pulls out some 
                              bills)
                         I did do a little chiseling.  I 
                         come to bring it back and fix up 
                         the books.  I didn't want him to
                         find out and come after me -

                                     NICK
                         You can save that and tell it to 
                         the police.  They'll be here in a 
                         minute.

                                     TANNER
                              (a hunted look comes 
                              into his face)
                         Police!

               He shrinks back, aghast, as at this moment we hear the 
               sound of sirens from police cars arriving outside.  Asta 
               crawls back under the desk.

               EXTERIOR WYNANT'S SHOP - STREET - NIGHT.

               There is a rising crescendo of sirens as Guild's police 
               car, and the Medical Examiner's car swing around the corner, 
               accompanied by a motorcycle escort.  They pull to a stop 
               at the front of the shop.  The police and Dr.  Walton, 
               with his assistant, get out of the cars and go to the door 
               of the building.  There are police photographers with them.  
               Nick, with Tanner in his custody, is waiting at the door 
               of the shop.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               WYNANT'S SHOP - BASEMENT.

               The floor is dug up more than in the last scene, so that 
               the body is exposed enough for the photographers.  Guild, 
               Nick, Dr. Walton, Tanner and the rest of the police stand 
               aside as the photographers take their flashlight pictures 
               from different angles.  Guild is putting on a pair of 
               gloves.  Dr. Walton is preparing to do his work.  Nick, in 
               his evening clothes and his casual air, is an incongruous 
               note in the midst of all the professional excitement.  As 
               the photographers finish, Guild steps up to the hole in 
               the floor.  He turns to Tanner, who is watching, horrified.

                              (to Tanner)
                         You didn't know anything about all 
                         this?

                                     TANNER
                         No, sir....

                              (to one of the police)
                         Take him down to the can.  I'll 
                         see him later.

               The policeman goes out with Tanner. Guild looks down into 
               the hole.

                                     GUILD
                              (he gives a low 
                              whistle)
                         I wonder what Wynant had against 
                         this one?  Quick lime. Well at 
                         least the clothes weren't touched.

               The Medical Examiner comes up and stands beside him.

                                     GUILD
                         Mind if I take those out, Doc?

                                     DR. WALTON
                         Go ahead.

               Guild stoops down and takes out a bundle of clothes.  The 
               CAMERA PANS with him as he takes them over to a work table 
               and starts to open them up.  Nick strolls over and stands 
               watching him.

                              (looking at the 
                              bundle of clothes)
                         Just rolled them up and threw them 
                         in.

                         Lucky thing for us they weren't in 
                         that lime.

                         Extraordinarily lucky.

               Guild pulls a coat from the bundle.  It is a large coat, 
               slightly eaten by the lime.  Guild picks it up and examines 
               it for a tailor's label.

                         Here's something, Bob comes into 
                         the scene.  He hands Guild a walking 
                         stick.  Guild takes it and examines 
                         it.

                         lame.

               Guild looks at it. He finds some initials engraved on the

                         I can't say offhand.  At least a 
                         couple of months...

                                     GUILD
                         Couple of months.  That's just 
                         when he closed the shop.  The way 
                         I figure it is... he kills this 
                         guy and plants him here.  Julia 
                         knows about it, so he kills her.  
                         And Nunheim caught him at that, so 
                         he he had to bump off Nunheim.
                              (he makes a bundle 
                              of the clothes)
                         Well, we'll be going along.
                              (to Nick)
                         You done a swell job.  You wouldn't 
                         like to pay me that hundred now?

                                     NICK
                         Wait 'till you catch Wynant.

               Nick walks over to the Medical Examiner who is putting on 
               his coat, preparatory to going.  The Medical Examiner speaks 
               to his assistant, indicating the wrapped up body, out of 
               the scene.

                                     DR. WALTON
                         You can take that out to the car.

                                     NICK
                         Going to run him through the 
                         fluoroscope?

                                     DR. WALTON
                         Yes.

                                     NICK
                         Do you mind if I come down and see 
                         it?

                                     DR. WALTON
                         Not at all.

                                     NICK
                         I'm very interested in that body.

               By this time Guild is ready to go.  He turns to Nick, the 
               bundle of clothes under his arm.

                                     GUILD
                         Give my best to your wife.

               He turns to go out, almost bumping into a figure in the 
               semi-darkness. It is apparently a slender boy, his coat 
               collar high about his neck, and his hat pulled down over 
               his eyes.  Nick spies him at the same time and comes toward 
               him.  Guild speaks sharply to the boy.

                                     GUILD
                              (to the boy)
                         What're you doing here?

                                     NICK
                              (to Guild - knowing 
                              who it is)
                         I'll take care of him.

               Guild grunts and continues on his way.  Nick takes the boy 
               by the arm, and unceremoniously hustles him out.  Nick has 
               Asta under his other arm.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               EXT. OF BUILDING

               Nick hustles the boy into a taxicab, and follows him in, 
               speaking to the driver as he gets in.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               CLOSEUP OF NICK

               Nick is seated in the cab.  He is looking with a 
               disapproving scowl at his companion.

                                     NICK
                         What do you think you are?

               The CAMERA PANS to his companion.  We see that it is Nora.  
               She is dressed in Nick's clothes.  She has even used some 
               of her hair to make a mustache.  She looks at Nick with a 
               twinkle in her eye, and strokes the points of her mustache 
               in imitation of him as she speaks.

                                     NORA
                         I'm a 'de-tect-uf'.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSEUP OF FLUOROSCOPE.  (Police Laboratory)

               The light of the fluoroscope comes through the skeleton of 
               the body.  The Medical Examiner's hand comes into the shot, 
               pointing to a dark spot in the left side of the body, near 
               the heart.

                                     DR. WALTON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         There's the bullet he was killed 
                         with.  See?

                                     NICK'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         What's this?

               His hand comes into the shot, pointing to a smaller speck 
               in the shin bone.  THE CAMERA NOW PULLS back to show the 
               two men in Dr.  Walton's laboratory looking at the body 
               under the fluoroscope.  Dr. Walton looks closer.

                                     DR. WALTON
                         Oh, just an old piece of shrapnel.

               An idea comes to Nick.  He is piecing things together in 
               his mind.

                                     NICK
                         Shrapnel!

                                     DR. WALTON
                              (still inspecting)
                         Must have been in the war.  That 
                         might account for the cane and his 
                         limp.

                                     NICK
                              (thinking of 
                              something else)
                         Yes... yes.

               AS WE 

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               SERIES OF EFFECT FLASHES -- THIRD MURDER --

               POLICE DRAGNET

               In terrific tempo, with the elongated shadow of the Thin 
               Man behind the flashes, we bring in, kaleidoscopically, 
               police teletypes -- radio broadcasts -- telephone and 
               telegraph -- wireless -- radio cars, etc.  Chief among 
               these effects are superimposed closeups of police and 
               detective chiefs as they talk into phones, firing their 
               orders.  By the nature of the uniforms worn by the police 
               captains, we must achieve the idea that the man-hunt is 
               NATION WIDE. 

               Also SUPERIMPOSED are newspaper headlines, tabloids, etc.,

               SCREAMING OUT:

               "WYNANT HUNTED IN THIRD MURDER --" 

               "WYNANT VICTIM BURIED IN BASEMENT --"

               "HORROR MURDER LAID TO WYNANT --" 

               "WYNANT BODY NUMBER THREE DUG UP IN CEMENT --" etc., etc. 

               Also, on SOUND TRACK, through radio and telephone, we hear 
               continuous voices as they report: "WYNANT SEEN HERE -- 
               WYNANT SEEN THERE --" etc.

               These are Vorkapich shots, and conclude with thrilling 
               flashes of automobiles being stopped on roads by traffic 
               officers, squad cars racing to and fro from headquarters, 
               etc.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSEUP OF ASTA.

               The dog is standing on a table. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to 
               show the living room of Nick's suite.  The reporters are 
               on Nick's trail again.  The floor is littered with 
               newspapers.

               Nora, in negligee, is being interviewed by a 'sob sister'.  
               Nick is near the table where the drinks are surrounded by 
               reporters.

               A newspaper photographer is taking Asta's picture as he 
               stands on the table.

                              down near the floor)
                         Hey... doggie, doggie.  Look down 
                         at the body!
                         Look down at the body!
                              (Asta looks down at 
                              the man's hand and 
                              the flashlight 
                              flares up. The 
                              photographer 
                              hurriedly goes to

                         Just one family group.

                         woman's page.

               Nick goes to stand beside Nora, and the photographer puts 
               Asta in Nora's arms. The reporters follow Nick, asking him 
               questions.

                                     1ST REPORTER
                         Have the police got any idea where

                                     NICK

                         I know they will.

               The flashlights flare again.  Nick moves away.

                                     3RD REPORTER
                         Got anything else to say about the

                         Yes.  It's put me way behind in my 
                         drinking.

               He starts for the table where the liquor is.

               Music of a small string orchestra is coming from the 
               adjoining balcony.  A table is set in the background for 
               fourteen people.  The waiters are quietly putting the the 
               last touches to the table.  The head waiter is passing 
               around a last tray of cocktails.  The CAMERA TRUCKS with 
               him as we pick up the different people.  He goes first to 
               Andrew who is standing by himself, very forlorn looking.  
               Then to Mimi, Tanner and Gilbert who are a little isolated 
               group.... not knowing what is going on, and looking very 
               suspiciously at the other guests.  He goes on to a group 
               made up of Nora, Guild, Marian and Morelli.  Nora is hanging 
               on to the two men's words. The head waiter goes on to Nick 
               and Macaulay.

                         at him.

                         I want some more of that tiger 
                         milk.

               She starts off to get another drink.  Morelli looks after 
               her admiringly.

               Nora is near the dinner table with Guild beside her.  
               Marian, Macaulay, Mimi, Gilbert, Tanner and Morelli are 
               nearby.

                         I think we may as well sit down.

                         I guess all the suspects are here.

               There is a second of stunned amazement on the people's 
               faces.

                                     NORA
                         Mr. Guild means guests!

                         They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My

                                     NORA
                              (beaming at him)
                         You're a great help to a hostess.  
                         I wish I always had you for my 
                         dinner parties.

               Nora starts to seat the guests.

                                     MIMI
                              (looking toward the 
                              door)
                         Chris!

               She walks rapidly out of the scene, and

               WE PAN WITH HER TO THE:

               DOORWAY.

               Jorgensen and a woman have come in the door.  She is a 
               hard-faced, common woman, who looks as if she could handle 
               any situation.  They are standing there angry and 
               belligerent.  There are a couple or plain-clothes men with 
               them.

                                     NICK
                         I'm Nick Charles. How do you do?

               Mimi rushes up to Jorgensen.

                                     MIMI
                         Chris, where have you been?

               She stops as she sees the other woman.  One of the plain-
               clothesmen speaks to Nick.

                                     PLAIN-CLOTHESMAN
                         Sorry we're late.  But they had to 
                         break down the door.

               Mimi bristles at this.  She gives the woman a withering 
               look and walks out of the scene. Nick watches with great 
               amusement.

                                     NICK
                              (to Jorgensen and 
                              the woman)
                         Won't you come in?

               The two reluctantly follow him further into the room.  
               Nick follows them, rubbing his hands with delighted 
               anticipation of the scene to follow.  The CAMERA PANS WITH 
               HIM as goes to the table.  The people are all seated with 
               the exception of Mimi, Jorgensen and the woman with him, 
               and Nick.  Nora is watching the new arrivals with eager 
               interest.  Nick looks at her and gives her a broad wink.

                                     NICK
                              (turning to Jorgensen)
                         Mr. Jorgensen, you sit next to 
                         Andrew, and Mrs.  Jorgensen on 
                         your right.

               Both Mimi and the woman who came in with Jorgensen, start 
               for the chair which Jorgensen is holding.  As they find 
               themselves both going for the same chair, Mimi draws herself 
               up with great dignity.

                                     MIMI
                         I'm Mrs. Jorgensen.

               Mimi starts to sit.

                                     THE WOMAN
                              (drily, as she points 
                              to an empty chair 
                              across the table)
                         Put it over there.  I was Mrs. 
                         Jorgensen before you were.

               Mimi looks at Jorgensen, bewildered.  But he refuses to 
               meet her eye.  The other woman sits down firmly in the 
               chair.  Nick, from the head of the table, calls to Mimi.

                                     NICK
                         Mimi.... you're here on my right.

               He holds her chair for her as she comes and sits down.  
               The waiters start in immediately to serve dinner.

                                                                 CUT TO:

               Nick holds Nora's chair for her.

                                     NORA
                         You give such charming parties,

                         Thank you, Mrs. Charles.

               Nora sits - she whispers to Nick.

                                     NORA
                         I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, 
                         do you think one of them did it?

                                     NICK
                         Yes.

                         I wish you'd tell me.

               Nick sits down at the head of the table.

                                                                 CUT TO:

                         I've seen Wynant.

               They all turn and look at him with curiosity.  Guild looks 
               amazed. Mimi is very composed.

               Nick and Nora exchange looks.  Nora is bewildered.

                         He didn't say very much.  Wanted

                         children were.

                         Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why 
                         I know Wynant didn't commit those 
                         murders -
                              (he turns to Morelli)
                         Three months ago - the night that 
                         he caught you in Julia's apartment, 
                         he found out that Julia was cheating 
                         him, and was splitting with some 
                         man.  He went to find the man.  
                         That man was.... Tanner, don't 
                         you...?

               But poor Tanner, thinking that Nick is naming him as the 
               man, spills his soup over everything.  Everybody turns and 
               looks suspiciously at him. Nick sees that he has startled 
               him and apologizes)

                         I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want 
                         some wine?

                         yes.  He went to find the man.  
                         That man was desperate!  He knew 
                         that he was caught dead to rights -- 
                         and with prison staring him in the 
                         face, he took the only way out.  
                         He killed Wynant.

               She breaks down and cries.  She gets up from the table.  
               Nora starts to go to her.  but Andy is there before her.  
               He takes Dorothy in his arms, oblivious of the other people 
               in the room and comforts her.

                         really better this way?

               Andy looks over at Nick.  Nick motions him to take her 
               away.

                         Come on, darling.

               With his arms around her, he starts out of the room.  
               Dorothy clings to him as they go out.  Quinn gets up to 
               follow.  There is a silence in the room for a minute after 
               they go.

                         spoiled your trip.

               Nora return to the table.

                         He planned the whole thing 
                         beautifully. After he killed Wynant 
                         he wired Macaulay, using Wynant's 
                         name and told him to shut up the 
                         shop.  He destroyed all of Wynant's 
                         clothes, with the exception of his 
                         watch chain.  He figured that some 
                         day that might come in handy.  
                         Then he took Wynant's body and 
                         buried it in the shop with another 
                         man's clothes to throw us off the 
                         track.  He even put a belt buckle 
                         with an "R" on it, hoping that 
                         we'd think it was Rosebreen -- an 
                         old enemy of Wynant's who dropped 
                         out of sight years ago.

                         After our hero had killed Wynant, 
                         he got a brilliant idea.  He 
                         realized that he and Julia could 
                         still collect money.  Wynant was 
                         supposed to be on a trip - no one 
                         knew where - so our dinner guest 
                         wrote letters to Macaulay, signing 
                         Wynant's name, so that Macaulay 
                         would continue to send the money
                         to Julia.  He even telephoned 
                         Macaulay --
                              (to Macaulay)
                         Do you remember?.... the first day 
                         that you came to see me... he 
                         telephoned that he was in town?

                         But it must have been Wynant.  I 
                         should have known if it weren't 
                         his voice.

                         Oh he as clever about that.  He 
                         called when you were out.  That 
                         same afternoon, Julia telephoned 
                         to him. She said that you were 
                         coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant.  
                         He got terrified. He was afraid 
                         that Julia would break down and 
                         tell... so he went to Julia and 
                         killed her and left Wynant's watch 
                         chain in her hand.

                         His plan was still working 
                         beautifully. Wynant was established 
                         as being in town.  The watch chain 
                         was handed over....
                              (with a look at 
                              Mimi)
                         ...with a slight delay...to the 
                         police. The only hitch was a man 
                         named Nunheim who had found out 
                         something.  Our hero paid Nunheim 
                         once to keep his mouth shut, and 
                         when Nunheim threatened him again, 
                         he bumped him off.

                         You see, he'd been very clever. 
                         Everybody, even our astute friend 
                         Guild, thought that Wynant was 
                         alive and that he was the murderer.  
                         But our hero had just one weak 
                         link in his chain.  The telegrams, 
                         wires and telephones were all very 
                         well - but no one had seen Wynant.  
                         So he picked on poor Mimi here to 
                         strengthen his case.  Mimi is the 
                         only one at the table who can tell 
                         us who the real murderer is.

                              Mimi)
                         Mimi, who was it that told you to 
                         say you'd seen Wynant?

                         getting a good price for saying 
                         you saw Wynant and you figure you 
                         won't get anything if he's dead.

                         was to go to the children.

               CLOSE UP - FOUR CHAMPAGNE GLASSES

               A small traveling Victrola is playing a gay tune.  The 
               glasses are held up by four hands.

               WE DISSOLVE THROUGH them to show the drawing room of a 
               train.  Dorothy and Nora are sitting facing each other, 
               dressed in robes and lounging pajamas, and Andy and Nick 
               are sitting beside them, also in robes and pajamas.  Nick 
               is pouring champagne from a bottle into the four glasses.  
               The drawing room is full of flowers.  Nick puts down the 
               bottle and holds up his glass in a toast.

                         And to you two too.

               OVER THE SOUND TRACK we hear the train whistle go "Toot-
               toot" at a crossing.  The four raise their glasses in a 
               toast and drink.  There is a buzz at the door.

                                     ANDY
                         Come!

               A good-natured colored porter sticks his head in the door 
               and speaks to Nick.

                                     PORTER
                         Your room's ready, sir.

                                     NICK
                         Thanks.  You can take Asta now.

               Nora goes to where Asta is lying asleep.  She picks him 
               up.

                                     NORA

                         bed in the baggage car.

               She hands the dog to the porter.  As the porter is starting 
               out, he sees Dorothy's bridal bouquet in the bracket in 
               the corner of the drawing room.

                              bouquet)
                         Shall I keep them fresh for you?

                         Please, if you will.

               The porter takes the flowers and Asta and goes out.  There 
               is a pause.  Simultaneously, Andy and Nick sneak a look at 
               the wrist watches.  Andy looks up and catches Nick looking 
               at his.  Nick is embarrassed but determined to call Nora's 
               attention to the late hour.

                                     NICK
                         Might as well set it ahead now.

               Nick starts to set his watch.  Nora leans over, is startled 
               to see how late it is.

                                     NORA

               She leans over Dorothy and kisses her affectionately.

               Dorothy clings to Nora for a minute.

               There are mingled "good nights" as Nick and Nora go out 
               the door.  As soon as the door closes, Andy takes Dorothy 
               in his arms.

               He kisses Dorothy affectionately.

               NICK AND NORA'S DRAWING ROOM.

               Nick is closing the door of their room.  As soon as it 
               snaps shut.... they are in each other's arms.

               BAGGAGE CAR -- PANNING ON PORTER.

               As he enters, Asta on one arm, flowers in the other.  He 
               is about to put Asta down on the blanket for the night 
               when he stops -- looks o.s.  CAMERA PANS OVER to show 
               another dog of the same breed as Asta in a small crate.  
               The dog is looking up at Asta eagerly.  And Asta's ears go 
               up and his tail begins to wag as he anticipates the 
               possibilities of a transcontinental romance.

               And he puts Asta into the crate with Fifi .... places the 
               BRIDAL BOUQUET on top of the crate ... turns and shuffles 
               out as we are --
