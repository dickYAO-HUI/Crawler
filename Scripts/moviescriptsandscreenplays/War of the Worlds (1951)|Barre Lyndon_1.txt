2.      SPECIAL EFFECT - SKY FULL OF STARS
 
        The planet Mars shows just above the spires and roof-
        tops of a city on the horizon.

               watched keenly and closely by
               intelligences greater than man's.
 
        Mars is picked out of the sky and brought to the screen
        as if by some enormous telescope with an infinite field.
        It becomes a small ball.  Enlarges to a pallid disk.
        Comes to moon size.
 
                          VOICE
               No one gave a thought to the older
               worlds as a source of human danger.
               Yet across the gulf of space, on the
               planet Mars...
 
        Now Mars has grown big and ruddy-colored.  Mysterious
        canals revealed.  Vegetation patches shadowy.  One thin
        polar cap shimmering.
 
                          VOICE
               Intellects vast and cool and unsym-
               pathetic regarded our earth with envious
               eyes, slowly and surely drawing their

               Mars is more than one hundred and
               forty million miles from the sun, and
               for centuries it has been in the last

               thousands of pounds to the square inch.
               On Mars it is only four pounds.  They
               couldn't go there.  Nor to Venus, which
               has no oxygen and no water.  Nor could they

        nearby box: coffee, rolls, butter, honey, canned
        fruit, fried tomatoes.  Extra helpings of fish simmer
        in the pan.  A beat-up station wagon lurches out of
        the darkness in b.g.  The three look up, surprised.
        Fiddler, the deputy ranger from the lookout post, alights.
 
                           FIDDLER
                    (Calling)
               I got a message for you.
                    (Moving in)
               You're the guys from Pacific-Tech,
               ain't you?
 
                           CLAYTON
               Right.
 
                           FIDDLER
                    (Eyeing pan)
               Looks like the fishing was good.
 
                           BILDERBECK
               Have some?
 
                           FIDDLER
                    (Eagerly - hitching
                     over a box)
               Well...I might just do that...!
 
 
23.     MED. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP
 
        Fiddler reaches for a plate, then helps himself
        liberally to everything in sight - most of the
        remaining fish, two rolls, a hunk of butter, coffee.
        The others stop eating and watch him.
 
                           FIDDLER
                    (Talking between grabs)
               It's about that meteor.  They say it's
               a whopper.  The District Officer phoned
               us at the lookout up on the summit.
               Thought you might be interested...
               It's ten or twelve miles from here -
               over by Linda Rosa.
 
                           CLAYTON
               Are they sure it's a meteor?  It
               didn't come down like one.
 
                           FIDDLER
                    (Gesturing with fish
                     on his fork)
               That's right - came down in kinda
               spurts, didn't it?
                    (Gobbles fish)
               You fellers'll have to figure it
               out.  You're scientists
                    (Puts down fork- plucks
                     cigarette from Bilderbeck's
                     shirt pocket)
               All I know - they say it's as big as
               a house and practically red hot.
 
                           CLAYTON
                    (To Bilderbeck)
               I'd like to borrow your car and take
               a look at it in the morning.
 
        Bilderbeck nods.  Pryor looks toward the plane in
        the meadow in b.g.
 
                           PRYOR
               We ought to get back to Pasadena.
                    (Gesturing)
               I can fly Bilderbeck down in your plane.
 
                           CLAYTON
               Okay, if he's willing.
                    (Grinning)
               The insurance is paid up.
 
        Bilderbeck takes a stick from the fire and holds it
        out to Fiddler, who is eating again, holding the
        cigarette.
 
                           BILDERBECK
               Want a light?
 
                           FIDDLER
                    (Glancing)
               No.  I'll smoke it later.
 
        He tucks the cigarette behind his ear and goes on
        eating.
 
        DISSOLVE:
 
 
24.     EXT. GULLY & DIRT ROAD - (EARLY MORNING)
 
        The meteor still lies in the gully, heat-hazed, a
        little thin smoke rising, burned grass and bushes
        in b.g.  On the bank of the gully, a woman is kodaking
        two kids against the b.g. of the meteor.  Beyond,
        a few old cars and a station wagon have pulled off
        the dirt road; nearby is Pastor Collins' three-year-
        old Plymouth.
 
 
25.     EXT. GULLY & DIRT ROAD - MED. SHOT - GROUP
 
        Sylvia is sitting behind the wheel in Pastor Collins'
        car.  The Pastor is talking to the uniformed Ranger.
        With them are Wash Perry, Alonzo Hogue, Salvador,
        Fiddler.  A handful of people is scattered in b.g.,
        eyeing the meteor, talking about it.
 
                          RANGER
                    (Pointing)
               It must have hit way up there, and
               then skidded along the gully.  When
               it stopped, all that loose earth and
               stuff shook down over it.
 
                          SYLVIA
               It's probably a stray from a swarm
               of meteors.
 
                          ALONZO HOGUE
                    (To Pastor)
               I reckon most of it's buried.
 
                          FIDDLER
               That's twelve feet thick, easy.
               Maybe more.
 
                          ALONZO HOGUE
               Meteors always run heavy.  They won't
               be able to haul this one away to no
               museum!
                    (Speculatively)
               It'll be a real good attraction for
               Sunday drivers.
 
                          WASH PERRY
               Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit.
               We won't have to feed it!
 
                          SALVADOR
               We sell the tamales, enchiladas -
               hot dogs!
 
                          FIDDLER
               Ice cream, cold drinks, souvenirs!
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
               I think we should put up a few
               picnic tables...
 
                          ALONZO HOGUE
                    (Quickly)
               Naw, naw -- then they'd bring their
               own lunches!
 
 
26.     GROUP - OUTSIDE THE GULLY
 
        'BUCK' MONAHAN - in service station overalls - passes
        the group, carrying a shovel, headed for the meteor.
        In b.g. a convertible pulls off the dirt road.
 
                          FIDDLER
               What's the idea, Buck?  Gonna dig
               for gold?
 
                          BUCK
                    (Indicating meteor)
               This is gonna be like having a gold
               mine in our own back yard!
 
                          PASTOR COLLLINS
                    (To Sylvia)
               I'm going to get a closer look at it.
 
        The men come forward, PAST CAMERA.  Sylvia pulls out
        the car keys, reaches for her purse.  The convertible
        bumps up, stops.  The back is loaded with camping
        gear and clustered fishing rods.  Clayton Forrester
        gets out, looking toward the gully.  Sylvia glances
        at him as she starts after the others, opening her
        purse.  A faint ticking SOUND comes overscene.
 
                          CLAYTON
               Is that it over there?
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Searching purse)
               Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
 
 
27.     GROUP - FROM THE GULLY
 
        as Buck comes on toward the meteor with his shovel.
        Pastor Collins and the others pause to watch him.
 
                          BUCK
                    (Calling back)
               It's still pretty darned hot!
 
 
28.     MED. CLOSE SHOT - BUCK AND METEOR
 
        He shields his face, reaching out, probing with his
        shovel trying to determine the size of the meteor.
 
 
29.     TWO SHOT - CLAYTON AND SYLVIA - HIS CAR IN B.G.
 
        He is looking toward the gully.  She now has a ciga-
        rette.  They pause as she begins looking for matches.
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Rummaging in purse)
               Did you see it come down?
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Absently, studying
                     gully and meteor)
               Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Glancing back at car)
               You must have caught plenty with
               all that tackle!
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Glancing, smiling)
               Oh - there were three of us.
                    (Starting forward)
               The others flew back in my plane.
                    (Pausing again - looking o.s.)
               I don't understand why a meteor this
               size didn't make a bigger crater.
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Definite)
               It hit sideways and skidded in.
 
        He glances at her, a little amused.  She catches his
        eye.
 
                          SYLVIA (Cont'd)
                    (Easily)
               At least, that's what I think.  I
               don't really know.
                    (At purse)
               But the Ranger says a scientist is
               coming from Pacific-Tech.  He'll
               tell us.
                    (And then)
               Clayton Forrester.  Ever hear of him?
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Looking o.s. - changing
                     the subject)
               What's that fellow over there trying
               to do - dig it out?
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Over him, not hearing)
               He's top man in astro and nuclear
               physics.  He knows all about meteors!
 
 
30.     CLOSE SHOT - MOVING
 
        FAVORING Clayton, as they move on.  Clayton is
        secretly amused, and a little flattered.
 
                          CLAYTON
               You seem to know a lot about him.
 
                          SYLVIA
               Well, I did a thesis on modern scien-
               tists - working for my Masters degree.
 
                          CLAYTON
               Did it do you any good?
 
                          SYLVIA
               Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have
               a match?
 
                          CLAYTON
               I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Going on, enthusiastic)
               Forrester's the man behind the new
               atomic engines.  They had him on the
               cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate
               to get that!
 
                          CLAYTON
               Aw, he isn't that good...!
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Protesting, stopping)
               How can you say that when you don't
               know him!
 
 
31.     TWO SHOT - CLAYTON AND SYLVIA
 
                          CLAYTON
               I do know him...slightly.
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Interested at once)
               What's he like?
 
                          CLAYTON
               Like...ah...
 
        Clayton hesitates, points to himself.  She stares,
        then gets it.  For a moment she is provoked, then
        she bursts naturally into laughter.  He laughs with
        her.
 
                          SYLVIA
               Well, you certainly don't look like
               yourself in that get-up!
                    (Laughing still,
                     offering hand)
               But I am happy to meet you anyway.
               I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach
               Library Science over at USC.
 
                          CLAYTON
               I didn't know how to stop you...!
 
                          SYLVIA
               I might have recognized you without
               the beard.  And you didn't wear
               glasses on the 'Time' cover!
 
                          CLAYTON
               They're really for long distance.
               When I want to look at something
               close...
                    (Removing glasses,
                     bending to her)
               I take them off.
 
 
32.     GROUP - FROM THE GULLY
 
        Buck is backing off, blowing running with sweat.
        Clayton and Sylvia approach from b.g.
 
                          GROUP - AD LIBS
                    (Kidding)
               You gonna quit? -- Roll up your
               sleeves, Buck! -- We thought you
               were gonna dig it out by yourself.
 
        Buck joins the group, wiping sweat.  CAMERA MOVES IN
        as Clayton comes up with Sylvia.
 
                          BUCK
               Boy - you could fry eggs on it!
 
                          CLAYTON
               All that sand will keep the heat
               in for a long time.
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (To Pastor Collins)
               Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton
               Forrester.
                    (To Clayton)
               My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor
               of the Community Church.
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
                    (Offering hand, pleased)
               Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Courteous - warm)
               How d'you do, sir?
 
                          SHERIFF'S VOICE (O.s.)
                    (Excitedly calling)
               Hey - you!
 
        All look quickly.
 
 
33.     EXT. CLAYTON'S CAR - CLOSE SHOT - MOVING SHOT
 
        CAMERA is CLOSE and ANGLED DOWN in the back of the
        car.  Tucked along fishing and camping gear alongside
        a box of iced trout is an impressive Geiger counter,
        chattering furiously.  A signal light is flashing
        rapidly.  The Sheriff's hands reach for it.  CAMERA
        MOVES BACK and his face comes into SCENE, looking
        down at the counter.
 
                          SHERIFF
                    (Yelling off)
               What you got in here, feller?...It's
               ticking like a bomb!
 
        The SHOT WIDENS as Clayton enter with Pastor Collins,
        Sylvia, the Ranger and others.  Clayton reaches into
        the car and picks up a short pole-meter attached to
        the counter.  He swings it around.  The clicking
        slows.  He lifts the counter out, points the pole-
        meter at the gully.  The light flashes become a rapid
        blur, brilliant.  The chattering increases to a high-
        pitched buzz.

                    (To Sheriff)
               This is a Geiger counter for detecting
               radio-activity.  We did a little sur-
               veying while we were up in the hills.
                    (Above SOUND of the counter -
                     looking o.s.)
               It's that meteor.
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
               It's radio-active?
 
                          SHERIFF
               Look at this thing -- goin' crazy!
 
        He reaches for the Geiger.  Clayton lets him have it
        and remains looking toward the gully.  The SOUND of
        the Geiger counter continues over SCENE.
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Puzzled)
               It's difficult to account for a
               reaction like that!
 
                          RANGER
                    (Moving in)
               Maybe we ought to keep people away
               from it, huh?
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Quietly - thinking)
               Might be a good idea.
 
                          SHERIFF
               I'll post two-three deputies.  They
               can watch it don't start any more fires.
 
 
34.     CLOSE SHOT - CLAYTON, PASTOR & SYLVIA
 
                          CLAYTON
               You know, that meteor's either very
               light - which is unheard of! - or
               else it's hollow somehow.  If it were
               solid and heavy it would have made a
               tremendous crater when it landed.
                    (Suddenly)
               I think I'll stay around until it
               cools off.
                    (To Sylvia)
               If you could tell me of a place in
               town --
                    (Strokes his chin)
               -- I'd like to clean up.
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
               I'd be delighted if you'd stay at
               my house, Doctor Forrester.
 
                          CLAYTON
               Thank you.
                    (Looks toward meteor)
               It probably won't be cool for another
               twenty-four hours.
                    (To Sylvia)
               What do people do around here on a
               Saturday?
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Returning his smile)
               They don't do much of anything...!

               There's a square dance at the social

36.     INT. SOCIAL HALL, LINDA ROSA - (NIGHT)
 
        Very CLOSE on Fiddler Hawkins, sweating, calling the
        dance, holding violin.
 
                          FIDDLER
                    (Raucous)
               A hickory limp and an ole burned stump -
               Go meet your honey and everybody jump!
 
        CAMERA PULLS BACK.  Fiddler wears Levis, embroidered
        shirt.  With him is a guitar player in a dress-up
        Western outfit.  Everybody's stomping.  Girls in
        tight bodices, swirling skirts, bows in their hair,
        Men in T-shirts, suits and shirtsleeves, Levis, fron-
        tier pants and cowboy boots.
 
                          FIDDLER (Cont'd)
               Now promenade two and promenade four -
               Promenade that pretty gal all around
                  the floor.
 
        CAMERA PICKS UP Clayton and Sylvia promenading arm in
        arm in a SET which includes the Sheriff.  Clayton
        wears tan gabardine slacks, fresh shirt, tie with a
        Western motif.  He is clean-shaven.  Sylvia wears a
        forget-me-not cotton print, with style to it.  Clayton
        is not an accomplished square dancer, but he isn't bad.
        Sylvia checks his wrong move in response to the next
        rollicking call.  He laughs.  They both enjoy this.
 
                          FIDDLER'S VOICE
               Now face your lady and make a bow,
               She's a pretty one you'll allow!
               Point the heel and point the toe -
               Now you're makin' a do-si-do.
               Mom - there's a chicken in the bread-bin
               A-peckin' at the dough!
               One more change and on we go.

        No smoke now.  Its appearance is otherwise unchanged.
 
 
38.     EXT. GULLY - MED. SHOT - (NIGHT)
 
        Wash Perry, Alonzo Hogue, Salvador.  Behind them, two
        old cars are parked not far from the gully.  A small
        fire burns on the open ground.  The three men step
        forward toward the gully, peering through the dark-
        ness.  Salvador switches on a flashlight.
 
 
39.     SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY - CLOSE SHOT - METEOR
 
        Still, ominous, as the flashlight hits it.
 
 
40.     CLOSE SHOT - WASH, SALVADOR, ALONZO
 
        They MOVE toward the gully, Salvador playing the
        flashlight ahead.  As they pause on the edge of
        the gully, he cuts the light.
 
                          ALONZO HOGUE
               Looks almost cold now, don't it?
 
                          WASH PERRY
               That won't start no more fires.  We
               might's well go home.
 
                          ALONZO HOGUE
                    (Spitting - starting away)
               Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
 
                          WASH PERRY
                    (Following him)
               Let's go.
 
        As they start away, CAMERA MOVES CLOSE on Salvador.
        He raises the flashlight for a last look at the
        meteor and pops it on directly into the LENSE.
 
                          SALVADOR
                    (In alarm)
               Hey - it's movin'!
 
 
41.     SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY - MED. SHOT - REVERSE SHOT -
        THE THREE
 
        Alonzo Hogue and Wash Perry, f.g., whirl and go back
        to Salvador.  Beyond them in the gully, the meteor
        is lit by Salvador's flashlight.  Something is moving
        on top of it.
 
 
41a.    CLOSE THREE SHOT
 
        Eyes popping as they stare off at the meter.
 
 
41b.    SPECIAL EFFECT - METEOR
 
        Thin gray clinker is dropping off in flakes.  The
        rounded top is turning.  A thread of bright metal
        appears between the moving top and the body.
 
 
42.     MED. CLOSE THREE SHOT - (MOVING SHOT)
 
        They start to back off.
 
                          ALONZO HOGUE
               It's a bomb!
 
                          SALVADOR
               It don't go off last night --
               it's going off now!
 
                          WASH PERRY
               It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's
               get outta here!
 
                          ALONZO HOGUE
                    (Stopping them)
               Wait a minute - wait a minute!....
               Bombs don't unscrew.
 
                          WASH PERRY
                    (Backing away again)
               It's no meteor, that's for sure!
 
                          ALONZO HOGUE
                    (Backing away too)
               Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way
               that's unscrewing!
 
        Salvador only stares as they all retreat.
 
 
43.     SPECIAL EFFECT - METEOR - (MOVING SHOT)
 
        CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY BACK.  The top segment of the
        meteor is turning steadily.  The band of bright
        metal is rapidly growing wider, serrated, greenish-
        white.

44.     INT. SOCIAL HALL - SIDE LINES - (NIGHT)
 
        Favoring Sylvia, sitting on a bench against the wall,
        fanning herself with a lace handkerchief.  Clayton
        comes to her between guys, wiping sweat.  Girls fix-
        ing shaken hair-do's.  People arguing about who ruined
        the square.  Clayton has two soft drinks with straws,
        hands one bottle to Sylvia, drops on the bench beside
        her.  Fiddler's VOICE comes over SCENE.
 
                          SYLVIA

45.     DANCE FLOOR
 
        SHOOTING past Clayton and Sylvia.  He is sweating.
        Beyond them, hearty dancers are going to town.
 
                          CLAYTON
               Yes.  And you know what I was thinking?
                    (Wiping sweat - eyeing
                     dancers)
               If we could gather all the energy
               expended in just one square dance,
               we could send that meteor back to
               where it came from.
 
        DISSOLVE:
 
 
46.     OUT
 
 
47.     SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY - METEOR (MOVING SHOT)
 
        CAMERA MOVES IN slowly.  The bright band of metal
        is now almost two feet wide.  Suddenly the rotating
        section falls away like a shell, uncovering bright
        metal within the opening.
 
 
48.     MED. CLOSE SHOT - WASH, SALVADOR & ALONZO
 
        CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they inch forward toward
        the gully.  A faint, reddish light catches their
        faces.  Salvador flicks the spotlight on.
 
 
49.     SPECIAL EFFECT - MED. SHOT - METEOR OPENING
 
        The metal sheath within the opening parts, shutter-
        like, allowing vivid, reddish light to glow upward
        from the interior.  A HISSING SOUND comes from
        the meteor.
 
 
50.     CLOSE THREE SHOT
 
        They stare, fascinated.  The SOUND dies away.
 
 
51.     SPECIAL EFFECT - MED. FULL SHOT - METEOR
 
        The light in the opening dims.  Something begins to
        appear from inside, revolving about, making a WHINING
        SOUND.  Dimly seen, it emerges.  It is flattened,
        hooded, with faintly-luminous openings -- almost
        cobra-like.  It turns as if scanning the area --
        snout glittering.
 
 
52.     OUT
 
 
53.     THREE SHOT
 
        Wash, Alonzo and Salvador move forward cautiously,
        warily watching the meteor.

               Must be somebody in there.

               the earth right now.
 
        They look at him - all getting the same idea.
 
                          ALONZO HOGUE (Cont'd)
               Happens every eighteen or twenty

               Maybe these are not men - not like us.

               flag!
                    (Turning)
               Here - I got an old sugar sack in
               my car!
 
        He leaves the two and runs back to his car and gets
        the sack and rips it open.  He picks up the shovel
        discarded earlier by Buck, starts to tie the sack
        to it.
 
                           SALVADOR

        Alonzo Hogue rejoins them, swinging his white flag
        from side to side as they look off toward the meteor.

        CAMERA FRAMED over the mechanism in f.g.  Beyond, on

        Alonzo holds the flag high.  Wash lifts his Panama hat.
        Salvador waves a handkerchief.

        SCREAM accompanies it.
 
 
60.     SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY - THREE MEN & METEOR
 
        A REVERSE ANGLE across Wash Perry, Salvador and

        the heat-ray - pulsating, glaring - outlines them
        momentarily as stark silhouettes, then engulfs them
        in searing flames.  As the horrible SCREAMING reaches

        then crumpling.

               The hind wheel off and the axle draggin'...

61.     NEAR REFRESHMENT COUNTER
 
        Someone lights a candle and puts it in a bottle.
        Dancers are milling, laughing, kidding.  Zippy is at
        a pay phone on the wall, between the counter and the
        door to the street.  Clayton and Sylvia move into
        scene.  The Sheriff pushes past them.

               It must be nearly that now - My watch

               There's only about one explanation
               for a thing like this..Got a pin?
 
        She reaches under the lapel of the Pastor's jacket,
        hands a pin to Clayton.  He puts it on the counter,
        then brings the case of his watch near it.

               Have you got a pocket compass?
 
        The Sheriff produces one in a case.  Clayton sets it
        on the counter.  They bend to watch the needle.
 
                          SHERIFF

        Shooting from the entrance of the social hall, as
        people pile out, Clayton, Sylvia and Pastor Collins
        with them.  The town is completely blacked out.  The
        only visible light is from a police car, using hand
        siren and red blinker.  Its headlights silver the
        dark streets as it races up.

        They get into the car.  Sylvia watches it go.  SOUND

        The SIREN DIES.
 
 
70.     SPECIAL EFFECT - DIRT ROAD - MED. SHOT
 
        CROSS ANGLE.  As the Police car comes to a stop,
        Clayton and the Sheriff hop out downstage, the Cop
        gets out on the driver's side.  Behind the car,
        bushes are blazing.  Above, on the hilltop, the
        Martian heat-ray has left a line of fire which
        stretches straight into the night.  In its path,
        some way off, a transmission tower has fallen,
        partly melted, high-tension wires trailing, still
        sparking.
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Looking toward fallen tower)
               That explains why the lights went out!
 
        The Cop, standing beside the spotlight, looks off.

                    (Pointing)
               What the bejeepers went on here?
               Look at their cars...!
 
 
71.     EXT. DIRT ROAD - REMAINS OF CARS
 
        The cars belonging to Fiddler and the others are gray,
        ashy shapes, collapsed.  Hardly recognizable except
        for their tires, which leave a darker residue.  Bushes
        and grass are still burning around.
 
 
72.     CLOSEUP - COP
 
        Jittery, he reaches for the spotlight and snaps it
        on toward the gully.
 
                          COP
               And look there!
 
 
73.     EXT. ROAD & GULLY - GROUP & METEOR
 
        A REVERSE ANGLE over the men to the meteor in the
        gully.  The beam of the Cop's spotlight sweeps over
        the smoldering bushes and rough ground, striking the
        bottom of the meteor and then returning to something
        on the edge above the gully.
 
 
73a.    CLOSE TWO SHOT - CLAYTON & SHERIFF
 
        The Sheriff wets his suddenly dry lips, gazing PAST
        CAMERA.  Clayton looks with him.
 
 
74.     WHAT THEY SEE ON THE EDGE OF THE GULLY - CLOSEUP
 
        Three shallow piles of gray ash, man-shaped, lie on
        the bare and blackened earth, held in the spotlight.

               People in town started to follow
               us out.
                    (Looking toward gully)
               Don't let them come anywhere near here.
                    (Suddenly authoritative -
                     loud)
               Get going!
 
 
76.     SPECIAL EFFECT - CLOSE SHOT - METEOR
 
        The hooded shape on its flexible shaft now rears
        twelve or fifteen feet above the meteor.  The cobra-
        head is turning, zero-ing toward the road.  It begins
        to glitter inside the hood.
 
 
77.     EXT. ROAD - MED. SHOT
 
        The Cop is diving into the car in panic.
 
                          CLAYTON
               Kill that spotlight.  Turn off
               your headlights!
 
        The cop cuts all the lights, backs around and takes
        off the way he came, CAMERA PANNING with him.
 
 
77a.    CLOSE SHOT - CLAYTON & SHERIFF
 
        The SOUND of the SCREAMING of the heat-ray whirls them
        about as the reddish light glows on their faces.
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Sharp - to Sheriff)

78.     SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. DIRT ROAD - MED. FULL SHOT
 
        A REVERSE ANGLE, SHOOTING along the road toward the
        gully.  The meteor is concealed behind a knoll.
        Clayton and the Sheriff, b.g. race down the road
        to f.g. and dive into a ditch as the superheated
        glare of the heat-ray swings from the gully toward
        them.  The SCREAM is ear-splitting in intensity.
 
 
79.     SPECIAL EFFECT - CLOSE SHOT - CLAYTON & SHERIFF
 
        The ray SCREAMS over their heads.  It holds above
        the ditch.  Throbbing.  Its reddish glare blinding.
 
 
80.     SPECIAL EFFECT - HEAT-RAY - COP'S CAR - FULL SHOT
 
        The car turns incandescent as the ray envelopes it,
        still going forward.  It turns ashy gray.  Hits
        a boulder on the shoulder of the road and breaks
        up into a spray of ashes.
 
 
81.     EXT. DITCH - CLOSE SHOT - CLAYTON & SHERIFF

               I think that - gizmo - is a machine
               from another planet.

82.     SPECIAL EFFECT - SKY & SECOND METEOR - FULL SHOT
 
        Beyond the burning grass, another meteor is spurting

               Sheriff - you'd better get word to
               the military.  You're going to need

83a.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY - CLOSE SHOT
 
        The hooded shape revolves about, searching.  Its
        snout glitters and glows alternately as it searches

        reporters and cameramen are on the black-top road,
        gazing out over open ground toward the gully.
 
        CAMERA favors the KGEB REPORTER - ex-newsman, high-

               Yes.  In Bordeaux, France.  Some from
               Spain.  There's supposed to be one down
               near the Gulf of Taranto, Italy.  We're
               still trying to locate the second meteor
               that dropped in this vicinity just about

               It's possible.  At least, it seems
               certain they're from some other

               In fact -- if they are from Mars -- it
               is possible they first made landings on

               There is precedent in our own evolution

               of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
 
                          SYLVIA
               Would you like some coffee, General?
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               Thank you.
 
        She starts out as his aide hands him some messages.
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (To Pastor)
               General Mann's in charge of Intel-
               ligence for the Pacific area.
 
 
107.    GROUP - BY THE MAP
 
        Favoring General Mann as he turns to scan the map,
        continuing to glance at the messages.  The lieutenant
        is marking up more positions.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               That's their position?
                    (Grimly amused)
               You've certainly got them surrounded.
                    (And then)
               I suppose they've neutralized all
               communications here.
 
                          COLONEL
               Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field
               phones are okay so far.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               And they'll go out the minute there's
               another ray.
                    (Reading)
               A cylinder reported down by Huntington
               Beach.  That's a job for the Navy.
 
                          CLAYTON
               Do you have any news from abroad?
 
        CAMERA ANGLES to favor him as he glances at messages,
        sorting them, handing some to his aide.
 
                          GENERAL MANN (Cont'd)
               They're coming down all over.  South
               America - Santiago has two cylinders.
               They're outside London.  And they're
               in Naples.
                    (Going on)
               We've got them between here and Fesno.
               Outside Sacramento.  Two on Long
               Island...
 
                          CLAYTON
               Are they just coming down at random?
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               No, they're working to some kind
               of a plan.
                    (After a moment)
               But here's the most dangerous thing...
               Once they begin to move -- no more
               news comes out of that area!
 
 
108.    INT. REVETMENT
 
        SHOOTING past the General.  Everyone is listening,
        fascinated.  The communications men have stopped
        work.  The morse key keeps repeating a call.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               We've been getting reports of destruction,
               massacre ... Here's an instance!
                    (reading a message)
               'Town of St. Julien, south of Bordeaux,
               wiped out by ray of undetermined nature.
               Local reports say nothing remains.'
                    (Looks around)
               Nothing remains!  What d'you make of that?
 
                          CLAYTON
               We'll have to see what they do
               here.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               A lot of our newest weapons are in
               here.  Washington wants to be sure
               we stop them.
 
                          COLONEL
                    (Confident - smiling)
               We will, sir!
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               From the data - and from that picture
               the Air Force took earlier tonight ...
                    (Thumbing toward the gully)
               ... what we've got in the gully out
               there is a guide ship.  One lands ...
               Others follow later.
                    (To Clayton)
               They appear to clear an area, then
               drop in groups of threes, joined
               magnetically.  Is that possible?
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Wryly)
               If they do it, it is.
 
        Sylvia brings coffee.  The General takes it
        automatically.
 
                          COLONEL
               My orders are not to go into action
               unless they make a move out of there.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               That's because we want a chance to
               observe them.
                    (Gesturing to gully)
               This is the only place we've had time
               to surround them with sufficient force
               to contain them.  What happens here
               will be a guide to all other operations.
               The minute action begins and a pattern
               of defense develops, I'll get my report
               to Washington.
                    (Glances at map)
               You've deployed your forces well.
 
                          COLONEL
               Thank you, sir.  If they start anything,
               we can blast them right off the earth!
 
                          GENERAL MANN
                    (Checks watch, sips coffee)
               They'll probably move at dawn.
 
        DISSOLVE TO:
 
 
109     SPECIAL EFFECT - HIGH CAMERA - LONG SHOT - GULLY - DAWN
 
        Silence.  No movement anywhere.  We see the burned
        grass and blackened earth.  The little gray ash-heaps
        are still there.  In the gully are dim, shining shapes.
        Beyond the hills the sky is lightening.  As the sun
        comes up, one of the shining shapes begins to rise.
        There is a SOUND of CRACKLING, HIGH-FREQUENCY ELECTRIC
        SPARKS.
 
 
110.    EXT. OBSERVATION POST
 
        CAMERA is on an infantry lieutenant and a sergeant.
        Their foxhole is camouflaged with burned grass and
        bushes.
 
                          LIEUTENANT
                    (At field phone)
               There's something moving in the
               gully -- something's coming out!
 
 
111.    FLASHES - TROOPS ALERTING
 
        Men have been resting, dozing, waiting for dawn.  A
        signal reaches them.
 
        a.      Recoilless 75 men running to positions.
 
        b.      Crew racing to half-track rocket-launcher.
 
        c.      Machine-gunners readying for action.
 
        d.      Bazooka team alerting.
 
 
112     INT. REVETMENT
 
        Lamps and candles being hurriedly extinguished.  The
        tarpaulin is yanked from the observation opening.
        Everyone cranes to get a glimpse of the gully.
 
 
113.    SPECIAL EFFECT - GULLY - (DAWN)
 
        Burned-over ground runs straight to the gully, with
        blackened scrub trees and bushes at either side.
        Something is visible in the gully.  Shining.  Moving.
 
 
114.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY - MED. SHOT
 
        Now, for the first time, we see a Martian machine
        clearly.  A metal shape is rising.  The SOUND of high-
        frequency sparks increases.  It is a built-up section
        of the cylinder.  Domed in the center.  Three vibrant
        beams are projected like rods from below - stiff, joint-
        less, incandescent.  Effortlessly, the body of the
        machine rises on the pulsating beams to a height of
        thirty feet in the air, and hovers motionless.  Then a
        hooded shape extends above the body on a flexible shaft.
 
 
115.    INT. REVETMENT
 
        Favoring Clayton, Pastor Collins, General Mann and the
        Colonel.  All crowded to the opening in the sandbags.
        The General and the Colonel use field glasses.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
                    (Softly - handing his
                     glasses to Clayton)
               Look at it, will you?
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
                    (Awed - half to himself)
               Beings from another world ...
 
        The Colonel signs to the Captain, who backs to the
        field telephone switchboard.
 
                          COLONEL
                    (Quietly)
               Stand by to fire.
 
                          CAPTAIN
                    (Into phone -
                     repeating)
               All command posts stand by to fire.
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
                    (Suddenly realizing -
                     protesting)
               Colonel - shooting's no good!
 
                          COLONEL
               It's always been a good persuader.
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
               Couldn't you try to communicate
               with them first - and shoot later
               if you have to?
 
        The Colonel glances, then ignores him, using his
        glasses.  The uniformed men are all tense, watching
        the gully, waiting for the order.  Clayton is gazing
        out with the Sheriff.  Pastor Collins moves uncertainly
        toward the open rear of the revetment.  Sylvia sees
        him, starts after him.
 
                          CAPTAIN'S VOICE (O.s.)
               All command posts - target as indicated.
 
 
116.    EXT. REVETMENT
 
        Pastor Collins comes out, stands staring toward the
        gully.  Sylvia joins him.  Behind them we glimpse
        the tension of the men inside.
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
                    (Looking o.s.)
               I think we should try to make them
               understand we mean them no harm.
 
        Sylvia looks at him, not sure of what he means.
 
                          COLONEL'S VOICE (O.s.)
                    (Quietly - from inside)
               There's another machine coming out.
 
 
117.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY
 
        The Martian machines.  The first machine is now
        catching the early sunbeams.  Turning golden, glis-
        tening.  In the shadows another machine is rising
        from the gully.  It, also, is armed with a hooded
        shape.
 
 
118.    CLOSE SHOT - SYLVIA AND PASTOR COLLINS
 
        Both gazing toward the gully.
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
                    (Meditative)
               They are living creatures out there.
 
                          SYLVIA
               But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester
               says they're some kind of an advanced
               civilization --
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
                    (Cutting in, smiling)
               If they're more advanced than us,
               they should be nearer the Creator
               for that reason!
 
                          CAPTAIN'S VOICE
                    (Tensely, from inside)
               Attention all batteries!  Prepare
               for volley fire!  Repeat --
               prepare for volley fire!
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
                    (Meditative again)
               No real attempt has been made to
               communicate with them, you know...
 
        Sylvia looks at him uneasily.  She takes his arm.
 
                          SYLVIA
               Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
                    (Shakes head, smiling)
               I've done about all I can do here.
               You go back in.
                    (Low - turning her
                     toward the inside)
               Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.
                    (Hand to her cheek)
               He's a good man.
 
        Sylvia presses his hand, smiling.  As she leaves him,
        the CAMERA PANS with her, losing Pastor Collins
        momentarily.
 
 
119.    HEAD CLOSEUP - PASTOR COLLINS
 
        Looking in the direction of the gully, thoughtful.
 
 
120.    FLASHES - PREPARATIONS FOR FIRING
 
        a.     Grouped bazookas bearing on the target.
 
        b.     Tanks waiting orders, at the ready.
 
        c.     Rocket launcher, loaded and ready.
 
 
121.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY
 
        The Martian machine in f.g. is motionless.  The second
        one has paused half out of the gully.  Its hooded arm
        swings around on its shaft, as if under test.
 
 
122.    EXTREME HEAD CLOSEUP - PASTOR COLLINS
 
        Eyes serene.  Smiles a little.  Moves forward.
 
 
123.    INT. REVETMENT
 
        No sound except the telegraph key repeating a signal
        over and over.  No movement save for Sylvia, f.g.,
        refilling coffee cups.  General Mann, the Colonel,
        Clayton and the Sheriff crouched by the opening.
 
                          COLONEL
                    (Suddenly)
               Who's that?!
 
 
124.    FLASH CLOSEUP - GROUP AT WINDOW
 
        They stare out, disbelieving.
 
 
125.    FLASH CLOSEUP - SYLVIA
 
        She whirls, starts toward the opening.
 
 
126.    SPECIAL EFFECT - INT. REVETMENT & VISTA
 
        SHOOTING over the group at the opening to the VISTA
        outside the revetment.  In b.g. Pastor Collins is
        walking away from the revetment, a solitary figure
        moving over the burned-off earth.  The Martian machines
        beyond him are motionless, as if awaiting him.
 
                          COLONEL
                    (Choked voice)
               What's he think he's doing?
 
 
127.    CLOSE SHOT - CROSS ANGLE - FEATURING SYLVIA
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Calling)
               Uncle!
                    (Half screaming)
               Uncle Matthew!!
 
        She whirls to go after him.  General Mann catches her
        arm.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               Too late now -- he's too far away.
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Lunges - appealing)
               Stop him!
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Holding her - looking out)
               It's seen him.
 
 
128.    SPECIAL EFFECT - MARTIAN MACHINE
 
        It begins slowly to sink down as its glittering beam-
        legs pulsate and grow shorter.
 
 
129.    MOVING SHOT - EXT. BURNED-OFF FIELD
 
        Pastor Collins brings out a cross, gazing ahead,
        reciting the Twenty-third Psalm.
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
                    (Softly)
               Though I walk through the valley
               of the shadow of death, I will fear
               no evil ...
 
 
130.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY
 
        SHOOTING past the first Martian machine, still sinking
        down.  The second machine has risen higher in the gully.
 
 
131.    MOVING SHOT - EXT. BURNED-OFF FIELD
 
        CLOSE on Pastor Collins, walking past more debris.
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
                    (Whispering)
               Thou anointest my head with oil.
               My cup runneth over ...
 
 
132.    INT. REVETMENT - GROUP
 
        Featuring Sylvia and Clayton.  All are crowded to the
        opening.  Sylvia is petrified with horror.
 
 
133.    MOVING SHOT - EXT. BURNED-OFF FIELD - HEAD CLOSEUP
 
        Pastor Collins moves ahead, eyes fixed on the machines.
        He won't permit himself to be afraid.
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS
               And I will dwell ... in the house
               of the Lord .. forever.
 
        He lifts the cross to shoulder height as CAMERA HOLDS
        and PANS him on.
 
                          PASTOR COLLINS (Cont'd)
               Amen.
                    (Murmuring)
               May the grace of the Father and of
               the Son ...
 
        Beyond him we now see the Martian machine.
 
 
134.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY
 
        Favoring the first machine, filling the SCREEN.  Squat-
        ting on its incandescent beam-legs, the hooded shaft
        tilted forward.  There is a moment -- then a magenta-
        tinted heat-ray SCREAMS from it.
 
 
135.    INT. REVETMENT - EXTREME HEAD CLOSEUP - SYLVIA
 
        She SCREAMS, but her voice is drowned in the unearthly
        SOUND of the Martian machine.  We know, without seeing,
        what has happened to the Pastor.
 
 
136.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY
 
        VIEWPOINT from the command post revetment.  The first
        machine rises swiftly to full height, gliding forward.
        The second clears the gully.  The top of a third
        machine appears.
 
 
137.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY & ROAD
 
        The base of the Martian machine's locomotor beam-leg.
        Featuring, in f.g., the Pastor's cross, partly melted.
        The glittering foot of the beam moves into SCENE,
        leaving behind it molten rock and smoke.  As it passes,
        the intense heat it gives off acts like a blowtorch on
        the terrain.
 
 
138.    INT. REVETMENT - MED. CLOSE SHOT
 
        SHOOTING from outside the observation opening.  Sylvia
        is CLOSE in f.g., horrified, unbelieving, supported by
        Clayton.  The Colonel whirls toward the switchboard.
 
                          COLONEL
               Let 'em have it!
 
 
139.    EXT. HILLSIDE - TANKS
 
        The big guns of the tanks slam shells toward the gully.
 
 
140.    SPECIAL EFFECT - MARTIAN MACHINE & SHELL BURSTS
 
        Shells burst close to the Martian machine.  Instantly
        a beam -- different from the heat-ray -- strikes out
        with a vicious, high-pitched DRUMMING SOUND.  The beam
        is electric-blue with a greenish tinge.  Edges soft,
        powdery.  Fast, projectile-like discharges race down
        its core, like a succession of balls, a deeper blue-
        green.  Beam and impulses are transparent.
 
 
141.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. HILLSIDE - TANK
 
        The beam hits a tank.  The tank changes color instan-
        taneously.  It turns bone yellow, then thins into an
        oyster-white skeleton shape that is an echo of death
        itself.  The beam cuts off and the tank dissolves into
        fine dust, the color of the beam, and blows away on
        the breeze.  Making pallid streamers in the early
        morning light.
 
 
142.    GROUP - AT OPENING
 
        SHOOTING IN on the men - staring, transfixed.  The
        General lowers his glasses, looks at Clayton in stupe-
        faction, then uses the glasses again.
 
 
143.    QUICK CUTS - INSERTS OF MUZZLES - AS WEAPONS FIRE
 
        CLOSE on the muzzles.  Individual SOUND blasting.
 
        a.      Rocket-launcher muzzles as rockets fly.
 
        b.      Machine-gun muzzles shuddering.
 
        c.      Anti-tank gun muzzles explode and recoil.
 
 
144.    QUICK CUTS & FLASHES - BATTLE  (1)
 
        The initial phase between man's weapons and the Martian
        machines.  The first Martian is out of the gully on the
        burned-off field.  The second is just clear of the
        gully.  The third has started to follow.
 
        a.      Special Effect - Full Shot - Gully.  Increasing
                shell and rocket fire bursting viciously about
                the Martians.  Short, blue jets are flashing
                out around the turret heads of the machines.
                These merge to form an impalpable, electro-
                magnetic envelope which drops all around to
                the ground.
 
        b.      Special Effect - Close Shot - First Machine.
                Rays SCREAM from it, lashing in every direction.
 
        c.      Recoilless 75's - Close Shot.  Muzzles Flash.
 
        d.      Rocket-launcher - Close Shot.  In rapid suc-
                cession, rockets roar toward the Martians.
 
        e.      Tank - Med. Shot.  It's gun bucks violently
                slamming an armor-piercing shell at the Mar-
                tians.
 
        f.      Machine-gun Nest - Close Shot.  50 cal. machine-
                gun chatters furiously, spitting a stream of
                tracer shells.
 
        g.      Bazookas - Close Shot.  In a sharp volley, a
                group of bazookas let go with HE charges.
 
        h.      Mortars - Close Shot.  In rapid succession,
                Marines drop Napalm charges into the big muz-
                zles of the mortars.  Instantly the charges
                fly high in the air in the direction of the
                enemy.
 
        i.      Special Effect - Martian Machines.  Projectiles
                burst against their almost invisible protective
                envelopes.  Others ricochet off, exploding harm-
                lessly in the air beyond.  Napalm charges burst
                around them, obscuring the machines in huge
                balls of searing, orange fire and black smoke.
 
        j.      Special Effect - First Machine - Close Shot.
                The flame of the Napalm clears.  The machine is
                undamaged.  Rays slash from it, SCREAMING.
 
        k.      Special Effect - Second & Third Machines - Close
                Shot.  Flames and smoke clear.  They lash rays
                in every direction.
 
        l.      Special Effect - Rocket-launcher - Close Shot.
                Hit by a heat-ray.  The launcher and crew glow
                white hot.  Become a pile of ashes.
 
        m.      Special Effect - First Machine - Close Shot.
                DRUMMING horribly, the blue-green disintegrating
                beam darts forth.
 
        n.      Special Effect - Mortars - Med. Close Shot.
                Hit by the skeletonizing beam.  They literally
                disintegrate - cease to exist.  Men and machines
                become a vapor of blue-green dust.
 
 
144-A.  INT. REVETMENT - GROUP
 
        Clayton, Sylvia and others duck below the shelter of
        the sandbags as a heat-ray HOWLS close past the com-
        mand post.  CAMERA MOVES IN on Clayton and General
        Mann, shouting above the uproar.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
                    (Fast, looking out)
               What's that skeleton beam they're
               using?
 
                          CLAYTON
               It must neutralize mesons somehow.
               They're the atomic glue that holds
               matter together.
                    (Grimly)
               Cut across their lines of magnetic
               force and any object will simply
               cease to exist.
 
 
145.    SPECIAL EFFECT - FLASH CUTS - BATTLE  (2)
 
        The destruction of man's weapons by the Martians, and
        the beginning of man's retreat.
 
        a.     Special Effect - Ext. Gully & Command Post
               Revetment - Full Shot.  A COMPOSITE SHOT of the
               entire battle.  One Martian machine on a hill
               slope.  The two others below.  Rays and beams
               lashing out.  Shells and rockets and Napalm
               exploding about them.  Tanks scuttling about.
               Rays hit them.  Machine-gunners and troops
               abandon their stations, leaving their weapons.
               Half-tracks, trucks, weapons-carriers, jeeps
               pull out.  Pandemonium.
 
        b.     Special Effect - Martian Machines - Med. Shot.
               Smoke and fire clearing.  Explosions about
               them diminish.  They redouble the activity of
               their rays and beams.
 
        c.     Special Effect - Battlefield - Med. Full Shot.
               Gray ash on a blackened road - the residue of
               tanks.  Men, jeeps, equipment flee past, es-
               caping.  Rays and beams reach after them.
 
        d.     Ext. Hillside - Med. Close Shot.  Infantrymen
               crash through burning bushes in headlong re-
               treat, looking back in panic.
 
        e.     Special Effect - Martian Machine - Close Shot.
               On skyline.  Moving forward.  Rays SCREAMING,
               beams DRUMMING.  No counter fire from our
               forces.
 
 
146.    EXT. REVETMENT - MED FULL SHOT
 
        Parked jeeps, General Mann's car, a few Marines, the
        Red Cross truck.  The heat-ray slashes through them,
        hits the revetment and swings away.  Men fall in
        ashes, jeeps glow and burn, the Red Cross truck and
        General Mann's car are singed and blazing.  The huge
        tarp stretched over the revetment blazes.
 
 
147.    INT. REVETMENT - MED. FULL SHOT
 
        The inclosure is a madhouse - men trying to extinguish
        burning switchboards - the lieutenant gathering up the
        scorched maps - the captain shouting uselessly into
        the field phone - Clayton up by the opening using the
        field glasses, Sylvia and the Sheriff crouched near
        him.  General Mann and his aide rush out.
 
                          LIEUTENANT
                    (At the opening)
               There's a Martian machine headed
               straight for us!
 
                          COLONEL
                    (Shouting to Captain)
               Order all command posts - everything
               pull back north of Highway Sixty
               tunnel bunker!
 
 
148.    SPECIAL EFFECT - MARTIAN MACHINE - MED. CLOSE SHOT
 
        Moving along the burned-off swathe from the gully,
        rays slashing.
 
 
149.    INT. REVETMENT - MED. SHOT
 
                           COLONEL
                     (At observation
                      opening - yelling)
                They're going to roll right through
                here.  Sheriff - get into Linda Rosa.
                Tell Civil Defense - evacuate everybody!
 
        Clayton, at the opening, watches the approaching
        machines, absorbed by them.  A heat-ray slashes near,
        casting its ruddy glare.  Shreds of the burning tar-
        paulin fall.  Sylvia grabs him, pulling him down.
 
                           COLONEL
                Doctor Forrester - get out of here!
 
        He literally jerks Clayton and Sylvia to their feet,
        shoving them toward the rear.
 
                           COLONEL (Cont'd)
                Everybody out!  The Air Force'll
                take care of these babies now!
                     (Runs toward CAMERA)
                Everybody out --- Everybody ----
 
        He is in EXTREME CLOSEUP, shouting.  The red heat-ray
        seems to envelope him in a blaze of color, SCREAMING.
        Suddenly the SCREEN explodes into deadly blue-green -
        the disintegrating beam!  The Colonel's shout is frozen
        on his lips.  The skeletal structure of his head glows
        incandescent -- greenish-white -- through the flesh
        of his face.  In an instant he vanishes into a shred
        of blue-green vapor which swirls and is lost in the
        ruddy flames of the ray.
 
        DISSOLVE:
 
 
150.    EXT. SKY - FULL SHOT - (STOCK)
 
        A huge formation of fighter bombers flashes across
        the sky, the chorus of their jets pulsating like
        thunder.
 
        DISSOLVE:
 
 
151.    EXT. ROAD - MED. SHOT
 
        A weapons carrier clatters past at breakneck speed.
        Men from mixed units jump from behind scrub trees,
        running.  A crowded jeep flashes past as Clayton and
        Sylvia appear.  The two run after the men.  Clayton
        pulls her to a stop, looks o.s., then runs across
        the road with her.
 
 
152.    EXT. FIELD - MED. SHOT
 
        A Piper Cub - battery observation plane - is just
        taking off.  Another is on the ground, no one near it.
        Clayton and Sylvia enter, running.  Beyond one wing
        of the machine we see smoke, explosions and rays and
        beams ripping against the sky.
 
                           CLAYTON
                We can't go into town - everybody's
                getting out of there!
                     (Steering her toward plane)
                I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
 
                           SYLVIA
                Can you handle one of these?
 
                           CLAYTON
                Sure...get in!
 
        He shoves Sylvia up into the plane and climbs in at
        the wheel.
 
        DISSOLVE:
 
 
153.    EXT. SKY - MED. SHOT
 
        The Piper Cub in flight, hedge-hopping.
 
 
154.    INT. PIPER CUT - CLOSE SHOT  (PROCESS)
 
        SHOOTING PAST Clayton to Sylvia.  The tops of utility
        poles and trees skim past, almost at their level.
        The plane wobbles.  Clayton is unconcerned.
 
                           SYLVIA
                     (Hanging on)
                You'll hit something!  Can't
                you go higher?
 
                           CLAYTON
                     (Looking up)
                No.  The air's going to be full of
                Jets in a minute...And there they
                are!
 
 
155.    EXT. SKY - QUICK CUTS OF JETS - (STOCK)
 
        Jet fighter-bombers in formation, colorful against the
        sky, peeling off to dive.
 
 
156.    INT. PIPER CUB - CLOSE SHOT - (PROCESS)
 
        Clayton looking o.s. as he banks sharply.  Sylvia
        looking after him.
 
 
157.    EXT. SKY - QUICK CLOSE SHOT (STOCK)
 
        Jet fighter-bombers diving, firing, launching rockets,
        dropping bombs.  SOUNDS of explosions.
 
 
158.    EXT. SKY - MED. CLOSE SHOT
 
        The piper cub porpoising over the treetops, banking
        and turning.
 
 
159.    QUICK CUTS - WRECK OF PIPER CUB
 
        a.      Int. Piper Cub - Close Shot (Process).
                Clayton looking up.  Sylvia turns and
                looks ahead, SCREAMS.
 
        b.      Special Effect - Piper Cub - Full Shot.
                SHOOTING AHEAD.  It rises over a low
                hilltop - flying directly toward a
                Martian machine on the flat fields
                beyond.  Plane banks sharply to change
                course.
 
        c.      Special Effect - Piper Cub - Med. Shot.
                The wing snags a tree.  The plane cart-
                wheels toward the ground.
 
 
160.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. BEAN FIELD - MED. SHOT
 
        The Cub lands on one wheel, bounces, goes into a
        ground loop, a slashing skid and stops, tilted on
        a torn wing.  Propeller shattered.
 
 
161.    EXT. BEANFIELD - CLOSE SHOT - (MOVING SHOT)
 
        Clayton half-falls out of the wrecked plane, looking
        o.s., as he helps Sylvia.  She looks with him, gasps.
        They run and dive into an irrigation ditch, CAMERA
        FOLLOWING.
 
 
162.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT BEANFIELD & DITCH - FULL SHOT
 
        SHOOTING over the torn wing of the Piper Cup among the
        tangled bean plants.  Across the field is a low, wooded
        hill.  Coming into sight at the foot of the hill is the
        Martian machine, its cobra-like weapon turning on its
        shaft, swinging toward the plane.
 
 
163.    EXT. DITCH - CLOSE SHOT - CLAYTON & SYLVIA
 
        Ducked low, taut, terrified.  He sneaks a look over
        the edge, then flings himself down with Sylvia again.
        There is the SOUND of the horrible DRUMMING of the
        disintegrating beam, which quickly flickers out, mark-
        ing the destruction of the Piper Cub.  Their faces are
        lit blue-green.  Then, down into the ditch, the eerie
        vapor of unglued atom flows, incandescent, swirling
        in the breeze.
 
        Clayton and Sylvia begin to stir.  The CRACKLING of
        HIGH FREQUENCY ELECTRICITY from the machine's loco-
        motor mechanism grows louder - it's coming for them!
        Clayton grabs Sylvia, half-dragging, half-carrying
        her back along the ditch.  He pushes her behind a
        pile of broken irrigation pipe, falls across her.
        The CRACKLING swells to a ROAR of SPARKS.  Where they
        had just lain, the glittering, flickering base of a
        beam-leg dips down into the ditch, moves across and
        up the other bank, leaving a smoking path of fused
        rock and debris.
 
 
163a.   EXTREME CLOSEUP - CLAYTON & SYLVIA
 
        Smoke swirling about them.  Heads thrust into the
        dirt.  Frozen with terror.  Faces crushed together.
        The machine's ROAR diminishes.  They begin to breathe
        again.  The tension of Clayton's grip on Sylvia's
        shoulders lessens.  The suspended functions of her
        mind resume.  Her eyes turn to him.  He looks at her.
        Shock overwhelms her.  She faints.
 
        FADE OUT.
 
        FADE IN:
 
 
164.    EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET, LOS ANGELES - (DAY)
 
        CAMERA is on a CORNER NEWSSTAND.  Tip-sheets and
        papers are clipped around the front, sides and to a
        wire between uprights.  Headlines:  MEN FROM MARS -
        Europe Cities Blasted - KILLER RAYS; MARS MACHINES
        IN CALIFORNIA - Fighting Near L.A. - U.S. INVADED -
        MARTIAN THREAT.  A little crowd on the sidewalk
        reads papers avidly.  Cars stop at the curb to buy
        others.  An elderly woman sits behind the newsstand,
        knitting, hawking her sensations.

        The SOUND of approaching sirens comes over SCENE.
        She and her customers look o.s.
 
 
166.    EXT. STREET - (Location)
 
        Traffic is slowing, stopping.  The SOUND of massed
        sirens comes to a peak.  Two motorcycle cops race
        past, blinkers working.  Four more follow.  Then
        comes General Mann's dirty, fire-blackened car.
        CAMERA PANS the car, going fast, then ANGLES UP
        the front of the stately Federal Building.
 
        DISSOLVE:
 
 
167.    MOVING SHOT - INT. ARMED FORCES INFORMATION, MAIN
        OFFICE - (DAY)
 
        Five desks.  Walls covered with maps and thumb-tacked
        notices.  The doors of three private offices across
        from the entrance.  The place is crowded with Army,
        Navy, Marine and Air Force personnel, police of-
        ficials, CD directors, reporters, photographers.  Two
        cops shoulder in from the corridor by a door marked:
        ARMED FORCES - Public Information Office - Entrance.
        General Mann follows with his aide.  Reporters and
        cameramen crowd around the unshaven, grimy General,
        impeding him on his way toward a private office out-
        side which sits a WAC secretary.  Naval and military
        men come to attention, then press toward him.  The
        General looks past them all, calling to CD directors
        and civic authorities.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
                    (Beckoning)
               You're the gentlemen I asked to
               come here.
                    (To his aide)
               Get Washington.
 
        The aide pushes ahead while flashbulbs blink and repor-
        ters surround the General.  He keeps moving.  A FAT
        REPORTER - thin-nosed, sweating - tries to buttonhole
        him.
 
                          FAT REPORTER
               General Mann, what d'you think of
               this situation --
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               Sorry.  I've no time!
 
                          FAT REPORTER
                    (Wily, fast)
               Is it your opinion the Army can
               hold 'em?
 
                          POLICE CHIEF
                    (Moving in, sharp)
               All right, boys - let it go!
 
                          SECOND REPORTER
                    (Jumping in, over him)
               You had guns and equipment going out
               there all night!  Weren't they enough to --
 
                          GENERAL MANN
                    (Tired, exasperated)
               I said I've no time!
 
                          POLICE CHIEF
               C'mon, now - break it up!
 
        During this, General Mann has pushed to the door of
        the private office.  With a concerted effort, the
        General and the civic officials push inside.  The
        door closes.  A big Marine bars further entry.  CAMERA
        HOLDS on the reporters and photographers.
 
                          FAT REPORTER
               The way he's hedging, maybe the
               Army didn't hold 'em!
                    (Significant)
               Because from the news that's coming
               through, nobody's stopped 'em yet!
                    (Looking toward door)
               We'll wait.
 
 
168.    INT. PRIVATE OFFICE
 
        It belongs to the Chief of Army Information.  General
        Mann's aide is talking into a phone in b.g.  The
        General faces the civilian group which includes police
        and fire chiefs, Pacific Electric and other trans-
        portation officials, Air Raid wardens, Red Cross.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               Who's the General Director for
               Civil Defense?
 
                          C.D. DIRECTOR
               Here, sir.  We're all ready for action!
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               I want to know if the city must be
               evacuated...?
 
                          C.D. DIRECTOR
                    (Smiling)
               Lots of people got scared and moved
               out as it is!
 
                          P.E. OFFICIAL
               We're holding emergency cars and
               buses ready in the yard, sir!
 
                          RED CROSS LEADER
               Red Cross is standing by.
 
                          C.D. DIRECTOR
               I believe, sir, I can speak for
               everyone.  We've got the whole
               city on the ready!
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               That's what I wanted!  For your in-
               formation - they're twenty-five or
               thirty miles outside Los Angeles.
               They're not down in force yet, but
               that can happen any minute.  We've
               got a developing situation.  It'll
               come to a crisis if they move into
               the metropolitan area and --

                    (Cutting in, quick)
               Washington on the wire, sir.

               General Mann...
 
 
169.    CLOSE ON GENERAL MANN
 
        listening at phone, keyed-up.
 
                          GENERAL MAN
                    (After a pause, low, fast)
               I'd say our effective losses were
               nearly sixty percent men and ninety
               percent materiel!
                    (Grimly)
               The new delta-wing jets went in, but
               not one of them came out.  I watched
               high-level bombers drop everything
               they carried.  They were knocked out
               of the sky and the bombs did nothing.
 
 
170.    GROUP - CIVILIAN LEADERS
 
        straining to catch what he is saying, glancing at
        one another, alarmed.
 
                          GENERAL MANN'S VOICE
               Nothing was effective against them!...
               Yes, they have some sort of electronic
               umbrella.  It's quite impenetrable.  And
               Doctor Forrester believes they generate
               atomic force without the heavy screening
               we use -- That's where they get the
               power for their rays!
 
 
171.    INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT
 
        General Mann at phone, his aide in b.g.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               Very well, sir.
                    (Hanging up - to aide)
               Call Victorville.  Tell them I
               want the fastest plane they've
               got!
 
        SHOT WIDENS as he turns to the nearby group.
 
                          GENERAL MANN (Cont'd)
               You'll get all further instructions
               from Sixth Army Command.
                    (To Police Chief)
               Now I'll make a statement to those
               reporters.
 
        The Police Chief opens the door.  Hubbub comes from
        the outside as reporters and photographers crowd in.
        The civic authorities leave.
 
                          FAT REPORTER
                    (Barging forward)
               General, we heard Doctor Clayton
               Forrester was out there with you.
               What's he think about this?
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               Ask him.  He's back at Pacific-Tech.
 
                          FAT REPORTER
               No, he's not!  We tried to get him.
               He hasn't shown up there.
 
        DISSOLVE:
 
 
172.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. FARM & BEANFIELD - (NIGHT)
 
        Peaceful.  Crickets chirruping.  A mocking-bird SOUND-
        ING off.  Low ground mist.  Out of the distance comes
        the MUTTER of gunfire and remote EXPLOSIONS.
 
        CAMERA SHOOTING across the edge of the dry irriga-
        tion ditch toward the farmhouse in the middle dis-
        tance.  A farm cat appears over the edge of the
        ditch, carrying something in its mouth.  It hurries
        down into the ditch, CAMERA PANNING.
 
 
172a.   EXT. IRRIGATION DITCH - MED. CLOSE SHOT
 
        Clayton is sitting alongside Sylvia who is stretched
        out asleep.  Clayton's jacket is covering her.  His
        attention has been attracted by the cat.
 
 
172b.   EXT. DITCH - CLOSE SHOT
 
        The cat stops in the bottom of the ditch and puts
        her burden down on some grass.  It is a tiny puppy.
        She lies down.  It snuggles to her, whining weakly.
 
 
172c.   CLOSEUP CLAYTON  (PAN SHOT)
 
        He smiles a little wryly, looks down toward Sylvia.
        CAMERA PANS to CLOSEUP of Sylvia.  She is breathing
        softly, regularly.
 
 
172d.   CLOSE SHOT - CLAYTON & SYLVIA
 
        He bends over, looking at her for a long moment,
        then his hand touches her shoulder, shaking it to
        waken her.
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Softly)
               Wake up....
 
        Her eyes open, close, then open again.
 
                          CLAYTON (Cont'd)
                    (Gently)
               Let's get moving, huh?
 
        She doesn't move, only looks at him.
 
                          CLAYTON (Cont'd)
                    (Concealing his anxiety -
                     smiling)
               Are you all right?
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Still half-awake)
               I never noticed before - that's a
               cowboy tie....
 
                          CLAYTON
               I bought it for the square dance.
               I thought I ought to wear some-
               thing Western.
 
        She laughs dreamily, looking up at him.  Her smile
        goes suddenly.  She glances out over the edge of the
        ditch.
 
                          SYLVIA
               Is that... machine...?
 
                          CLAYTON
               It's gone now.
 
                          SYLVIA
               Where are we?
 
                          CLAYTON
               Southwest of Corona, somewhere.
               There must have been another
               cylinder down here.  They've been
               through this whole area and cleared
               everybody out.
                    (Peering from the ditch)
               There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if
               we can find something to eat...!
 
        As they prepare to leave,
 
        DISSOLVE:
 
 
173.    INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - (NIGHT)
 
        CLOSE on a skillet loaded with bacon and eggs.
        CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS.  The kitchen is not modern.
        Old gas refrigerator.  High-oven stove, its flaming
        gas-jets make an eerie glow.  Coffee percolates.
        Sylvia has tidied her hair, renewed her make-up.
        Clayton is taking a jug of orange juice from the
        refrigerator.  He uses it to indicate the farmhouse
        as he glances around.
 
                          CLAYTON
               We're doing all right.
 
        He puts it on the table, which he has set, then looks
        warily out the window.  He goes to the stove as
        Sylvia begins dishing up.  She is pensive.  They keep
        their voices down.
 
                          CLAYTON
               I almost forget when I ate last.
                    (Genuine)
               It looks so good.... You know,
               mostly I get my meals in coffee
               shops and restaurants.
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Astonished)
               Don't you live at home?
 
                          CLAYTON
               No, on the campus.  I haven't
               any family.
 
                          SYLVIA
               I come from a big one.  Nine of us.
               All in Minnesota, except me.
 
                          CLAYTON
               I have no close folks.  My parents
               died when I was a kid.
 
 
174.    ANOTHER ANGLE - CLAYTON AND SYLVIA
 
        Shooting across the table to the stove.  Sylvia
        comes toward CAMERA, bringing bacon and eggs.  He
        follows with the coffee.
 
                          CLAYTON
               A big family must be fun...I
               imagine it makes you feel you
               belong to something.
 
                          SYLVIA
               It does...Maybe that's why I feel
               kind of lost right now.
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Reassuring, pouring coffee)
               We'll get safely out of here, don't
               worry.
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Pouring orange juice)
               But they seem to murder everything
               that moves...!
 
                          CLAYTON
               If they're mortal, they must have
               mortal weaknesses.  They'll be
               stopped -- somehow!
 
 
175.    CLOSE SHOT
 
        They begin to eat.
 
                          CLAYTON
               I've been as close to them as anyone.
               But not close enough for real observation...
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Over him - not listening)
               I feel like I did one time when
               I was small.
                    (Not sorry for herself,
                     merely telling him)
               Awful scared and lonesome...I'd
               wandered off - I've forgotten why -
               but the family and whole crowds of
               neighbors were hunting for me.
                    (And then)
               They found me in a church.  I was
               afraid to go in any place else.
 
 
116.    CLOSE SHOT - SYLVIA
 
        Half smiling at the memory.
 
                          SYLVIA
               I stayed right by the door - praying
               for the one who loved me best to
               come and find me.
                    (And then)
               It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Quietly)
               I liked him.
 
 
177.    AT THE TABLE
 
        Sylvia touches away a tear, keeps her voice con-
        trolled.
 
                          SYLVIA
               He liked you ... I could bawl my
               head off!
 
                          CLAYTON
               But you're not going to.  You're
               not the kind.
                    (Encouraging, gentle)
               You're tired, anyway.  You've been
               up all night.  You cracked up in a
               plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you
               want to know something?
                    (Removing glasses
                     looking, smiling)
               It doesn't show on you at all.
 
        As she smiles, holding his gaze, a greenish glow
        begins to spread through the kitchen.  Clayton rises,
        startled.  The light becomes a glare that limns
        everything sharply - emerald and black.  A smashing
        and roaring SOUNDS outside, approaching like an
        avalanche.  Clayton grabs Sylvia as the house shakes.
        Part of the ceiling crashes down.  The floor rocks
        under them.  They fall, Clayton shielding Sylvia,
        as the walls smash in.
 
 
178.    HIGH CAMERA - SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. FARMHOUSE AND
        MULTIPLE METEOR
 
        A multiple meteor has fallen.  Through the ground
        mist we see that one cylinder has gouged up earth
        and is hitting the farmhouse in f.g.  Two other
        cylinders land in the far distance and are obscured
        in the mist.  All movement ends.  Silence follows.
 
        DISSOLVE:
 
 
179.    INT. WRECKED FARMHOUSE - (NIGHT)
 
        CLOSE on a broken pipe, gushing water.  Sylvia's hand
        comes into SCENE, soaking a cloth.  CAMERA PANS as
        she draws the cloth away.  Clayton is sprawled near
        the living room doorway, hunched, holding his head.
        She crouches by him - shaken, anxious - pressing the
        cloth against his temple.  He sits up slowly, holding
        the cloth against his head, then pressing it over his
        face and eyes.  He is hurt.  Finally, he drags the
        cloth down his face and sucks in his breath.  She
        holds him while his brain steadies.
 
                          CLAYTON
               How long was I out?
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Small, whispering)
               Hours.  I've been so scared...!
 
        He starts to get up.  She holds him down.
 
                          SYLVIA (Cont'd)
                    (Whispering)
               They're right outside!  Several of
               them came down together!
 
        Clayton is immediately alert.  He rises quietly,
        CAMERA PANS as he tiptoes to the wall and peers out
        a vertical break.
 
 
180.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. WRECKED FARMHOUSE
 
        Clayton's VIEWPOINT.  Everything is seen through or
        above low ground mist.  In b.g. is fencing, trees, sheds.
        Visible above the mist is a Martian machine, gliding
        slowly.  It stops.  CLOSE in f.g., is part of a glit-
        tering leg that rises to the underside of another
        machine standing sentinel, straddling the house.
 
 
181.    INT. KITCHEN - CLAYTON & SYLVIA
 
        Clayton's eyes reflect his excitement.  He leaves the
        opening, looks up, starts quickly toward the living
        room.
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Whispering)
               There's a machine standing right over us!
 
 
182.    INT. LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT
 
        The attic has been crushed down in a mess of beams
        and plaster.  The roof has spilled over at one side.
        Clayton reaches up, pulling at beams and plaster,
        trying to get a better look.  He peers out through
        an opening to the farmyard again.  Sylvia, by the
        door to the patio, regards him fearfully.
 
 
183.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. FARMHOUSE
 
        Clayton's VIEWPOINT from the living room.  The Martian
        machine in b.g. is now slowly submerging into the mist.
        From this vantage point, a third machine is now vis-
        ible, still on the ground in the farmyard.  Now this
        machine begins to rise on its glowing beam-legs.
 
 
184.    INT. LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT
 
        Clayton is peering through the opening in b.g.
        Sylvia, f.g., standing beside the broken door to the
        outside patio, turns and looks out.  She suppresses
        a scream, starting away.  CAMERA MOVES IN fast, SHOOT-
        ING past her to the EXTERIOR.  The patio is blocked
        with debris, fallen fuchsias, potted cacti in bloom.
        A form is just disappearing beyond the debris.  Smooth,
        reddish, indefinite.
 
 
185.    CLOSE SHOT - SYLVIA & CLAYTON
 
        Clayton jumps to her side.
 
                          SYLVIA
               Something moved outside!
 
        Clayton brings out a flashlight, starts to move out to
        the patio.  Sylvia clings to him as he looks.
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Whispering, tense)
               Nothing there now.
 
                          SYLVIA
               It was...
                    (Indicating Martians)
               ...one of them!
 
                          CLAYTON
               What was it like?
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Drawing him back
                     toward kitchen)
               I couldn't see much in the dark -
               but it was one!
 
                          CLAYTON
               We're right in a nest of 'em! ...
               I've got to get a look at them.
 
        He pulls away from Sylvia and works quickly at a
        shattered wall, making an opening.  From the other
        side of the room comes the SOUND of shifting debris.
        Sylvia calls a warning.  Clayton spins, backing to
        join her.  They shelter in the kitchen doorway,
        watching cautiously.  The thrusting and RATTLING
        of displaced wood and plaster continues.
 
 
186.    INT. LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT
 
        Their VIEWPOINT.  Through the debris appears a long,
        slender mechanism in the shape of a flexible metal-
        lic tubing.  At the head of it is an enlarged section
        which splits and slides back, disclosing a bright
        lens - like an eye, but larger.  It begins to quest
        about the room, glittering in the deep shadow.
 
 
187.    CLOSE - CLAYTON AND SYLVIA
 
        He is fascinated.  She is frozen with fear.
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Bated)
               It's looking for us!
 
        She pulls him down behind the upset dinette table,
        jammed in a corner with other debris.
 
 
188.    CLOSEUP - MARTIAN SCANNING EYE
 
        It is divided into three striated lenses, each faintly
        colored with one of the optical primaries - red, blue
        or green.  It comes through the doorway.  It turns
        ceaselessly around and back again on a sheathed
        universal joint, making a faint CLICKING SOUND on
        each movement.  Questing.  Suspicious.  Reflected in
        each lens is a tinted, peculiarly distorted view of
        the wrecked kitchen.
 
 
189.    CLOSE SHOT - CLAYTON & SYLVIA
 
        Huddled behind the table, watching through a crack.
 
 
190.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. FARMHOUSE & MARTIAN MACHINE
 
        CAMERA PICKS UP the plastic-covered nose of the
        machine, within which the honeycombed circle has
        now become a luminous screen.  On this translucent
        surface, projected from inside, is a curiously
        twisted picture of the kitchen - as transmitted
        by the scanning eye in the house below.
 
 
191.    INT. KITCHEN - CLOSE SHOT - CLAYTON & SYLVIA
 
        Clayton has picked up a pebble of broken plaster.
        He flips it against the ceiling of the living room
        beyond.  He grabs Sylvia, pulling her down.
 
 
191a.   INT. LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT - SCANNING EYE
 
        The eye is turning around and back as Clayton's pebble
        and a little broken plaster dribble from the ceiling.
        The eye snakes upward to look.  It comes down again.
        Slowly, suspiciously, it lowers to the floor.
 
 
192.    CLOSEUP - CLAYTON & SYLVIA
 
        She is clutching him.  He comes up a little, pokes
        cautiously where plaster is broken from the wall
        and peers into the living room.
 
 
193.    INT. LIVING ROOM - MED. FULL SHOT
 
        Clayton's VIEWPOINT.  The mechanical eye is in the
        middle of the floor, turning around and back.
        Watching.  Waiting.
 
 
194.    INT. KITCHEN - CLOSEUP - CLAYTON & SYLVIA
 
        He covers the peephole with his hand.
 
                          CLAYTON
               Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Bated)
               They could be as curious about us
               as we are about them.
 
                          CLAYTON
               Maybe ...
                    (Looks up)
               Maybe they want to take us alive.
 
 
195.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. FARMHOUSE - MED. FULL SHOT
 
        A Martian machine is moving through the mist in b.g.
        The one in the farmyard has moved nearer.  The honey-
        combed circle is alight, showing the picture of the
        kitchen in the house.  Suddenly this goes off.
 
 
196.    INT. KITCHEN - CLOSE SHOT CLAYTON & SYLVIA
 
        He is using the peephole to the living room again.
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Whispering - sharp)
               It's pulling out!
 
 
197.    INT. LIVING ROOM - MED. FULL SHOT
 
        VIEWPOINT from kitchen.  The sheath is closing over the
        eye.  The flexible tubing is withdrawing.  It disappears.
 
 
198.    CLOSE SHOT - CLAYTON & SYLVIA
 
        He gets up, comes cautiously from the kitchen, with
        Sylvia following.  She grasps his arm.
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Gasping)
               Let's get out of here!
 
        He gestures her to silence, moves toward the wall
        and the opening he had made.  She peers fearfully
        out through the broken patio door.
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (At the door, shocked)
               They've blocked it!
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (At opening in wall)
               It's blocked here, too!
                    (Furiously clawing at
                     the hole)
               They've pushed up earth or something
               all around outside.
                    (Moving to fireplace)
               Here, this way...!
 
        He snatches an axe from the woodbox by the fireplace,
        jabbing between fallen ceiling beams.  Sylvia looks
        fearfully around.
 
 
199.    CLOSEUP - SYLVIA & CLAYTON - PAN SHOT
 
        CAMERA WHIPS UP from them.  The Martian eye is hanging
        in the dimness above their heads, through a split in
        the ceiling.
 
                          SYLVIA
               Look out!!
 
        Clayton sees it, leaps, slashing with the axe.  A
        loose beam is dislodged in a shower of dust and frag-
        ments, falling across the tubing and the eye, pinning
        it to the floor.
 
 
200.    CLOSE SHOT - CLAYTON
 
        As he holds a foot on the tubing behind the eye,
        hacking with the axe.  He cuts the lens clear.  The
        rest of the mechanism is withdrawn fast, snaking up
        into the debris.
 
                          CLAYTON
               We've got to get out now - fast!
                    (Grabs up metal shape
                     containing the eye)
               This is something tangible to
               work on....
                    (Excited, exultant)
               It'll tell us a lot about them...
 
        He jumps to where he was working, hacking furiously
        with the axe, careless of noise now.
 
                          CLAYTON (Cont'd)
               I've got to get to Pacific-Tech -
               quick!
 
 
201.    CLOSE SHOT - SYLVIA
 
        SHOOTING past Clayton.  She comes into SCENE behind
        him, pulling on a loose beam to give him room, using
        a piece of cloth to protect her hands.  Behind her
        is a door leading to the den.  It is broken, sprung
        from its hinges.
 
        CAMERA MOVES IN past Clayton as out of the dark cavity
        behind Sylvia comes a hand that is more than a hand,
        on an arm that is thin, lean, with degenerate muscu-
        lature.  Thick veins cross it, pulsating.  Back of it
        is a dim form.  The hand-shape has three fingerlike
        suckers.  They fasten on Sylvia's shoulder, spreading,
        huge.  Her eyes and mouth open in horror.  She tries
        to scream but her vocal cords are paralyzed, shocked.
        She is drawn back, drops the loose beam.  Then she
        forces a SOUND between her lips.  Clayton hears and
        leaps to help her, sending the beam of his flash-
        light at the figure behind her.
 
 
202.    FLASH - CLOSE SHOT - MARTIAN
 
        We see a head, hairless, reddish like the planet
        itself, crossed by protruding veins which pulsate.
        Dominant is a single multi-lensed eye with colored
        pupils.  The Martian is staggered by the light.  He
        lifts his strange, suckered hands to ward it off.
 
 
203.    LIVING ROOM - CLAYTON, SYLVIA AND MARTIAN
 
        Clayton turns with Sylvia to escape.  The Martian
        lunges after them.  Clayton turns the flashlight on
        the figure again.  It stops, staggered.  Clayton
        flings the axe and the Martian reels back as the axe
        hits.  An unhuman SCREAMING sounds as it disappears
        back into the cavity.  This continues overscene as
        Clayton swings Sylvia to the opening in the ceiling.
        He snatches up the piece of cloth Sylvia dropped,
        then follows.
 
 
204.    INT. WRECKED FARMHOUSE - ATTIC
 
        Sylvia comes up through the sloping floor, slides to-
        ward a broken window, its frame sprung half out of
        the wall.  Clayton slides after her, through the
        dormer window.  They drop out between frame and wall.
        The SCREAMING continues.
 
 
205.    SPECIAL EFFECT - WRECKED FARMHOUSE AND MARTIANS
 
        The unhuman SCREAMING comes overscene, wild.  We see
        the red leg of the sentinel Martian, which is moving.
        In b.g. a machine is on the ground, misted.  From an
        opening comes a yellowish, strange-colored beam.
        Visible in this are three moving creatures.  Squat.
        Thick through.  Everything about them sags downward
        under air weight and the pull of gravity.  In f.g.,
        Clayton and Sylvia flee wildly from the house.
 
 
206.    EXT. FARMYARD - (NIGHT) - FEATURING CLAYTON AND SYLVIA
 
        The two run from the direction of the house, smashing
        through a burned hedge, their feet stirring hot ashes
        and bright sparks in the darkness.  The SCREAMING
        trails away.
 
 
207.    SPECIAL EFFECT - LONG SHOT - EXT. WRECKED HOUSE AND
        MARTIAN MACHINE
 
        The sentinel Martian has moved back from the house
        and is hitting it with a heat-ray.  Beyond, in the
        night sky, the green streak of a multiple meteor sud-
        denly slants down.  Glowing, sinister.  Another slows,
        falling at the same angle.  Both loom big before they
        hit the dark earth in turn and disappear behind the
        curtain of the ground mist.

210.    INT. MESSAGE CENTER - MED. CLOSE SHOT - (DAY)
 
        CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN on an enormous table map of the
        world, scattered with black patches, indicating dead
        areas cleaned out by the Martians.  Attack arrows
        extend from these.  Metal - each with a bright, min-
        iature Martian machine.  Around the edge of the map
        are WACs and special personnel constantly enlarging
        the blacked-out areas, pushing arrows forward as the
        Martians advance.  The map indicates that the world
        is fighting for its existence.  Spain is dead from
        Valencia to Seville.  Martians occupy the west of
        France up to Nantes.  They're thick from Cherbourg
        across Belgium, Holland.  The Italian boot is blacked
        out near Rome.  Dark patches are in Greece, Yugo-
        slavia.  In the southeast corner of England; in
        South Wales, Scotland and in Ireland from Tralee to
        Cork.  They're in Sweden, Lithuania, Marrakesh,
        Tripoli, Egypt, South Africa and strategic places in
        the U.S.S.R.  In the Levant and India, Malaya and
        Australia.  Some dead areas are large.  Some small.
        But the small ones grow larger all the time.
 
 
210a.   INT. MESSAGE CENTER - MED. SHOT
 
        A reception area occupies the floor around the map
        on the table.  In this area, and in rooms off it,
        are batteries of teletypes, phones, wirephoto
        machines.  Present are high Army, Air Force, Navy
        and Marine Corps brass, with a colorful scattering
        of worried foreign attaches - phoning, conferring,
        arguing.  Seated personnel receive messages and use
        phones to direct the workers at the map.
 
        CAMERA MOVES IN on a big group near a wall covered
        with pull-down maps, listening to General Mann.  His
        aide stands near, holding colored chalks.  There is
        a control-bank of TV screens close by, lifeless.
 
 
211.    CLOSE SHOT - GROUP
 
        Shooting past General Mann.  We see high brass, all
        stars and staff insignia.  The only civilian is the
        SECRETARY OF DEFENSE - neat, without fat, disting-
        uished, badger-gray hair, cool.  He stands beside the
        CHIEF OF STAFF - balding, seven rows of decorations
        and five stars; a tight-lipped man with calculating
        eyes.
 
        The rest are mature tacticians and fighters.  They
        include the FRENCH ATTACHE - rugged, tough.  The
        ITALIAN ATTACHE - fat, suave.  The BRITISH ATTACHE
        has a trim mustache, three rows of ribbons, graying
        hair.  The incessant SOUNDS of phone calls, teletypes,
        quick orders come over SCENE.
 
                          GENERAL MANN'S VOICE
               And this much is certain -- it is
               vital to prevent the Martian machines
               linking up.  Once they do, they adopt
               an extraordinary military tactic.
                    (Forceful - indicating map)
               You can see from those blacked-out
               areas that they're using it very
               effectively.  They form a crescent...
 
 
212.    CLOSE SHOT - GENERAL MANN
 
        He uses colored chalk to draw a thick, crescent-
        shaped line on the blackboard.  He continues drawing,
        illustrating his words.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               They anchor it at one end, and sweep
               on until they've cleared a quadrant...
 
        He draws three crescent-shaped lines to a quadrant,
        showing the movement of the Martians.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               ...Then they anchor the opposite end--
               and reverse direction!
 
        As the strange diagram progresses across the black-
        board, it takes on an unearthly, centipedular aspect.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               They slash across country like scythes,

               the West Coast... Golden Gate
               Bridge.
 
        A Martian machine is coming off the bridge, moving
        out from under one of the 750-foot towers.

        We see a Martian machine on the waterfront, caught
        against the New York skyline, using a ray against
        a skyscraper.

               This is the Paris wirephoto.  It
               must be the last thing out of
               there!
 
        CAMERA MOVES IN on the glass.  In a still picture
        transparescy, we see the Eiffel Tower collapsing.
        There is a Martian machine in a lower corner.  A
        ray has blasted three of the tower's legs and is
        just hitting a fourth.

               This is a sonic-radar picture, taken
               from extreme altitude.  It shows de-
               tails of the Martian nest outside
               Los Angeles.
 
        CAMERA MOVES IN on the viewing glass.
 
                          STAFF MAJOR'S VOICE
               Their machines show as round blobs.
               Newly fallen cylinders are elongated.
 
        We see an odd, blue-tinted photo.  It shows a clear
        pattern of small, shining shapes.  Sentinel Martians
        make the outer points of a triangle.  Inside these
        are smaller triangles, formed where multiple cylin-
        ders have come down.
 
                          CHIEF OF STAFF'S VOICE
               We know there are three cylinders to
               each group.  Three machines to every
               cylinder...

               There's only one thing that will stop
               the Martians!  We've held back pre-
               viously because of the danger of
               radiation to civilians.  Now there's
               no choice.
                    (To Chief of Staff)
               The United Nations has voted authority
               to the United States.  The White House
               will confirm an order to use the Atom

                          SECRETARY
               I'll request the scientists from
               Pacific-Tech to monitor the drop.
                    (Toward General Mann)
               We'll clear the area all around.  After

               What's that?
 
                          DR. PRYOR
               A king-size fish eye?
 
                          CLAYTON
               We took this off the Martians.
 
        All move in sharply as he sets the eye on a table.
        DR. PENNINGTON - astro-physics and optics -

               They may be mental giants, but by
               our standards, they're physically
               degenerate.
 
        Most of the Pacific-Tech scientists are grouped with
        him at a bench where the stained cloth is under
        examination; Clayton and Sylvia with them.  In a
        corner is an epidiascope; Dr. Pennington is rigging
        the Martian 'eye' to this.  The instrument has a
        big screen.
 
        There is a wall-board chalked with notes and form-
        ulae.  High-pressure cylinders - one red, one green -

                    (Commenting mildly)
               Isn't it curious how everything about

                          CLAYTON
               Their eyes have three lenses and
               three distinct pupils.  And strong
               light shocks them.
 
                          DR. PENNINGTON
               They're not accustomed to it!  Sunlight
               on Mars is about half as strong as we
               get it.  Add their clouds and dust and
               it amounts to no more than twilight.
                    (To Clayton)
               We've rigged this epidiascope to reflect
               whatever your Martian lense picks up.

        CAMERA ANGLES to favor Clayton, Dr. Pryor and Dr.
        Bilderbeck as they ease nearer.  Light from the
        epidiascope screen shows on their faces.  Its density
        changes.  Suddenly, everyone gasps, horrified.

        Hands elongated.  Fingers like bony talons with blue
        claws.  Proportions gone crazy, and all movement
        exaggerated.  There is a moment of horrified silence.
 
                          DR. DuBROCK'S VOICE
               If that's how they see us, no wonder
               they want to kill us on sight!
 
                          DR. BILDERBECK'S VOICE
               If I saw creatures like that I'd want
               to kill them myself.
 
                          CLAYTON'S VOICE
               Evidently there's a shift in the spec-
               trum.  And color absorption of the
               Martian retina is completely different
               from our own.
                    (Amused)
               But maybe they look good to each other!

        The others move back and Sylvia seems to surge on to
        the glass screen.  Her face is a nightmare mask,
        violently colored.  She recoils in a little shocked

        They are all moving toward the door.  Clayton pauses
        by the microscope, glancing toward Gratzman.

                    (Touching cloth - thoughtfully)
               This Martian blood...
                    (Suddenly suggesting)
               Let's make a quick analysis and see
               what we've got!
 
                          GRATZMAN
                    (Looking at him - thinking)
               It might give us something.
 
        Sylvia glances at them in turn, not understanding,
        but sensing the importance of what they are saying.
        Pennington pauses behind them.

               Let it go.  If you're interested in

        CAMERA is CLOSE on the lips and mouth of a RADIO
        REPORTER for the Pacific Broadcasting Company as he
        speaks rapidly and dramatically into a microphone.
 
                          REPORTER
               The target for the A-bomb drop is this
               nest of Martian machines in the Puente
               Hills - where more of these meteors
               came down early last evening.
 
        The SHOT WIDENS to show the Reporter -- dishevelled,
        tired, dirty -- with a portable tape-recorder slung
        over his shoulder.  He moves forward, CAMERA FOLLOW-
        ING, to disclose Sylvia, gazing through field glasses.
        The Reporter exits, still talking rapidly.  Sylvia
        lowers the glasses momentarily, then looks through
        them again.  CAMERA leaves her, PANNING.
 
        The mouth of the vehicular tunnel is on the slope of
        a high ridge, about halfway up to the summit, so that
        a view from the tunnel itself is one of sky only.
        Right at the mouth of the tunnel, the highway makes
        an abrupt turn to enter, and the outer side of the
        roadway is protected by the usual concrete buffer
        wall.  This has been augmented by the military with
        massive sandbag breastworks to protect those in the
        tunnel and the necessary observers in forward posi-
        tions from enemy action from the valley below.  With-
        in the tunnel proper, CAMERA PICKS UP the scientists
        from Pacific-Tech, who are gathered in a cul-de-sac
        in the tunnel wall.  Doctors DuBrock, Pennington and
        Bilderbeck have already got into their colored anti-
        radiation suits.  Doctors Pryor and Gratzman are
        present with sundry assistants.  Gloves, masks, and
        special equipment are being laid out.  Clayton is
        putting on a suit.  A jeep stands by. During this:
 
                          REPORTER'S VOICE
               A plane will pinpoint the target for
               the drop from six miles up.  Conditions
               are perfect.  The bomb will be about
               ten times more powerful than the one
               used at Hiroshima.  Nothing like it
               has ever been exploded before, and
               we're going to be pretty darn close --
               but there are observers down in the
               valley in a forward bunker and they'll
               be a lot nearer than us!
 
        CAMERA MOVES to PICK UP, near the outer breastworks,
        Army, Navy and Air Force brass, with special observers
        from the Atomic Energy Commission, and a First-Aid
        unit.  To one side is a group of high officers and
        officials, for liaison and observation from Allied
        Nations within the roster of the united Nations.
        Everyone is equipped with field glasses.  Observing
        officers use them constantly and talk quietly, tense-
        ly.  There is a BUZZ of comment in foreign tongues
        from the United Nations Group.  A spread of loud-
        speakers is mounted on a jeep.  Other vehicles include
        a Radar Scanning truck with antenna cocked skyward,
        constantly scanning.
 
                          REPORTER'S VOICE (Cont'd)
               There must be a couple of million people
               back of us in the shelter of the San Gabriel
               hills -- waiting to find out whether they
               can go home again!  This will decide the
               fate of civilization and all humanity --
               whether we live or die may depend on what
               happens here!

        CAMERA PICKS UP General Mann with a group of officers
        and staff of Sixth Army Command, behind a big breast-
        work.  Nearby is a field telephone unit.  Beyond are
        cameramen in battle dress.  The Radio Reporter moves
        into SCENE, talking in to his mike.
 
                          REPORTER
               Direct cable communication is being
               maintained with Washington, and from
               there to key centers around the world,
               but there's no radio communication at
               all - even with the bombing plane that's
               coming over.  All radio is dead.  Which
               means that these tape-recordings I'm
               making are for the sake of history --

                          DR. PENNINGTON
               It won't.

               Is it possible to go in right
               after the explosion?
 
                          CLAYTON
               Yes, with these suits.  We've used
               them before on atomic tests... Odd-
               looking, aren't they?
 
                          SYLVIA

               along the tunnel.
 
        f.     Special Effect - the glare outlines a cowering

               lies - a scene reminiscent of Mount Rubidoux
               of an Easter morning.  As the bomb glares, a
               GASP of human terror and agony joins with the

        is gliding.  Another follows.  A third shows.

               They haven't even been touched!
 
 
246.    GROUP - GENERAL MANN, SCIENTISTS, CLAYTON AND SYLVIA
 
        The Pacific-Tech men run into the breastwork, Clayton
        and Sylvia with them.  The suction blast whips and
        swirls, dust filling the air.  CAMERA FAVORS the
        General, using field glasses.
 
                          GENERAL MANN
                    (Shaken)
               It didn't stop them...
 
                          DR. PRYOR
               They knew what to expect!
 
                          DR. DuBROCK
                    (Excited)
               They're way ahead of us electronically.
               They've had the atom bomb and forgotten
               it!
 
                          GENERAL MANN
                    (Desperate)
               Guns - tanks - bombs - they're like
               toys against them.  We can't go on
               ordering men to attack...!
 
 
247.    WIDER ANGLE - GROUP - SYLVIA IN F.G.
 
        Army, Navy and Air Force Brass coming over, listen-
        ing, anxious.  The wind fades.
 
                          DR. PRYOR
               They'll exterminate every living
               thing!
 
                          DR. PENNINGTON
               So what do we do -- run about like
               ants until they hunt us down?
 
                          GENERAL MANN
               We'll establish a line and fight them
               all the way back to the mountains!
 
                          DR. BILDERBECK
                    (Mildly again)
               But it can end only one way ...
               We're beaten.
 
        Sylvia looks at him, moves away.  Clayton follows.
        CAMERA MOVES IN on Dr. DuBrock and Dr. Bilderbeck.
 
                          DR. DuBROCK

248.    EXT. MOUTH OF TUNNEL - NEAR BREASTWORK
 
        Featuring Sylvia, as Clayton comes to her.  Dr.
        DuBrock is approaching from b.g.  Sylvia looks up
        at the empty branch where the oriole was perched.
 
                          SYLVIA
               Maybe they won't kill all the birds.
 
                          DR. DuBROCK
               Washington issued orders - in event the
               A-bomb failed - immediately evacuate
               all cities under attack!
                    (Looking out toward Martians)
               And they're moving in on Los Angeles
               now!
 
                          CLAYTON
               They'll stamp the city flat!
 
                          DR. DuBROCK
                    (To Clayton)
               If we take all the instruments we can
               establish a base in the Rocky Mountains...
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Nodding - looking o.s.)
               A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
 
                          GRATZMAN
               It might give us time to search out
               some weakness in the Martians.
 
                          CLAYTON
               I believe we can get a lead from their
               anaemic blood.
 
                          DR. DuBROCK
                    (Glancing at Clayton)
               You mean some biological approach...?
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Forcefully)
               We know now that we can't beat their
               machines -- but we can beat them!
                    (Looking o.s. again)
               They are mortal beings...The only
               question is whether we have time enough
               to do anything!
 
                          GRATZMAN
                    (To DuBrock)
               If we get what transportation we can,
               and pick up instruments and books
               from Pacific-Tech...
 
                          DuBROCK
                    (To Sylvia)
               Could you help us?  Drive for us?
 
                          SYLVIA
               Of course.
 
                          DR. DuBROCK
                    (Hurrying o.s.)
               Thank you!
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Quietly, watching Sylvia)
               The Rockies...!  You'd rather get
               back to that big family of yours
               in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
 
                          SYLVIA
               I wonder if they're going through
               this too...?
 
        Clayton looks at her sympathetically, not speaking.
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Going on)
               I probably wouldn't be able to get
               to them if I tried...
 
                          CLAYTON
               You'll be all right with us....
                    (Looking out again)
               ...for as long as anybody's got!
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Touching his arm)
               Don't let's lose each other.
 
        He tucks a hand under her arm, reassuring, turning
        away with her.
 
                          SYLVIA
                    (Wryly, smiling)
               Because then I really would feel lost!

254.    EXT. YARD BEHIND PACIFIC-TECH - (DAY)
 
        Overscene is the distant SOUND of the Martian
        approach - roaring explosions, the thunder of
        destruction and gunfire.  The scene itself is desper-
        ate with urgency and activity.  Scientists working
        frantically to load books, heavy instruments, papers,
        files - even a blackboard from which there is no
        time to copy the formulae it bears.  For transporta-
        tion they have a small moving van, a school bus,
        stake truck, two light pick-ups and four cars.
 
        As we come into scene, the moving van roars past us
        to the street.  Beyond this, the last baggage is
        being slammed aboard the yellow school bus.  Dr.
        DuBrock waves it away.  It comes PAST CAMERA -
        Sylvia driving - as Clayton climbs up behind the
        wheel of the stake truck.
 
 
255.    BY THE STAKE TRUCK
 
        Clayton reaches for the starter button as Gratzman

                          GRATZMAN
               No.  I thought you had them.

256.    INT. LABORATORY - HIGH POTENTIAL BUILDING - (DAY)
 
        The room is in a state of abandonment and disorder.

        glass and packed plastic vials which have been left
        on one of the benches.  He starts out again.

        It is littered with discarded material.  All the other

        truck.  He is a lonely, desperate figure in the empty
        yard, as he clambers aboard pushing his load across to
        the passenger seat.  He starts the motor.  The truck
        screams away.
 
 
257.    INT. TRUCK CAB - EXIT FROM YARD AND STREET

        A mob has attacked and piled aboard a P.E. bus.
        Others are swarming all over a couple of taxis.
        These vehicles begin to move on, with men on roofs
        and bumpers.  The mob rushes the stake truck.

        Men jump up at both sides of the cab, wrenching open
        the doors before Clayton can back up.

        SHOOTING through the windshield.  Men attacking Clayton
        from both sides of the cab.
 
 
263.    STAKE TRUCK AND MOB - STREET
 
        It is a strange mob.  Men and women.  Desperate.  Piling
        over the open sides of the now halted truck, while
        Clayton fights behind the wheel.  He is thrown out.
        A man slides into his place.  CAMERA PANS the mob,
        fighting to get aboard - emptying the truck to make
        room.  Scientific instruments crash to the road.  Books
        and papers shower down.  The truck gets under way.
        People hanging on outside are shoved off.
 
 
264.    MOVING SHOT - BACK OF TRUCK
 
        A well-dressed man is clinging to a rear corner,

265.    ROADWAY - FEATURING WELL-DRESSED MAN
 
        His bag bursts open as he falls.  Bills, gold coins,
        jewelry spills out.  He scrambles to pick up his money.
        Running feet trample on it.  Trample on him.
 
 
266.    EXT. STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLAYTON
 
        He gets to his feet, winded, holding his ribs,
        gazing after the truck.  Stragglers run past him.
        Only the well-dressed man is left behind, still
        grabbing for his valuables.  Clayton gets his
        breath, looks around.
 
 
267.    MED. SHOT - WELL-DRESSED MAN
 
        Strewn on the pavement is the precious debris the
        mob left.  The shattered barrel of an electron micro-
        scope - biochemical vials, spilled and shattered -
        electric induction furnace - laboratory cameras -
        electronic tubes - microscopes - books - the jars
        and containers of organic chemistry.  The well-
        dressed man is scrabbling among this wreckage as
        Clayton comes into SCENE.

               Did that mob grab the truck ahead
               of me?
 
        The man glances at him but doesn't answer.  Clayton
        moves nearer.
 
                          CLAYTON (Cont'd)
                    (Desperate)
               Hey - there were a lot of Pacific-Tech
               men with those trucks!  Did you see them?
 
                          MAN
               I don't know.  There was fighting

                    (Still moving in)
               Did the mob get a school bus?  A
               girl was driving it.

        He sits back on his haunches, looking at the bills
        and coins in his hand.  He looks from the bag to
        Clayton and back again, suddenly shaken and terribly
        shocked.
 
                          WELL-DRESSED MAN
               My whole life's savings...Now it
               won't even buy a ride on a truck!
 
        Slowly he stands up.  Suddenly he grabs a big fistful
        of bills and jewels from the bag.

               Help yourself -- there's a hundred
               thousand in there!
 
        He turns and starts after the mob.  Clayton eyes the
        ruin around him.  He picks up a shattered microscope,
        looking from it to the way he has come.  Again he
        looks at the debris of the instruments, hopeless.  He
        turns to the way he was traveling and lets the micro-
        scope fall from his hand as he starts away, beginning
        to run.  CAMERA ANGLES to PICK UP the money and broken
        instruments.  It MOVES CLOSE on the shattered micro-

        Deserted.  Late afternoon shadows.  Littered with
        dropped garments.  Doors stand open.  Curtains flap
        at windows.  Clayton is running, glancing back as an
        old, open car rattles into scene.  Loaded with three
        families, their kids and two barking dogs.  Bundles
        and baggage tied all over it.  Clayton thumbs for a
        ride.  Sprints and tries to leap on the running board.
        Hands shove him off.  He falls.  The car clatters on.
        Clayton gets up off the road and begins to run again.
        Two more cars come past CAMERA and race by him, over-
        loaded, driven recklessly.

        Clayton dog-trots into scene.  It is beginning to get
        dark.  We see debris from a hasty road-block placed
        by a mob - chairs, settee, furniture dragged out of
        a nearby store.  To the side of the road is one of
        the pickups from Pacific-Tech, distinguished by its
        color, overturned, its load spilled, wheels buckled,
        jammed between a telephone pole and shop front.
        Strewn on the road are piles of papers, books, files
        and instruments thrown off the other Pacific-Tech
        vehicles.  Clayton stares around, sees something and
        hurries to pick up a yellow board:  SCHOOL BUS -
        Southridge.  He holds it, looking around.  The road is
        scattered with baggage thrown off the little bus.  A
        car streaks past, heavily laden and going fast.  Three
        bicyclists follow, pedaling hard, possessions tied all
        over themselves and their machines.  One wobbles, but
        recovers.  Clayton starts forward, hesitates, still
        holding the yellow board.

        No answer.  He looks up at the sky and the unearthly
        flicker of the Martian rays.  He glances at the
        board again.  The first drops of rain hit it, driz-
        zling down.  He drops it across the curb, moves
        away toward the broken barrier, turning up his coat

        looming larger and closer.  His FOOTSTEPS ECHO in the
        deserted street.  Then his feet enter the SHOT and
        pause by the puddle and the yellow board.  CAMERA MOVES
        UP to disclose Clayton in CLOSE figure, looking down

        from him to show the street beyond.  Smashed windows
        and looted shops.  Cracked-up, abandoned vehicles.
        Discarded bundles.  A jalopy has overturned against a

        a church.  Faint light shows at the windows.  Above

        He climbs the steps, pushes open the doors.  The

        CAMERA is CLOSE on Clayton as he opens the doors

        PANS with Clayton to people standing near the door.
        Light in the church comes from kerosene lamps and
        candles placed wherever they will stand - on pew-ends,
        window-ledges.  CAMERA FOLLOWS Clayton, as he looks
        anxiously about.  The congregation is a scattered
        gathering of distressed humanity.  Those who couldn't
        run - children, cripples, the sick, aged - and those
        who felt it was useless to run.  They make groups
        and clusters in the aisles and benches and pews.  The
        church is full of quiet movement - first-aid for the
        injured, water for the faint, comforting children,
        soothing babies.  The VOICE OF the MINISTER is lifted
        in prayer.  Mumbled 'Amens' join, above the RUMBLE
        of destruction, growing with the Martian advance.

        As Clayton runs into it, checks.  The sky is red and

        ING.  A ray fires the tip of a tall building.  A
        skeleton beam hits another.  It collapses, falls.  A
        Martian machine comes into sight, ray slashing.  The

        his arms.  Not ranting.  Sure in his faith.  Under
        great stress.
 
                           REV. BETHANY
                     (Supplicating)
                In our peril we plead!  Succor and
                comfort us in this hour.
                     (Almost whispering)
                Please God....
 
        He lowers his arms.  A terrifying, rattling explosion
        sounds nearby.  We hear the vicious screech of a
        skeleton ray and the chuting roar of falling masonry.
        Rev. Bethany signs toward the choir.
 
 
289.    CLOSE SHOT - CHOIR BOY
 
        Tears on his cheeks.  Scared to death.  Lips trembling.
        But his clear soprano sounds.
 
                           CHOIR BOY
                     (Singing)
                Abide with me ....
 
 
290.    MOVING SHOT - INT. COMMUNITY CHURCH
 
        The congregation picks up the hymn, the Rev. Bethany's
        voice coming strongly.  CAMERA TRUCKS the congregation.
        Sudden flashes burn at the windows.  Crackings and
        roarings increase overscene, racing closer.  Some people
        glance from the corners of their eyes.  Some cling to
        one another, shuddering at the high-pitched sounds of
        Martian rays.  They know any moment may be the last.
        CAMERA PICKS UP:
 
                a.   Elderly couple holding hands,
                     singing the hymn, and waiting
                     patiently for the end.
 
                b.   Rev. Bethany, out of his pulpit,
                     putting a comforting arm around
                     the choir boy.
 
                c.   Stained-glass windows, aflame and
                     brilliant from the glare of a ray
                     passing outside.
 
                d.   Young husband and wife with two kids,
                     seven and four years old.  The parents
                     have their arms about them.  The little
                     girl has an arm around her brother.  She
                     is praying:  "Set four angels round my
                     bed...one to watch...and one to pray...
                     and two to carry my soul away."  The
                     mother bites her lip.  Her husband kisses
                     her.  They cling to each other.
 
        CAMERA PICAS UP Clayton searching frantically, try-
        ing to push in past people, beginning to lose hope.
        CAMERA MOVES ON.  We see a doctor doing what he can
        for sick and injured.  As CAMERA MOVEMENT CONTINUES
        the overscene noises begin almost imperceptibly to
        diminish, as though the Martian advance is myster-
        iously slowing.  Finally, CAMERA PICKS UP Sylvia.
        Kneeling a little way in from the church porch.
        Beyond her is a stained-glass window of St. Peter.
        The SOUND from outside is lessening all the time.
 
        CAMERA MOVES CLOSE on Sylvia.  Praying softly.  As
        she prayed when she was small.  We don't need to
        hear the words.  We know what she is asking when we
        see the light that comes in her face as she hears:
 
                          CLAYTON'S VOICE
               Sylvia.......!
 
        She whirls around and comes upright.  CAMERA ANGLE
        WIDENS.  Clayton takes her in his arms, just as
        the stained glass window is momentarily lit by an
        orange glare.  Loud in the strange and sudden quiet
        comes a tremendous explosion.  Colored glass showers
        in from the window, but the haloed head of St. Peter
        remains intact.  So do his keys.  Woodwork, masonry
        and dust spill down from the roof.  People scatter
        from it, moving out of SCENE PAST CAMERA with
        Clayton and Sylvia.  CAMERA PANS and HOLDS on the
        congregation as the hymn dies out.  Now it is al-
        most completely quiet.  People begin to rise.  Lis-
        tening, turning to gaze o.s.  Some begin to move to
        the doorway and steps outside.
 
 
291.    EXT. CHURCH STEPS - MED. SHOT
 
        Sylvia and Clayton are standing on the steps.  Still.
        Listening with everyone else.  The Doctor comes for-
        ward to look out.  Sylvia gasps suddenly, holding
        tightly to Clayton.  A woman near her points o.s.,
        SCREAMING wildly.
 
 
292.    SPECIAL EFFECT - CHURCH & STREET - FULL SHOT
 
        A Martian machine is coming from the corner of the
        block.  Rolling toward the church, filthy with dust,
        tangled with every sort of debris.  Ugly and enormous,
        rays flickering into the air.  It blunders into a
        building.  Comes on.
 
 
293.    EXT. CHURCH - MED. SHOT
 
        Everyone still, staring fearfully off at the machine.
        Faces lit by the shuddering glare of nearby flames.
        The Rev. Bethany shows in b.g., coming forward,
        gazing out.
 
 
294.    SPECIAL EFFECT - MARTIAN MACHINE  (2)
 
        Its colors dimmed, muddy.  Foul with earth and oil
        streaks.  Dribbling debris.  Rays lick weakly, fading.
        It blunders into and breaks overhead wires and cables.
        A telephone pole smashes down under it.  Fallen wires
        are entangled underneath, burning and smoking in the
        sputtering high-frequency beam-legs.  The beams flick-
        er, off and on.  The machine rocks as its supports
        falter.  It crashes to the street.
 
 
294a.   EXT. STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIAN MACHINE
 
        An aperture slowly splits open.  The hand and arm
        of a Martian struggle partly out, reaching and clawing.
 
 
295.    EXT. CHURCH - MED. CLOSE SHOT
 
        Everyone staring, full of fear and wonder.  The Rev.
        Bethany joins Clayton and Sylvia.
 
 
296.    EXT. STREET - CLOSE SHOT - MARTIAN
 
        The triple-suckered hand is reaching out, trying to
        find a grip.  We see the protruding veins, their
        pulsation weakening, slowing.
 
 
297.    EXT. CHURCH - MED. CLOSE MOVING SHOT
 
        Clayton moves out.  The Doctor follows with Sylvia.
        The Rev. Bethany moves out.  Others follow.  Clayton
        pauses, looking o.s.  Others look with him.
 
 
298.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. STREET - FULL SHOT
 
        F.g. is the machine on the pavement.  Beyond at a cor-
        ner, is another, heat-ray flicking wildly.  It lurches
        against a building, caroms off, blunders into another
        and moves out of sight.
 
 
299.    EXT. STREET & CHURCH - FULL SHOT
 
        A REVERSE ANGLE, with the downed Martian machine in
        f.g.  People from the church begin to approach the
        machine, but they are wary and keep their distance.
        Clayton leads the way with the Doctor.  Suddenly
        Clayton gestures and they all stop and look off
        past the f.g. machine.
 
 
300.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. DEVASTATED STREET - MED. SHOT
 
        A Martian machine almost enveloped in flames, moving
        slowly.  Its beam-legs flicker.  It sinks down.
 
 
301.    EXT. STREET & MARTIAN MACHINE - MED. CLOSE SHOT
 
        Clayton steps forward again.
 
                          CLAYTON
                    (Looking off - exclaiming)
               Something's happening to them!
 
        He looks down at the veined arm extending from the
        opening in the machine.
 
 
302.    CLOSE SHOT - MARTIAN & GROUP
 
        SHOOTING across the Martian's arm in f.g.  The skin
        of the arm is losing its ruddy color.  The pulsation
        of the veins has slowed.  The clutching of the hand
        lessens.  The arm becomes brownish-yellow.  The hand
        stills.  Clayton and the Doctor, b.g. move closer.
        The Doctor kneels by the Martian, touches the yellow
        flesh.
 
 
303.    EXT. STREET & CHURCH - MED. FULL SHOT
 
        People streaming from the church and the street
        beyond.  Staring.  Inching forward.
 
 
304.    EXT. STREET & MACHINE - GROUP - (MOVING SHOT)
 
        The Doctor straightens up from his examination of
        the Martian.  There is a strained look of awe on
        his face as he looks off toward the now silent city.
 
                          DOCTOR
                    (Low-voiced)
               We were all praying for a miracle...
 
        The SHOT WIDENS to include the forefront of the
        crowd.  Reverend Bethany, the choir boy, Clayton,
        Sylvia, all waiting on his words.  They, too,
        look off, listening.
 
 
304a.   SERIES OF CUTS - COLLAPSE OF THE MARTIANS
 
        a.     Special Effect - Ext. Viaduct (as previously).
               Flames of the burning oil reservoir previous-
               ly destroyed.  The Martian machine sinks to
               the ground.
 
        b.     Special Effect - Ext. City Hall District (as
               previously).  Rays and beams in the smoke-filled
               sky grow weak, flicker and stop.  There is
               silence.
 
        c.     Special Effect - Ext. Street (as previously).
               Wreckage everywhere.  Smoke-laden sky.
               Devastated buildings.  Flames.  Two Martian
               machines prone on the street, color fading.
               A jeep races through down the street, dodging
               obstacles.
 
        d.     Special Effect - San Gabriel Hills (as previous-
               ly).  The thousands of families huddled in the
               barrancas and gullies are turned, facing the
               holocaust in the distant city.  A last few
               rays streak the sky, then cease.  A BABBLE of
               VOICES grows into an inarticulate hosanna.
 
 
304b.   EXT. STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT
 
        The Doctor is center of the group.
 
                          DOCTOR
               After everything men could do has
               failed - the Martians are being killed
               by the littlest things that God, in
               His wisdom, has put upon the earth.
 
        People are looking at him.  At one another.
 
                          DOCTOR
                    (Quietly)
               The Martians come from a sterilized
               world.  They have no resistance to
               diseases from which we are immune.
                    (To Reverend Bethany)
               This one died of septicema.  Anaerobic
               baccili.
                    (To Clayton - grim, glad)
               An embolism of his overdeveloped brain
               has burst an artery - killed him and
               saved us!  They're doomed - all of
               them.  Germ are killing them!
 
        CAMERA MOVES IN on the faces of the crowd.  Hardly
        believing what has happened.  Beginning to hope.
        Wonder and gladness growing.
 
                          REVEREND BETHANY
               Saved by the littlest things God made...!
 
                          DOCTOR'S VOICE
               Once they are infected, it's quick --
               twenty-four hours.  It's hit all these
               at about the same time.
 
 
304c.   EXT. STREET & CHURCH - MED. SHOT - (PAN SHOT)
 
        Near the church, the MP jeep speeds in, braking as
        it nears the people.  They jump aside, leaving a
        lane to the fallen Martian machine.  CAMERA PANS
        with the jeep.  Half-standing, the MP Driver and
        his PFC aide yell orders, gesticulating, faces grim.
 
                          MP DRIVER
               Keep to your shelters - stay in your
               shelters!  Everybody back!
 
                          OTHER MP
               There's still danger - wait for orders!
 
                          MP DRIVER
               You'll get orders!
 
        The jeep stops beside the main group.  The two MPs
        jump out, guns at the ready, and advance to the
        dead Martian.
 
 
304d.   CLOSE SHOT - GROUP
 
        Clayton, Sylvia, Rev. Bethany, Doctor.  Breathless,
        eyes questioning mutely.
 
 
304e.   CLOSEUP MP DRIVER
 
        He rises and turns toward the group.
 
                          MP DRIVER
                    (Understanding their
                     tension)
               Nothing official yet -- but it looks
               like it's over.  First reports are
               they're folding up in droves all
               over the world!
 
        He grins and wipes his brow.
 
 
304f.   CLOSEUP CHOIR BOY
 
        He draws a breath, eyes shining.
 
                          CHOIR BOY
                    (Singing - clear)
               Now thank we all our God...
 
 
305.    SPECIAL EFFECT - BELFRY & CITY - FULL SHOT
 
        As the words of the ancient hymn swell OVERSCENE
        from a myriad throats, bells begin to peal through
        the smoke and ruin of the devastated city.
 
                          VOICES
                    (Singing)
               ...With heart and hand and voices,
               Who wondrous things hath done...
 
 
306.    EXT. STREET & CHURCH - CROWD  (MOVING SHOT)
 
        Some singing.  Some in silent prayer.  Some in silent
        ecstasy.  The young husband hugging his kids.  An old
        woman all alone, singing softly with the others, eyes
        turned to heaven.  They start to move toward the
        church.  CAMERA PICKS UP IN CLOSE SHOT, Clayton and
        Sylvia.  She is radiant.  He smiles, holding her gaze
        as he takes off his glasses, folds them and puts them
        in his pocket, bending to her.  She takes his arm,
        smiling up at him.  They move after the crowd.  She
        starts to sing as they go.
 
 
307.    SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. STREET & CITY BEYOND
 
        CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN into the street as the crowd
        moves toward the church.  Almost unconsciously, people
        have formed a lane, along which the small figures of
        Clayton and Sylvia walk.  CAMERA PANS UP the facade
        of the church to the belfry, where bells begin to ring
        out, joining the chorus of SOUND from the VOICES and
        other belfrys.  CAMERA PANS ACROSS burned, smoking
        buildings to an untouched sector of the city - CROSSING
        other belfrys with their ringing BELLS.  A dawn sun is
        rising beyond rooftops as the SINGING VOICES end in a
        great "AMEN."
 
        FADE OUT.
