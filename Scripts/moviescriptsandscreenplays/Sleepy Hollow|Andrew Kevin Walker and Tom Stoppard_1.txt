     EXT.  CITY STREETS -- NIGHT

     Empty cobblestone streets are bordered by stately buildings.  A rapidly
     CLANGING BELL breaks the silence from afar.

     INSERT TITLE:               New York City
                                     1799

     TWO CONSTABLES clamor around a corner, lanterns held high, listening.
     They disappear down an alleyway.

     EXT.  CITY WATERFRONT -- NIGHT

     ELSEWHERE, piers border the Hudson.  The BELL is LOUDER here.  The two
     constables arrive, searching, pistols drawn.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Where are you?!

                             MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Here... !  Over here!

     The constables hurry to the river's edge... 

     Down an embankment, the MAN, another constable, has his back to us.
     He's waist deep in dark water, throwing aside his ALARM BELL,
     struggling to pull something from the murk... 

                             MAN
               I need your help with this.

     Constable Two and Constable One move forward, wary.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Constable Crane?  Ichabod Crane... is
               that you?

     The MAN turns.  Meet ICHABOD CRANE, handsome, eyes piercing but nervous
     and unsettled.

                             ICHABOD
               None other, and not only me... 
                     (returns to lifting)
               I have found something... 

     Ichabod drags a bloated MALE CORPSE out from the water.  He backs away,
     shaken, looks to the constables... 

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               ... which was lately a man.

     INT.  CITY WATCHHOUSE, JAIL -- NIGHT

     In a dank, cavernous room, the distinguished HIGH CONSTABLE lifts a
     blanket off the corpse in a wheelbarrow manned by Constable Two.
     Constable One and Ichabod are near, watching.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Burn it.

                             CONSTABLE ONE
               Yes, sir.

     Constable Two wheels the corpse down a RAMP to another room.

                             ICHABOD
               Just a moment, if I may... we do not
               yet know the cause of death.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               When you find 'em in the river,
               cause of death is drowning.

                             ICHABOD
               Possibly so if there is water in the
               lungs, but... by pathology we might
               determine whether or not he was dead
               when he went into the river.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Cut him up?  Are we heathens?  Let him
               rest in peace -- in one piece as
               according to God and the New York
               Department of Health.

     Ichabod is about to protest, but stops himself, frustrated.

     Two THUGGISH CONSTABLES -- different ones -- bring in a bleeding
     SEMICONSCIOUS MAN.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE (CONT'D)
               What happened to him?

                             THUGGISH CONSTABLE
               Nothing, sir.  Arrested for burglary.

     The constables throw him against the bars of the slammer while one of
     them opens the cage door.  With their leather truncheons, the cops beat
     their prisoner into the cage and lock him in.

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Good work... 

     Ichabod hurries to follow his two constables and the corpse.

     EXT.  CITY WATCHHOUSE -- DAY

     The metropolis thrives; horsedrawn vehicles plodding, MEN, WOMEN and
     CHILDREN, MERCHANTS and TRADESMEN everywhere.

     MEN are held in chains and gibbets in front of the Watchhouse.

     INT.  CITY WATCHHOUSE, JAIL -- DAY

     We enter midway into a "Audition Scene." A row of CITY OFFICIALS are
     "auditioning" APPLICANTS (mostly obvious Cranks and Eccentrics) with
     Devices for crime fighting and crime solving.  The Applicants are
     crowded together to one side, waiting their turn.  Ichabod, holding
     only papers and books, is among them.

     "On Stage" at this moment is an INVENTOR demonstrating his invention,
     of which more in a moment.  Facing the "stage" is the BURGOMASTER,
     flanked by the HIGH CONSTABLE (who has a list of names) and various
     MAGISTRATES and ALDERMEN.

     The Inventor is demonstrating a combination wallet and mousetrap.

                             INVENTOR
               ... and in a few weeks, the plague of
               pickpockets will be a thing of the
               past!

     He shows how to set the trap-spring.

                             INVENTOR (CONT'D)
               Give me a dozen constables in
               gentleman's dress... 

     He pockets the wallet-trap.

                             INVENTOR (CONT'D)
               ... mixing with the crowds where
               pickpockets are rife!

     He produces a fake hand-on-a-stick and does the business.

                             INVENTOR (CONT'D)
               A stealthy hand dips into the
               gentleman's pocket... and -- !

     There is the sound of the trap snapping shut and the Inventor
     withdraws the fake hand with its fingers chopped off.  The Officials
     wince, impressed.

                             BURGOMASTER
               Thank you.  We will take your device
               under consideration, Mr.
               Vanderbilt... Next!

     A SPOTTY MAN starts dragging a man-sized cage contraption to center
     stage... while Ichabod tries to get the attention of the Officials.

                             ICHABOD
               Gentlemen!  -- the Millennium is
               almost upon us -- In a few months we
               will be living in the nineteenth
               century -- !

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
               Wait your turn, Constable Crane --

                             ICHABOD
               These devices are unworthy of a
               modern civilization... 

                             BURGOMASTER
               Quiet!  -- Next, I say!

                             SPOTTY MAN
               Thank you, sir!

     He turns proudly to his man-size cage, whose front hinges down for
     ingress.

     The floor of the cage is a steel plate.  A "writting board" for signing
     confessions is attached to the inside of the cage.

                             SPOTTY MAN (CONT'D)
               The Tomkins self-locking
               Confessional is cheap at the price
               and will last for years with just an
               occasional wipe with a damp cloth... 
               When the villain steps on the floor
               plate... 

     Ichabod, dropping books and papers around his feet, is feverishly
     writing on a blank page (his "traveling inkpot" is hung around his
     neck).

                             ICHABOD
                     (pointing to the Spotty
                     Man)
               Arrest that man!

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
                     (jaw dropped)
               Arrest... ?

                             ICHABOD
               I accuse him of murder!

                             SPOTTY MAN
               What the devil are you talking
               about, you loon?!

     Ichabod takes two steps toward him and gives him a violent shove in
     the chest.  The Spotty Man staggers back into his cage, which self-
     locks, and at the same time a head clamp descends from the top,
     gripping the Spotty Man's head.  His arms flail about as he yells.
     Ichabod slaps his page on the writing board, offers his pen.

                             ICHABOD
               Sign here!

                             SPOTTY MAN
                     (groaning and pointing)
               The release handle... 

                             ICHABOD
               Not till you confess... !

     Uproar around him, Ichabod waits as the prisoner signs the paper, then
     pulls the "release handle."

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
                     (waving the confession)
               I have here a confession to the
               murder of a man I fished out of the
               river last night!

                             HIGH CONSTABLE
                     (furious)
               Stand down!

                             ICHABOD
               I stand up, for sense and justice!
               Our jails overflow with men and
               women convicted on confessions worth
               no more than this one!

     The High Constable bangs a gavel until he gets some silence for the
     Burgomaster.  Meanwhile, the Spotty Man is rescued by his friends.

                             BURGOMASTER
               Constable, this is a song we have
               heard from you more than once but
               never before with this discordant
               accompaniment.  I have two courses
               open to me.  First, I can let you
               cool your heels in the cells until
               you learn respect for the dignity of
               my office... 

                             ICHABOD
               I beg pardon.  I only meant well.  Why
               am I the only one who sees that to
               solve crimes, to detect the guilty,
               we must use our brains?  -- to
               recognize vital clues, using up-to-
               date scientific --

                             BURGOMASTER
                     (interrupting)
               Which brings me to the second
               course.  Constable Crane, there is a
               town upstate, two days' journey to
               the north in the Hudson Highlands.
               It is a place called Sleepy Hollow.
               Have you heard of it?

                             ICHABOD
               I have not.

                             BURGOMASTER
               An isolated farming community,
               mostly Dutch.  Three persons have
               been murdered there, all within a
               fortnight... each found with their
               head lopped off.

                             ICHABOD
               Lopped off?

                             BURGOMASTER
               Clean as dandelion heads,
               apparently.  Now, these ideas of
               yours, they have never been put to
               the test... 

                             ICHABOD
               I have never been allowed to put
               them to the test!

                             BURGOMASTER
               Just so, granted.  So you take your
               experimentations to Sleepy Hollow
               and deduce, er detect the murderer.
               Bring him here to face our good
               justice.  Will you do this?

                             ICHABOD
                     (swallowing doubt)
               I shall, gladly.

                             BURGOMASTER
               And remember -- it is you, Ichabod
               Crane, who is now put to the test.

     The Burgomaster smiles encouragingly.

     INT/EXT.  ICHABOD'S HOME, 2ND FLOOR -- DAY (TITLE SEQUENCE BEGINS)

     Piles of BOOKS and PAPERS, JARS of CHEMICALS, MAGNIFYING GLASSES,
     CHALKBOARDS covered with scrawl and ANATOMY CHARTS above a small bed.

     AT THE WINDOW, Ichabod holds a bird cage with a red CARDINAL inside.
     He opens the cage and the bird flies free... 

                             ICHABOD
               Such a day for such a sad farewell,
               this is good-bye, my sweet... 

     Ichabod watches it go, sad, then looks down.  A COACH halts in the
     street below.  The forlorn DRIVER looks up.

     EXT.  NEW YORK CITY STREETS -- DAY

     ICHABOD'S COACH leaves city limits, forgoing civilization... following
     a dirt road to forested wilderness.

     EXT.  NEW YORK FORESTS -- NIGHT

     Coach lanterns light the way as the coach lumbers along, caressed by
     tight foliage.  A WOLF is HEARD HOWLING.  Ichabod looks out, unnerved,
     shuts the window's curtain.

     EXT.  UPSTATE FORESTS -- DAY

     The coach moves through sun dappled forest... 

     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- DAY

     Ichabod checks the contents of a LEATHER SATCHEL in his lap.  He pauses
     a moment, studying the palm of his hand.

     Ichabod touches the strange SCARS on both his palms: evenly dispersed,
     tiny dots of tissue.  Many scars.  After a moment, he returns to looking
     through his satchel.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- LATE DAY

     Ichabod stands between two massive STONE PILLARS.  He's unsure, turning
     to watch his coach leave him behind.

     Ichabod picks up his bags and heads between the pillars, starting up a
     LONG STRAIGHT ROAD.  He does not notice, in the tree limbs above: THREE
     DEAD RAVENS, hung by twine.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, TOWN SQUARE -- DUSK

     Ichabod walks on, passing a CHURCH and GRAVEYARD.  The road ahead is
     bordered by rows of businesses and two-story homes.

     Ichabod enters the TOWN SQUARE proper.  And ELDERLY WOMAN stands in a
     doorway, watching Ichabod.  Ichabod tips his hat.  The woman backs away,
     shuts her door.

     Ichabod continues.  He looks up... a MAN closes the shutters of a
     second-story window.

     As Ichabod continues he sees that there are two or three Riflemen
     placed at vantage points on the roofs and also, when he looks back, a
     Rifleman up on the Church Tower.  The whole village is like a Western
     town waiting for an attack.

     EXT.  WOODEN BUNKER -- DUSK

     A strange WOODEN BUNKER, like a small fortress with a HUGE BELL
     mounted on top, sits in a field.  SEVERAL DIRT FARMERS are gathered,
     all with rifles.

     Ichabod stops as he walks, looking at this... 

     A boy, YOUNG MASBATH, aged 10, comes to the Designated Rifleman,
     JONATHAN MASBATH, with food and drink, i.e., a picnic tied up in cloth
     and a stone bottle of beer.  Masbath Senior takes the picnic and gives
     Young Masbath an affectionate pat.  He smiles confidently.

                             MASBATH SENIOR
               Don't worry, son.

     One farmer comes to lead Young Masbath away as Jonathan heads into the
     BUNKER, taking several rifles.

     In front of the BUNKER, across a field, other dirt farmers light TORCH
     POSTS in a line along the forest edge.

     Ichabod ponders this as he trudges along... 

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- DUSK

     Ahead on a hill: the grand Van Tassel MANOR HOUSE, windows aglow.

     TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT DOOR -- NIGHT

     Ichabod puts down his bags (a suitcase and a leather box-bag) but
     keeps his satchel.

     JACK-O'-LANTERNS glow on the porch.

     A KISSING COUPLE are lustfully busy in a dark corner of the porch.  The
     woman is a pretty servant, SARAH.  The man we will know as DOCTOR
     LANCASTER.

     Ichabod almost blunders into them, causing a little panic and
     embarrassment, in which Ichabod shares, and as he mumbles apologies
     and opens the door, a shaft of light identifies the couple for our
     further reference.

     The open door reveals the MAIN HALL and FOYER... 

     There's a harvest party in progress.  PEOPLE are gathered.  QUIET MUSIC
     is HEARD from elsewhere.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod opens a door.  MEN and WOMEN eat and drink, talking quietly in
     groups.  Ichabod looks around, daunted, tentatively makes his way... 

     Ichabod bumps into a few people, excusing himself.  He mops his sweaty
     brow, finds a pretty girl.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon my intrusion, I seek Baltus
               Van Tassel but --

                             GIRL
               In the parlor, sir, further on.

     Ichabod thanks her, continues... 

     Ahead, CHILDREN, YOUNG MEN and LADIES in a circle taunt a BLINDFOLDED
     YOUNG WOMAN spun around by the handsome, barrel-chested man, BROM VAN
     BRUNT.  Brom releases the woman.  Everyone quiets, avoiding her
     searching hands.

     The Blindfolded Woman circles slowly, chanting a REFRAIN that makes
     the CHILDREN and even some of the younger WOMEN shiver with
     pleasurable fright.  They giggle nervously and hush each other up.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               "The Pickety Witch, the Pickety
               Witch, who's got a kiss for the
               pickety witch?"

     She makes a lunge, grabbing empty air, just missing BROM; everyone
     moans humorously.  Doctor Lancaster slips back into the party, and
     Sarah likewise.

     Ichabod is trying to pass through to reach the farther door... and on
     the NEXT REFRAIN finds himself caught by the Blindfolded Woman.

     Everyone stays quiet, that's the game, but of course everyone is also
     puzzled, not knowing Ichabod.  The Woman touches Ichabod's face, which
     embarrasses Ichabod and displeases Brom.

                             CHILD
               A kiss, a kiss!

                             WOMAN
               She has to guess first.

     The WOMAN is wifely, and as she puts her arm through Doctor
     Lancaster's arm, we realize she is his wife.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               Is it Theodore?

     There's a general laugh at that.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon, ma'am.  I am only a stranger.

                             BLINDFOLDED WOMAN
               Then have a kiss on account.

     She kisses him laughingly and takes the blindfold off the reveal a
     stunning beauty: KATRINA VAN TASSEL.  She smiles.  Ichabod tries to
     compose himself, stricken by the sight of her.

                             ICHABOD
               I... um, I am looking for Baltus Van
               Tassel.

                             KATRINA
               I am his daughter, Katrina Van
               Tassel.

                             BROM
               And who are you, friend?  We have not
               heard your name yet.

                             ICHABOD
               I have not said it.  Excuse me... 

     Brom grabs Ichabod's collar.  Ichabod's baffled.

                             BROM
               You need some manners.

                             KATRINA
               Brom!

                             MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                     (admonishing)
               Come, come -- we want no raised
               voices... 

     We now SEE that the voice belongs to BALTUS VAN TASSEL, a working-
     class self-made Mr. Big with a sympathetic smile.

                             BALTUS (CONT'D)
               It is only to raise the spirits
               during this dark time that I and my
               good wife are giving this little
               party... 

     LADY VAN TASSEL stands behind him, a mix of homespun wife and well-
     kept lady.  Brom releases Ichabod.  Children hide behind Katrina.
     Ichabod's relieved to have a proper focal point.  Others from the party
     gather.

                             BALTUS (CONT'D)
               Young sir, you are welcome even if
               you are selling something!

     The pleasantry relaxes the atmosphere around Ichabod.

                             ICHABOD
               Thank you, sir.  I am Constable
               Ichabod Crane, sent to you from New
               York with authority to investigate
               murder in Sleepy Hollow.

     This has quite an effect.  A man we will know as MAGISTRATE PHILIPSE
     looks up sharply.  A man we will know as REVEREND STEENWYCK grunts
     skeptically.  A man we have already seen, DOCTOR LANCASTER, exchanges a
     surprised look with another man, NOTARY HARDENBROOK.

                             STEENWYCK
                     (rudely)
               Well, what use is a Constable?!

     Lady Van Tassel gives the Clergyman a reproachful look.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Then, Sleepy Hollow is grateful to
               you, Constable Crane -- I hope you
               will honor this house by remaining
               with us until... 

                             BROM
               Until you've made the arrest!

     To Ichabod's surprise this gets a nervous laugh.  Baltus frowns at Brom.
     Katrina looks at Ichabod with renewed interest.

                             BALTUS
                     (to his wife)
               Well spoke!
                     (to Ichabod)
               Come, sir.  We'll get you settled.
                     (to the Musicians)
               Play on!

     Baltus catches the eyes of Philipse, then of Lancaster, nodding as if
     to say "See you in a minute."

     As he leads Ichabod out, he murmurs to Steenwyck, who nods and passes
     the murmur to Hardenbrook.

     The Fiddlers strike up the music.  Katrina watches Ichabod's exit.  Brom
     watches Katrina's interest with displeasure.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     We HEAR the music from downstairs.  Ichabod is unpacking -- arranging
     his scientific books.  His "medical case," revealing a few mysterious
     Instruments of Detections, is open on the bed.  Sarah is just
     delivering a pitcher of water to the washstand.

                             ICHABOD
               Thank you.  Please tell Mr. Van
               Tassel I will be down in a moment.

                             SARAH
               I will, sir.
                     (then -- as she leaves)
               Thank God you are here!

     Ichabod is a bit surprised by her emotion.  Then he pours the water and
     douses his face.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- NIGHT

     FIVE MEN wait grimly for Ichabod, silent in the presence of Sarah, who
     is placing a pipe cradle by Baltus.  Lady Van Tassel is pouring the men
     a drink.  The music from the party is faintly audible.  Lancaster is 50,
     dour, always sweaty.  Philipse is youngest, a drinker, eyes bloodshot,
     augmenting his glass with a shot from his private flask.  Reverend
     Steenwyck has a disdainful, sour expression.  Hardenbrook is oldest,
     ancient, nervous, one eye pale and blind.

                             HARDENBROOK
               All the way from New York!

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               A waste of time!

                             STEENWYCK
                     (to Baltus)
               What can he do?

                             BALTUS
                     (calmingly)
               Gentlemen, gentlemen... 

     Sarah, leaving, passes Doctor Lancaster, who secretly trails his hand
     against Sarah's buttock... not quite secretly enough for the vigilance
     of Lady Van Tassel, who, by the merest flick of an eye, shows us that
     she has noticed.

     Sarah leaves just as Ichabod appears in the doorway, Sarah closing the
     door behind him.

                             BALTUS (CONT'D)
                     (to Ichabod)
               Excellent!  Come in!
                     (to his wife)
               Leave us, my dear.

                             ICHABOD
               So.  Three persons murdered.  First,
               Peter Van Garrett and his son Dirk
               Van Garrett, both of them strong
               capable men, found together,
               decapitated.  A week later, the Widow
               Winship, also decapitated.  I will
               need to ask you many questions, but
               first let me ask -- is anyone
               suspected?

                             BALTUS
               I don't understand you.

                             ICHABOD
               I say, is there any one person
               suspect in these acts?

     The men stir in their seats -- their looks say "I told you so!" --
     "Useless!" -- etc.

                             BALTUS
               Constable... how much have your
               superiors explained to you?

                             ICHABOD
               Only that the three were slain in
               open ground and their heads found
               severed from their bodies... 

                             STEENWYCK
               The heads were not found severed.
               The heads were not found at all.

                             ICHABOD
               The heads are gone?

     Hardenbrook leans forward, his voice cragged.

                             HARDENBROOK
               Taken.  Taken by the Headless
               Horseman.  Taken back to hell.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon me, I... ?

                             BALTUS
               Perhaps you had better sit down.

     Baltus gestures for Ichabod to sit.  Baltus lights his pipe and pours a
     glass for Ichabod.  The men help themselves to food and drink.

                             BALTUS (CONT'D)
               The Horseman was a Hessian
               mercenary, sent to our shores by
               German princes to keep Americans
               under the yoke of England.  But
               unlike his compatriots who came for
               money, the Horseman came... for love
               of carnage... and he was not like the
               others... 

     FLASHBACK -- AMERICAN BATTLEFIELD (WINTER) -- DAY

     The HESSIAN HORSEMAN rides his black steed into a gory, close-quarters
     clash, his cloaked uniform adorned with edged weapons.  He cuts down
     Americans left and right.

                             BALTUS (V.O.)
               He rode a giant black steed named
               Daredevil.  He was infamous for
               taking his horse hard into battle... 
               chopping off heads at full gallop.

     The Horseman dismounts, hoists a battle axe.  With sword and axe, he
     annihilates.  Blood gushes.  Bones crack.

                             BALTUS (CONT'D; V.O.)
               To look upon him made your blood run
               cold, for he had filed down his
               teeth to sharp points... to add to
               the ferocity of his appearance... 

     The Horseman lets out a war cry.  Jagged teeth.  Grotesque.

     FLASHBACK -- FOREST BATTLEFIELD (WINTER) -- DAY

     Winter.  CANNONS can be HEARD BOOMING from afar.  Daredevil, galloping
     is hit and falls.  The Horseman is not hurt.

                             BALTUS (V.O.)
               This butcher would not finally meet
               his end till the winter of seventy-
               nine... 

     The Horseman rises, eyes filled with rage, looks to see... 

     SIX ragtag REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS give chase, firing rifles.  The
     Horseman flees, bullets throwing snow behind.

                             BALTUS (CONT'D)
               ... not far from here in our Western
               Woods... 

     FLASHBACK -- DEEPER IN THE FOREST BATTLEFIELD (WINTER) -- DAY

     The Horseman glances back, bounding through, drawing his sword, when
     suddenly he halts... 

     He's happened upon TWO YOUNG GIRLS gathering firewood.  The girls stand
     frozen at the sight of him for a long, silent moment, till one girl
     drops the firewood and runs.

     The second girl remains, holding the Horseman's gaze.

     The Horseman and the girl hold each other's gaze for a long beat.

     The Horseman puts his finger to his lips, warning her to stay quiet.

     The girl takes one of her pieces of dry wood and deliberately breaks
     it, making a noise like a pistol shot.

     There is a responding shout from a soldier back in the trees.  The
     Horseman turns to the sound.

     Soldiers move forward from the forest behind, spreading out.

     The second girl flees.  The Horseman hefts his sword, turning as
     soldiers surround.  One soldier aims his rifle... 

     The Horseman reaches over his shoulder, grasps a sheathed knife and
     THROWS --

     THOCK!  The rifleman jerks back, knife in his eye socket.

     A second soldier aims and FIRES... Blood explodes from the Horseman's
     arm.  His sword drops.

     The Horseman readies and AXE in his good hand.  The Revolutionaries
     move in with swords.  They battle, STEEL AGAINST STEEL.  The Horseman
     fends off blows... 

     Soldier Three stabs his blade deep into the Horseman's side.  The
     Horseman roars, bringing his axe DOWN... 

     BREAKS the sword at the hilt.  An UPWARD stroke sends Soldier Three
     backward in a fountain of blood.

     The Horseman staggers, trying to pull the blade from his ribs.  The
     remaining soldiers close in... 

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- NIGHT

     Ichabod is spooked.  Pipe smoke wafts from Baltus's mouth.

                             BALTUS
               They cut off his head with his own
               sword.  To this day, the Western
               Woods is a haunted place where brave
               men will not venture.

     FLASHBACK -- EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD AREA (WINTER) -- DAY

     The Horseman's headless corpse lies in a shallow grave.

                             BALTUS (V.O.)
               ... for what was planted in the
               ground that day was a seed of evil.

     The HORSEMAN'S HEAD is dropped into the grave.

     FLASHBACK -- EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD AREA (WINTER) -- LATER
     DAY

     One of the four surviving soldiers stabs the HORSEMAN'S SWORD deep in
     the ground as a marker.

     The grave is done.  The soldiers walk away from the grave.  They have
     buried the Horseman in a treeless clearing.

     Daredevil appears, limping, from the trees, and puts his nose down to
     the turned earth.

     The Second Girl is watching from hiding.

     She sees: Daredevil collapses on the grave, blood frothing from his
     mouth.  Dying.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- NIGHT

                             BALTUS
               And so it has been for twenty years.
               But now the Hessian wakes -- he is
               on the rampage, cutting off heads
               where he finds them.

     Ichabod sits back, shakes off the reverie of the tale.  He takes a gulp
     from his glass.

                             ICHABOD
               Are you... saying... ?  Is that what
               you believe?

                             HARDENBROOK
               Seeing is believing!

     Baltus puts a calming hand on senile Hardenbrook's shoulder.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               No one knows why the Hessian has
               chosen this time to return from the
               grave.

                             STEENWYCK
               Satan has called forth one of his
               own.

     Steenwyck stands and from a side table picks up the hefty Baltus
     family Bible.

                             STEENWYCK (CONT'D)
               They tell me you have brought books
               and trappings of scientific
               investigation -- this is the only
               book I recommend you study.

     He drops the Bible on the table in front of Ichabod, making him jump.
     Ichabod gingerly lifts the front cover -- revealing a page of ink
     writing, which he will remember later -- then he snaps out of all this
     "nonsense."

                             ICHABOD
               Reverend Steenwyck... gentlemen... 
               murder needs no ghost come from the
               grave.  Which of you have laid eyes
               on this Headless Horsemen?

     Pause.

                             HARDENBROOK
               Others have.  Many others.

     Ichabod allows himself a skeptical smile.

                             BALTUS
               You will see him too if he comes
               again.  The men of the village are
               posted to watch for him.

                             ICHABOD
               We have murders in New York without
               benefit of ghouls and goblins.

                             BALTUS
               You are a long way from New York,
               sir.

                             ICHABOD
               A century at least.  The assassin is
               a man of flesh and blood, and I will
               discover him.

                             STEENWYCK
               How do you propose to do so?

                             ICHABOD
               By discovering his reason.  It is
               what we call "the motive." This
               mystery will not resist
               investigation by a Rational Man.

     Ichabod's natural clumsiness, however, causes him to sweep his empty
     glass off the table, rather ruining the effect of the Rational Man in
     command of the situation.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KATRINA'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Katrina is sitting in front of her mirror.  Lady Van Tassel is brushing
     out Katrina's hair, counting the strokes.

                             KATRINA
               Well, I'm disappointed... our first
               visitor from New York... 

     There is a knock.

                             KATRINA (CONT'D)
               He doesn't know where to put himself
               and his feet are all over the place.

     Lady Van Tassel gives Katrina the hairbrush and goes to the door.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Yes, not like your Brom.  Go on
               brushing, I got to forty-two... 

     She opens the door to Sarah.

                             SARAH
               That constable, he wants the Bible,
               Mum... 

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Bible... ?

                             KATRINA
               I'll bring it to him.

     Sarah dips a curtsy and goes.  Lady Van Tassel gives Katrina a friendly
     raised eyebrow.

                             KATRINA (CONT'D)
                     (meeting her eye,
                     explains)
               We'll see if his city talk fits him
               better than his clothes.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod sits surrounded by his books, including his Ledger.  Clearly
     there has been no breakthrough.  Ichabod broods.  There is a knock at
     the door, which he seems to have been expecting, for he does not turn
     around.

                             ICHABOD
               Yes -- yes -- come in.

     Katrina enters carrying the Bible.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
                     (not turning)
               Thank you, just leave it on the
               reading stand.

     Katrina puts down the Bible as directed.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               That will be all -- no, tell me,
               about that big brute who seems to be
               Miss Katrina's --

     He has turned in his chair, too late, and sees Katrina -- Ichabod has
     a minor convulsion, standing up, knocking papers to the floor, etc.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Forgive me, I... I asked Sarah to
               bring me... 

                             KATRINA
                     (amused, relaxed)
               So your clever books have failed you
               and you turn to the Bible after all!

                             ICHABOD
                     (sharply, despite
                     himself)
               I see I am talked about downstairs.

                             KATRINA
               In passing only -- we have many
               things to talk about even in this
               backward place.

                             ICHABOD
               I am sorry... Please excuse my
               manner -- I am not used to... 

                             KATRINA
               Female company?

                             ICHABOD
               Society.

                             KATRINA
               How can you avoid society in New
               York?  How I should love the opera --
               and theaters -- to go dancing... Is
               it wonderful?

                             ICHABOD
               I have never been.

                             KATRINA
               But there is an art museum?  -- a
               concert hall?

                             ICHABOD
               I don't know.

                             KATRINA
                     (disappointed)
               Then you have nothing to teach me.

                             ICHABOD
               Perhaps I have.  Do you believe the
               Van Garretts and the Widow Winship
               were murdered by a headless
               horseman?

                             KATRINA
               Not everyone here believes it is the
               Horseman.

                             ICHABOD
                     (relieved)
               Good.

                             KATRINA
               Some say it is the witch of the
               Western Woods who has made a pact
               with Lucifer.

                             ICHABOD
                     (exasperated)
               There are no witches, or galloping
               ghosts either!  Is everyone in this
               village in thrall to superstition?

                             KATRINA
               Why are you so frightened of magic?
               Not all magic is black.  There are
               ancient truths in these woods which
               have been forgotten in your city
               parks.

                             ICHABOD
               If they are truths they are not
               magic -- and if magic, not truth.

                             KATRINA
               You are foolish.  When there is fever
               in the house, it is well known that
               willow-herb roots and a crow's foot
               must be boiled in the milk of a pure
               white goat with special charms
               uttered over the fire... and the
               fever abates.

                             ICHABOD
               Next time try the herb without the
               rest -- and now I must ask you --
               excuse me --

                             KATRINA
               Gladly.  I should not have interrupted
               our town's savior.  Good night.  And
               as to your first question, that big
               brute you were asking about has
               proposed to me.

                             ICHABOD
               I... I... I'm happy that... 

                             KATRINA
               Proposed to me several times.

     This ambiguous statement, accompanied by a faint smile, confuses
     Ichabod into silence as she closes the door behind her.  He turns with
     relief to the next business -- the Bible.  He opens the front cover.  On
     the endpaper is a Family Tree going back a hundred years, in variously
     faded inks and handwritings.

     Ichabod studies it and we see what he learns: that Katrina was born in
     1777... to Baltus's first wife, who died in 1797... that Lady Van Tassel
     is Baltus's second wife (her maiden name is unimportant, because
     false)... Then he suddenly notices something even more interesting:
     The family tree has a "Van Garrett" in it -- the husband of Baltus's
     father's sister.

                             ICHABOD
                     (mutters)
               Van Garrett... !

     Ichabod looks thoughtful.  He starts copying out details into his
     Ledger.

     A very faint rumbling disturbs him for a moment.  He looks up.  Silence
     now.  He continues working.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW -- NIGHT

     The empty street.

     Then the low sinister sound of rumbling is heard again.

     EXT.  WOODEN BUNKER / FIELD -- INTERCUT -- NIGHT

     The distant SOUND of the GROUND RUMBLING is HEARD.  AT THE WOODEN
     BUNKER, Jonathan looks out, fearful... 

     The torches burn bright along the forest line.  SEVERAL DEER stampede
     out... sprinting across the field.

     Jonathan watches the forest.  A horrible, SILENT stillness has fallen.
     Then, Jonathan's eyes widen... 

     A thick FOG creeps from the woods.

     As fog overtakes each torch, mist snakes up, snuffing each flame... one
     by one by one, all along the forest edge... 

     Jonathan sticks his rifle out from the bunker, sights the gun along
     the treeline.

                             JONATHAN
               Come out, devil... come... 

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FORESTS, OVERVIEW -- NIGHT

     Silhouetted treetops.  The SOUNDS of JONATHAN'S RIFLE FIRING are HEARD,
     echoing -- SEVERAL GUNSHOTS, then... SILENCE... 

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FOREST -- NIGHT

     Jonathan flees through the forest, glances back, terrified.  THUNDEROUS
     HOOFBEATS are HEARD from behind.

     DEEP IN THE FOREST, we GLIMPSE the source of the HOOFBEATS: a HUGE
     FORM on a HUGE BLACK HORSE, already gone.

     Jonathan pushes through thorny bushes.  Jagged branches bloody his
     hands and cheeks... 

     He bursts from the brier patch and TUMBLES to a TRAIL.

     IN THE FOREST BEHIND: The hooves of the black horse rip underbrush.
     HOOFBEATS DEAFENING.  A spur digs into the snorting steed's already
     bleeding flank.

     The pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING.

     ON THE TRAIL, Jonathan runs onward.  The shrill WHISTLE of a SWORD
     SWING is HEARD as the pursuer BLURS PAST... 

     Jonathan is still running when his head lolls back, at an impossible
     angle... his head tumbles off his shoulders... 

     Jonathan's headless body hits the dirt.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW -- DAY (EARLY MORNING)

     People going about their business calmly.  A WOMAN shakes out a blanket
     from an upper window.  The murder has obviously not been discovered
     yet.

     No one notices that the WOODEN BUNKER is deserted... and now has a gap
     of shattered timber.

     EXT/INT.  LIVERY STABLE -- DAY (EARLY MORNING)

     The stables belong to KILLIAN, a dashingly rustic man, father of a
     young family.  Ichabod likes him... though he does not think much of the
     Horse Killian is offering him, an old nag.  Ichabod has a big satchel.

                             KILLIAN
               His name's Gunpowder.

                             ICHABOD
               A brave name, but... have you got
               something a little younger?... 
               Taller?

                             KILLIAN
                     (apparently getting it)
               Faster.

                             ICHABOD
               Yes.

                             KILLIAN
               A horse cut to dash.

                             ICHABOD
               Yes.

                             KILLIAN
               No, I haven't.

                             ICHABOD
               Oh.

                             KILLIAN
               Not at the price.

                             ICHABOD
               Well... I'm sure he'll do very well.
               Thank you, Mr. Killian.

                             KILLIAN
               Good luck, sir.  If you need help,
               call my name.

                             ICHABOD
               Much appreciated.

     Killian's son Thomas, a small boy, is feeding one of the horses.

     ANGLE ON Mrs. KILLIAN at the door of the Killian House.  She is in the
     act of seeing a woman out of her door, a PREGNANT WOMAN, and handing
     her a bunch of herbs.

     CLOSER

                             BETH
                     (to Pregnant Woman)
               Mind you rub them well in the
               breech, Mrs. Sherry -- don't worry,
               it'll be easy as shelling peas.

     As the Pregnant Woman leaves, Beth bawls over her shoulder, turning to
     go into the house.

                             BETH (CONT'D)
               Thomas!  -- It's you I want!

     Beth goes into the house, passing a modest notice on the door: "Knock
     before entering -- Elizabeth Killian, MIDWIFE"

                             KILLIAN
                     (to Thomas)
               Go off home for your breakfast, Tom
               -- kiss your mother once for you and
               twice for me.

     As the boy goes, Ichabod has a thought.

                             ICHABOD
               Mr. Killian, I was thinking... about
               the old widow... 

                             KILLIAN
               Old Widow?

                             ICHABOD
               Widow Winship.

                             KILLIAN
               Who told you she was old?  She was
               comely.  Widowed young and dead
               before the bloom was off her.

     Ichabod is surprised.  Before he can react further, a distant gunshot
     is heard -- a signal followed by the distant sight of a man on
     horseback, hurrying and shouting, waving his rifle.  It's clear that
     Masbath's murder has been discovered.  Killian and Ichabod watch the
     Rider coming, telling the news as he comes.

                             RIDER
                     (shouting)
               Murder, murder!  The Horseman has
               killed again!

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FARMLAND -- DAY

     Riders are galloping across the fields toward the murder site.

     Baltus, a Dullardly Man called VAN RIPPER, who was the original Rider
     who found the body... followed by Brom, and a gig driven fast by
     Philipse, and Doctor Lancaster and various villagers.

     Way behind, trying to keep up on Gunpowder, comes Ichabod.

     EXT.  FOREST, MASBATH MURDER SITE -- MORNING

     Baltus takes charge of posting armed villagers to keep an eye out
     toward the forest.

                             BALTUS
               Mr. Miller -- ride back for the
               coffin cart -- the rest of you keep
               a sharp lookout.
                     (to GLEN)
               No -- not at me, Glen, I'm not going
               to cut my own head off!  -- Look out
               to the woods!

     Ichabod hasn't quite arrived.  The others are watching as Doctor
     Lancaster turns over the headless corpse of Masbath.  He straightens
     the body reverently.  Everyone is shocked and spooked, looking
     fearfully around.  Behind them -- a sound.  Everyone reacts but it's
     Ichabod arriving.

                             BROM
                     (laughs)
               A fine looking animal, Crane.

     Ichabod dismounts, ignoring Brom.  The great Detective is trying to
     cover up his jitters.  New York was never like this.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
               And... the head... ?

                             PHILIPSE
               Taken.

                             ICHABOD
               Taken!

     Doctor Lancaster seems unprofessionally jittery.  He grasps Philipse by
     the arm.  Philipse shakes him off and pulls out a flask.  Ichabod
     notices this.  Their behavior seems to him to be an odd moment.  Then he
     turns his attention back to the matter at hand.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Interesting... very interesting.

                             BALTUS
               What is?

                             ICHABOD
               In headless corpse cases of this
               sort... the head is removed to
               prevent identification of the body.

                             BALTUS
                     (puzzled)
               But we know this is Jonathan
               Masbath... 

                             ICHABOD
               Exactly!  So, why was the head
               removed?

     They all wait for enlightenment.

                             BALTUS
               Why?

                             ICHABOD
               I don't know.

     They all watch Ichabod to see what he will do.  Philipse takes nips
     from his flask.  But Ichabod isn't sure.  He isn't too keen on looking
     at the corpse.  Then he realizes:

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               You have moved the body?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               I did.

                             ICHABOD
                     (furious)
               You must never move the body!

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               Why not?

                             ICHABOD
               Because!

     Despite themselves, they are impressed.  Ichabod takes heart.

     Ichabod finds a huge, deep HOOFPRINT.  He kneels, pulls his satchel off
     his shoulder, takes out a BOWL, BOTTLE of WATER and a BAG of POWDER.

     The others watch, finding this bizarre, as Ichabod begins mixing the
     water and powder, making plaster.

                             BROM
               What is that potion?

                             ICHABOD
               You are the blacksmith, Brom.  Ever
               shoe a horse with a hoof this large?

     Ichabod fills the print with runny plaster.

                             BROM
                     (grudging the point)
               It's big.

     Ichabod shoulders his satchel, walks all around, studies the ground,
     kicks away leaves... and then lopes around puzzlingly.  The watchers are
     astonished by his antics as he leaps from hoofprint to hoofprint.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
                     (to Philipse)
               The man's a fool.

                             PHILLIPSE
                     (drunk)
               He's a fool and we're damn fools --
               but death will make us all equal.

     Doctor Lancaster impatiently hushes him and turns away.

                             ICHABOD
               The stride is gigantic... 

     Ichabod stops, turns, following back to way he came... 

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               The attacker rode Masbath down... 
               turned his horse... came back... 
                     (stops leaping)
               Came back to claim the head.

     He pauses to sum up.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               To sum up.  Head taken.  Big horse.
                     (beat)
               Did this man have any enemies?

                             PHILIPSE
               Well, someone didn't like him.

     But Ichabod has already latched on to something.

                             ICHABOD
               Van Ripper, show me where the neck
               rested.

     Van Ripper points.  Ichabod opens his satchel, takes out a BOTTLE OF
     GREEN POWDER.

     He uncorks the bottle, sprinkles a thin layer of powder on the dirt,
     waiting.

     A reaction causes the powder to bubble a little.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               A chemical reaction, it shows there
               was just a smear of blood, no more.

                             VAN RIPPER
               I didn't see none.

     Ichabod's puzzled.

     Ichabod swallows, queasy, trying not to let it show.

     Ichabod takes odd spectacles from his satchel, wire-framed with many
     lenses: MAGNIFICATION SPECTACLES.  He fumbles putting them on,
     examines the gross neck wound.

     Ichabod takes an INSTRUMENT from his satchel, a delicate SCISSOR
     MECHANISM TOOL that tapes off into tiny jaws.  He uses it, hand
     shaking, to pick at the flesh.

     POV through Ichabod's magnifying spectacles: a CREEPY CRAWLY BUG is
     feeding on the wound.  Ichabod freaks, leaps up.

                             ICHABOD
                     (recovering, faking)
               Interesting... 

                             BALTUS
               What is it?  -- What is it?!

     Squinting sidelong at the ground, Ichabod uses his foot to squash and
     grind the bug, which is too small to be visible.

     He looks at Baltus, his eyes huge in his spectacles.

                             ICHABOD
               The wound was cauterized in the very
               instant... as though the blade itself
               were red hot... and yet, no
               blistering, no scorched flesh.

     They all look worried.

                             PHILIPSE
               The Devil's fire!

     Ichabod looks worried too.

     EXT.  CEMETERY -- DAY

     The town is gathered for Jonathan Masbath's funeral.  Steenwyck stands
     at the open grave, reads from the BIBLE.

                             STEENWYCK
                     (reading)
               "Be sober, be vigilant... " as it
               sayeth in the book of Peter, chapter
               five, verse eight -- "because your
               adversary the devil, as a roaring
               lion, walketh about, seeking whom he
               may devour... "

     People WHISPER and steal glances at Ichabod.  Ichabod stands with
     Baltus and Lady Van Tassel.  Ichabod looks around, observing... 

     Young Masbath stands with his head bowed.

     Brom stands beside Katrina, who wipes tears.  Brom puts his arm around
     Katrina, comforting.  Theodore and Glenn are nearby with rifles over
     their shoulders.

     EXT.  CEMETERY/CHURCH -- (TIME CUT) -- LATER DAY

     The funeral is done.  People head out from the cemetery.

     Ichabod walks with the Van Tassels.  Baltus holds Katrina's hand.  Young
     Masbath runs to catch up with Ichabod.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Mister Constable, sir... 

     Ichabod stops.

                             ICHABOD
               You are Young Masbath... 

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               I was Young Masbath, but now the
               only one.  Masbath at your service,
               in honor bound to avenge my father.

                             ICHABOD
               Well, one-and-only Masbath, I thank
               you, but your mother will need you
               more than I.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               My mother is in heaven, sir, and has
               my father now to care for her.  But
               you have no one to serve you, and I
               am your man, sir.

                             ICHABOD
               And a brave man too, but I cannot be
               the one to look after you.  I am
               sorry for your loss, young Mister
               Masbath.

     Ichabod moves away, watched disconsolately by Masbath.

     Ichabod finds his sleeve furtively plucked by Philipse.

                             PHILIPSE
               Constable... 

                             ICHABOD
               Mr. Philipse... ?

     Philipse looks around anxiously to see if they're observed.

                             PHILIPSE
               Something you should know.  Jonathan
               Masbath was not the fourth victim
               but the fifth!

                             ICHABOD
               The fifth?

                             PHILIPSE
               Aye.  Five victims in four graves!

                             ICHABOD
               But who... ?

     Philipse sees that Steenwyck has noticed the encounter.  He breaks off
     and scuttles away.

     Ichabod turns his gaze toward... 

     The fresh grave of Jonathan Masbath, and three more graves almost as
     recent: The Van Garretts are just receiving their brand new
     headstones, and Widow Winship's grave is marked for the present by a
     simple wooden cross with her name on it.

     Ichabod sees Killian and nods to him.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Mr. Killian... I will need the help
               you offered.

     INT.  STABLE -- DAY

     Ichabod lifts the lid of a large feed bin half full of horse feed.
     Young Masbath is curled up inside like a mouse in a nest.  Homeless.

                             ICHABOD
               Find a place in the Van Tassel's
               servant quarters.  Wake me before
               dawn.  I hope you have a strong
               stomach.

     Ichabod walks away, disgruntled.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Thank you, sir.

     EXT.  CEMETERY -- NIGHT/DAWN

     The lid of a muddy coffin is wrenched open.  The coffin contains a
     headless corpse.  Just the one.

     What's happening?

     The coffin is on the ground next to the hole marked by the headstone
     of Peter Van Garrett.

     Killian holds a lantern and a spade.  Ichabod, holding a handkerchief
     to his face, looks into the open coffin.  He nods.  Ichabod, in
     shirtsleeves and sweating, has a spade too.  Young Masbath is watching
     uneasily.  This is why Young Masbath would need a "strong stomach." He
     gags, almost pukes.

     At Ichabod's nod, Killian replaces the lid.  Killian has Two Men with
     him.  There are two more coffins and two more piles of dirt, one coffin
     for Dirk Van Garrett and one for Widow Winship.

     Ichabod moves to the second coffin.  It contains a headless corpse.
     Just the one.  Ichabod nods, and the lid is replaced.

     The third coffin -- the Widow's -- is being opened by one of the Men.
     Ichabod takes a lantern and looks expectantly as the lid comes off.
     The Widow's headless corpse is alone in the coffin.

     Ichabod pauses.  Nods.  As the lid is about to be replaced.  He stops it.

                             ICHABOD
               Wait.

     Ichabod takes out a small penknife and cuts through the shroud.  He
     reveals the belly.  He stares at it.  Was she pregnant?  It's impossible
     to tell.  But there is the wound of a sword stab in the stomach.

     Suddenly there is a screech, which seems to come from the corpse,
     giving heart attacks all around -- but now we see a "ghost" holding a
     lantern.  It's Reverend Steenwyck who has discovered them and is
     shrieking in outrage.

                             STEENWYCK
               Sacrilege!  Sacrilege!

     Ichabod recovers.

                             ICHABOD
               Science... science, Reverend
               Steenwyck!  Someone in Sleepy Hollow
               is using the Horseman story for his
               own murderous purpose, and I intend
               to... dig it out.

     Steenwyck froths, looks terrified and backs off.

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- DAY

     Ichabod and Killian, helped by Young Masbath, carry the Widow's muddy
     coffin inside.  Doctor Lancaster watches in horror, sweating profusely,
     freaked out.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               This is... most irregular, Constable.

                             ICHABOD
               I should hope so.  But in this case,
               necessary.

     The coffin is put down.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               I will need to operate.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               Operate?  She's dead!

                             ICHABOD
                     (thrown)
               When we say "operate," we mean, of
               course... er, I'll need the operating
               table.  Lay her out, please.
                     (to Young Masbath)
               Go on, nothing to be afraid of.

     When Killian and Young Masbath lay out the corpse, Ichabod gulps water
     and studies the pages of his Ledger.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               There is a common thread between
               these victims.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               And what's that?

                             ICHABOD
                     (closing the Ledger)
               I don't know.

     He goes to examine the corpse.  Young Masbath retreats to a corner, ill
     at ease.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Once more, the neck wound
               cauterized.  The sword thrust to the
               stomach, the same, perhaps by
               chemical means.  But to what purpose?

     Ichabod gingerly feels the corpse's stomach.  The Doctor watches.  We
     get the feeling he "knows something."

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               To what is your purpose, is the
               question.

     Ichabod takes a rolled VELVET CLOTH from his satchel, unrolls it... it
     holds SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, some particularly strange: RIB-SPEADERS
     and CURVED CLAMPS.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER (CONT'D)
               What manner of instruments are
               those?

                             ICHABOD
               Some of my own design.

     Ichabod picks through his instruments, unsure.  He looks to the corpse
     a long moment.  He looks at Young Masbath.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Step outside.  Thank you for your
               help, Mr. Killian.  And, if you do
               not mind, Doctor, my concentration
               suffers when I am observed.

     Ichabod watches Killian, Young Masbath and Lancaster go.  He quickly
     returns to his satchel, pulling out a BOOK: HUMAN ANATOMY.  He searches
     the pages... 

     He flips through DRAWINGS of ANATOMY, then sets the book open nearby
     so he can refer to it.  He picks up a KNIFE, stands at the corpse,
     taking a deep uncertain breath.

     Ichabod cuts into the Widow's belly, but stops, looking horrified at
     what he's done.  He leans close to study the book again, worried.  He
     makes another incision... He looks down at it, queasy.

     EXT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- DAY

     Young Masbath sits waiting.

     Doctor Lancaster stands with Philipse (hung over), Steenwyck and
     Hardenbrook, speaking agitatedly.  OTHER PEOPLE have gathered in the
     background.

     The door to the doctor's residence opens and Ichabod steps out.  He is
     bloodied, shaken, futilely wiping at the mess with a blood-covered
     cloth, looking up... 

     All attention goes to Ichabod.  Everyone's horrified.

                             ICHABOD
               I am... finished.

                             STEENWYCK
               What in God's name have you done to
               her?
                     (pointing)
               Magistrate Philipse, you are the
               word of law here... put him in irons!

     Philipse and Ichabod exchange a look.  Philipse nips from his flask.

                             PHILIPSE
               And what did you find out,
               Constable?

                             ICHABOD
               That there are not four victims but
               five.  The Widow Winship was with
               child!

     The small crowd murmurs, shocked.  Doctor Lancaster recovers, furious.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               What of it?  She should have been
               left to make her peace with God and
               not cut to bits by the Constabulary!

     Ichabod is shaken for a moment, remembering the similar charge made
     against him in New York.

                             ICHABOD
               The sword was thrust into the womb
               and no farther.  A symbolic murder.
               We are dealing with a madman.

     EXT.  LONG STRAIGHT ROAD, COVERED BRIDGE -- LATER NIGHT

     Pale moonlight.  Ichabod rides Gunpowder across the COVERED BRIDGE.
     They are an ungainly pair.

     Following the road, Ichabod is lost in thought.  The CLOPPING of
     HOOFBEATS is HEARD on the bridge behind.

     Ichabod turns to look.  HOOFBEATS STOP.  No one can be seen in the dark
     mouth of the bridge.  CRICKETS CHIRP.

                             ICHABOD
               Who's there?

     Ichabod faces forward, continuing to the forest.

     He hums a tune to himself, tone deaf.  After a moment, a HORSE is HEARD
     SNORTING, HOOFBEATS RESUME.  Ichabod stops Gunpowder.

     There is SOMEONE back there, on horseback, coming out from the
     darkness of the bridge, slowly... 

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Who are you?

     The FIGURE comes into moonlight, on a BLACK HORSE, smoke seeming to
     rise from him; a dark FIGURE, cloaked -- headless.

     Ichabod panics, kicking Gunpowder to flee.  The figure takes off to
     follow.

     Ichabod whips Gunpowder's reins, gasping, moving faster.  The figure
     behind also picks up speed.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FOREST -- NIGHT

     Gunpowder carries Ichabod into the forest.  The headless figure is
     right behind, cloak flowing... 

     The HEADLESS FIGURE is HEARD letting out a hellish CRY of rage.
     Ichabod glances fearfully over his shoulder... 

     A HORRIBLE FACE with flaming eyes and mouth rushes forward... 

     It SMASHES into Ichabod -- sends him sprawling to the ground in an
     explosion of red hot ash and cinders... 

     Ichabod rolls, shaken... looking behind.  The trail is empty.  HOOFBEATS
     are HEARD.  SEVERAL HORSES.

     Ichabod stands.  He looks down at the remnants of a BROKEN JACK-O'-
     LANTERN and smoldering ball of paper on the trail.

     The FIGURE rides to a halt, throws off a cloak and "headless"
     disguise; it's Brom.  Glenn and Theodore ride up, laughing.

     Brom also laughs, but when he looks back, the smile leaves his face.
     He takes grim satisfaction in what he's done.

     Ichabod's face is haunted, running with the sweat of fear -- he is
     still trembling from the experience.

                             FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
               Ichabod!  Ichabod!

     And suddenly we are pitched into Ichabod's DREAM.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- EXT.  COTTAGE -- DAY

                             FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
               Ichabod!  Ichabod... !

     A woman is in the doorway, holding out her arms.  She seems to be
     Katrina as Ichabod first saw her, blindfolded.

     A YOUNG BOY, aged about seven, runs toward her, with a little bunch of
     wildflowers.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     The Blindfolded Woman is playing the Pickety Witch Game with Ichabod.
     He is laughing -- scared as she grabs the air looking for him.  He is
     holding the wildflowers he picked.  She seizes him, kisses him and
     takes off the blindfold.  It's not Katrina, but his Mother, a kind and
     lovely face.  He gives his Mother the flowers.  She puts one of the
     flowers in her hair, laughing.  But the others -- she throws on the
     fire!  -- and she crouches at the hearthstone, beckoning him, still
     "nice." He comes to her, not scared.

     As the flowers burn, they give off smoky fumes, which the Mother
     inhales like perfume, closing her eyes in a trance.  He watches
     fascinated as she picks up a twig and starts drawing pictures --
     strange designs -- in the layer of ash on the hearthstone.

     Suddenly Ichabod turns his head to the door, which is opening --
     spooky because no one is entering.  Then he sees at floor level the
     family CAT has come through the door.  A black cat with a white paw.

     Ichabod's Mother is "awakened" by this, just in time as Father, a grim
     Parson all in black, enters.

     Ichabod looks up frightened at the face of his Father.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     The Cat is on Ichabod's bed... watching Mother who is entertaining
     Ichabod with the Bird-in-Cage Spinning Disc Toy, which we will get to
     know.

     Ichabod is tucked up in bed, astonished and happy.  The Bird and Cage
     blur together.

     Lightning flashes outside a window, thunder booms, the storm bursts
     open the window.

     The Cat leaps off the bed, caught in lightning flash, the Toy drops,
     tangled on the bed.  Ichabod covers his face, scared; his Mother hugs
     him.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod is startled awake, frightened, sweating.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Ichabod enters with a lantern and his Ledger.  He sits, studies notes,
     then notices a light down the hall.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod enters.  Opposite an elaborate LOOM, Katrina reads by
     candlelight.

     She looks up, and self-consciously closes her book, which we see is a
     child's version of THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE.  She covers it on
     her lap.

                             ICHABOD
               Oh... pardon my intrusion... I saw a
               light... 

                             KATRINA
               It is no intrusion... I come here to
               read when I am wakeful.

                             ICHABOD
               To read books which you must
               hide... ?

                             KATRINA
               They were my mother's books... my
               father frowned at them then, and
               would frown at me now.  He believes
               tales of romance caused the brain
               fever that killed my mother.  She
               died two years ago come midwinter.

     Ichabod nods.

                             ICHABOD
               I saw it written in the front of the
               Bible.

                             KATRINA
               The nurse who cared for her during
               her sickness is now Lady Van Tassel.

                             ICHABOD
               There was something else too.  Why
               did no one think to mention that Van
               Garretts are kith and kin to the Van
               Tassels?

                             KATRINA
               Why, because there is hardly a
               household in Sleepy Hollow that is
               not connected to every other by
               blood or marriage.  I have more
               cousins than fingers and toes to
               count them on.

     A cock crows.  Ichabod goes to the window to look at the edge of dawn.

                             ICHABOD
               I see.

                             KATRINA
               This land was Van Garrett Land,
               given to my father when I was in
               swaddling clothes.

                             ICHABOD
               Given by the dead Van Garrett?

                             KATRINA
                     (nods)
               The Van Garretts were the richest
               family round these parts even then.
               When my father brought us to Sleepy
               Hollow, Van Garrett set him up with
               an acre and a broken-down cottage,
               and a dozen of Van Garrett hens.  My
               father prospered, and built us a new
               house.  I owe my happiness to him.  I
               remember living poor in the cottage.
               Should I show you?

                             ICHABOD
               Yes.  I would like to see where you
               were as poor as I am.

     Katrina stands up, revealing a Book that had been on the floor, hidden
     by her skirt.  She picks up the book and gives it to Ichabod.

                             KATRINA
               Take this.  It is my gift for you.

     Ichabod looks at the title page: A COMPENDIUM OF SPELLS, CHARMS AND
     DEVICES OF THE SPIRIT WORLD.

                             ICHABOD
                     (troubled)
               But I have no use for... 

                             KATRINA
               Are you so certain of everything?

     Ichabod sees that Katrina's name is written on the endpaper, and, in a
     different hand, her mother's name, "Elizabeth Van Tassel."

                             ICHABOD
               It was your mother's... ?

                             KATRINA
               Keep it close to your heart.  It is
               sure protection against harm.

                             ICHABOD
                     (smiles)
               Are you so certain of everything?

     Their eyes meet and hold for a moment.  Ichabod accepts the book by
     placing it on the desk.

     EXT.  FIELDS -- DAY (EARLY MORNING)

     Ichabod and Katrina make a pretty picture on horseback, riding slowly
     toward the cottage.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW FARMLAND -- DAY (EARLY MORNING)

     Ichabod and Katrina, riding, come upon the ruin of a cottage.  There is
     almost nothing left but the hearth and a part of a chimney.

     Ichabod dismounts and helps Katrina down from her horse, taking her
     hand.

     Before he lets go, she notices the little scars on his palm.  She takes
     both his hands and looks at them.

                             KATRINA
               These are strange... What are
               they... ?

                             ICHABOD
               I wish I knew.  I had them since I
               can remember.

     Katrina holds his hands a moment longer, their eyes meet, then she
     lets go and "enters" the ruin.

     Ichabod's attention is caught by a red Cardinal on a branch, like the
     bird he had in New York.

     He reflects a moment, then turns to watch Katrina crouching by the
     hearth.  She has put a flower in her hair.

                             KATRINA
               I used to play by this hearth.  It
               was my first drawing school and my
               mother was my teacher.

     Unwittingly, Katrina is mimicking Ichabod's dream.  She picks up a twig
     and starts "drawing" on the hearth stone.  Like Ichabod's mother in his
     dream.

     Ichabod's blood runs cold but she is unaware of him.  Then he notices
     that a few small wildflowers are growing in the old fireplace.  Ichabod
     feels short of breath, he leans against the stones for support.

                             KATRINA (CONT'D)
               Oh, look!  I'd forgotten this!  -- see
               -- carved into the fire-back, the
               Archer!

     Using her fingers she cleans off the dirt around a simple carving of a
     man with a Bow and Arrow.

                             KATRINA (CONT'D)
               This was from long before we lived
               here.

     She turns to show Ichabod and notices him looking strange.

                             KATRINA (CONT'D)
               Are you all right?

     Ichabod nods, recovering, saying nothing.

     Katrina is reassured.  Suddenly her attention is caught, as Ichabod's
     was, by the Cardinal bird.

                             KATRINA (CONT'D)
                     (pointing)
               Oh, look!  A Cardinal!  My favorite!  I
               would love to have a tame one, but I
               wouldn't have the heart to cage him.

     Ichabod unslings his satchel.

                             ICHABOD
               Then I have something for you.

     He has a PAPER DISK with a BIRD on one side and an EMPTY CAGE on the
     other, pierced by a looped string on which the disk can twist and
     spin.  He demonstrates like a magician.  This is the very Toy given to
     him by his Mother.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               A Cardinal on one side, and an empty
               cage.

     Katrina watches intently.  Ichabod spins the Disk.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               And now... 

     The bird appears to be inside the cage.

     Katrina is astonished and delighted.

                             KATRINA
               You can do magic!  Teach me!

                             ICHABOD
               It is no magic.  It is optics.

     Ichabod gives her the Toy and shows her how to spin it.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Separate pictures which become one
               picture in the spinning... Like the
               truth which I must spin here... 

     Katrina spins the disk, the bird appears in the cage.

     EXT.  PHILIPSE HOUSE -- NIGHT

     A MOVING POV is checking out the Village House.  Through lighted
     windows, figures of Men are seen pacing, apparently arguing.

     Philipse is packing his bags, moving out... while three Men, Steenwyck,
     Doctor Lancaster and Hardenbrook, are in agitated conference.  Their
     raised voices make an undecipherable hubbub.  The POV'S horse makes a
     horsey snuffling sound.  Is it Daredevil?

     Steenwyck comes right to the window as if he has seen something... but
     he merely closes the shutters.

     The REVERSE shows that it is Ichabod who has been spying.

     Ichabod backs off and mounts Gunpowder, looking thoughtful, then
     determined.

     EXT.  ROAD OUTSIDE VILLAGE -- NIGHT

     A Mounted Man is approaching on a heavily loaded Pack Horse... Philipse
     making his getaway from Sleepy Hollow.  As he reaches the foreground,
     Ichabod on Gunpowder intercepts him, grabbing the bridle of the Pack
     Horse.

                             PHILIPSE
               What are you doing?  Let go!

                             ICHABOD
               What are you running from,
               Magistrate Philipse?

                             PHILIPSE
               Damn you, Crane --

                             ICHABOD
               You'll raise the village.

     Philipse calms down.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               You had a mind to help me.

                             PHILIPSE
               Yes -- and I put myself in mortal
               dread of... 

                             ICHABOD
               Of... what?

                             PHILIPSE
               Powers against which there is no
               defense.

                             ICHABOD
               How did you know the widow was
               expecting a child?

                             PHILIPSE
               She told me.

                             ICHABOD
               Then I deduce you are the father.

                             PHILIPSE
               I hope your deductions serve you
               better in your contest against the
               Hessian.  I am not the father.

                             ICHABOD
               Did she tell you the name of the
               child's father?

                             PHILIPSE
               Yes -- she did.  She came to me for
               advice -- as the town magistrate --

     Ichabod hears sounds... of sheep in agitation at some distance but he
     holds Philipse to his story.

                             PHILIPSE (CONT'D)
               -- to protect the rights of her
               child.  I was bound by my oath of
               office to keep the secret --

                             ICHABOD
               Do you believe the father killed
               her?

                             PHILIPSE
                     (stares at him in
                     surprise)
               The Horseman killed her!  -- You damn
               fool, do you suppose the Horseman
               stops to impregnate our women?

                             ICHABOD
               The Horseman?  How often do I have to
               tell you there is no Horseman!  There
               never was a Horseman!  -- and there
               never will be a Horseman!

     Ichabod grabs him fiercely, pulling on the amulet Philipse wears
     around his neck.

                             PHILIPSE
               Let go!  -- it is my talisman that
               protects me from the Horseman!

                             ICHABOD
               You a magistrate!  -- and your head
               full of such nonsense!  Now tell me
               the name of --

     A flock of sheep comes streaming and bleating across the path.

     The horses go crazy, BRAYING and rearing.  A SOUND is HEARD, distant:
     THUNDERING HOOFBEATS.  Wind kicks up.

     Philipse looks to the forest.  A FLOCK of BIRDS alights.

                             PHILIPSE
               Oh my... oh my oh my oh my... 

     PHILIPSE runs away.  HOOFBEATS LOUDER, CLOSER.  Ichabod faces the
     forest.

     The forest explodes open, foliage bending to make way as the HEADLESS
     HORSEMAN gallops into view atop DAREDEVIL.

     Ichabod's stunned.  He looks down to draw his flintlock pistol, but the
     Horseman ROARS by before he can raise it -- a blast of air knocks
     Ichabod off his horse.

     After this, everything happens very quickly --

     The Horseman chases Philipse.

     Philipse looks over his shoulder.

     The Horseman draws his sword.

     Philipse gathers his courage and stops, turning.  He raises his iron
     key talisman before him.  The Horseman is closing... 

                             ICHABOD
               Philipse!

     Philipse holds the talisman up, trying to be fearless.  The Horseman
     swings his sword upon the talisman -- CLANK... 

     Philipse's severed head spins.  His body falls and folds.

     The two pieces of Philipse's Talisman, an Iron Key, fly through the
     air, toward Ichabod, who has only just managed to find his feet and
     find his fallen pistol.

     The Horseman turns Daredevil in a wide circle... 

     Daredevil completes the turn, letting out a SCREECHY CRY as the
     Horseman rides straight toward Ichabod... 

     Before Ichabod has time to take aim, the Horseman is upon him and past
     him!  -- heading toward Philipse's corpse... leans effortlessly to
     skewer Philipse's head with his sword.

     With the head as his prize, the Horseman races away.

     Ichabod turns, watches the Horseman head to the forest.

     Ichabod stands, stricken.  He faints.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- DAY

     Ichabod gasps awake.  A KNOCKING is HEARD.

                             BALTUS'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Constable Crane... ?

     Ichabod looks at his hand balled into a fist.  He opens his hand --
     holds BOTH HALVES of PHILIPSE'S IRON KEY TALISMAN.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL 3RD FLOOR -- DAY

     Young Masbath is seated by Ichabod's closed door.  Katrina is backing
     up Baltus, who knocks again.

                             BALTUS
               Has he not come out at all?

     Young Masbath shakes his head.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY

     Baltus enters.  Katrina and Masbath follow him, cautiously, "visiting
     the sick." Ichabod sits up in bed, stunned, spaced out.

                             ICHABOD
               It was a Headless Horseman!

                             BALTUS
               You must not excite yourself.

                             ICHABOD
               But it was Headless Horseman!

                             BALTUS
               Of course it was.

                             ICHABOD
               No, you must believe me, it was
               Horseman!  A dead one!  Headless!

                             BALTUS
               I know, I know... 

                             ICHABOD
               You don't know because you weren't
               there!  But it's all true!

                             BALTUS
               Of course it is.  I told you!
               Everyone told you!

                             ICHABOD
                     (wildly)
               I saw him!

     His eyes roll up and he faints.  Katrina and Masbath look helplessly at
     each other.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               I suppose it's back to the City,
               then.

     Katrina's reaction is mixed -- glad that Ichabod will be safe, sorry
     if he leaves.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FOREST -- DAY

     A MILLION WHITE MILKWEED SEEDLINGS are floating in sunlight.  Young
     Ichabod's laughter is heard.

     Now we see that his Mother is blowing the seedlings for his delight.
     She gives him a milkweed pod and shows him how to do it for himself.
     Ichabod breaks the pod and releases another million.  But when he looks
     around to share the delight, his Mother has gone... and he sees her
     disappearing among the trees.  He goes to follow her.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FOREST GLADE -- DAY

     Ichabod can't see his Mother anywhere... 

     Then he sees her standing in the middle of a CIRCLE OF BEAUTIFUL
     TOADSTOOLS/MUSHROOMS growing in the Glade.

     Ichabod watches as his Mother turns inside the Mushroom Circle, almost
     dancing.  He smiles.  Then he sees his Mother stoop to pick a mushroom.
     She eats it.  She looks happy.  She drops a small piece of the mushroom.

     Ichabod sees it fall.

     He runs forward and picks it up before she sees him.  Ichabod eats it.
     His Mother sees him, takes his hands in hers and dances around in a
     circle.

     As Ichabod whizzes around laughing, his POV becomes the Encircling
     Trees whizzing around, and suddenly he seems to be surrounded by
     Menacing Headless Figures dressed all in black.

     Ichabod falls over dizzy and when he looks up he sees that the
     Headless Figures have become his Father, watching his Mother
     heedlessly dancing, his face like thunder.  His Mother has loosened her
     clothes and is virtually barebreasted.

     His Father's eyes begin to glow like live coals as Ichabod cowers away
     from him.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- ICHABOD'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod's eyes are spying... through a crack in the kitchen door.

     When we see him properly, he is wearing a nightshirt.  Then we see his
     POV, into the kitchen.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Mother is seated, her head down.  Father paces, chastising Mother
     angrily, his fist balled up in rage.

     Father continues berating Mother.  He picks up his Bible off the table,
     waving it, then grabs Mother by the shoulders, forcing her to the
     floor... 

     Father forces Mother to her knees.  Mother is afraid, clasping her
     hands in front of her as Father forces her to pray.  Father starts
     reading from the Bible.  In Ichabod's dream, this is the same Bible
     from Baltus's house.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod watches, afraid.  He backs away, returning upstairs.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     A window is thrown CRASHING open, THUNDER BOOMING... Young Ichabod
     sits up in his bed.  He goes to close the window, RAIN pouring in.  He
     looks down... 

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- EXT.  YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Below, in front of the home, a MAN drags Mother toward a COACH.  TWO
     MEN stand watching, faces hidden under hat brims.  Mother looks back,
     eyes pleading, struggling... 

     Mother looks up to Young Ichabod.

     The TWO MEN looks up to Young Ichabod: one is Father, and the THIRD
     MAN is a Cotton Mather-ish man with a villainous face.

     Young Ichabod reaches helplessly toward Mother.

     Mother is forced into the coach.

     The Third Man speaks to Father, then walks to the coach.  He gets onto
     the coach as the coach starts away.

     Father watches, rain flowing down his stony features.  LIGHTING
     FLASHES... And we see the family Cat watching with glowing eyes.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- DAY

     Ichabod's eyes as he opens them.  He wakes, breathing heavily.

     After a beat, he flings back the bedclothes and springs out of bed,
     energized by a new determination.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DOWNSTAIRS -- DAY

     Baltus, Steenwyck, Doctor Lancaster and Notary Hardenbrook are having
     another meeting, this time with Lady Van Tassel and Katrina on hand
     with the drinks.

                             BALTUS
               Right -- this time I'll go to New
               York myself and I won't be fobbled
               off with an amateur deductor.

                             HARDENBROOK
                     (correcting him)
               Detector.

                             STEENWYCK
                     (correcting)
               Deductive.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
                     (doubting)
               No... no... 

                             BALTUS
                     (rising above it)
               An amateur sleuth!  This time it's a
               magistrate that's dead, and --

     The door is flung open without ceremony.

     It's Ichabod ready for action, transformed, raring to go -- with Young
     Masbath round-eyed just behind him.

                             ICHABOD
               Gentlemen!  -- I need able men, to go
               with me to the Western Woods.  Who
               will be the first to volunteer?

                             BALTUS
               You... ?  We thought you'd shot your
               bolt... 

                             ICHABOD
               A setback, merely.  And yet, a step
               forward too -- we now know who has
               done these terrible --

                             STEENWYCK
               You now know, we already knew --

                             ICHABOD
                     (high on it)
               Quite so -- and now it seems fate
               has chosen me to make my name in a
               case without parallel in the annals
               of crime -- in short, to pit myself
               against a murdering ghost.

                             KATRINA
                     (fearful for him)
               No, Ichabod -- Constable --

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (smiles)
               Do you intend to arrest him?  Or
               impound his horse... ?

     The Men chuckle indulgently.

                             ICHABOD
               Neither.  To put an end to the
               killing.  To discover the cause and
               remove it.  Who's with me?

     No one.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY

     No one, indeed... Ichabod and Young Masbath ride alone... their horses
     loaded up for the expedition.

     Dark, gnarled and creepy woods.  Ichabod and Young Masbath move
     through.  SOUND OF BIRDS etc.

                             ICHABOD
               The Van Garretts, the Widow Winship
               ... your father, Jonathan Masbath... 
               and now Philipse... Something must
               connect them.  Can you think?

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (shakes his head)
               We had no dealings with the
               magistrate that I know of... 

                             ICHABOD
               And the widow?  Your father knew her?

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (shrugs)
               Everyone knew Widow Winship.

                             ICHABOD
               In a manner of speaking, I trust.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               She would bring old Mr. Van Garrett
               a basket of eggs many a day.

                             ICHABOD
               Did your father have dealings with
               the Van Garretts?

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (surprised)
               He worked for them, we lived in the
               coach house.

     Ichabod halts his horse, surprised.

                             YOUNG MASBATH (CONT'D)
               It's nothing -- there were many
               servants... all dismissed now, of
               course.
                     (beat -- they ride on)
               But there was something happened one
               night, a week before the murder.  An
               argument upstairs between father and
               son, and my father was later sent
               for by Mr. Van Garrett.

                             ICHABOD
               An argument between father and son?
                     (to himself,
                     thoughtfully)
               After which, the elder Van Garrett
               summoned his servant, Masbath... 

     Young Masbath halts his horse and looks around.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Listen.

                             ICHABOD
               I hear nothing.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Nor I -- no birds -- no crickets --

     Everything has gone quiet.

                             YOUNG MASBATH (CONT'D)
               -- it's all gone so quiet... 

     Ichabod notes this nervously.

                             ICHABOD
               You're right!

     He gees up the horses.  They break into a gallop.  A MOVING POV watches
     them gallop by.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS AND CAVE ENTRANCE -- DAY

     Ichabod and Masbath reach a hill crest.  They stop, uneasy.

     BELOW, there is a CAVE with a rock archway.  An ill-fitting DOOR covers
     the mouth.  The chimney spews smoke.

     Ichabod and Masbath share a fearful look.

     ELSEWHERE, SOMEONE WATCHES... A MOVING POV WATCHES Ichabod and Masbath
     as they ride to the cave, FOLLOWING... 

     Ichabod and Young Masbath dismount, tying their horses, then heading
     to the cave.  They arrive at the cave door.  Ichabod hesitantly KNOCKS.

     INT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     The door is ajar... Ichabod and Young Masbath step in... Walls are hung
     with SKINS and SKELETONS.  Across the cave, a CRONE sits facing away,
     motionless.

     Ichabod and Young Masbath look to each other, fearful.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon my intrusion... 

     The Crone, with gray hair and gray features, sits disinterested.
     Behind, Ichabod edges slowly forward... 

                             CRONE
               You are from the Hollow?

                             ICHABOD
               In a way, yes.  I, um... 

     Ichabod is distracted by gourd BOWLS of DEAD INSECTS, LEAVES and
     ACORNS... KNIVES, SCISSORS and YELLOWED BONES.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               I should like to say... um... I make
               no assumptions about your
               occupation, no, your ways, witch --
               which -- which are nothing to me... 
               um... whatever you are, each to his
               own -- um --

     The Crone places something on a table beside her... a DEAD BIRD, a
     bright red cardinal.

     Ichabod backs away, but Masbath comes to stand beside him.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Do you know of the Horseman,
               ma'am... ?  The Hessian.

     The Crone draws her finger across her neck.

                             YOUNG MASBATH (CONT'D)
               That'll be him, miss.

     Around her neck is a cord on which is threaded a carved stone, a
     mystic bauble.  Ichabod notices it.  The Crone stands, faces them, tall
     ... points to Ichabod.

                             CRONE
               You, follow with me.
                     (to young Masbath)
               Go out, child.  Keep away.  No matter
               what you hear, keep away.

     She takes a candle and heads deeper into the cave... 

     INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY

     The Crone enters through a passage, Ichabod follows, terrified, bent
     under the low ceiling.

                             ICHABOD
               Um... what might he hear that he must
               keep away from... ?

                             CRONE
               Sit there.

     Ichabod sits on a crooked stool.  The Crone kneels with her back to
     him, grasps two METAL CUFFS with chains attached, slides these onto
     her wrists, testing them... 

                             CRONE (CONT'D)
               He rides, to the Hollow and back.  I
               hear him.  I smell the blood on him.

                             ICHABOD
               Do... do you?  Well... I'm here to find
               him and... er... make him stop... 

                             CRONE
               You want to see into the netherworld
               ... I can show you... 

     The Crone gathers STRAW in a pile on the floor, then gathers bowls,
     putting GRASS and POWDER on the pile, WITHERING over it.  She takes a
     JAR from a table.

                             ICHABOD
               What... what are you doing?

     The Crone shakes one jar, pulls the lid off and upends it.  A BABY BAT
     squirms, dazed.  The Crone grips the bat, uses a knife to cut off its
     head, soaks the straw with blood.

                             CRONE
               Do not move or speak.  When the other
               comes, I will hold him.

     Using her candle, the Crone lights the straw pile.

                             ICHABOD
               The other... ?

                             CRONE
               Silence.
                     (bends to inhale smoke)
               He comes now.

     Ichabod would like to leave now.

     EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Young Masbath waits.  WIND picks up, kicking leaves, sending them in
     swirls.  Masbath holds himself against the chill.

     INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY

     The Crone slumps forward to the floor, suddenly immobile, still with
     her back to Ichabod.  WIND HOWLS through a hole/window.

     Ichabod looks around, uncertain, stands.

                             ICHABOD
               Excuse me... ma'am... ?

     The Crone remains motionless.  The WIND intensifies.  Candles blow out.
     Ichabod inches closer... 

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Do you hear me... ?

     INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY

     The Crone suddenly jumps erect, spinning -- a half-human, half-demon
     CREATURE, black clawed hands reaching... 

     Ichabod cries out, leaping backward... 

     CHAINS on the restraining CUFFS around the creature's hands go taut,
     yanking the creature back.

     Ichabod KNOCKS over a table of bones, hits the floor.  The creature is
     chained, but still wants Ichabod.  It SHRIEKS.

     The creature's face still seethes from transformation.

                             CREATURE/CRONE
               You seek the warrior bathed in blood
               ... the Headless Horseman... 

     Ichabod scrambles back as far as possible.  The creature claws the rock
     floor, yearning.

                             CREATURE/CRONE (CONT'D)
               Follow the Indian trail to where the
               sun dies.  Follow to the Tree of the
               Dead... 

     The creature yanks, testing the chains.  Behind, the BOLT holding the
     chains slips... the WALL CRACKS a little.

                             CREATURE/CRONE (CONT'D)
               Climb down to the Horseman's resting
               place.  Do you hear... ?

     Ichabod nods, quaking, aghast.  He glances to the exit.

     The chain bolt gives more... coming loose... 

     Ichabod flees toward the door.  The creature HOWLS, leaping... the chain
     bolt BREAKS... 

     Ichabod cries out as he is TACKLED to the floor... 

     INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY

     It is only the CRONE lying on him; she has returned to human form,
     semiconscious.  Ichabod desperately shoves her off... 

     EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Ichabod sprints out from the cave, past Young Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
               We are leaving.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What happened?

                             ICHABOD
               We are leaving now.

     Ichabod scrambles onto Gunpowder, riding, glancing back.  Young Masbath
     follows.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS AREA TWO, FARTHER ON -- LATER DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath ride side by side.

                             ICHABOD
                     (quoting)
               "Take the Indian trail... To the
               Tree of the Dead... "

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               How will we recognize it?

                             ICHABOD
               Without difficulty I rather fear.
               And "Climb down to the Horseman's
               resting place... " she said.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               His... camp?

                             ICHABOD
               His grave.

     A SNAPPING BRANCH is HEARD.  Ichabod turns to look back... 

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
                     (whispers to Masbath)
               Quicken pace.

     Ichabod rides faster.  Young Masbath keeps up... 

     FARTHER ON, they charge over a hill.  Ichabod halts Gunpowder, climbs
     clumsily off, handing the reins to Masbath.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Ride on.

     Young Masbath obeys.  Ichabod takes out his pistol and wades into
     forest growth, backtracking... 

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS AREA THREE -- DAY

     INSIDE THE FOREST, Ichabod moves through UNDERBRUSH, keeping low.  A
     HORSE is HEARD SNORTING.

     Ichabod forges on, pushes through branches, fearful... 

     He comes up behind a FIGURE IN A GRAY CLOAK on horseback, raising his
     pistol, cocking the hammer... 

                             ICHABOD
               Halt and turn!  I have a pistol
               aimed.

     The FIGURE stops, pushes off the cloak hood.  It is Katrina.

                             KATRINA
               It is me.

                             ICHABOD
                     (lowers gun, shaken)
               Katrina... I might have killed you.
               Why have you come?

                             KATRINA
               Because no one else would go with
               you.

     She smiles a little.  Ichabod is heartened.

                             ICHABOD
               I am now twice the man.

     Ichabod takes her hand.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               It is your white magic.

     She is about to turn this moment into a kiss -- but... 

                             YOUNG MASBATH (O.S.)
               Pardon my intrusion... 

     Ichabod and Katrina look to see Masbath has backtracked.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               I think you'd better come and look
               at this... 

     Ichabod and Katrina move to follow Young Masbath.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DUSK

     Ichabod, Masbath and Katrina come into a clearing, slowing their
     horses... looking up in wonder at... 

     The monstrously huge TREE OF THE DEAD, at the clearing's center.

     Its branches reach far and wide, knotted and gross, like agony
     captured in wood sculpture.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               The Tree of the Dead.

                             KATRINA
               It does announce itself.

     Ichabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and weeds will
     not grow.  Young Masbath and Katrina dismount behind.  They all walk
     toward the tree... 

     Ichabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches.

     There's a VERTICAL WOUND in the bark, like a terrible suture, now
     healed and scarred.  Ichabod approaches... 

     He feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till sap begins to run.
     Red Sap.  Ichabod fingers it, sniffs it.

                             ICHABOD
               Blood.

                             KATRINA
               The tree bleeds?  How can it be?

     Ichabod goes to where Katrina and Masbath wait with the horses, digs
     in a saddle bag for a hand AXE.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What is it?

                             ICHABOD
               Stay here.

     At the trunk, Ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against the
     suture.  It sounds hollow.  He begins to CHOP... 

     He CHOPS into the suture... pulls away loose bark.  The tree drips more
     blood and a goo.  Ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the
     festering suture.

                             KATRINA
               What are you doing?

                             ICHABOD
               Just... keep where you are.

     Young Masbath moves closer.  Ichabod keeps CHOPPING, then grips a
     large, loose flap, trying to pull it away.  It's not easy.  Ichabod
     struggles.

     Katrina follows Young Masbath's slow advance.

     Ichabod's pulling -- the flap suddenly gives, revealing a blood-
     soaked, wide-eyed, gap-mouthed HUMAN HEAD.

     Ichabod recoils.  Behind him, Katrina stifles a scream.

     Ichabod backs off, back of his hand to his mouth.

     It is PHILIPSE'S HEAD, hanging off the trunk flap, held by roots grown
     around and into the flesh.

     FOUR other SEVERED, DECAYING HEADS are held by ingrown roots within
     the dewy innards.

     One of the heads is Jonathan Masbath's.  Before Young Masbath sees it,
     Katrina hides his face in her bosom and comforts him.

                             KATRINA
               My God... 

                             ICHABOD
               He... he tries to take the heads back
               with him.  They will not pass... 

                             KATRINA
               We must leave this place.

     Ichabod looks to the branches towering above.

                             ICHABOD
               This is... a gateway, between two
               worlds... 

     Ichabod studies the ground, circling the trunk... Around the other
     side, Ichabod gets to his knees... 

     He's found the HORSEMAN'S SWORD: the grave marker, jutting out from
     the ground, rusted twenty years' worth, gripped by the tree trunk and
     vines.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
                     (touching the ground)
               Climb down to the Horseman's resting
               place... 
                     (looks to Masbath)
               Bring the shovel.

     Now he sees Katrina hugging the boy.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Forgive me... I... 

     Young Masbath courageously recovers himself, wiping his eyes and nose
     on the back of his sleeve.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Yes, sir -- the shovel... Two
               shovels and the rifle, I suggest.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DUSK

     Lantern light.

     Young Masbath's crouched, rifle across his knees.  He watches the tree,
     looking up... 

     High branches swarm with BATS.

     Behind Masbath, Ichabod and Katrina dig up the SHALLOW GRAVE.

                             KATRINA
               This ground has been disturbed, the
               soil is loose.

     Ichabod throws down his Shovel.

     Young Masbath comes to the grave.  Ichabod pulls at thick BURLAP CLOTH
     heavy with dirt... straining as it comes away... 

     Ichabod drops the burlap, looking down, disbelieving... 

                             ICHABOD
               Look... !

     WE SEE: Roots have gripped the HORSEMAN'S BONES and tattered uniform.
     The skeleton is all there -- except the skull.

                             KATRINA
               The skull is gone.  What does it
               mean?

     Ichabod jumps out from the grave, snapping his fingers.

                             ICHABOD
                     (energized)
               It means, my dear Miss Van Tassel,
               it means -- yes!  What exactly does
               it mean?  -- It means, unless I am
               mistaken... it definitely means
               something -- what that something is,
               only time will tell!  But I sense
               that we are very close to the answer
               here, if only we had one more
               clue... 

     Ichabod is unaware that the ground is writhing around him.

                             KATRINA (O.S.)
               Ichabod... !

     Ichabod turns, looks... 

     Katrina and Young Masbath back away, because... the ROOTS in the grave
     are ALIVE, entwining around remains.

     Ichabod spins to the twisted tree... 

     The vertical SUTURE SEETHES, pulling inward... sucking Philipse's head
     back in and closing, bubbling.

     Ichabod bounds over the grave dirt pile, hastening Katrina and Young
     Masbath along as he flees across the field.

     At the tree, the suture swells.

     Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath pass where their freaking horses
     are tied to a fallen trunk, heading for cover.

     A RUMBLING is HEARD from the tree.  It's wound suddenly BURSTS wide,
     spitting smoldering cinders.

     At the tree line, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath take cover,
     looking back.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS TREE OF THE DEAD (EFFECT) -- DUSK

     From the tree wound, a glow BRIGHTENS... till suddenly the Headless
     Horseman and Daredevil EXPLODE into existence... They hit the ground
     running.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS TREE OF THE DEAD -- DUSK

     Ichabod watches the Horseman ride away, bolts of LIGHTING STRIKING the
     GROUND BEHIND.

     The Horseman disappears into the forest.

                             ICHABOD
                     (to Masbath)
               Did you see that?!
                     (recovering)
               Take Katrina home!

     Ichabod runs toward the horses.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Constable!

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS AREA TWO -- NIGHT

     The Horseman rips past on Daredevil... 

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS AREA THREE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod rides as fast as Gunpowder is able... 

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS AREA TWO, FARTHER ON -- NIGHT

     Trees are silhouetted against the sky.  As Daredevil's HOOFBEATS get
     LOUDER, branches bend like arms and fingers yearning to touch.  As
     HOOFBEATS ROAR PAST, the trees relax.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS AREA TWO, FARTHER ON -- NIGHT

     Ichabod ducks under foliage as he pursues.  He sees... 

     Through the forest ahead: the SKY'S LIT UP.  Distant fire.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, CAVE HOME -- NIGHT

     The Crone's CAVE vomits FLAME.

     Ichabod arrives on Gunpowder, horrified, struggling for control as
     Gunpowder rears, trying to see through BLACK SMOKE... 

     Embers swirl everywhere.  Ichabod dismounts, moving closer to the cave
     ... suddenly he SLIPS... 

     Ichabod falls down a bloody rock, landing very close to the CRONE'S
     HEADLESS BODY.  Ichabod recoils, crawling away, looking to the carnage
     in terror... 

     The corpse lies near the cave entrance.  The jagged skin of the neck
     wound still bleeds.  The ground and dead leaves around the corpse are
     thick with BLOOD.  Ichabod crawls back to the Crone, terrified... because
     he has seen a CLUE.

     The cord around the Crone's neck has been cut and the Carved Bauble is
     missing (along with the Crone's head).

     Ichabod hears a Horse neighing in the trees... and the sound of the
     horse crashing through the undergrowth, departing... but he can see
     nothing.

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     Brom, Theodore and Glen are on patrol -- Brom with his new rifle.  They
     can hear the same horse crashing invisibly through branches, the sound
     of hooves.  They can't tell where the sound is coming from.  They look
     around nervously.

                             BROM
               Split up!  He won't get away.

     The three of them gallop off in three directions.

     When they clear the frame there is a sound of deep rumbling, the sound
     we heard before Jonathan Masbath was murdered.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Small home.  Killian, Thomas and BETH, Killian's wife, have finished
     supper.  Beth clears plates as Killian picks his teeth with a knife.

     The same rumbling sound is faintly heard.

     The glasses on the table shiver audibly.  Killian notices.  Then the
     phenomenon stops.  Killian continues picking his teeth.

     Thomas gets down from his chair.  He goes to the fireplace to light a
     tallow wick, which he takes to the next room.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- NIGHT

     Thomas plops on the floor and lights his MAGIC LANTERN: a lantern with
     an outer sleeve of glass painted with SILHOUETTES of LIONS and
     MONSTERS.

     Thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the creatures'
     SHADOWS are cast.

     He roars for them, imagining them real and having a grand time.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Beth comes for dishes.

                             BETH
               Don't pick teeth.  You teach Thomas
               bad habits.

     Killian pulls her to him, playful.

                             KILLIAN
               I am a bad habit.  There's nothing
               for it.

                             BETH
                     (kisses him)
               Oh, isn't there.

     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT

     A black horse runs, hooves pounding the ground.

     THUNDER is HEARD.  The horse stops... it is Brom's horse, with Brom
     riding.  Brom looks skyward.

     All around, the WIND HALTS.  A DEAD SILENCE falls.  Distant HOOFBEATS
     can be HEARD.

     Brom takes his long rifle from his shoulder, rides... 

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Behind Killian, MANTELPIECE STONES pulse, breathing.  Demonic faces
     form, then disappear.  WIND HOWLS.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- NIGHT

     Thomas continues his fun, shadow animals circling him.  Beth enters,
     looking at Thomas, smiling.

     The magic lantern suddenly stops spinning.  Shadow creatures freeze.
     Beth looks up, noticing the FEROCITY of the WIND.  The smile leaves her
     face.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     The ENTIRE HOUSE CREAKS.  Killian stands, looking up.  The HOUSE CREAKS
     again, then suddenly the WIND CEASES.  Silence.

                             KILLIAN
               Beth... 

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- NIGHT

     Beth picks up Thomas.  The magic lantern shadow creatures begin
     spinning anew, quickly, around and around.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     With a ROAR, the fire flares.  Killian looks... In the leaping flames
     he seems to see -- as we also seem to see -- the ILLUSION OF DEMONIC
     FACES molded out of flames.

     Behind Killian, the DOOR SPLINTERS INWARD.  The Horseman steps in, a
     battle axe in each hand.  WIND BLASTS... 

     The DOOR to the other room SLAMS.  Killian grabs a chair and HURLS
     it... 

     The Horseman swings, SMASHING it aside.

                             KILLIAN
               Beth... run!

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- NIGHT

     Beth holds Thomas as she back away from the closed door.

                             KILLIAN (CONT'D; O.S.)
                     (from kitchen)
               Get out!

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Killian grabs an IRON SKEWER from the fireplace, SWINGS it to fend off
     a blow from the Horseman.

     The Horseman SWINGS the other axe.  Killian ducks.  The axe CRACKS
     fireplace stone, throwing sparks.

     Killian lunges, JAMMING the skewer into the Horseman... The skewer
     comes through the Horseman's back.  The Horseman SWIPES with the flat
     of one axe -- POUNDS Killian aside... 

     Killian hits the wall, BASHING his head.  Hits the floor.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- NIGHT

     Beth kicks a carpet to reveal a TRAP DOOR.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     The Horseman pulls the skewer out of his body, throws it.  He goes to
     lift Killian by the hair with one hand, brings back the axe in the
     other hand... 

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- NIGHT

     At the trap door, Beth lowers Thomas to stairs leading to a CRAWL
     SPACE under the GAPPED floorboards.  Thomas is crying.

                             BETH
               Hush -- hush -- quiet as a mouse,
               now.

                             THOMAS
               Mother... 

                             BETH
               You must hide... 

     Beth closes the trap door, frantically replacing the carpet.  The
     room's door FLIES OPEN... the Horseman strides in, carrying Killian's
     severed head.  Beth shrieks.

     EXT.  FOREST NEAR KILLIAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Brom, on his horse, hears Beth's shriek.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- NIGHT

     Beth's SCREAMS are abruptly CUT OFF.  Her BODY is HEARD HITTING the
     floor above.  Thomas sees the shadow of Beth's head rolling across the
     gaps in the floorboards above him, coming to rest with her hair
     showing, hanging down in the gap.  FOOTSTEPS are HEARD... 

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- NIGHT

     The Horseman's hands place Killian's and Beth's heads in a sack,
     cinching the sack shut.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     The Headless Horseman enters, bends to retrieve the battle axe he
     left.  He stands.  Long, silent pause.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CRAWL SPACE -- NIGHT

     Thomas cowers, trembling.  QUIET.

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     The Horseman falls to his knees.  He starts to CHOP at the floor with
     both axes.  CHOPPING, CHOPPING, CHOPPING... making quick work of it... 

     INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CRAWL SPACE -- NIGHT

     A hole appears as debris falls... 

     Thomas looks up.  He tries to crawl away.

     The Horseman's arm SHOVES through from above -- grabbing Thomas and
     YANKING him up through the hole.

     EXT.  KILLIAN'S FARM, TOWN OUTSKIRTS -- NIGHT

     Brom rides from the forest.

     Ahead, at Killian's house, among scattered homes on the outskirts of
     town, Daredevil rides up as the Headless Horseman walks out with his
     sack of heads.  The Horseman ties the sack to his saddle and leaps up.

     The Horseman ignores Brom.  But Brom refuses to be ignored.

     Brom puts his reins in his mouth, aims his rifle... FIRING... 

     BOOM -- the slug blows the Horseman off Daredevil, EXPLODING.
     Daredevil keeps going.  The Horseman's smoldering body is left "face
     down."

     Brom halts his horse.  He climbs down, pleased.

     The Horseman moves.

     Brom backs away, satisfaction diminishing.

     The Horseman rises to his knees.

     Brom falls to one knee, begins reloading.  He fills the gun from his
     powder horn.

     The Horseman stands, unsheathes his sword and turns.  The blast has
     exposed rotten flesh and maggot-infested muscle.

     Brom readies his ramrod, but there's no time.  He rises, hefting his
     rifle, straight at the Horseman with a yell... 

     The Horseman is on him.  Brom swings the rifle, blocking.

     The battle is on, with Brom fending off the Horseman's sword with the
     rifle -- CLANK... CLANK... CLANK... 

     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod and Gunpowder arrive... 

     UP THE FIELD, the Horseman makes a backhanded swing, knocks Brom's
     rifle away, sends Brom to the ground... 

     The Horseman walks away from Brom.  Ichabod sees this, registers it.

     Brom pulls a knife and throws it.

     The knife blade goes through the Horseman from back to front, like a
     spear thrust through a smoldering sack of rotten flesh.  The Horseman
     pulls Brom's knife, blade first, from his chest and turns upon Brom.

     Brom scrambles up, flees, running toward Killian's.  The Horseman
     THROWS the knife... 

     THWAP -- the knife imbeds in Brom's thigh.

     The Horseman strides to Brom.

     Ichabod closes in, pulling an unlit lantern off his saddle.

     The Horseman changes his sword grip, blade open... plants one foot on
     Brom's back, raising his sword to skewer... 

     Ichabod arrives at full gallop -- SMASHES the lantern into the
     Horseman -- KNOCKING the Horseman off Brom.

     IN THE DISTANCE, Theodore and Glen arrive on horseback.  They halt
     where they are, watching.

     Brom runs, limping to Killian's house, a goal in sight: FARM
     IMPLEMENTS propped there.  Brom grabs SCYTHES with long curved blades,
     one in each hand.

     The Horseman rises.

     Ichabod leaps off Gunpowder, runs to Brom's side.

     Once more, the Horseman turns away.

                             BROM
               I'll get him!

     Brom grabs Ichabod's pistol.  Ichabod grabs Brom's pistol arm.

                             ICHABOD
               Wait!  Don't you see?  -- he's not
               after us!

     Brom shakes himself free and --

     FIRES -- the bullet rips through the Horseman's stomach to reveal
     putrid innards.

     The Horseman turns and strides back -- no more nice guy!

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               He is now!

     Brom throws the pistol at the Horseman.

     Across the way, Theodore looks to Glenn, turns his horse and flees.
     Glenn follows Theodore away.

     Brom steps up, scythes ready.  He and the Horseman go at it -- Brom
     blocks axe and sword, deflecting blows... 

     Ichabod grabs a long-handled SICKLE, circles them... SWINGS the sickle.
     The Horseman blocks.

     The Horseman battles both men at once, catching blows... counting every
     strike, METAL RINGING.

     Ichabod's sickle is knocked out of his hand.

     Brom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, catches the axe
     handle in the other scythe... 

     The Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom, sending him down.

     Brom picks up Ichabod's sickle and SWINGS it... 

     The blade embeds in the Horseman down to the hilt.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Now you've annoyed him.

     The Horseman drops his axe, grasps the sickle handle... The handle
     SLAMS Ichabod away... 

     Ichabod crawls, shaking off the blow.  The Horseman staggers, trying to
     pull the blade from his body.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               We cannot win this.

     Brom yanks Ichabod to his feet and grabs his scythes.

     As they flee, Ichabod grabs a wood-splitting AXE from the stump where
     it's imbedded.

     Behind, the Horseman manages to extract the sickle, drops it.

     Brom and Ichabod head toward the COVERED BRIDGE that leads across to
     the town square.

     The Horseman strides after... retrives his axe on the way.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE AND COVERED BRIDGE -- NIGHT

     Brom and Ichabod start across.  Ichabod must help support Brom as Brom
     limps.

     Behind, the Horseman picks up the pace, closing fast... 

     Inside the bridge, Ichabod and Brom are halfway across.  FOOTSTEPS are
     HEARD POUNDING.  Ichabod glances back... 

     The Horseman is not behind them.  Ichabod and Brom looks up.  The
     POUNDING FOOTSTEPS are on the roof, passing over... !

     Ahead, at the mouth of the covered bridge, the Horseman leaps down,
     spinning in midair, lands, crouched.

     Ichabod and Brom halt.  The Horseman rises.

     Ichabod releases Brom and moves forward, gripping his wood axe in both
     hands, SWINGING the axe downward... 

     The Horseman swings his axe -- SPLINTERS Ichabod's axe handle.

     The Horseman, axe in one hand, sword in the other, turns upon Brom,
     and in pulling Brom aside out of the path of the sword, Ichabod
     recieves a sword-thrust in the shoulder, which makes him screem out.

     The Horseman lifts his sword arm, THROWING Ichabod and withdrawing the
     sword in one motion... Ichabod tumbles.

     Brom moves forward with scythes.  The Horseman sets upon him with
     incredible ferocity -- battling Brom back, striking so hard and fast
     it's hard for Brom to keep blocking.

     Ichabod tries to get up, but falls, looking up... 

     ICHABOD'S POV:

     The Horseman KNOCKS one of Brom's scythes away, takes another SWING --
     sends Brom spinning in a spray of blood... 

     The Horseman stands over Brom's body, CHOPPING with his sword.  Our
     POINT OF VIEW grows BLURRY... 

     A BLURRY HORSEMAN approaches the POV.

     Ichabod is at the Horseman's mercy.

     Then, another ANGLE -- the Horseman ignores Ichabod, strides past him.
     Ichabod takes a step back and collapses.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Candlelight.  Ichabod, shirtless, feverish, opens his eyes.  The wound
     at the top of his chest is raw but with the edges sealed shut.  Ichabod
     in on his bed.  Doctor Lancaster bends over him.  Baltus Van Tassel
     observes.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               Remarkable.  A wound like this should
               have killed him... but it needs no
               stitch and there's hardly loss of
               blood.

     Baltus sees Ichabod's eyes open.

                             BALTUS
               He stirs.

     Ichabod tries to rise, looking around, collapses in pain.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               You must be still... the fever is on
               you.

                             ICHABOD
                     (weakly)
               Katrina... 

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     A Woman is bent over the hearth, mumbling.

     Then we see it is Katrina, mumbling over a boiling beaker of milk and
     green leaves.  There is a dead crow on the hearth, with one foot
     chopped off and a sharp knife lying alongside.

                             KATRINA
                     (chanting, repeating the
                     phrases)
               Nostradamus Mediamus, Milk Of Mercy
               In Media Nos Laudamas... 

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Katrina enters with the beaker of medicine.  Baltus and Doctor
     Lancaster are bending over Ichabod, the Doctor trying to make Ichabod
     drink a livid green liquid from a shot glass.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               It will restore you.

     Ichabod closes his lips tight and refuses the drink -- he doesn't
     trust Lancaster.  Katrina comes to the bedside with her beaker.  Ichabod
     sees her.  He is in pain, feverish.

                             ICHABOD
               I... I... tried to stop Brom but... 

     Katrina soothes him.

                             KATRINA
               Sssh... no one could have done more.
               Drink this down, it will make you
               sleep.

                             ICHABOD
               The Horseman was not set to kill
               Brom... or me... If Brom had not
               attacked him... 

                             BALTUS
               Later.  Rest now.

                             ICHABOD
               I have discovered something.

     Baltus and Doctor Lancaster glance at each other.

                             BALTUS
               These are ravings... 

                             ICHABOD
               The Horseman does not kill for the
               sake of killing... he choses his
               victims.

                             KATRINA
               Drink... 

     She holds the beaker to Ichabod's lips.  He drains it and falls back on
     the pillow, closing his eyes.

     Baltus turns at a sound from the door.

     Lady Van Tassel has entered quietly.  She comes to him anxiously and
     grips his hand.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               What is it, Baltus?

                             BALTUS
               Nothing... nothing... Don't be
               troubled, my love... 

     They hold hands lovingly, staring at Ichabod, who has fallen asleep.

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Empty church.  Young Ichabod enters, carries a lantern past pews.  He
     HEARS a SOUND, moving behind a pew to hide.

     Ahead, across the church, a RED DOOR opens... Father and the
     villainous Third Man come out, shutting the door, speaking quietly.
     The Third man holds a piece of parchment paper.  Father is ever
     emotionless.

     Ichabod watches them, ducking down to keep hidden... 

     Father and the Third Man walk to leave down the aisle, passing close
     to Ichabod without seeing him.  They exit, leaving Young Ichabod alone
     in the silent church.

     Young Ichabod rises, begins moving fearfully forward... FOLLOW as he
     crosses through the church... going to the RED DOOR... opening it... 

     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH, BEYOND THE RED DOOR -- MORNING

     Young Ichabod enters.  The room contains TORTURE DEVICES: IRON CUFFS,
     THUMB SCREWS, KNIFES and NEEDLES.  There is a SPIKED CHAIR, fitted with
     sharp spikes, adorned with straps for holding down the "accused."

     Young Ichabod backs away, terrified, then sees... 

     A shaft of light cuts across a large, sarcophagus-like IRON MAIDEN --
     where MOTHER'S EYES can be seen through the slit in the Iron Maiden's
     face.  Open eyes.  Dead eyes.

     Young Ichabod lets out a strangled cry, runs to the Iron Maiden,
     trying to pull it open, clawing at the lock... 

     Finally, Young Ichabod backs away, choking on misery.  He looks around
     in despair.  He falls to his knees at the spiked chair, places his
     hands on the spikes, pressing... 

     As he sobs, blood runs down from his hands.  He looks down and sees the
     CAT is there, looking up at him.  The cat reaches up to rub its head
     against his face.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod, sobbing, has jerked up out of the dream straight into
     Katrina's embrace.

     She is sitting on the bed, holding him, calming him.  She notices blood
     on his palms.

     She takes a plain linen handkerchief from her cuff and dabs at the
     blood.

                             KATRINA
               Hush... hush... you were dreaming.

     Ichabod falls back on the pillow.

                             ICHABOD
               Yes... thing I had forgotten and
               would like not to remember.

                             KATRINA
               Perhaps the remembering is the hard
               road to peace of mind... What ails
               you, Ichabod?

                             ICHABOD
               I was well, it was the world that
               was ill... But since I came here... 

                             KATRINA
               You were not a happy man when you
               came.  I think your wound was deeper
               than the wound you received from the
               Horseman... 
                     (she puts her hand on
                     his forehead)
               But your fever is broken, and though
               I cannot cure the world I would make
               you live happy in it... Tell me what
               you dreamed.

                             ICHABOD
               How I found my mother dead... how
               good and evil sometimes wear each
               other's clothes.  She was an
               innocent, a child of nature,
               condemned... murdered... by my
               father... 

                             KATRINA
               Murdered by... ?

                             ICHABOD
               Yes -- murdered to save her soul!
               By a Bible-Black tyrant behind a
               mask of righteousness.  I was seven
               when I lost my faith.

                             KATRINA
               What do you believe in, Ichabod?

                             ICHABOD
               Sense and reason, cause and
               consequence, an ordered universe... 
               Oh lord, I should not have come to
               this place where my rational mind
               has been so controverted by the
               spirit world... 

                             KATRINA
               Is there nothing you will take from
               Sleepy Hollow that was worth the
               coming here?

     Their eyes meet.

                             ICHABOD
               No... not nothing.  A kiss... and how
               rare a thing... a kiss from a lovely
               woman before she saw my face or knew
               my name.

                             KATRINA
               Yes, without sense or reason... 

     They hold still, perhaps about to kiss.

                             KATRINA (CONT'D)
               It was a kiss on account.

     But Ichabod breaks the moment.

                             ICHABOD
               Oh -- God forgive me -- I talk of
               kisses and you have lost your brave
               man Brom --

                             KATRINA
               I have shed my tears for Brom... and
               yet my heart is not broken.  Do you
               think me wicked?

                             ICHABOD
               No... but perhaps there is a little
               bit of the witch in you, Katrina.

                             KATRINA
               Why do you say that?

                             ICHABOD
               Because you have bewitched me.

     This time their held look turns into a passionate embrace... 

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PORCH -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath slowly opens the door to peer out.  He walks out onto the
     porch, watching as... 

     ACROSS THE LAWN, a CLOAKED FIGURE walks, carrying a LANTERN.  The
     figure heads onto the long straight road, into the forest, lantern
     light dissipating.

     Young Masbath steps off the porch, in cautious pursuit.

     EXT.  THE HOLLOW -- EARLY MORNING

     Dawn light is visible over fog-shrouded forests.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- MORNING

     Ichabod awakes, rolls... finds Lady Van Tassel at his bedside with food
     and drink.  Ichabod covers himself with his sheets.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               You slept like the dead.

                             ICHABOD
               You are too kind to me... I do not
               look to be served by the lady of the
               house.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (smiles)
               Nor would you be but that the
               servant girl has vanished.

                             ICHABOD
               Sarah?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Run away, like many more -- people
               are leaving in fear without
               ceremony.

                             ICHABOD
               Where is... ?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               She watched over you till dawn.  Now
               it is her turn to sleep.

     Young Masbath enters as Lady Van Tassel goes out.

     Ichabod looks at his palms, which are stained with dried blood.

                             ICHABOD
               Help me.  I am fit for another day, I
               think.

     The scene incorporates Young Masbath pouring water for Ichabod to wash
     himself, and helping him into his clothes.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Where are we going?

                             ICHABOD
               To the Notary's office.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Why?

                             ICHABOD
               Because that is where I expect to
               find deposited... the last will and
               testament of the elder Van
               Garrett... 

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               You have thought of something... 

                             ICHABOD
               ... of something you said, Young
               Masbath... The Widow Winship came
               many a day with a basket of eggs to
               Van Garrett... who I understand had
               hens to spare... I begin to see.  It
               was Van Garrett's child that the
               widow was carrying.  And what news
               have you?

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               I heard someone leaving last night.
               Looked like they headed to town, but
               I lost them in the woods.

                             ICHABOD
               You didn't see who?

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               All I saw was their lantern.

     Ichabod ponders, troubled, as Masbath brings him a shirt.

                             ICHABOD
               The Horseman does the killing but, I
               believe, at the bidding of a mortal,
               someone of flesh and blood.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What... ?  What makes you say that?

                             ICHABOD
               The witch... the crone, when I
               happened upon her corpse, she lay in
               a pool of blood.  Blood poured hard
               from her neck.  The wound was not
               cauterized.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Then, she was not killed by the
               Hessian.  Someone only tried to make
               it seem so.

                             ICHABOD
                     (nods)
               It was the settling of a private
               score.  But the Horseman cuts heads
               to a different drum.  The crone
               pointed us to what drives the
               Hessian -- his skull has been stolen
               from his grave.  The person who stole
               it has power over the Hessian.  Here
               is why the Headless One has returned
               through the gate of the Tree of the
               Dead.  He chops heads until his own
               is restored to him.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               But what person... ?

                             ICHABOD
               A person who stands to gain by these
               murders.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, CHURCH -- DAY

     WAGONS, HORSES and TOWNSPEOPLE swarm.  A CROWD empties the town's
     general store.  Provisions are passed along, man to man, and loaded
     onto wheelbarrows.

     Ichabod and Young Masbath ride, passing MANY ANGRY FACES.

     All up and down the long straight road, home owners board up windows
     with lumber.

     Ichabod and Young Masbath stop, tying their horses in front of the
     "NOTARY." Ichabod looks off... 

     DOWN THE ROAD, people head to the CHURCH.  Much activity... 

                             ICHABOD
               Sanctuary.  Or, so they hope.

     People carry supplies into the church, within the bordering WROUGHT-
     IRON FENCE.  Others work to build and erect massive WOODEN CROSSES.

     In the crowd here, Reverend Steenwyck spots Ichabod and Young Masbath,
     pushes past people, shouting... 

                             STEENWYCK
               There he is!  There... !

     People begin to pay attention to Steenwyck as he climbs atop a crate,
     pointing toward Ichabod... 

                             STEENWYCK (CONT'D)
                     (to everyone)
               The desecrater of Christian burial!
               Twice he met the Horseman, and kept
               his head!  How is it so... ?

     AT THE NOTARY, Ichabod tries to ignore, heads inside, as a clod of
     earth hits him on the shoulder.

     IN THE CHURCHYARD, Steenwyck continues his rant.

                             STEENWYCK (CONT'D)
               The Devil protects his own!

     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY

     A small, untidy room with piles of dusty documents in great disorder.
     The Notary Hardenbrook looks at Ichabod with his one good eye.  Young
     Masbath stands near.

                             ICHABOD
               I take it, Mr. Hardenbrook, that
               wills and testaments are held here
               on public record?

     Hardenbrook is in a funk, trying to act calm.  He passes a document
     across the desk.

                             HARDENBROOK
               I believe this is what you wish to
               see.  Take it and go!

     Ichabod scans the will of Peter Van Garrett.

                             HARDENBROOK (CONT'D)
               Van Garrett Senior left his estate
               to his next of kin, that is to say,
               to his only son.  However, the son
               being murdered in the same
               instant... 

                             ICHABOD
               The next of kin after the son would
               be the eldest of the line from Van
               Garrett's father's sister... none
               other than the Baltus Van Tassel:
               something else no one thought to
               mention!

                             HARDENBROOK
               Well, you have found your way to it,
               and I hope you will leave now before
               my windows are boken.

     The crowd murmurs outside like angry bees.  Ichabod flourishes the
     will.

                             ICHABOD
               I am not ready to leave.

     Hardenbrook starts moaning and wringing his hands.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               A brick through your window is not
               what puts you in terror, Hardenbrook
               ... there is something else... I saw
               your fear, and Steenwyck's and the
               doctor's, when you met at Philipse's
               house... Philipse paid with his
               head, and you fear for your own.

                             HARDENBROOK
               Yes, it's true!  -- but we did not
               know it was a murdering plot when we
               were drawn in!

                             ICHABOD
               Drawn in by whom?!

                             HARDENBROOK
               Mercy upon me!  -- We meant no harm
               to come to her!

                             ICHABOD
               No harm to come to whom?

                             HARDENBROOK
                     (babbling)
               But the marriage made her next of
               kin... 

                             ICHABOD
               Made who next of kin to whom?!  --
               I'm confused!

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               He means old Van Garrett secretly
               married the Widow Winship.

                             ICHABOD
                     (getting it)
               Of course!  And Van Garrett made a
               new will, leaving everything to her
               and his unborn child... So she stood
               between Baltus and the legacy!  Where
               is the will?

                             HARDENBROOK
               I cannot be seen to help you -- the
               Horseman will come for me -- !

                             ICHABOD
               I will not leave without the very
               last will and testament of --

     Hardenbrook digs into a mountain of documents, hurling handfuls into
     the air... and flings the second will at Ichabod.  Young Masbath
     nervously checks the door.

                             HARDENBROOK
               Go, then!  I am a dead man!

     He starts to sob.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Sir... 

                             ICHABOD
                     (reading)
               Young Masbath... I know why your
               father died.  That night when Van
               Garrett quarreled with his son,
               Jonathan Masbath was summoned
               upstairs to witness the new Will.
               Here is your father's signature.  It
               was his death warrant.

     Young Masbath takes the document and looks at it tearfully.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               But the secret was not safe.  Mrs.
               Killian the midwife was forewarned
               the baby was coming -- and so she,
               too, had to die.

     One of the other hurled documents has fluttered down fortuitously in
     front of Ichabod.  He picks it up.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               The marriage certificate.  Parson
               Steenwyck married them.  Doctor
               Lancaster confirmed the widow was
               pregnant.  She told the secret to
               Magistrate Philipse.  Notary
               Hardenbrook concealed the
               documents... 

     Hardenbrook snivels and moans and wrings his hands.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               And you all kept silence!  Why?... 
               For some nameless dread of the man
               who stood to gain by it -- Baltus
               Van Tassel!

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, STAIRS -- DAY

     Ichabod and Young Masbath start up the stairs, noticing:

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- DAY

     Baltus, alone, with a glass of liquor, is brooding over an oak coffer
     of SILVER COINS, running coins through his fingers.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, STAIRS -- DAY

     Ichabod continues with Young Masbath, speaking quietly.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               I think there is some error in your
               reasoning... 

                             ICHABOD
                     (politely)
               Really?  Do give me the benefit of
               your... 

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               All these murders... just so that
               Baltus Van Tassel should inherit yet
               more land and property?

                             ICHABOD
               Precisely.  Men murder for profit.
               Possibly you don't know New York... ?

     Suddenly he sees his bedroom door is ajar.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- DAY

     Ichabod's entry surprises... Katrina, sitting at Ichabod's desk,
     reading his Ledger.

                             ICHABOD
               Katrina... why are you in my room?

                             KATRINA
                     (smiles)
               Because it is yours.  Is it wicked of
               me?

                             ICHABOD
               No... no... 

                             KATRINA
               I missed you.  Where did you go?

                             ICHABOD
               To the Notary... I had questions to
               ask Hardenbrook.

                             KATRINA
               And did you learn anything of
               interest?

     Ichabod and Young Masbath exchange a glance.

                             ICHABOD
               Well... perhaps.

                             KATRINA
               My father... 

                             ICHABOD
                     (jumps)
               Your father... ?

                             KATRINA
               Yes.  My father thinks you should
               return to New York.

                             ICHABOD
               Really?  Why is that?

                             KATRINA
                     (smiles)
               I don't know.  Perhaps he looked in
               your ledger and did not like what he
               saw... 

     She leaves the Ledger open on the desk.  Ichabod steps over to look.
     Young Masbath cranes his neck to look.  It is a page of doodles with
     the name "Katrina" written several times, and a sketch of Katrina.
     Embarrassed Ichabod closes the Ledger.

                             KATRINA (CONT'D)
               He believes townfolk and country do
               not mix.

     Ichabod opens the drawer in the desk and puts away the document he
     took from the Notary.

     He is nervous because he knows they point to complicity by Katrina's
     father.  Young Masbath, watching, understands this, Ichabod locks the
     drawer and pockets the key.

                             KATRINA (CONT'D)
               What have you there?

                             ICHABOD
               Evidence.  I'm sorry, I must ask
               your... 

                             KATRINA
               Then I will leave you to your
               thoughts.  Sleep well.

     Katrina leaves.  Ichabod is troubled.

     Then -- to add to his troubles -- he suddenly sees a HUGE SPIDER
     scuttling under his bed.  He doesn't like spiders, even small ones.  He
     gives a yelp.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               It's only a spider.

                             ICHABOD
               Where's it gone?  -- Where's it gone?
               Can you see it?

     Young Masbath crouches to look under the bed.  He frowns, puzzled.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               There's something under there... 

                             ICHABOD
               Kill it!  Kill it!
                     (getting a grip)
               No -- no... er... stun it... 

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Help me move the bed.

     Young Masbath and Ichabod move the bed.

                             YOUNG MASBATH (CONT'D)
               Look... 

     UNDER THE BED is revealed a strange PENTAGRAM drawn in chalk.

                             YOUNG MASBATH (CONT'D)
               The Evil Eye!

                             ICHABOD
               What... ?  What is... ?

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               It is someone casting spells against
               you.

                             ICHABOD
               The Evil Eye.

     The spider is sitting on the Pentagram.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Young Masbath, fully dressed, sleeps on the bed.  Ichabod sits waiting.
     He takes the cover off the lantern, looks at a CLOCK.  Midnight.

     Ichabod heara A DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE, then a CREAK on the stairs.  He
     lights a candle.  Then he goes to wake Young Masbath.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S DOOR -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Younng Masbath come out of the room.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath come down STAIRS with a lantern, cautious.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath cross, A CREAKING FLOORBOARD is HEARD from
     ANOTHER ROOM.  Ichabod quickly covers his lantern.

     Across the room, LIGHT comes under a DOOR, stops... continues.
     FOOTSTEPS are HEARD, then a DOOR OPENING and CLOSING.

     EXT.  FOREST BY VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     LANTERN LIGHT moves, far ahead.  Ichabod and Young Masbath follow,
     fearful, keeping hidden.

     EXT.  FOREST BY VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FARTHER ON (HILLSIDE) -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath stop on a hillside.

                             ICHABOD
               Wait here.

     Ichabod advances, up the hill... peers forward to see... 

     EXT.  FOREST CLEARING BY VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     The lantern sits on a rock.  On a blanket, a semi-naked MAN and semi-
     naked WOMAN are in the midst of rough SEX.

     Ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush.

     The couple keeps coupling, the MAN on top.  His grunts and gasps are
     particularly desperate.  He's all over the WOMAN, who lays back... it is
     LADY VAN TASSEL.

     Ichabod swallows.

     Lady Van Tassel pulls down the man's shirt, exposes his flesh.  She
     raises a small, sharp KNIFE behind his back.

     Ichabod's eyes widen.  He's about to shout a warning, but... 

     Lady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing deep into
     her palm.  Blood flows.  She rubs her cut hand over her partner's
     arching back, smearing blood.

     Lady Van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face... trailing blood.
     The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucking the woman's bloody fingers
     ... it's REVEREND STEENWYCK.

     Ichabod backs away, having seen more than enough.

     EXT.  FOREST BY VAN TASSEL ESTATE (HILLSIDE) -- NIGHT

     Ichabod returns to Young Masbath's side.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               What was there?

                             ICHABOD
               Something I wish I had not seen.  A
               beast with two backs.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
                     (wow!)
               A beast with... ?  What next in these
               bewitched woods?!

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Ichabod and Young Masbath enter.

     Ichabod sees that his desk drawer is slightly open.

     He opens the drawer knowing the worst.

     The documents have been taken.

     Masbath suddenly sniffs the air.  He signals to Ichabod, alert.  He
     shiffs again... and in the grate is the source of the smell: the
     documents burned to ashes.

     Ichabod, in despondency, brings his finger to his head, rubbing his
     temples.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- DAY

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               She will not see you.

     She is talking to Ichabod.  Her hand is loosely bandaged.

                             ICHABOD
               Did she say... anything?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Only that she will not come down.

                             ICHABOD
               I see.  Thank you.

     Ichabod turns to go.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Constable, you have not asked me how
               I hurt my hand since yesterday... 
               which would have been polite.  In
               fact you have been as careful not to
               look at it as not to mention it.

     She strips off the bandage to show a roughly sewn cut.

                             ICHABOD
               Yes -- I'm sorry... How did you... ?

     Lady Van Tassel GRABS Ichabod by the wrist, tight... 

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (whispering close)
               I know you saw me.

                             ICHABOD
               What... ?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               I know you followed last night.  You
               must promise not to tell my husband
               what you saw... promise me... 

     Ichabod tries to pull away, but she grips tighter.  The FRONT DOOR is
     HEARD SLAMMING.  Ichabod is panicky.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (CONT'D)
               Reverend Steenwyck has power over
               me.

                             ICHABOD
               P-p-power... ?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               He knows something terrible against
               my dear husband -- what you
               witnessed was the price of
               Steenwyck's silence.

                             ICHABOD
               What does Steenwyck know?

     Footsteps approach the door, the handle turns.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Later -- later... 

     She pulls away just as Baltus enters.

                             BALTUS
               The town is in a ferment.  Horror
               piled on tragedy -- Hardenbrook is
               dead -- strangled.

     Baltus goes straight to a flagon on the side table and lifts it to his
     lips.  Ichabod stares at Baltus's strong hands gripping the neck of the
     flagon.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Oh... !  That harmless old man?

                             BALTUS
               Hanged himself in the night!

                             ICHABOD
               Hanged himself?

                             BALTUS
               Reverend Steenwyck has called a
               meeting at the church -- tonight.
               Every man, woman and child.
                     (to Ichabod)
               He will speak against you -- if you
               are wise you will be gone from here.
               Steenwyck's congregation is already
               halfway to being a mob.

                             ICHABOD
               I will go when I have done what I
               came to do.

     Lady Van Tassel comes to calm her husband.  Baltus notices her wound.

                             BALTUS
               What is this?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               I was careless with the kitchen
               knife --

                             BALTUS
               The wound looks angry --

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               I'll bind it later with wild
               arrowroot flowers -- I know where
               I'll find some.  Will you ride with
               me?

     Ichabod slips silently out of the room.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, STAIRS -- DAY

     Ichabod goes up the stairs.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY

     Ichabod knocks quietly at Katrina's door.  No answer.  He quietly opens
     the door.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KATRINA'S ROOM -- DAY

     Katrina's bed has been slept in but it's empty and she is not there.

     But in the grate there is the telltale heap of charred paper and ash,
     recognizable as Ichabod's documents.

     A sound at the door makes him whip around.  It is Young Masbath.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               I saw her riding away towards the
               old pasture.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- DAY

     A small PILE of STRAW burns.  GLOVED HANDS unfold a paper filled with
     HAIR CLIPPINGS, which are sprinkled on the fire.

     A cloaked FIGURE kneels at the pile.  This person removes a HUMAN SKULL
     from a cloth bag.

     The skull is placed at center in the flames.  It's teeth are sharp, cut
     to points -- the HORSEMAN'S SKULL.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- FIELDS -- DAY

     Ichabod rides Gunpowder, approaching the Ruined Cottage.  He finds
     Katrina crouched over the hearthstone.  Her horse grazes.  She hears his
     horse and turns.

                             ICHABOD
               Katrina... 

     Ichabod dismounts.  Katrina had made a small fire.  She is "doing
     magic." Mumbling.  She turns to look at Ichabod in anger and tears.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
                     (sympathetically)
               You took the papers and burned
               them... ?

                             KATRINA
               So that you would not have them to
               accuse my father... !

                             ICHABOD
               I... I accuse no one... but if there
               is guilt I cannot alter it no matter
               how much it grieves me... and no
               spells of yours can alter it
               either... 

                             KATRINA
               If you knew my father you would not
               have such harsh thoughts about him
               -- no, nor if you felt anything for
               me!

                             ICHABOD
                     (in torment)
               I am pinioned by a chain of
               reasoning!  Why else did his four
               friends conspire to conceal... ?

                             KATRINA
               You are the Constable, not I -- so
               find another chain of reasoning and
               let me be.

                             ICHABOD
               I cannot -- not the one or the
               other.  I am heartsick with it.

                             KATRINA
               I think you have no heart -- and I
               had a mind once to give you mine.

     Katrina mounts her horse, which rears up.  She is momentarily like a
     female warrior, her eyes ablaze with anger and tears.

                             ICHABOD
                     (cries out)
               Yes -- I think you loved me that day
               when you followed me into the
               Western Woods!  -- to have braved
               such peril!

                             KATRINA
                     (scornfully)
               What peril was there for me if it
               was my own father who controlled the
               Headless Horseman?!  Good-bye,
               Ichabod Crane!  I curse the day you
               came to Sleepy Hollow!

     Ichabod watches her gallop away and hides his anguished face for
     comfort in Gunpowder's neck.

     EXT.  FIELD AND COPSE -- EVENING

     A distant bell is tolling as Baltus waits on his horse... watching
     where Lady Van Tassel can be glimpsed among the spaced trees gathering
     "arrowroot flowers."

                             BALTUS
                     (calls out)
               Come.  Hurry up!  The meeting bell has
               started toning.

     He looks anxiously toward the vinage, then back to the trees... where
     to his horror he sees... the Headless Horseman moves slowly toward Lady
     Van Tassel, calmly unsheathing his sword.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, CHURCH -- NIGHT

     People are entering the Church while the bell tolls them in... watched
     grimly by Steenwyck.

     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW TOWN SQUARE, CHURCH -- NIGHT

     More people are heading toward the Church.  In the shadows, Ichabod,
     hatted and cloaked to make himself look anonymous, also watches the
     people going by... and sees Katrina among them.

     Baltus comes charging through the TOWN SQUARE on his horse.

                             BALTUS
               The Horseman... !

     Baltus is barely hanging on.  He stops, falling off his horse,
     scrambling toward Katrina, who is not far from Ichabod.

                             BALTUS (CONT'D)
               Save me... 

                             KATRINA
               Father... ?

                             BALTUS
               He killed her... 

     Baltus grasps Katrina, deathly afraid.

                             BALTUS (CONT'D)
               The Horseman has killed your
               stepmother!

     HOOFBEATS are HEARD... the SCREECHY CRY of Daredevil.  Baltus looks... 

     The Horseman rides into view, giving chase... 

     Instant mayhem -- the few people in the churchyard flee, heading for
     the Church... 

     Baltus runs toward the Church... 

                             KATRINA
               Father!

     Katrina chases after Baltus.  Ichabod now sees that his "case" is
     falling apart.  He and Young Masbath start running to the Church.

     INT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     The GATHERERS in the pews react to the commotion, shouting, some
     running to the windows... to the doors... 

     EXT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Baltus pushes through the IRON GATE, across the churchyard, bounding
     up the stairs... Katrina following him.

     The Horseman rides behind... 

     Ichabod, with Masbath, follow into the churchyard.  Ichabod glances
     back... 

                             ICHABOD
                     (to Young Masbath)
               I know what you are thinking.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               It seems Baltus Van Tassel is not
               the one who controls the Horseman.

     As the Horseman reaches the open gate, Daredevil rears up violently,
     snorting, unwilling to enter.

     INT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Baltus makes his way into the church, shoving people aside.

     Men pass RIFLES from stockpiles and climb onto pews at the boarded
     windows.  Women herd children into a cellar.

     Baltus searches for a hiding place, moves toward the back... 

     Katrina moves through, following Baltus... 

     At the front of the Church, Ichabod squeezes in just as the front
     doors are forced shut.  Ichabod surveys the madness... 

     Ichabod runs to a window, looking out between boards... 

     EXT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     At the church yard gates, the Horseman grabs Daredevils reins, tries
     to move forward again.  Same result -- Daredevil freaks.

     The Horseman gives his AXE an underhand toss... to the ground inside
     the gate... 

     The axe instantly BEGINS TO DEGRADE -- like dust in the rain.

     The Horseman steers away, keeping outside the fence.

     INT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Ichabod comes away from the window, looking to the mass of panicked
     citizens.  He sees Katrina pushing up the aisle... she's heading toward
     Baltus.

     Katrina turns to Ichabod, her face aflame with accusation.

     Ichabod is humbled, desperate to make it up -- but Katrina runs toward
     ... the Altar, where she prostrates herself, evidently in a paroxysm of
     despair.

     RIFLES BOOM LOUDLY as men at the windows begin FIRING... 

     EXT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     The Horseman circles, under fire.

     Great clouds of gun smoke shoot from the Church.

     Men fire down from the belfry.

     Parts of the Horseman and Daredevil splatter red as slugs hit, without
     effect.

     At the other side of the Church... 

     The Horseman circles, heading to the town square... 

     INT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Riflemen shout to each other, running to the opposite windows to
     follow the Horseman.

     Young Masbath grabs a rifle, leaps to join the brigade.

     Baltus is trying to force his way to one of the cellar doors, when
     Steenwyck grips him angrily, SHOVES him... 

                             STEENWYCK
               You'll kill us all... !

     Baltus stumbles back, topples pews.

                             STEENWYCK (CONT'D)
               You're the one the Horseman wants.

     Steenwyck grabs Baltus, dragging him to the front.

     Ichabod's pushing past people, trying to get to them.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, CHURCH -- NIGHT

     The Horseman brings Daredevil to a halt, yanks a large coil of ROPE
     off a hitching post, turns to ride back... 

     INT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Baltus pulls free from Steenwyck, falls to the floor again.

                             STEENWYCK
               Why should we die for you?  Get out!

     Others join the rage, pulling Baltus toward the front of the Church,
     shouting.  Ichabod joins in, struggling to push people off of Baltus... 

                             ICHABOD
               Stop this... !

     Ichabod gets to Baltus's side, trying to protect.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               The Horseman cannot enter!  It does
               not matter who he wants, he cannot
               cross the gate... !

     At the windows, ONE RIFLEMAN cries out.

                             ONE RIFLEMAN
               He's coming back!

     More panic.  Steenwyck points toward Baltus.

                             STEENWYCK
               We have to save ourselves... !

     Baltus pulls the PISTOL from Ichabod's holster... 

                             BALTUS
               No!  Unhand me!  Stand off... !

     Baltus brandishes the gun.  Everyone backs off.

     EXT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     The Horseman rides past the front, fired upon... 

     The Horseman halts along a length of the wrought gate, reaches... yanks
     off one IRON POST, which is pointed on top, like an arrow head.

     INT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Baltus holds everyone away with the pistol, enraged... 

                             BALTUS
               The next person to lay hands on me
               will have a bullet.

     Doctor Lancaster, who so far has just been one of the crowd, now
     pushes his way between Steenwyck and Baltus.

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
               Enough have died already!
                     (to Steenwyck
                     meaningfully)
               It is time to confess our sins and
               ask God to forgive our trespasses!

                             STEENWYCK
               Don't be a fool!  I warn you, Doctor
               Lancaster -- !

                             BALTUS
                     (to Doctor Lancaster)
               What is it that you know?

                             DOCTOR LANCASTER
                     (to Baltus)
               Your four friends played you false.
               We were devilishly possessed by one
               who --

     That's as far as he gets before Steenwyck wrenches a heavy ornate
     CROSS from the wall and smashes his skull with a blow of tremendous
     force, with the Cross.

     Baltus FIRES -- blasts a bloody hole in Steenwyck's stomach... !

     Everyone backs farther away as Steenwyck falls.  Steenwyck lays
     gasping, eyes huge.  He tries crawl... 

     Katrina rises to her feet and stands; staring wide-eyed at the horror.
     Ichabod moves toward her.

     Steenwyck lays still with a bloody gurgle, face down.  Baltus looks to
     all the horrified people around him.

                             BALTUS
               There is conspiracy here!  And I will
               seek it out!

     CRASH!  -- the IRON POST comes SPEARING through a window, trailing
     rope... 

     CRACK -- SKEWERS Baltus from behind: its bloodied point bursting out
     through his breastbone... 

     Baltus gasps, stunned... he drops the gun, looks down to clutch the
     post.  Blood streams out of his mouth.

     Ichabod catches Katrina as she swoons.  Horrorstruck, he hugs her... and
     thus notices that hanging on a ribbon around her neck is the little
     carved bauble taken from the neck of the dead Crone.  Almost at the
     same time, Ichabod sees that on the flagstones where Katrina was lying
     there is now a "Drawing" done in chalk, identical to the "Evil Eye"
     drawing he found under his bed.

                             ICHABOD
                     (gasps)
               The Evil Eye again!

     At that moment, a piece of White Chalk falls from Katrina's senseless
     hand.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Oh God... .it was you!

     The full horrible implication of this hits Ichabod just as:

     The rope tied to the post suddenly YANKS Baltus backward with
     incredibleforce -- SLAMS him into the WINDOW... 

     EXT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Baltus CRASHES backward through the window, hits the ground,
     DRAGGED... 

     OUTSIDE THE FENCE, the Horseman rides Daredevil away from the church,
     with the rope tied around Daredevil's saddle pommel... 

     Baltus SLAMS the fence.  The rope SNAPS.  Baltus is held there
     awkwardly, gurgling blood.

     INT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Ichabod, holding Katrina, cries out --

                             ICHABOD
               Oh... Katrlna... Oh God, forgive
               her... 

     EXT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT

     The Horseman turns Daredevil, riding back... his sword raised high... 

     ... he chops off Baltus's head.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Katrina lies insensible in her bed... the ribbon with the bauble around
     her neck.

     Ichabod stands watching her, alone with his grief and his appalling
     "secret."

                             ICHABOD
               It was an evil spirit possessed you.
               I pray God it is satisfied now, and
               that you find peace.  Good-bye,
               Katrina.  The Evil Eye has done its
               work.  My life is over -- spared for
               a lifetime of horrors in my sleep,
               waking each day to grief.

     Ichabod leaves the room, closing the door.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN, PORCH AND LAWN -- DAWN

     Ichabod, watch only by Young Masbath, stands by a FIRE burning in a
     CIRCLE of ROCKS nearby.  He has his Ledger.  After a moment, he throws
     the LEDGER onto the fire.  The pages catch quickly.

     He opens his satchel and digs out a BOOK.  His luggage is packed on the
     porch.

     He walks back to the fire, looks at the book in his hand, the book
     Katrina gave him.  He stands staring down.

     A DECREPIT COACH is arriving.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN, PORCH AND LAWN -- DAY

     The decrepit COACH, with Gunpowder as one of its team, waits, loaded
     with Ichabod's baggage.

     Van Ripper, the driver, helps Ichabod with strapping the load.  Young
     Masbath watches, not helping.

     Ichabod turns to Young Masbath.

     Angry tears come to Young Masbath's eyes.  The farewell is like an
     argument.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               But who will look for the truth when
               you have gone?

                             ICHABOD
               There is no more truth to be found.
               That is why I can go and leave this
               wretched place behind me.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               You think it was Katrina, don't you?

     Ichabod clamps his hand over Young Masbath's mouth.  He looks intently
     into his eyes.

                             ICHABOD
               That can never be uttered.  Never.

     Ichabod takes his hand away.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               A strange sort of witch!  -- with a
               kind and loving heart!  How can you
               think so?

                             ICHABOD
               I have a good reason.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Then you are bewitched by reason.

                             ICHABOD
               I am beaten down by it!  It's a hard
               lesson for a hard world, and you had
               better learn it, Young Masbath --
               villainy wears many masks, none so
               dangerous as the mask of virtue.
               Farewell!

     Van Ripper climbs onto the coach.  Ichabod looks to the Manor House.
     Only one light shines, in a SECOND FLOOR WINDOW.

     lchabod climbs into the coach.

     INT.  VAN RIPPER'S COACH -- DAY

     INSIDE THE COACH, Ichabod slumps.  He pounds twice on the coach wall.

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FRONT LAWN -- DAY

     OUTSIDE, Van Ripper whips the reins.  The coach starts.  Young Masbath
     watches, wiping tears.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KATRINA'S ROOM -- DAY

     Katrina wakes.  She hears the Coach Wheels.  She gets up from the bed
     and goes to the window.  Her POV shows the Coach leaving... Katrina's
     face shows that her world has collapsed around her.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, CHURCH -- DAY

     Van Ripper's coach crosses the covered bridge... past the town square
     ... past the church.

     Near Doctor Lancaster's house, the coach passes a flat cart... on
     which lies the headless corpse of Lady Van Tassel.  Ichabod looks at
     the corpse and he notes the gashed palm of one dead hand.

     The cart is being pulled at a walking pace by a single horse.  The CART
     MAN walking, holding the bridle.

     The cart man pauses, seeing a RIDER approaching, traveling in the same
     direction as Ichabod's coach.

     Ichabod realizes that the rider is Katrina.  He looks from the coach
     window and sees Katrina get down from the horse and go to the cart.

     Ichabod pulls back from his window and closes his eyes.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY

     Young Masbath enters, looks around the empty room.  He goes to sit,
     crosses his arms on the desk and lays down his head.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- DAY

     Katrina enters.  She crosses, slumps in a chair, staring into the
     burning fireplace

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, VARIOUS ROOMS -- POV -- DAY

     A POV MOVES SLOWLY THROUGH THE HOUSE; SOMEONE'S searching various
     rooms... 

     INT VAN RIPPER'S COACH -- DAY

     Ichabod opens his satchel, takes out a bottle of water and gulps from
     it.  In replacing the bottle, he finds... the Book given him by Katrina.
     He opens the book.  There is a DIAGRAM DRAWING on a whole page.  Ichabod
     recognizes... the "Drawing" of the supposed "Evil Eye," identical to
     the two we have seen before.  But what gets Ichabod's real attention is
     the bold "headline."

     The Headline over the Picture is "For The Protection of A Loved One
     Against Evil Spirits."

     Ichabod gasps, and mutters the words aloud.

     What a fool he's been!

                             ICHABOD
                     (to himself)
               But then, who... ?

     He is puzzled.  He stares at his open palms.  The scars on his palms
     trigger a thought... 

     Then he understands: something we will soon understand.

     He slides the front window panel to shout through it.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Van Ripper, turn the coach... !

                             VAN RIPPER
               What?

                             ICHABOD
               Turn around, now!

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, VARIOUS ROOMS, PARLOR -- POV -- EVENING

     SOMEONE still moves through the house, a TRAVELING POV -- moving
     through ROOMS on the ground floor... 

     Stopping at the doorway of the PARLOR, looking to where Katrina is
     seated across the room.

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- EVENING

     Mrs. Lancaster comes to answer BANGING on the door.  She opens the door
     and Ichabod pushes past, satchel in hand, taking Mrs. Lancaster's
     lantern.

                             ICHABOD
               Pardon my intrusion... 

     There are TWO COFFINS on the floor.

     Ichabod throws off the lids from the coffins, looking to the headless
     BODIES of BALTUS and LADY VAN TASSEL.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- INTERCUT -- EVENING

     Katrina still sits, her eyes closed.  A FIGURE in BLACK moves forward
     in the darkness behind... 

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- INTERCUT -- EVENING

     Ichabod goes to lift Lady Van Tassel's hand with the GASH on its palm,
     bends to study... pulling at the sewn wound -- pulling the stitches
     apart between his thumbs... 

     Mrs. Lancaster watches.

     INT.  VAN TASSEL H0USE, PARLOR -- INTERCUT -- EVENING

     Katrina hears a BOARD CREAK.  She sits up, turning... 

                             KATRTNA
               Who is it?

     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- INTERCUT -- EVENING

     Ichabod releases the corpse's hand, tears off his spectacles, shaken
     by the realization... 

                             ICHABOD
               No bloodflow, no clotting, no
               healing... When this cut was made... 
               this woman was already dead.

     Ichabod grabs his satchel, bolts out the door... 

     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- INTERCUT -- EVENING

     The FIGURE moves closer in darkness... 

                             KATRINA
               Who is there... ?

     The FIGURE comes into the dim, flickering fire light... Lady Van
     Tassel.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Dear step daughter... 

     Katrina stands, terrified, trying to form words... Lady Van Tassel
     cackles like a witch.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (CONT'D)
               You look as if you've seen a ghost.

     Katrina's eyes roll up as she FAINTS dead away to the floor.

     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod runs out from the DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, leaps up onto the empty
     coach, pushing Van Ripper's rifle aside.  Van Ripper's urinating
     against the side of the building.

                             VAN RIPPER
               Be with you in a minute, Constable.

     Ichabod whips the horses, driving the coach away.

     Van Ripper frowns in confusion.

     INT.  THE WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The interior of the windmill is large and shadowy, with lots of old
     junk, clutter, machinery, boxes, etc.

     Katrina lies unconscious.  Lady Van Tassel comes to cut off a clump of
     Katrina's hair with SCISSORS, grinning as she does it.

     A CONJURING PILE has been prepared, containing a small ANIMAL'S HEART
     with an iron NAIL through it.  Lady Van Tassel adds Katrina's hair,
     lights the pile off a lantern.

     Lady Van Tassel WHISPERS over the fire.  She looks to Katrina, who
     stirs.

     Lady Van Tassel takes the HORSEMAN'S SKULL from a bag over her
     shoulder, places it in the flames.  THUNDER is HEARD.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
                     (whispers and chants)
               Rise up once more, my Dark Avenger!
               -- Rise up! -- One more night of
               Beheading! -- Rise up with your
               sword, and your Mistress of the
               night will make you whole -- a head
               for a head, my unholy Horseman --
               rise -- rise -- rise from the earth,
               come forth again through the Tree of
               the Dead... come now for... Katrina!

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT

     The WIND scatters dead leaves.  The TWISTED TREE OPENS WIDE with a
     RUMBLE -- SHAFTS of LIGHT shooting out.

     EXT.  THE ROAD TO VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT

     Ichabod drives the coach hard ahead.

     INT.  THE WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Katrina sits up, groggy, looking around... sees the dying fire, and
     Lady Van Tassel watching her.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Awake at last.  Did you think it was
               all a nasty dream?  Alas, no.

                             KATRINA
               My father saw the Horseman kill
               you... 

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               He saw the Horseman coming to me
               with his sword unsheathed!  But it is
               I who govern the Horseman, my dear,
               and Baltus did not stay to see.

                             KATRINA
               But there was your body!

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               The servantgirl, Sarah, I always
               thought her useless, but she turned,
               out useful.  Tomorrow I'll totter out
               of the woods and spin a tale how I
               found Baltus and Sarah in the act of
               lust... as I watched, the Horseman
               was upon them, and off went Sarah's
               head!  I fainted and remember nothing
               more... 

                             KATRINA
               Who are you?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               My family name was... Archer.

                             KATRINA
                     (remembering the cottage
                     hearth)
               The Archer... 

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               I lived with my father and mother
               and my sister in a gamekeeper's
               cottage not far from here... 

The conversation is being heard by a MOVING POV among the shadows.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (CONT'D)
               Until one day, my father died, and
               the landlord who received many years
               of loyal service from my parents... 
               evicted us.  No one in this God-
               fearing town would take us in... 
               
     The MOVING POV stops, spying from behind the clutter.  The REVERSE SHOT
     reveals YOUNG MASBATH, holding his breath.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (CONT'D)
               ... because my mother was suspected
               of witchcraft... 

     Young Masbath looks about for a weapon.  His eyes alight on a large
     Wooden Mallet.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (CONT'D)
               She was no witch, but I believe she
               knew much that lies under the
               surface of life... and she schooled
               her daughters well while we lived as
               outcasts in the Western Woods.  She
               died within a year... and my sister
               and I remained in our refuge, seeing
               not a soul... until, gathering
               firewood one day, we crossed the
               path of the Hessian... 

     FLASHBACK -- FOREST BATTLEFIELD (WESTERN WOODS) -- DAY

     The Hessian Horseman (avec head) has happened upon TWO YOUNG GIRLS
     gathering firewood.  The girls stand frozen at the sight of him, till
     one girl drops her firewood and runs... 

     The second girl remains, holding the Horseman's gaze.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               I saw his death, and from that
               moment... 

     FLASHBACK -- FOREST BATTLEFIELD (WESTERN WOODS) -- DAY

     The Girl watches the burial of the Horseman... and his Head dropped
     into the grave.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               ... I offered my soul to Satan if he
               would raise the Hessian from the
               grave to avenge me.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath, unseen, works his way quietly around behind Lady Van
     Tassel.

                             KATRINA
               Avenge you?

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Against Van Garrett, who evicted my
               family, against Baltus Van Tassel
               who, with wife and simpering
               girlchild, stole our home.  I swore I
               would make myself mistress of all
               they had... 
                     (she cackles again)
               The easiest part was the first -- to
               enter your house as your mother's
               sick nurse and put her body into the
               grave, and my own into the marriage
               bed.

     Katrina cries out in horror.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (CONT'D)
               Not quite so easy was to secure my
               legacy... but lust delivered Reverend
               Steenwyck into my power.  Fear did
               the same for the Notary Hardenbrook.
               The drunken Philipse succumbed for a
               share of the proceeds, and the
               Doctor's silence I exchanged for my
               complicity in his fornications... 

     Masbath moves into the open, weapon raised.  Katrina sees him and
     stifles a gasp.

                             KATRINA
                     (keeping Lady Van
                     Tassel's attention)
               Yes!  -- you have everything now.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               No, my dear -- you do, by your
               father's will.  But I get everything
               in the event of your death.
                     (she cackles again)
               
     Lady Van Tassel's hand reaches for the Mystic Bauble on Katrina's
     neck.  She rips it free.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (CONT'D)
                     (as she does so)
               This pretty bauble, which I so
               kindly gave you to wear, has done
               it's work.  My sister, by the way,
               sadly passed away... 

     FLASHBACK -- OUTSIDE CRONE'S CAVE HOME -- DAY

     The Crone falls to the ground outside her cave, unconscious, beaten
     and bloodied.

     A hand -- Lady Van Tassel's hand -- enters FRAME to haul the Crone up
     by the hair, and WE SEE the Crone's bloodied features face to face
     with the wicked smile of Lady Van Tassel.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               ... quite recently.

     FLASHBACK -- OUTSIDE CRONE'S CAVE HOME -- DAY

     Lady Van Tassel holds a SWORD high, SWINGS DOWN... Then we see the
     separated Head and Torso... and the severed CORD, which had been around
     the Crone's neck... and Lady Van Tassel's Hand reaching for the Mystic
     Bauble, which had fallen free.

     INT.  WINDMILL NIGHT

     Young Masbath is about ready to bring the mallet down upon Lady Van
     Tassel's head.

                             KATRINA
                     (keeping Lady Van
                     Tassel's attention)
               It was the Crone you killed... your
               own sister... 

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               She brought it upon herself... 

     Like a whiplash, Lady Van Tassel turns cackling at Young Masbath --
     she sensed him by witchery!

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (CONT'D)
                     (to Young Masbath)
               -- by helping you and your master!

     Young Masbath shrieks and drops the mallet.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (CONT'D)
               You are just in time to have your
               head sliced off!

     Katrina and Young Masbath run to each other for mutual comfort.

     LIGHTNING BRIGHTENS the forest.  Lady Van Tassel looks up.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (CONT'D)
               The Horseman comes.  And tonight he
               comes for you!

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- NIGHT

     The Horseman rides Daredevil, a freight train of moldering flesh... 

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Katrina and Young Masbath are holding hands, scared.

     Lady Van Tassel picks up the Horseman's skull in her gloved hand and
     puts up her face and gives out a long animal howl.  Distantly,
     Daredevil is heard answering with a scream.

     Katrina and Young Masbath run.  Lady Van Tassel has need to stop them.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Run!  There is no escape!

     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PORCH AND LAWN -- NIGHT

     Ichabod leaps from the coach, bounds up porch stairs... 

                             ICHABOD
               Katrina!

     Ichabod stops, sees FIRELIGHT at the Windmill.  He runs... leaps back up
     to the coach and takes off... 

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     THUNDER BOOMS.  WIND HOWLS.  Lady Van Tassel stands in the doorway with
     the skull in one hand, laughing.

     EXT.  AROUND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Katrina and Young Masbath break out into the open.  Ichabod drives
     toward them... 

                             KATRINA
               Ichabod!

     Ichabod meets them, halts the coach and jumps down (as the coach
     horses trot away), running to put his arms around Katrina and Young
     Masbath... 

                             ICHAB0D
               Thank God... 

     Lady Van Tassel's mad laughter is heard.  Ichabod and Katrina turn
     as... 

     Lady Van Tassel rides from around the windmill on her white horse.  She
     shrieks with laughter.

     ALONG THE TREELINE, the Horseman breaks into the open... Hell on
     horseback -- full speed ahead... 

                             LADY VAN TASSEL (0.S.)
               Have you come back to arrest him
               after all?!

     Ichabod thinks fast, moving to the windmill, leading Katrina and Young
     Masbath along with him.

                             ICHABOD
               Quickly... !

     Behind, wind tosses Lady Van Tassel's dress and hair.  She holds the
     Horseman's skull high.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Mind your hat, Constable!

     Young Masbath scurries up the ladder and in.

     Katrina's next.  Ichabod looks behind... The Horseman is almost upon
     them.

     Ichabod follows Katrina, pulling himself up.  The Horseman arrives,
     dismounting, moving forward... 

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Ichabod leaps up, lifts the heavy trap door on its hinges, slams it.
     The door is POUNDED from outside, buckling.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               It won't hold.

     Ichabod goes to a large GRINDSTONE against a wall.  He struggles to
     roll it... 

     Young Masbath helps him roll it to the trapdoor.  It falls on top with
     a THUD.  Masbath jumps back as the Horseman's sword jabs up through the
     grindstone's center hole.

     The sword withdraws.  POUNDING begins anew.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman chops at the door with his axe.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     POUNDING CONTINUES, Katrina and Young Masbath back away.  Ichabod holds
     his lantern up, desperate for ideas, searching.

     Above, to the right, is the high MILLING PLATFORM, where grain is
     ground and bagged, and a ladder leading to it.  To the left is the
     crooked, open STAIRCASE.

     Ichabod picks up a BAILING HOOK, a plan forming.  He gives his lantern
     to Katrina and points.

                             ICHABOD
               Get up these stairs.  Open the door
               to the roof and wait.

     Katrina and Young Masbath obey, heading left.  Ichabod crosses to the
     right, starts climbing the ladder to the milling platform... 

     On the platform, Ichabod grasps a wooden lever, pulling it.

     The entire windmill CREAKS and GROANS as massive GEARS and
     COUNTERWHEELS above begin to turn.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The windmill's rotors slowly begin spinning.

     UNDER THE WINDMILL, the Horseman keeps chopping... 

     His axe exposes grindstone, throwing sparks.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Katrina looks down from the stairway.  The POUNDING on the trap door
     causes the grindstone to jump.

                             KATRINA
               Ichabod... 

                             ICHABOD
               Keep climbing.  I will follow... 
                     (under his breath)
               Hopefully.

     Ichabod drags large BAGS of GRAIN, lining them up at the edge of the
     milling platform.

     ABOVE, Young Masbath throws open the door to the roof.

     BELOW, Ichabod uses the bailing hook to cut holes into the grain bags,
     so that MILLED GRAIN SPILLS out and falls to the floor, creating
     clouds of grain dust.

     Ichabod grabs one open bag, dumps it.

     He slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system, pushes it so it
     swings in circles, grain flooding out... 

     More and more DUST RISES, filling the air... 

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

     Masbath and Katrina come out.  Rotors spin behind them.

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The GRINDSTONE blocking the trap door FALLS THROUGH as wood splinters
     and gives.  A moment, then the Horseman climbs in.

                             KATRINA
                     (looking in from above)
               Behind you!

     Ichabod looks down, sees the Horseman, then looks to the staircase
     adjacent from the high platform.  He runs... 

     He LEAPS across the space between the platform and stairs... 

     Ichabod grasps the outer rail of the staircase, hanging on, pulls
     himself up onto the stairs... 

     Below, the Horseman moves through clouds of billowing dust, runs and
     LEAPS, incredibly high... 

     The Horseman grasps a hanging chain, swinging, his momentum carrying
     him in a wide arc... 

     Above, Ichabod runs upstairs, to the roof door.

     The Horseman's weight swings him toward the stairwell... 

     He releases the chain... airborne momentarily... 

     The Horseman lands high up on the stairwell.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

     Katrina and Young Masbath help Ichabod onto the roof.

                             KATRINA
               Quickly, close it!

                             ICHABOD
               No... 

     Ichabod takes the lantern from Katrina.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
                     (points)
               Get to the crest of the roof and be
               ready to jump.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Jump?  From up here?!

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman clomps upstairs, axe in hand.

     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NlGHT

     Ichabod shepherds Katrina and Young Masbath to the edge, where the
     rotors spin close.

                             ICHABOD
               Jump for the sails!  Wait till I give
               the word!

                             KATRINA
               Ichabod!... I can't... 

                             ICHABOD
               Yes, you can, my love -- hand in
               hand... 

     Ichabod moves back to the trap door.

     Katrina and Young Masbath look at the rotors, and down at the long
     distance between them and the ground.

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Be ready... 

     Ichabod DROPS the LANTERN into the windmill and runs... 

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Now!

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The Horseman continues up.  The lantern falls past... 

     EXT.  WINDMILL, ROOF -- NIGHT

     Young Masbath jumps.  Ichabod grips Katrina, jumps... 

     They hit one rotor, gripping the frame and cloth as the rotor begins
     its DOWNWARD TURN... 

     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The lantern hits the ground and shatters -- FLAMES EXPLODE!

     Throughout the windmill's interior, grain dust is consumed
     instantaneously -- FLAMES ROAR upward... 

     FLAMES engulf the Horseman... 

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     The rotor is halfway to its lowest point.  Masbath, Katrina and Ichabod
     hang on as the ENTIRE STRUCTURE TREMBLES... 

     Flames shoot out windows, doors and seams!

     On the rotor, Ichabod struggles to keep a grip on Katrina.  Masbath
     drops.  Ichabod and Katrina fall... 

     They all hit the ground.  Ichabod rolls over, gasping, holding his
     shoulders, getting to his feet... 

     Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath run away as smoldering debris rains
     down.

     EXT.  ACROSS THE FIELD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod ushers them along as they run, heading uphill.  Lightning
     flashes across the sky.  THUNDER RUMBLES.

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     Behind, the WINDMILL begins to CRUMBLE, huge burning sections crashing
     to the ground.

     EXT.  ACROSS THE FIELD -- NIGHT

     Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath slow, looking back at the
     incredible conflagration.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Is he dead?

                             ICHABOD
               He was dead to start with -- that's
               the problem.

                             KATRINA
               Look... 

     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT

     IN THE WINDMILL RUBBLE, the Horseman RISES, shoving off burning
     debris.  His flame-ravaged uniform smolders.

     EXT.  ACROSS THE FIELD -NIGHT

     Ichabod spins, searching for possibilities... He spots the COACH and
     HORSES not too far away... 

                             ICHABOD
               Come on!

     They flee toward the coach.  Behind... 

     Daredevil rides to rejoin the Horseman.

     EXT.  THE ROAD FROM VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT

     The coach hits the long straight road, rumbling at top speed away from
     the Van Tassel Estate, into the forest... 

     Katrina and Masbath hold on as the coach shakes violently.

                             KATRINA
               Where are we going?

                             ICHABOD
               Anywhere!

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               He's right behind!

     Behind on the trail, the Horseman chases, closing fast.

                             KATRINA
               Make for the church!

                             ICHABOD
               We'll never reach it!

     Young Masbath grabs Ichabod's satchel, offers it... 

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Here, sir... you must have something
               in your bag of tricks.

                             ICHABOD
               Nothing that will help us, I am
               afraid.  Take the reins... 

     Young Masbath takes them.  Ichabod gives Van Ripper's rifle to Katrina,
     then crawls back across the coach roof.

     Ichabod gets to a baggage area at the rear, struggling to open a
     storage box.

     Behind, the Horseman draws his sword, closer.

     Ichabod opens the box and pulls out a jagged HAND SAW.

                             KATRINA
               Look out... !

     Ichabod looks.  The Horseman rides up, SWINGS his sword... 

     Ichabod recoils -- THWACK -- just missed.

     The Horseman lets the coach get ahead, shifting to the other side of
     the trail... coming along side again... 

     Ichabod backpedals, looking to Masbath.

                             ICHABOD
               Keep him off!  Block him!

     Masbath guides the horses over.  The Horseman must fall behind to avoid
     the wheels.

     One wheel hits a large rock... 

     Ichabod bounces, falling, drops the saw... 

     He hangs off the side of the coach.

     The saw clatters away on the trail.

     Ichabod tries for better purchase.  He grips the coach door.

     Katrina climbs to offer her hand.

                             KATRINA
               Take my hand!

     Ichabod reaches to her, but the coach door falls open... 

     Ichabod's PISTOL falls from the holster and is lost on the trail.

     Ichabod clings helplessly to the door as branches slam him.

     EXT.  BEHIND THE TRAIL

     The Horseman gets to his feet.  Ahead, Daredevil stands waiting, giving
     a SCREECH.

     EXT.  AHEAD ON THE TRAIL NEAR THE TREE OF THE DEAD

     Katrina and Ichabod rejoin Mashath, climb off the coach to examine the
     ruined wheel, panicked.

                             ICHABOD
               This is not good.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               We're doomed.

                             ICHABOD
               We have to get out of the open
               somehow.  Quick, follow me... 

     They turn to run, but suddenly falter, seeing... Riding over the crest
     of the hill, comes Lady Van Tassel, on her white horse, with Ichahod's
     lost pistol in her hand... 

     EXT.  NEAR FOREST -- NIGHT

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               What?  Still alive?!

     Across the distance, the Horseman strides in this direction.

                             ICHABOD
               Run, Katrina... 

     Lady Van Tassel points her gun at Katrina.

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               Yes, do run.  And jump.  And skip.
                     (she takes aim)
               And now let's see a somersault!

                             ICHABOD
               Run!

     Ichahod makes a move toward Lady Van Tassel, but Lady Van Tassel aims
     and FIRES -- shoots Ichahod in the chest!  Ichahod goes down... 

                             KATRINA
               No!

     Young Masbath cries out, falls to his knees beside Ichabod.  Katrina
     moves toward Ichahod... Lady Van Tassel rides forward -- GRABS Katrina
     by the hair, PULLING HER, riding off toward the Horseman... Ichabod
     lays clutching the smoldering wound in his chest, gasping.  Young
     Masbath holds him... 

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Oh, God... no... no... 

     Lady Van Tassel drags Katrina by the hair as Katrina screams and
     struggles and kicks.

     The Horseman keeps coming... 

     Lady Van Tassel stops her horse, halfway to the Horseman, drops
     Katrina and starts riding back, shouting... 

                             LADY VAN TASSEL
               There she is.  Take her, she's yours!

     Katrina gets up to run, stumbles, falls... 

     The Horseman strides after... 

     Up the field, Ichabod gets to his knees, feeling his chest with both
     hands, not quite understanding, struggling to shake off delirium... 

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Sir, you're... you're not dead... 

                             ICHABOD
               Not... yet... 

     Ichabod looks up, trying to comprehend... 

     Lady Van Tassel had turned her horse, her back to us, keeping her
     distance from the Horseman.  Beyond her, Katrina flees this direction
     with the Horseman at her heels.

     Ichabod's focused on something... 

     The black SADDLEBAG slung over Lady Van Tassel's horse.

     Ichabod rises out of pure determination, runs... 

     Katrina runs... the Horseman is closing on her.

     Lady Van Tassel watches, grinning, but at the last second something
     catches her eye and she turns, just as... 

     Ichabod LEAPS... 

     TACKLES Lady Van Tassel off of her horse, taking her down to the
     ground HARD... her bag falling open... 

     The Horseman's skull rolling out... 

     Ichabod scrambles toward the skull -- but falls, halted.  Lady Van
     Tassel grips his leg, holding him.

     Young Masbath grabs a heavy, broken TREE LIMB off the ground.

     The Horseman is mere yards behind Katrina... 

     Ichabod struggles to get free from Lady Van Tassel, can't break her
     grip when, BANG -- Young Masbath SMASHES Lady Van Tassel over the head
     with the tree limb.  She's out.

     The Horseman catches Katrina... 

     Ichabod scrambles free, running, reaching for the skull... grasping
     it... 

     The Horseman holds Katrina ready by her hair as she falls to her
     knees, screaming and struggling.  The Horseman raises his sword... 

     Ichabod rises, THROWS the skull with all his might... 

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               Horseman!

     The skull spins through the air... 

     The Horseman suddenly drops Katrina, reaches up with one hand... 
     catches the skull.

     Katrina runs.  Ichabod runs to meet her, grabs her as she falls.
     Together, they back away from the Horseman... 

     The Horseman holds the skull out... brings it to his shoulders, to its
     rightful place.  THUNDER POUNDS.

     TRANSFORMATION begins -- blood and flesh rise up from the Horseman's
     throat and grip the skull... 

     Young Masbath watches in awe.

     The Horseman's reformation continues.  Muscle forms.  Liquids become
     solids.  He is made whole once more, the same evil, human face we saw
     in Baltus's stories.

     The Horseman looks to Ichabod and Katrina, touches his restored face.
     Daredevil rides up, SCREECHING.  The Horseman replaces his sword,
     climbs into the saddle.

     He rides toward Katrina and Ichabod, but he does not want them.  They
     are so exhausted they fall down.  Young Masbath comes to stand with
     them.

     The Horseman leans to grab Lady Van Tassel's unconscious form, pulls
     her up across Daredevil's back.

     The Horseman rides away with her.

     Ichabod and Katrina watch him go.  They look at each other, then kiss
     gratefully.  Ichabod looks to Young Masbath... 

                             ICHABOD (CONT'D)
               How are you, Young Masbath?

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Weary, sir.

     Ichabod holds out his arm.  Masbath comes over.  They embrace.  Katrina
     touches the burned bullet hole in Ichabod's clothing.

                             KATRINA
               I thought I had lost you.

     Ichabod reaches into his clothing, takes out a BOOK he kept in an
     inner pocket close to his heart... 

     The BOOK OF SPELLS with a bullet lodged in it.

     Katrina wraps her arms around Ichabod.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT

     HOOFBEATS.

     The Horseman enters the clearing, holding on to Lady Van Tassel.
     Ahead, the Tree of the dead awaits.

     Lady Van Tassel is awakening... 

     The Horseman grips Lady Van Tassel's hair, pulling her face up closer
     to his, just as she opens her eyes... 

     Lady Van Tassel screams... 

     As the Horseman brings his face to meet hers, about to engage in a
     KISS, his jagged teeth open wide.

     Ahead, the twisted tree's wound opens, deep and glowing, as Daredevil
     picks up speed.

     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT

     Daredevil JUMPS in the air just as a LIGHTNING BOLT blasts down from
     the sky, striking the Horseman... 

     For an instant, Horseman and horse are transformed, SKELETONS OF
     LIGHT, entering the tree!

     Silence and smoke.

     At the tree, Lady Van Tassel's hand sticks out from the tight-shut
     suture.

     The sewn wound on her palm seeps blood as her fingers curl.

     EXT.  NEW YORK CITY STREET, ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY

     A coach pulls up to Ichabod's home.  Ichabod is the driver.

     He gets off, goes and opens the coach door.  He helps Katrina down.
     Next, Young Masbath sticks his head out.

     Katrina holds Young Masbath's hand.  Ichabod comes to hold Katrina's
     hand.

     A STRAY CAT watches them --

     Young Masbath looks entranced at the BUSTLING METROPOLIS.

                             YOUNG MASBATH
               Oh, my!

                             KATRINA
                     (equally impressed)
               And cobbled streets!

                             ICHABOD
                     (proudly)
               Yes... New York, New York!  Just in
               time for the new century!  It's the
               modern age, Katrina!

                             KATRINA
               It's always the modern age, Ichabod
               ... but the ancient ones endure.

     Large snowflakes begin to fall upon the scene.

     Ichabod puts an arm around Katrina and the other arm around Masbath.

     The CAT is black with one white paw... the Cat from Ichabod's dreams... 
     The CAT turns to look at the trio.

     ECU -- The CAT'S EYES ARE HUMAN, INTELLIGENT, KINDLY... They are
     Ichabod's Mother's eyes.

     Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath enter Ichabod's house, as the SNOW
     continues to fall.

                              THE END
