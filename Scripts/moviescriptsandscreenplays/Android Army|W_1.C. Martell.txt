						  "ANDROID ARMY"


	    INT. CARNUBIUM MINE -- DAY

	    A pick axe SLAMS into solid rock, breaking off a chunk.

	    The prisoner lowers his axe and wipes sweat from his brow.

	    Muscled arms, a trim body, alien face partially covered by
	    the nose piece from a rebreather tank.  MERRITT is a hip
	    alien with a sarcastic wit and a kick back attitude, sentenced
	    to 25 years for hijacking cargo ships.

	    A GUARD nudges Merritt with a rifle, prompting him to work.

						 MERRITT
			    Hey! Can't you see I'm trying to sleep?

	    Merritt hefts the axe ad gets back to work.

	    THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF PRISONERS working the mine:

	    Aliens like Merritt.								   
	    Humans like PRATT, a burned out three time looser with a
	    weight lifter's body.								    
	    But more than half the prisoners are chrome fingernailed
	    Androids, sentenced for killing humans on Earth.  None of
	    the Androids wear re-breathers... they don't need them.

	    RALPH 124C41 is the leader of the Android gang.  A HUGE mean
	    looking droid with metal fingernails and grey eyes, guilty
	    of brutally murdering more than fifty humans.  He slams his
	    axe into the rock... Imagining it's the Warden's head.

	    Working beside Ralph 124C41 are his two henchmen: SMITH EE17,
	    a wiry Android with slicked back hair, aluminum teeth, and
	    pincher claw hands.

	    And COBLENTZ HL2000, whose body is criss-crossed with baseball-
	    like seams where he's been sewn together after knife fights.

	    Coblentz HL2000 breaks through a wall, exposing a vein of
	    glimmering Carnubium.

						 COBLENTZ
			    The fucking motherlode.  Vein of
			    Carnubium!

	    Merritt wrinkles his nose under the rebreather.

						 MERRITT
			    Shit, Coblentz, what you found is a
			    damned Deros Cave.  If you weren't a
			    fucking Android you could smell 'em. 
			    Let's get out of here before we're
			    lunch.

	    SUDDENLY, a slimy DEROS worm breaks through the opening in
	    front of Coblentz and EATS the PRISONER next to him.

	    The other PRISONERS yell and scramble out of the mine.

	    One of the GUARDS fires his rifle, forcing the Deros back.


	    EXT. MOUTH OF THE CAVE -- DAY

	    The PRISONERS sit along the side of the mountain, taking a
	    break. Merritt looks up when NOWLAN nudges him with his rifle.

						 NOWLAN
			    Warden wants to see you.

						 MERRITT
			    Must be my lucky day.

	    JACK NOWLAN is head guard of the prison mining colony.  Tough
	    but good natured, he's Esau to Merritt's James Dean-like
	    Jacob, here on the twin sunned planet Isaac.

	    Nowlan clips magnetic leg shackles onto Merritt, then nods
	    for his assistant AL BESTER to take over.

	    Bester is a farm boy prison guard.  Not only second in
	    command, but  Nowlan's best friend.  He wears a cowboy hat,
	    has a small town attitude.  Bester gestures for Merritt to
	    get to his feet.

	    Nowlan prods Ralph 124C41 with the rifle, and the Android
	    grabs the barrel.  Nowlan pulls the gun back, then JAMBS it
	    into Ralph's gut.

						 NOWLAN
			    Warden wants to see you.

						 RALPH
			    Screw you, screw.

						 NOWLAN
			    I've got the gun: Screw YOU. Now, you
			    going to cooperate, or am I going to
			    have to shoot you again?

	    Ralph snarls and Nowlan clips on the magnetic shackles.

	    Nowlan prods Ralph to his feet, escorts the prisoners away.


	    EXT. PRISON BUILDING - ESTABLISHING -- DAY

	    The Prison Building scorches under Isaac's twin suns.


	    INT. GERNSBECK'S OFFICE -- DAY

	    Nowlan and Bester prod the two prisoners into chairs across
	    from Warden Gernsbeck.

	    In his tailored suit and gold Rolex, VERNON GERNSBECK is the
	    type of slimy, bigoted, corrupt warden they make prison movies
	    about.  Trophies and political photos adorn the office,
	    obscuring the UN flag in the corner.

	    On his desk, near his polished brass name plate, is a photo
	    of his pretty twenty year old daughter, GARBY.

						 GERNSBECK
				   (sarcastic)
			    My two favorite prisoners.  Merritt.
			    Ralph 124C41.

						 MERRITT
			    What do you want, Verne?  I'm a busy
			    man.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Nowlan. Bester. Better stick around.

	    Nowlan and Bester nod, and keep their guns ready.

	    Gernsbeck lifts two manila folders, giving a false smile.

						 GERNSBECK
			    I've been looking over your files,
			    gentlemen. Interesting reading.
				   (to Merritt)
			    Mr. Merritt.  Twenty five years hard
			    labor for the armed hijack of twelve
			    cargo shuttles...

						 MERRITT
			    Fourteen.  There was two they couldn't
			    prove.

						 GERNSBECK
			    You seem to have trouble obeying the
			    rules around here.
						 (MORE)


										(CONTINUED)

														4.


						 GERNSBECK (CONT'D)
			    You've been disciplined by electroshock
			    forty three times.
				   (beat)
			    I have disciplined you more than thirty
			    times myself...

						 MERRITT
				   (sotto)
			    Sadistic fucker.

						 GERNSBECK
			    What was that?

	    Merritt just smiles.

	    Gernsbeck pulls the other folder and looks up at Ralph 124C41.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Ralph 124C41. Life without parole for
			    murdering fifty seven people on Earth. 
			    It says here you were reprogrammed
			    twice, but kept on killing.

						 RALPH
			    Humans are scrap.

						 GERNSBECK
			    If it were my decision, I would have
			    you disassembled and melted down,
			    sold as slag.

						 MERRITT
			    Ralph the toaster.

	    Gernsbeck looks from Ralph to Merritt.

						 GERNSBECK
			    As you know, your labor has been leased
			    by Manrocci Industries to mine the
			    Carnubium deposits here on the planet
			    Isaac.  Now that the Carnubium has
			    been depleted, this prison colony
			    will be closed down.
				   (beat)
			    The human and alien prisoners will be
			    reassigned to the mining colony on
			    Mars....

						 RALPH
			    And the 'droids?




										(CONTINUED)

														5.


						 GERNSBECK
			    The Androids will be set free... But
			    remain here on Isaac.

						 RALPH
			    What about a repairs technician?

	    Gernsbeck gives Ralph an evil smile.

						 GERNSBECK
			    No.  If you break down, you're on
			    your own.  Maybe you can repair
			    yourself...

	    Ralph goes berserk.

						 RALPH
			    You piece of scrap!  I'm gonna kill
			    you!  You and all the other human
			    scraps!  I'll kill you ALL!

	    Nowlan and Bester hold him in his chair.

	    Gernsbeck hits a buzzer.  Two other guards enter the office:
	    KLINE, a jokester ex-Marine, and STILSON, an attractive female
	    guard.  Stilson and Nowlan exchange smoldering looks, sparks
	    of attraction between them.

	    KLINE SLAMS Ralph with his gun butt until he sparks, then
	    drags him out with Bester and Stilson's help.

	    Merritt scoops the photo of Garby off the Warden's desk and
	    studies the picture.

						 MERRITT
			    Come on, Verne.  This is just an excuse
			    to keep me away from your daughter.
			    You know she wants me.

	    Gernsbeck pulls the photo out of Merritt's hands.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Keep your hands off my daughter.

						 MERRITT
			    Okay. But you better tell her to keep
			    her hands off of me... You KNOW she's
			    looking for some "close encounters".

						 GERNSBECK
			    I'll light you up like a Christmas
			    Tree.  You'll get enough voltage to
			    fry that evil little sociopathic brain
			    of yours...

										(CONTINUED)

														6.


						 MERRITT
			    She must take after her mother, Verne,
			    because I don't see a lick of family
			    resemblance.  Was your mail man a
			    handsome guy?

	    Gernsbeck is about to explode. He turns to Nowlan.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Get him out of here!

						 MERRITT
			    I was just beginning to like it, here.
			    Thinking about opening an ice rink..

	    Nowlan uses his gun to prod Merritt to his feet.

						 NOWLAN
			    Come on.  Now.

	    Merritt lifts his hands and co-operates, allowing Nowlan to
	    escort him out of the Warden's office.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    Nowlan escorts Merritt out of the Warden's office and across
	    the Command Center.

	    THE COMMAND CENTER is a circular room with work stations, a
	    security section where video monitors show various interior
	    and exterior views of the prison, and a vidmap of the prison
	    with lighted points showing where prisoners are.

	    A guard named CARTER is on security duty, watching the video
	    monitors in the security section.  He nods as Nowlan passes
	    by, but ignores Merritt.

	    HALFWAY across the command center, they pass GARBY, Warden
	    Gernsbeck's pretty twenty year old daughter.

	    Garby is one of the few people on the planet not dressed in
	    prison denim or guard uniforms.  She's dressed in a VERY
	    sexy outfit.

						 MERRITT
			    Well hello.

	    Nowlan tries to pull Merritt away from Garby, but she changes
	    course so that she can run her hand across Merritt's body
	    sensually.

						 GARBY
			    Is it true what they say about 'Smovs?

										(CONTINUED)

														7.


						 MERRITT
			    Depends upon what they say.

	    Garby whispers something in Merritt's ear, and he laughs.

						 MERRITT
			    Well, that's true about ME.

						 GARBY
			    Is it?

	    They exchange flirtatious smiles, and Nowlan YANKS Merritt
	    away from her, dragging him to the doorway marked AIRLOCKS. 
	    Merritt looks at her over his shoulder.

						 MERRITT
			    Until we meet again.

						 GARBY
			    I'll be waiting.

	    They exit and Garby crosses to her father's office and pops
	    open the door.

	    ON THE VIDMAP

	    We see two red dots exit the building and cross the terrain
	    to a section labeled: Carnubium Mines.


	    INT. CARNUBIUM MINE -- DAY

	    Ralph 124C41 slams the pick axe into the rock, grumbling to
	    himself.  He's about to explode in anger.

	    Pratt cracks through some rocks and a cloud of dust billows
	    into his face.  He takes a step back, covering his eyes...
	    bumping into Ralph.

	    Ralph spins, using the head of his axe to press Pratt back
	    against the wall of the cave.

						 RALPH
			    Human scrap! Don't ever touch me.

	    Merritt sets down his axe, moves between Ralph and Pratt.

						 MERRITT
			    It was an accident, tin man.  No reason
			    to blow a fuse.

						 RALPH
			    I do what I please.


										(CONTINUED)

														8.


						 MERRITT
			    Back off or I'll piss on you while
			    you sleep and rust your ass.

	    Ralph lowers the axe head from Pratt's neck... and JABS it
	    at Merritt.

						 RALPH
			    Screw you.

	    Merritt grabs the axe head quickly.

						 MERRITT
			    We can do without the axe, can't we? 
			    Settle this like men... Oh, I forgot.
			    You're not anatomically correct, are
			    you?

	    Ralph lets go of the axe and rushes Merritt.

	    The two begin fighting, and it spills out of the cave into
	    the twin sunlights.


	    EXT. MOUTH OF THE CAVE -- DAY

	    Ralph and Merritt fight.  A circle of prisoners around them.

	    ON ONE SIDE OF THE CIRCLE, Human and Alien prisoners cheer
	    on Merritt.  On the opposite side, Android prisoners with
	    chrome fingernails cheer on Ralph 124C41.

	    WHAM!  WHAM!										   
	    Ralph 124C41 lands a pair of solid punches to Merritt's chest,
	    pressing him back.

						 RALPH
			    Ready to die, Alien?

						 MERRITT
			    No.  I'm ready to pound you into sheet
			    metal.

	    Merritt blocks Ralph's next punch, lands a SOLID hit to the
	    Android's jaw.  The Human and Alien prisoners CHEER.

	    Coblentz HL2000 yells at the cheering crowd.

						 COBLENTZ
			    No one can fight an Android and win.

						 PRATT
			    Yeah? Merritt will turn him into SCRAP!


										(CONTINUED)

														9.


	    Both sides CHEER and JEER at each other.  Tension and hatred
	    runs thick between steel and flesh.

	    Merritt tries a combination to Ralph's face, hitting with
	    his right.... But Ralph plucks his left hand out of the air
	    before it can make contact and SQUEEZES it.

	    Merritt screams and we can hear the snap crackle and pop of
	    bones breaking.  Merritt kicks Ralph in the chest, forcing
	    the Android to let go of his hand.

	    Merritt staggers back, cradling his injured hand.

	    THE LINE OF ANDROIDS pushes Merritt back towards Ralph.

	    Merritt stumbles right into Ralph's arms.  The Android grabs
	    Merritt's neck and squeezes, cutting off his air.  Merritt
	    tries pulling the Android's hands off him, but can't.

						 RALPH
			    No air, no life.

	    Merritt is beginning to turn blue, when he pulls back his
	    head and SLAMS it into Ralph's.

	    Ralph lets go of Merritt, staggering back from the force of
	    the head butt.

	    Merritt takes a deep breath from the rebreather tank, and
	    goes into action.  He spins, kicking Ralph in the head.

	    RALPH AND MERRITT exchange kicks and punches.				
	    It's a battle of the titans.							  
	    Merritt is a great fighter, but his blows do little to slow
	    down Ralph 124C41... No one can fight an android and win.

						 COBLENTZ
			    Steel against flesh.  You CAN'T win,
			    Merritt!

						 PRATT
			    He'll win.  Brains against silicon.

	    WHAM! WHAM!										    
	    Merritt takes two brutal kicks to the head, reeling backwards. 
	    The line of Androids pushes him back into the ring.

	    Ralph sends a foot flying at Merritt's head, but Merritt
	    catches it and flips him head over heels onto the sandstone.

						 MERRITT
			    Kissing the ground I walk on, tin
			    man?


										(CONTINUED)

													    10.


						 RALPH
			    Screw you.

	    Ralph rushes Merritt, slicing out with his chrome fingernails
	    and tearing into the Alien's shirt.  Merritt jumps back,
	    then lands a pair of kicks to Ralph's head.

	    Merritt moves in to punch the Android, but Ralph swings out
	    and kicks the rebreather off Merritt's face.  Without oxygen,
	    Merritt falls back, clutching at his throat.

	    RALPH LAUGHS in victory.

	    Merritt grabs the rebreather mask and forces it onto his
	    face, taking deep breaths until he stabilizes.

	    BANG!  BANG!  Two gunshots.

	    Nowlan and Bester break through the circle and pulls Merritt
	    and Ralph off of each other.

						 NOWLAN
			    Break it up! Break it up!

						 BESTER
			    Who wants the first one?  Coblentz?

	    Bester aims his rifle from Android to Android.			    
	    They all fall back, arms in front of them.

	    Nowlan grabs Merritt by the collar and drags him out of the
	    circle, tossing him against the rocks.

						 NOWLAN
			    You stupid, convict?  Trying to get
			    yourself killed?  That android'll
			    tear you apart.

						 MERRITT
			    He's scrap.

						 NOWLAN
			    Some day, Alien, you and me is gonna
			    fight.

						 MERRITT
			    I'll be looking forward to it.

	    Nowlan slams Merritt back against the rocks, trying to knock
	    the grin off his alien face.

	    No luck.  Merritt moves to his feet and laughs.

													    11.


	    INT. LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

	    NOWLAN SLAMS THE DOOR on his locker, anger still bubbling
	    inside of him.

						 BESTER
			    You shouldn't let him rattle your
			    cage like that.

						 NOWLAN
			    Right.

						 BESTER
			    By Thursday night, this will all be
			    over.  Merritt'll be breaking red
			    rocks on Mars.

						 NOWLAN
			    My luck, I'll be reassigned there as
			    a guard.

						 BESTER
			    Then you could date Stilson.

						 NOWLAN
			    Stilson?

	    They leave the locker room.


	    INT. CIRCULAR HALLWAY -- DAY

	    Nowlan and Bester walk around a circular hallway towards the
	    crew quarters.

						 BESTER
			    I saw you two looking at each other.
			    If it weren't for anti-fraternization
			    rules, you'd have asked her to be
			    your naked rhumba partner long ago.

						 NOWLAN
			    Maybe.

						 BESTER
			    Don't try to shit me, Nowlan.  Have
			    you seen what she looks like under
			    that uniform?  I'd kill or die for a
			    chance at that.

						 NOWLAN
			    Okay, Bester.
						 (MORE)


										(CONTINUED)

													    12.


						 NOWLAN (CONT'D)
			    Say I end up on the Mars Colony and
			    Stilson gets transferred to Earth.
				   (beat)
			    How do we rhumba when she's thirty
			    nine million miles away?

	    Nowlan opens the crew quarters door for Bester.

						 BESTER
			    You could FAX her kisses.

						 NOWLAN
			    That's satisfying.

	    Nowlan lets the door slam closed behind them.


	    EXT. PRISON BUILDING - ESTABLISHING -- DAY

	    The prison building bakes under the twin suns.

	    A TITLE IS SUPERED: "THURSDAY"

	    We see the shuttle zoom out of the sky and begin its slow
	    descent to the Prison's shuttle dock.  The shuttle lands.


	    INT. GERNSBECK'S OFFICE -- DAY

	    Nowlan reads from a video-clipboard, reporting to Gernsbeck.

						 NOWLAN
			    All of the electronic weapons and the
			    majority of the human and alien
			    prisoners have been transferred off
			    the planet.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Who's left?

						 NOWLAN
			    Skeleton crew.  Stilson, Giesy, Kline,
			    Carter, Bester and myself.  All of
			    the Max Security prisoners, including
			    Merritt...

						 GERNSBECK
			    Shackle them into the shuttle as soon
			    as possible.





										(CONTINUED)

													    13.


						 NOWLAN
			    It's going to take ten hours for it
			    to refuel.  That's a lot of time
			    chained to a chair.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Do it.  I want all of the Max
			    Securities locked into the shuttle
			    brig as soon as possible.

						 NOWLAN
			    Sir, with all due respect....

						 GERNSBECK
			    Just do it, Nowlan.  If Merritt or
			    Pratt complains, I'll jettison them
			    into deep space.  I'm in charge, here.

						 NOWLAN
			    Yes, sir.
				   (beat)
			    I have Giesy and Kline packing up all
			    of the reserve weapons and ammunition.
			    I think we can last the next ten hours
			    with personal sidearms.

	    Nowlan's clipboard beeps and he looks down at it.

						 NOWLAN
			    The shuttle just docked.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    GIESY, a guard who's a Born Again Christian, puts the lid on
	    a create of rifles and begins nailing it closed.

	    Kline and Stilson help crate up all of the guns and equipment.
	    Carter sits at the security section, watching monitor.

						 STILSON
			    What about the operating system?

						 KLINE
			    Have to leave it behind. Need the
			    computers for shuttle take off and
			    atmosphere manufacturing.

						 STILSON
			    Those animals are going to tear it
			    apart.  Use it to rewire themselves. 
			    They'll be nothing left for a salvage
			    company to loot.


										(CONTINUED)

													    14.


						 KLINE
			    Then they'll go to hell.  Ask Giesy.

	    Giesy looks up from hammering, frowns threateningly at Kline.

						 KLINE
			    Sorry, they're Droids.  Droids don't
			    go to hell, they aren't human.

	    Giesy growls, realizing that Kline is making fun of him. 
	    Before he can quote scripture, J.W. CAMPBELL saunters in.

	    Campbell is the pilot of the shuttle, a good looking flyboy
	    in the overly fancy uniform of the U.S. Space Force.

						 CAMPBELL
			    J.W. Campbell.  I'll be your pilot on
			    this escape from hell.

	    Campbell holds out his hand to shake, and Kline takes it.

						 KLINE
			    Kline.  I'm a Marshal, here.

						 CAMPBELL
			    If you're the Marshal, who's the
			    Sheriff?

	    A bad joke, which rates only a smile.

						 KLINE
			    That'd probably be Al Bester.  Thinks
			    he's a cowboy.

						 CAMPBELL
			    I've been accused of that.

						 KLINE
			    This is Giesy, and...

						 CAMPBELL
			    Who's the pretty lady?

	    Campbell shows Stilson all of his teeth.  She isn't impressed.

						 STILSON
			    Janet Stilson.  Marshal Stilson to
			    you.

						 CAMPBELL
			    Well, Marshal, I'm stuck here for the
			    next ten hours while my fuel cells re-
			    energize.  Kind of hoped to spend the
			    time in bed.

										(CONTINUED)

													    15.


						 STILSON
			    I'm sure you could use the sleep.

						 CAMPBELL
			    Not what I had in mind.

						 STILSON
			    Well, you aren't landing here, sky
			    pilot.  Runway's closed.

	    It's obvious that Campbell isn't used to being rejected.   
	    He takes a step back... Bumping into someone.			   
	    When he turns around, his smile returns.

	    Garby returns the smile.

						 CAMPBELL
			    J.W. Campbell, the shuttle pilot.

						 GARBY
			    Really?

						 CAMPBELL
			    That's right.  I've got ten hours to
			    kill.  Thought I'd spend it in bed.

						 GARBY
			    Did you?  That sounds interesting.

						 CAMPBELL
			    Could be.
				   (beat)
			    Tell me: What's a beautiful girl like
			    you doing on a prison planet?

						 GARBY
			    They didn't tell you?

	    Campbell looks from Stilson to Kline to Giesy.		    
	    All three give him cryptic smiles.

						 GARBY
			    I'm doing twenty five years to life
			    for sexually mutilating more than a
			    hundred men... I bite.

	    Campbell takes a step back, color draining from his face.

	    Garby waves goodbye, and enters her father's office.		   
	    Campbell watches her leave, still in shock.				  
	    Kline touches his arm and explains.




										(CONTINUED)

													    16.


						 KLINE
			    Warden's daughter.  Strictly off limits
			    around here.

	    Campbell nods slowly.


	    INT. BLOCK 11 BUNK ROOM -- DAY

	    A room filled with cots, used by the Androids for resting.
	    But all are empty.

	    A GROUP OF ANDROIDS ring Ralph 124C41, who stands on a table.
	    All of the Androids are nodding at everything Ralph says. 
	    Becoming angry and agitated.

						 RALPH
			    These humans are SCRAP and should be
			    treated like SCRAP!  The time has
			    come for the Androids to seize power.
			    Kill every human and alien on the
			    planet.  And have the Warden's head
			    on a plate!

	    The Androids CHEER LOUDER AND LOUDER.


	    INT. HALLWAY #6 -- DAY

	    Kline drives an electric scooter with a trailer (empty) out
	    double doors marked "SHUTTLE BAY" and heads down Hallway #6.

	    HALLWAY #6 is a long, industrial-looking hallway with a bright
	    red stripe broken only by the number six.

	    Kline whistles a tune as he scoots down the long hallway. 
	    Occasionally, he steers right into the wall, only to correct
	    course at the last minute.  Anything for a thrill.

	    AT THE END OF THE HALL he turns into ANOTHER long hall.


	    INT. HALLWAY #7 -- DAY

	    HALLWAY #7 has a GREEN stripe broken only by the number seven.

	    Kline scoots down this hallway, still whistling, occasionally
	    driving like a lunatic, until he comes to a door at the end
	    marked "COMMAND CENTER".

	    The scooter and trailer come to a stop.  Kline gets out and
	    knocks on the door, smiling at the overhead security camera.



										(CONTINUED)

													    17.


	    STILSON'S VOICE squeaks from speaker next to the electronic
	    door controls.

						 STILSON (V.O.)
			    Who is it?

						 KLINE
			    Kline.

						 STILSON (V.O.)
			    Use your Mag-Key.

						 KLINE
			    Can't.  Lost it last week.

						 STILSON (V.O.)
			    At least you didn't give it to a
			    prisoner.

	    There's an electronic noise, and the doors are opened.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    Kline drives the scooter into the Command Center, pulls up
	    next to a stack of crates and shuts off the motor.

	    Stilson shakes her head at Kline.

						 STILSON
			    You're such a screw up, Kline.

						 KLINE
			    At least I'm the best at what I do. 
			    I used to be the best screw-up Marine,
			    now I'm the best screw-up Prison Guard.

	    Stilson rolls her eyes and points to the last twenty crates
	    of weapons.

						 STILSON
			    Come on.  Let's get them loaded.

	    She turns to Giesy, who's on his knees praying.

						 STILSON
			    Giesy, put God on hold and give us a
			    hand, here.

	    Giesy ignores her, finishing his prayers before helping them.

	    Giesy, Stilson and Kline load the crates onto the trailer,
	    but can't fit the last crate on.


										(CONTINUED)

													    18.


						 KLINE
			    It's not gonna fit.  I'll come back
			    for it, later.

						 STILSON
			    I think we can tie it on top.

						 KLINE
			    Skip it.  I'll take nineteen crates
			    this load and one the next.
				   (beat)
			    Big deal.  It's not like the shuttle's
			    going anywhere for the next nine hours.

						 STILSON
			    You're wasting a trip.

	    Kline hops into the scooter and starts it up.

						 KLINE
			    No, Stilson.  I'm wasting time in a
			    professional manner.  There's a
			    difference.  My way, I get promoted.

	    He pulls a U turn and scoots out the doors, while Stilson
	    rolls her eyes.  She turns to Giesy, who is already on his
	    knees preparing to pray.

						 STILSON
			    I'm going to miss him.

	    Giesy ignores her and begins to pray.


	    INT. HALLWAY #7 -- DAY

	    KLINE zig-zags through the hallway, trying to see how close
	    to the walls he can get without scraping them.			    
	    He begins singing.

						 KLINE
			    Oh, she's just a sheep, but she's the
			    love of my life.  And someday, I'll
			    have my way, and take her for my wife.
				   (beat)
			    Bahhaaa, bahahhaha, bahhaaa, bahahhaha.

	    He gets to the corner, and turns onto Hallway #6, not knowing
	    what waits for him....

													    19.


	    INT. HALLWAY #6 -- DAY

	    Nothing.											  
	    Hallway #6 is empty.

	    Kline continues to zig-zag, almost skimming the walls, singing
	    to himself and laughing when he almost hits the wall.

						 KLINE
			    Oh when I see her in the fields, my
			    heart with love is full. And when I
			    get her in my bed, I stroke and kiss
			    her wool.
				   (beat)
			    Bahhaaa, Bahahhaha, bahhaaa, bahahhaha.

	    Bored out of his mind.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    Nowlan enters, handcuffed to Merritt.					   
	    Behind them, Bester is cuffed to Pratt.

	    ANOTHER PAIR OF GUARDS escorts a dozen leg-shackled PRISONERS
	    into the command center.

	    Stilson exchange a smile with Nowlan, then back to business.

						 STILSON
			    What are you going to do with them?

						 MERRITT
			    Trade us to the Yankees for a third
			    round draft choice.

	    Nowlan yanks on Merritt's chain to shut him up.

						 NOWLAN
			    Gernsbeck wants them secured in the
			    shuttle immediately.

						 STILSON
			    We aren't leaving for another nine
			    hours.

						 NOWLAN
			    Gernsbeck's idea of discipline.

						 MERRITT
			    You want to hear my idea of discipline?

						 NOWLAN
			    No.

										(CONTINUED)

													    20.


						 MERRITT
			    It involves the Warden's daughter in
			    skin tight leather and a ping pong
			    paddle... The kind with sandpaper.

						 NOWLAN
			    Now I really don't want to hear it.

	    Nowlan turns to Giesy and Carter.

						 NOWLAN
			    Giesy.  Carter.  Take these two down
			    to the shuttle and lock them in the
			    brig.  Stilson, take over for Carter.

	    Stilson nods and sits in Carter's chair when he vacates it.

	    PRATT is shackled to Carter, and MERRITT is shackled to Giesy.

						 MERRITT
			    Well, reverend. Looks like it's you
			    and me.  The saint and the sinner.

						 CARTER
			    Shut up, Merritt.

	    CARTER, MERRITT, PRATT, and GIESY lead the procession of
	    PRISONERS and GUARDS to the doors to Hallway #7.

	    Stilson watches the video monitor.

	    ON THE MONITOR

	    The end of Hallway #6, where Kline is ramming the scooter
	    against the wall repeatedly.  The trailer is empty.

	    BAM!  He hits the wall, bounces backwards a few feet, then
	    BAM!  Rams it again.

						 STILSON
			    You ought to see Kline.  He's playing
			    bumper cars in Hallway Six.

						 NOWLAN
			    He's WHAT?

						 STILSON
			    Just goofing off, as usual.

						 NOWLAN
			    Tell him if he doesn't get back here
			    to get this crate he'll be goofing
			    off on suspension with out pay for
			    two weeks.

										(CONTINUED)

													    21.


	    Stilson clicks on a microphone and speaks into it.

						 STILSON
			    You hear that Kline?  Nowlan's going
			    to suspend you without pay for two
			    weeks if you don't quit goofing off.

	    ON THE MONITOR

	    Kline continues ramming into the wall with his cart.		  
	    He doesn't seem to care about being suspended.

	    Giesy uses his mag-card to open the doors, and the procession
	    leaves the Command Center.


	    INT. HALLWAY #7 -- DAY

	    Giesy, Merritt, Pratt, and Carter and the others walk down
	    Hallway #7.


	    INT. HALLWAY #6 -- DAY

	    They turn the corner, and walk down Hallway #6 towards Kline,
	    who continues to ram his scooter into the wall.

						 MERRITT
			    You're in a heap of trouble, there,
			    boy. Nowlan's gonna fry your ass when
			    you get back to the command center. 
			    You'll probably end up like me...
			    Chained to a Saint on the way to hell.

	    Giesy yanks on Merritt's chains to shut him up.  When they
	    get to the end of the hall, CARTER walks up to Kline.

						 CARTER
			    Kline.  Will you stop jacking off?
				   (closer)
			    Nowlan's serious.  He's going to put
			    you on suspension if you don't quit
			    ramming that scooter.
				   (closer)
			    You probably dented it.
				   (closer)
			    Don't let Gernsbeck see it, he'll
			    take it out of your pay.
				   (closer)
			    Kline?  Are you listening to me?

	    Carter grabs Kline's shoulder to turn him around, and Kline
	    falls over... DEAD!									 
	    Neck torn open, blood soaking the front of his uniform.

			    Oh my God!

	    Stilson watches the video monitor, which shows one CELL BLOCK
	    after another.  All are EMPTY.

						 STILSON
			    Nowlan?

						 NOWLAN
			    What is it?

						 STILSON
			    All of the cell blocks are empty.

						 NOWLAN
			    Sure.  We transferred out the prisoners
			    yesterday...

						 STILSON
			    Even the Androids.

	    Nowlan turns away from his paperwork, color draining from
	    his face in shock.

						 NOWLAN
			    Shit...

	    BANG!  BANG!  BANG!									 
	    Bullets begin flying through the command center, shattering
	    glass and exploding computer monitors.

	    ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE!								   
	    Gunfire blasting everywhere.							  
	    The crew hits the dirt, bullets ricochet overhead, exploding
	    a planter right above Bester and showering him with dirt.


	    INT. HALLWAY #6 -- DAY

	    THE PRISONERS AND GUARDS are pummelled with gunfire.		   
	    Bullets spark off the walls.

	    Merritt and Giesy duck behind the Scooter.				   
	    Giesy's eyes closed in silent prayer.

						 COBLENTZ
			    You're all SCRAP! Kill the humans!

	    THE ANDROIDS aims their stolen guns at the Prisoners and
	    Guards and open fire.

	    A PAIR OF PRISONERS get killed, slamming back against the
	    wall and leaving a smear of blood.

	    Merritt ducks as bullets spray overhead.					
	    Then he notices Kline's corpse on the bouncing scooter.

						 MERRITT
			    Guard's gun.

	    He times the bouncing scooter for a moment, then uses it's
	    movement as cover when he pops up and tries to grab the gun
	    from Kline's holster.

	    BULLETS SPATTER around Merritt as he realizes Kline was a
	    leftie... the holster's on the wrong side!

						 MERRITT
			    Shit!

	    Merritt ducks back down, just as a new volley of gunfire
	    sparks off the Scooter.  He didn't get the gun.

	    PRISONERS lay wounded and screaming on the floor, chained
	    together and trapped.  Gunfire blasts around them,
	    occasionally cutting off one of their screams.

	    Pratt and Carter are trapped in the center of the hallway,
	    bullets fly all around them.  Face down, next to each other.

						 PRATT
			    We've got to run.

	    Carter nods an affirmative.  Bullets spray around them.

						 PRATT
			    On three.  One.  Two. Three!

	    Carter and Pratt pop to their feet.						
	    Running to Hallway #7.

	    BLAM!												
	    A bullet sparks off their handcuffs.  Severing them.

	    Pratt takes a quick look at the cuffs, realizing he's free,
	    keeps on running.  At the corner of Hallway 6, he turns to
	    yell at Carter.

										(CONTINUED)

													    24.


						 PRATT
			    Carter, come on!

	    But instead sees Carter get shot a half dozen times.  Killed.

	    INT. GERNSBECK'S OFFICE -- DAY

	    Gernsbeck hides under his desk as bullets ricochet through
	    his office.  He's scarred, shaking.  A trickle of urine runs
	    down the leg of his pants.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    BULLETS fly over Nowlan's head.						    
	    He looks to Bester, covered with dirt, notices the last crate
	    of guns just behind him.

						 NOWLAN
			    Bester!  That crate of guns!  We're
			    gonna need them!

	    Bester turns to see the crate.  Crawls across the floor, as
	    bullets spatter around him.  When he reaches the crate, he
	    realizes he can't pry it open with his hands.

						 BESTER
			    I need a hammer!

	    Stilson has the hammer near her, and slides it across the
	    floor into Bester's hand.

	    Bester grabs the hammer and goes to work opening the crate.
	    A bullet explodes a corner of the crate into a shower of
	    sawdust, and Bester ducks.  Using the crate as cover.

	    Stilson ducks as the monitor above her is destroyed.

						 STILSON
			    Shit!

	    Stilson closes her eyes as debris rains around her.

	    Nowlan scoots to the wall and raises his pistol overhead,
	    firing out the window blindly.

	    Stilson grabs a shard of mirrored glass and scoots along the
	    floor to Nowlan's side.  Holds the mirrored glass overhead,
	    using it as a periscope.

						 NOWLAN
			    How many of them?

										(CONTINUED)

													    25.


						 STILSON
			    Hundreds.  An army.  They have rifles
			    and shotguns.

	    Bester gets the crate open and begins pulling out weapons.

						 BESTER
			    So do we. Catch!

	    Bester throws a shotgun to Nowlan, and a rifle to Stilson.

	    Nowlan and Stilson catch guns, swing to their feet and fire
	    a volley out the window, then dive for cover.

	    RETURN FIRE pummels the room, exploding anything on the
	    counter and sending papers scattering.

	    NOWLAN waits for a lull, pops to his feet and pulls the
	    trigger on his shotgun.								  
	    Click!  Out of shells!


	    INT. HALLWAY #6 -- DAY

	    A BARRAGE OF GUNFIRE from the Androids has Giesy and Merritt
	    pinned behind the scooter.  No way Merritt is going to reach
	    Kline's gun.  Giesy keeps praying silently.

						 MERRITT
			    Listen, Padre.  God's not gonna get
			    us out of this one.  We're on our
			    own.  Gonna have to make a break for
			    it.  Understand?

	    Giesy continues his silent prayer, ignoring Merritt.  Merritt
	    yanks on the handcuff chain, getting Giesy's attention.

						 MERRITT
			    Understand?  We gotta RUN.

	    Giesy nods slowly, anger in his eyes.

	    Merritt and Giesy wait for a lull, then make a break for it.
	    Running down Hallway #6, chained together by their handcuffs.

	    BULLETS chase them down the hallway.					    
	    Androids advance, lead by Coblentz HL2000, firing rifles.

	    HALFWAY DOWN THE HALL, one of the wounded PRISONERs reaches

	    Merritt and Giesy get to the corner of the hallways...

	    THE ANDROIDS are chasing right behind them!  Firing the entire

	    BLAM!												
	    Giesy shot in the chest, almost yanking Merritt off his feet.

	    Merritt makes it around the corner into Hallway #7, dragging

			    Geeze, Padre, you weight a ton!

	    THE DOOR TO THE COMMAND CENTER (and safety) at the far end

	    The Androids continue to advance.

						 MERRITT
			    Come on!  Come on!  You can't just
			    leave me out here!

	    He pounds some more.									
	    The doors don't open.								    
	    The Androids are getting CLOSER and CLOSER!

	    Merritt is trapped.  Then he remembers something.

	    THE ANDROIDS advance, guns ready to blast Merritt to pieces.

	    Merritt scoops the gun from Giesy's holster, opens fire.

	    BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

			    Eat lead tinman!

						 MERRITT
			    Shit.

	    Coblentz HL2000 laughs, and raises his rifle at Merritt.

	    Merritt pounds on the door some more.

						 MERRITT
			    Open up.  Please.  Please.  Open the

	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    Bester sees the Androids coming in, and tries to shut the
	    door...  A few Android arms reach between the door and the
	    jamb, grabbing for Bester's face.

						 BESTER
			    Need a hand!

	    Merritt jumps to his feet and helps Bester squeeze the door
	    shut.  One of the Android's arms gets stuck... and is severed.

	    Bester gets the door shut and locked.  The gunfire suddenly
	    stops.  Silence is deafening.

	    Stilson uses her shard of mirror to look out the window.

						 STILSON
			    They're gone.

	    Merritt picks up the crawling Android hand, offers it to
	    Bester.

						 MERRITT
			    You needed a hand.

	    Bester knocks it out of Merritt's hands. It crawls away.

	    RALPH'S VOICE BOOMS from the loudspeaker overhead.

						 RALPH (V.O.)
			    Scrap humans.  I control your destiny. 
			    I will let you LIVE in exchange for
			    Warden Gernsbeck. Your lives for his!

	    The voice turns to static.							    
	    Bester looks at Nowlan, then at Gernsbeck's office.

	    J.W. CAMPBELL comes out of the day room, alive, but scared.

													    29.


	    Pratt rises from behind the counter, Merritt smiles at him.

						 MERRITT
			    Glad to see I'm not the only prisoner
			    to make it out of this.  How about
			    getting me out of these cuffs?

	    Merritt nods at Giesy's corpse.

						 MERRITT
			    He's starting to get on my nerves.

	    Gernsbeck comes out of his office cautiously.

						 GERNSBECK
			    The cuffs stay on.  He's still a
			    Prisoner, and we'll treat him like
			    one.

						 MERRITT
			    Look, Verne, there's three hundred of
			    them and only eight of us.  Seems
			    like you could use all the help you
			    can get.

						 GERNSBECK
			    We don't need the help of scum like
			    you, Merritt.

	    Nowlan steps up to Merritt and pulls out his hand cuff key.

						 NOWLAN
			    He's right.  We need all the help we
			    can get.

	    Nowlan unlocks Merritt's handcuffs.						
	    Merritt rubs his wrists, smiling at Gernsbeck.			    
	    Then he notices Garby, as she rises up from cover.

						 MERRITT
			    Hey, sugarpie.  I'm a free man.  Want
			    to help me celebrate?

						 NOWLAN
			    Want me to put the cuffs back on?

						 MERRITT
			    No.  I want HER to do it.

	    Merritt winks at Garby, who smiles.

	    Nowlan doesn't smile.								    
	    He grabs Merritt by the collar and yanks him off his feet.


										(CONTINUED)

													    30.


						 NOWLAN
			    You better start remembering you're
			    still a prisoner.

						 MERRITT
			    We all are, aren't we?

						 BESTER
			    What's he talking about?

						 MERRITT
			    We're trapped here.  No way out.

						 CAMPBELL
			    There's the shuttle.  It'll take
			    another eight hours to fuel, but...

						 MERRITT
			    Until then, we're all prisoners.

						 NOWLAN
			    But only one of us has an attitude.

						 MERRITT
			    Screw off, Nowlan.

	    WHAM!												
	    Nowlan punches him.  Merritt returns a punch, and they
	    exchange blows, slamming each other with their fists, until
	    Stilson breaks it up.  Standing between them.

						 STILSON
			    Hey.  Hey.  We've got to work together,
			    okay?

						 NOWLAN
			    Listen, Convict.  Some day, you and
			    me is gonna fight.

						 MERRITT
			    Be looking forward to that day.

	    Nowlan and Merritt try to fight again, but Stilson is between
	    them.  She pushes both of them back, concentrating on Nowlan.

	    Nowlan calms down, and looks at the crew: Stilson, Campbell,
	    Garby, Pratt, Bester, Gernsbeck, and finally Merritt.

						 NOWLAN
			    We've got to be ready for them when
			    they come back.

						 STILSON
			    Right.

	    Stilson covers the monitors, watching the two undamaged
	    screens.  Trying not to blink, least she miss something.

						 NOWLAN
			    Al. I want you to booby trap the doors.

						 BESTER
			    Right, chief.

	    Bester starts to work.

						 NOWLAN
			    Warden, could you look over the floor
			    plans?  Try to find us some escape
			    routes in case of emergency?

						 GERNSBECK
			    Who elected you leader?

						 NOWLAN
			    No one.  You want to put it to a vote?

	    Gernsbeck looks from face to face, ending on Merritt's smile.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Just keep that man away from my
			    daughter.

						 MERRITT
			    I can't help it if she likes Smovs.
			    We do it in stereo, you know...

						 GERNSBECK
			    You dirty little son of a bitch!

	    Nowlan's turn to break up a fight.  He blocks Gernsbeck's
	    crazed rush at Merritt, holding the Warden back.

						 NOWLAN
			    One more word out of you, Merritt,
			    and you're back in shackles.

	    Merritt rolls his eyes, but steps back.					 
	    Gernsbeck gives Merritt a scowl, moves to the map in the
	    center of the Command Center and starts punching control
	    buttons for details.

	    Nowlan looks at the rest of the team.

						 NOWLAN
			    Everybody else gets to help fortify
			    this place.  Block the windows the
			    best you can.

	    THE REST OF THE GROUP goes to work.  They push file cabinets
	    in front of windows.  Break up a desk and nail the parts
	    over the windows, and turn the place into a fortress.

	    Nowlan inventories guns and ammo from the single crate.
	    Counting bullets.  Loading weapons.  Getting ready for battle.

	    STILSON keeps watching the monitors.  Trying not to blink.
	    Her eyes are beginning to burn from keeping them open so
	    long.  She blinks a few times to clear them.

	    WHEN SHE BLINKS, we see a SHADOW flit across one of the
	    monitors.  When her eyes are back open, the shadow is gone.


	    EXT. PRISON BUILDING - ESTABLISHING -- DAY

	    We see the Prison building under Isaac's twin suns.

						 RALPH (V.O.)
			    Human SCRAP!  Your flesh is no match
			    for our steel.

	    Nowlan moves up behind Stilson.

						 NOWLAN
			    Where's he coming from?

	    Stilson clicks through dozens of security shots, trying to
	    find where Ralph 124C41 is broadcasting from.

						 RALPH (V.O.)
			    We will kill you all.  Tear you limb
			    from limb.

						 STILSON
			    I can't find him.

						 NOWLAN
			    He's got to be somewhere.

						 RALPH (V.O.)
			    Spill your precious bodily fluids

			    Warden Gernsbeck.

	    FINALLY Stilson flips to an image of Ralph 124C41 circled by
	    Androids, looking directly into the security camera.

						 STILSON
			    Got him!

						 NOWLAN
			    Where is he?

						 STILSON
			    Cell Block 11.

						 NOWLAN
			    Keep him talking.

	    Nowlan grabs a rifle and a shotgun and starts to the door.

						 BESTER
			    Wait a sec, I'll go with you.

	    Bester grabs a shotgun, and the two exit.				    
	    Stilson grabs the microphone.

						 STILSON
			    Why do you want the Warden?

						 RALPH (V.O.)
			    To make restitution for the wrongs he
			    has committed against me.

						 STILSON
			    What wrongs are those?

						 RALPH (V.O.)
			    Surely you must know.  The sadistic
			    pleasure he gets from punishing us.
			    The way he forces us to live in terror.

						 STILSON
			    You've been convicted of a crime.
			    Sentenced to punishment.

						 RALPH (V.O.)
			    Violence is a crime in your world,
			    but violent punishment is not.  The
			    Warden has killed, and deserves
			    punishment.

						 BESTER
			    Can you get him from here?

						 NOWLAN
			    Maybe.

	    Nowlan aims his rifle carefully, trying to get Ralph's head
	    (three rooms away) in his cross hairs.

	    He squeezes the trigger twice.

	    Bang!  Bang!

	    Both shots MISS Ralph 124C41!

						 NOWLAN
			    Shit!

	    Nowlan and Bester take off running.						
	    Behind them, Ralph yells orders.

						 RALPH (O.S.)
			    Kill the human scrap!



										(CONTINUED)

													    35.


	    A HALF DOZEN armed Androids lead by Ralph 124C41 burst out
	    of the doors and give chase.

	    Nowlan and Bester turns and fire a volley at the Androids,
	    dropping a few... But they keep on coming!

	    Nowlan and Bester run like hell, Androids chasing.


	    INT. HALLWAY #9 -- DAY

	    Nowlan and Bester enter Hallway #9, with the Androids only a
	    hundred feet behind them.

						 BESTER
			    Great idea you had.  Glad I came along.

						 NOWLAN
			    I would have had him.

						 BESTER
			    Right.  If he were two inches taller.

						 NOWLAN
			    Kill Ralph and it's over. T hese others
			    won't fight.

						 BESTER
			    You sure?

	    Nowlan shrugs, dives into a doorframe, and aims his gun at
	    the corner of the hallway.  Bester takes cover behind him.

	    WHEN THE ANDROIDS round the corner of the hall, Nowlan and
	    Bester open fire.

	    A half dozen Androids go down, none of them Ralph.			
	    The Androids keep charging.

						 NOWLAN
			    Shit!

	    Nowlan and Bester dive out of the doorframe and keep running.

						 BESTER
			    Course, if you get them angry enough,
			    they'll fight even after you kill
			    Ralph.... If you ever kill Ralph.

	    another Hallway.  Androids right behind them.


	    INT. HALLWAY #8 -- DAY

	    HALFWAY DOWN THE HALL, Nowlan and Bester spot SMITH EE17 and
	    a platoon of Androids entering in front of them.

						 NOWLAN
			    Shit.

	    Smith EE17 spots them, raises his gun, and fires.

	    Nowlan and Bester return fire.  When they run for cover in a
	    doorway, Bester gets tagged in the leg by a bullet.

	    Nowlan rolls into the cover of the doorway, and spots Bester
	    trapped in the center of the floor...

	    As Smith EE17 and his troops advance from one end of the
	    hall and Ralph 124C41 and a half dozen Androids advance from
	    the other end.

	    Nowlan pumps his shotgun and rolls out to rescue Bester.

	    Blam! Blam! Blam!									   
	    He gets off three shots, before getting caught in the
	    crossfire from the two groups of Androids.

						 NOWLAN
			    Al....

						 BESTER
			    Get out of here!  Run!

	    A bullet tags Nowlan in the arm, and the shotgun goes flying
	    out of his hands.  No time to save Bester.

	    Nowlan rolls back to the door, uses his mag card to zip it
	    open, and escapes into a storage room.

													    37.


	    INT. STORAGE ROOM -- DAY

	    Nowlan can't just run away.  That's his best friend out there.
	    He hugs the wall under a window, listening.  Frightened.

						 RALPH (O.S.)
			    Well, Cowboy, just you and me, huh?

						 BESTER (O.S.)
			    Screw you.

	    Bester SCREAMS in agony.

			    How many people in the Command Center?

						 BESTER (O.S.)
			    A hundred.  More.  Extra guards.  All
			    waiting to kill your aluminum ass.

	    Nowlan sees Ralph's reflection in a chrome panel as he lowers
	    his shotgun.

						 RALPH
			    Wrong.  There's less than ten.

	    BLAAAM! BLAAAM!										
	    Blood spatters over Ralph's face.

	    Nowlan takes off.  Scurrying across the floor to the door on
	    the far side of the Storage Room.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    BAM! BAM! BAM!										 
	    Someone is POUNDING on the door.

	    slides in.

			    Where's Bester?

						 NOWLAN
			    Dead.

						 GARBY
			    What?

						 STILSON
			    They've cut off the oxygen generators

						 MERRITT
			    Androids don't need air.

						 NOWLAN
			    But the rest of us do.  How much time
			    do we have on the remaining air?

						 STILSON
			    About six hours, if we take it easy.

						 NOWLAN
			    How much time until the shuttle's
			    refueled?

						 CAMPBELL
			    Eight hours.

						 NOWLAN
			    Will there be enough fuel in six hours
			    to get us to our own Solar System?

						 CAMPBELL
			    Yeah, but not enough to land.

						 NOWLAN
			    We'll send a distress.  They can have

						 STILSON
			    Six hours of air.  We can make it.

						 MERRITT
			    You've never done it with a Smov?

						 GARBY
			    Only humans.
				   (beat)
			    Is it true?  What they say?

						 MERRITT
			    When a human has it, they call it
			    Diphallic Terata.  But for Smovs,

						 GARBY
			    I've never met a human with...
			    Diphallic Terata.

						 MERRITT
			    They're out there.  Gotta be, or else

						 GARBY
			    I've never come across one.

						 MERRITT
			    Two.  You'd come across two.

						 GARBY
			    Right.  And all Smovs are....?

						 MERRITT
			    Yeah.  My gun is twins.

						 GARBY
			    Side by side?  Or over and under?

						 MERRITT
			    Over and under.

						 GARBY
			    Fascinating....

						 MERRITT
			    Does it make you uncomfortable?

						 GARBY
			    No.  I think I can accommodate you.
			    Have you named them?



										(CONTINUED)

						 MERRITT
			    Sure.  The one on top is Jose.

						 GARBY
			    And the one underneath?

						 MERRITT
			    That's Hose B.

	    Garby smiles, and takes Merritt's arm.					  
	    Gernsbeck has had more than he can take, and attacks Merritt.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Get your hands off my daughter. 
			    Fucking perverted convict.

	    Merritt and Gernsbeck fight, exchanging punches.			  
	    The others watch them fight it out.

	    Merritt is in better condition, and grabs Gernsbeck's fist
	    before it can make contact, tossing the Warden over his
	    shoulder and onto the floor.

	    Merritt moves over Gernsbeck, who covers his face from the
	    impending stomp... Which never happens.

						 MERRITT
			    Afraid I'm gonna stomp you?
				   (beat)
			    That's the difference between you and
			    me, Verne.  You hurt people because
			    you like it.  I only hurt people in

				   (beat)
			    If it were up to me, I'd let those

	    Merritt turns and walks away.

	    Gernsbeck gets to his feet and attacks Merritt from behind.
	    Blind-siding him.  Nowlan pulls him off, trying to contain
	    the Warden's attacks.

						 NOWLAN
			    Warden.  Let it go.  Just calm down.

						 GERNSBECK
			    You saw what he did to me. We should

	    face.  Yelling at him, shoving him.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Restrain me?  I'm the warden, asshole.
			    I'm in control here, not you.  You're
			    just a fucking guard.  You can't even

			    think you can...

	    Nowlan takes all the pushing he can from Gernsbeck, decks

	    Nowlan turns to Campbell and Garby.

						 NOWLAN
			    Take him to his office and handcuff

			    I don't know.  But I DO know, this

	    EXT. PRISON BUILDING - ESTABLISHING

	    In the desert outside the Prison Building, a group of Androids
	    under Smith EE17 search for a back entrance to the Command
	    Center.  They find a steel door labeled "AIRLOCK #4", open
	    it, and enter.

	    The group ignores Stilson and Nowlan when they exit the wash

	    Merritt gestures to Nowlan.

						 MERRITT
			    Look.  I was thinking.  There's a
			    couple dozen emergency rebreathers in
			    the air locks.  They might come in
			    handy if we get down to the wire.

						 NOWLAN
			    Good idea.

	    Nowlan looks around the room for someone to send with Merritt.
	    Stilson?  No.  Too dangerous for her.

	    Merritt turns to Campbell.

						 MERRITT
			    Let's go.

						 GARBY
			    I'm coming along.

	    Merritt tries to dissuade her, but she stops him before he
	    can speak.

						 GARBY
			    You need all the guns you can get out
			    there.

						 MERRITT
			    Okay.

	    THE THREE, armed and ready for action, use Garby's mag-card
	    to exit through the door marked "AIRLOCKS".


	    INT. HALLWAY #12 -- DAY

	    The trio creeps through the hall, lights flicker around them.
	    Suspense builds.  They come to a corner.

	    Merritt gestures for Garby and Campbell to hold back as he
	    scouts ahead.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Merritt peeks around the corner into Hallway #13.			 
	    The hall is empty all the way to the Airlocks at the end.

	    Lights flicker, and several doorways are dark...			  
	    Maybe with Androids hiding inside them.

	    Merritt creeps down the hall.							 
	    Tension builds as he passes each dark doorway.			
	    But nothing happens.

	    When he gets to the end of the hall, and the Airlock doors,
	    he gestures for Garby and Campbell to join him.



										(CONTINUED)

													    44.


	    Garby and Campbell creep down the hall, guns ready.  Each
	    time they pass one of the dark doorways, tension builds.

	    At the Airlock door, the trio gives the hallway behind them
	    a final sweep.

						 GARBY
			    Looks clear.

						 MERRITT
			    Looks are deceiving.

						 CAMPBELL
			    Let's get the rebreathers and get the
			    hell out of here.

	    Merritt nods, and gestures for Campbell to open the door
	    while he and Garby cover.

	    Campbell slowly opens the Airlock door.					 
	    Nothing inside but darkness.

						 GARBY
			    Let's make this quick.

	    Campbell nods and enters the Air locks.


	    INT.  AIRLOCKS -- DAY

	    Campbell gets one step inside the dark airlocks before hearing
	    the noise.  A METALLIC ECHO.

						 CAMPBELL
			    Who goes there?

	    The answer is gunfire.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    BLAM!										 
	    Campbell is BLASTED out of the airlocks and skids between
	    Garby and Merritt.

						 MERRITT
			    Shit!

	    Garby and Merritt start running.

	    The Airlock is filled with a dozen Androids, lead by Smith
	    EE17.  The Androids begin spilling out into Hallway #13.



										(CONTINUED)

													    45.


	    Campbell looks down at his wounded leg, gushing blood, and
	    tries to stagger to his feet.

	    BULLETS fly around Garby and Merritt as they race towards
	    the end of the hallway.

	    Merritt turns and sees Campbell trying to crawl away.

						 MERRITT
			    Come on!

	    He provides cover fire, blasting away at some of the Androids.
	    Sending some slamming backwards in a shower of sparks.

	    Campbell crawls along the floor, leaving a trail of blood.

	    Garby stops running and joins in the cover fire.			  
	    But Merritt realizes they don't have a chance.			    
	    He turns to her between blasts and yells.

						 MERRITT
			    Get out of here.  Run!

						 GARBY
			    What about...

						 MERRITT
			    Just run, I'll hold them.

	    They exchange a look, then Garby reluctantly complies...
	    After blasting one last Android into scrap.

	    As soon as Garby is gone, Merritt tries to save Campbell.

						 MERRITT
			    Campbell.  Come on.

	    Smith EE17 gets Merritt in his sights, smiles, and fires.

	    Merritt hits the dirt, rolling across the hall and popping
	    to his feet. The bullet ricochets down the hall behind him.

	    Merritt fires cover shots, trying to force the Androids back,
	    so that Campbell escape.

						 MERRITT
			    Come on!  Come on!

	    Campbell crawls towards Merritt.						 
	    Closer.											 
	    Closer.											  
	    Almost there.



										(CONTINUED)

													    46.


	    SMITH EE17 aims at Merritt again and fires.  The other
	    Androids chime in, forcing Merritt to dive around the corner
	    to Hallway #12.  Bullets chunk the corner of the hall, sending
	    plaster dust into the air.

	    Campbell keeps crawling, but Smith EE17 grabs him.

						 SMITH EE17
			    Not so fast.

	    Campbell struggles to get away, but can't.


	    INT. HALLWAY #12 -- DAY

	    Garby runs down the hallway to the Command Center door.
	    Passing dark doorways along the way.

	    WHAM!  A shower of sparks shoots out a doorway as Garby passes
	    it, as a light fixtures short circuits.

	    Garby keeps running to the end of the hallway, and the safety
	    of the Command Center.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Merritt tries to force Smith EE17 away from Campbell, but is
	    forced back around the corner by gunfire.

	    Campbell is dragged back by Smith EE17.  He tries to fight
	    him off, but can't.  But he CAN reach the Android's gun hand.

	    Campbell and Smith EE17 struggle for the gun, wrestling back
	    and forth.  Campbell gets the barrel twisted around so that
	    it aims at Smith's face and tries to find the trigger.

						 CAMPBELL
			    Damned hunk of tin.

	    Smith EE17 twist the gun around to aim at Campbell.

						 SMITH EE17
			    Human scrap.

	    Campbell sees the gun aiming right at his face, and presses
	    the barrel up only moments before it discharges.

	    BLAM!												
	    A hole is blasted into the ceiling.

	    Smith EE17 yanks the gun away from Campbell, then clubs him
	    over the head with it.  Knocking him out.				    
	    Then Smith EE17 turns to the other Androids.

										(CONTINUED)

													    47.


						 SMITH EE17
				   (gesturing to Merritt)
			    Kill him.

	    The Androids advance.


	    INT. HALLWAY #12 -- DAY

	    Garby pounds on the Command Center door.

						 GARBY
			    Let me in!  Let me in!

	    No one answers.  She can hear the gunfire getting closer.

	    She pounds on the door some more, then remembers her mag-
	    card key.  Fumbles, trying to find it, swipes it through the
	    lock.  The Command Center door opens, she squeezes inside...


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    Right into Hell.									   
	    The Command Center is under siege again.  Under attack by an
	    army of Androids lead by Ralph 124C41.

	    When Garby squeezes through the door, Nowlan spins, aiming
	    his gun at her... Ready to fire.

	    When Nowlan sees who it is, he yells:

						 NOWLAN
			    Shut the door and get down!

	    Then Nowlan goes back to BLASTING Androids.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Merritt begins blasting the advancing androids into a shower
	    of sparks.  But they keep on coming.

	    THE SEVEN REMAINING ANDROIDS move past their fallen comrades,
	    advancing on Merritt.

	    Merritt aims at the first one and pulls the trigger.  BLAM!

	    The First Android is blown backwards in a shower of sparks.

	    Merritt aims at the Second Android and pulls the trigger.
	    Click.  His gun is out of shells.



										(CONTINUED)

													    48.


						 MERRITT
			    Shit.

	    The Second Android laughs....

	    Until Merritt throws the gun at him, scoring a direct hit on
	    his face.  The Second Android goes down, and Merritt takes
	    off running.


	    INT. HALLWAY #12 -- DAY

	    Merritt runs down the hallway, chased by the six Androids.
	    He gets to the Command Center door, and realizes he has no
	    mag-key.  He begins POUNDING on the door.

						 MERRITT
			    Let me in!  Let me in!

	    The six androids are almost on top of him.

						 MERRITT
			    Unlock the damned door!

	    Merritt continues pounding, as the androids get closer.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    It's hard to hear Merritt's pounding over the din of gunfire
	    in the room.  Garby, Nowlan, Stilson and Pratt blast away at
	    the army of androids outside the windows.

	    Garby fires out a window, but hears the pounding.	 
	    Without turning from the gun battle, she unlocks the door
	    with her foot.

	    Merritt squeezes into the room... but so do a dozen android
	    arms!  Merritt tries to push the door closed, but the Androids
	    are stronger.  Merritt looks around for help, but everyone
	    is busy blasting the androids outside.

						 MERRITT
			    Shit.

	    Android hands claw at him, as he tries to press the door
	    closed.  But there's no way he can hold them back.

						 MERRITT
			    Throw me a gun!  Throw me a fucking
			    gun!

	    Nowlan tosses Merritt his 44 Magnum.  Merritt catches the
	    gun with one hand, then jumps back from the door.

										(CONTINUED)

													    49.


	    ALL SIX ANDROIDS rush into the room.

	    MERRITT quick fires: six shells, six androids, six head shots.

	    ALL SIX ANDROIDS go down in a shower of sparks.

						 MERRITT
			    Help me take out this garbage.

	    While Pratt, Nowlan and Stilson hold the fort, Garby helps
	    Merritt push the six android bodies out of the Command Center,
	    dodging ricochets the entire time.

	    Once the bodies are out, they close and lock the door, and
	    Merritt takes cover next to Nowlan as he reloads.

	    Nowlan fires and talks simultaneously.

						 NOWLAN
			    Where's Campbell?

						 MERRITT
			    They got him.

	    Nowlan stops firing and looks at Merritt.

						 GARBY
			    He's alive, Nowlan.  But he's theirs.

						 NOWLAN
			    That's the only pilot we've got.

	    Everyone looks at Merritt, letting this bad news sink in.

						 MERRITT
				   (gestures out window)
			    Don't get them pissed, who knows what
			    they'll do to him.

	    Nowlan gives Merritt a look, then goes back to blasting
	    Androids.  Every time Nowlan sees an Android head, he fires
	    at it.  It's like an arcade game... "Doom", maybe.

						 NOWLAN
			    Who's next?  Step right up.

	    Blam!  Nowlan fires.

						 NOWLAN
			    We have a winner.

	    THE GUN BATTLE CONTINUES with Pratt, Nowlan, Stilson, Garby,
	    and Merritt blasting away.  Bullets fly through the Command
	    Center, shattering computer screens.

										(CONTINUED)

													    50.


	    Glass rains down on Merritt.

						 MERRITT
			    Shit.

	    He takes cover and reloads as bullets spatter around him.

	    Garby sights through the boarded windows and blows a couple
	    of Androids to hell.

	    Pratt spots Coblentz HL2000 in the hallway, takes aim, and
	    fires.

	    The bullet misses, but Coblentz gets mad.  Rising up, he
	    sends a stream of gunfire at Pratt.

	    Pratt hits the dirt as boards covering the window splinter.
	    Bullets ricochet through the room, shattering glass.

						 GARBY
			    Great.  Now he's angry.

						 PRATT
			    I was hoping he'd be dead.

	    Garby and Pratt pop up at the same time, blasting at Coblentz
	    and his Androids, forcing them back down the hallway.

	    Merritt has reloaded, and blasts a half dozen Androids,
	    forcing the others back.

	    Nowlan fires two guns through the barricades, forcing Androids
	    to take cover and retreat.

	    SUDDENLY, the shooting from outside stops.				 
	    The silence is deafening.

	    Nowlan rises up slowly, looking out the window.

						 NOWLAN
			    They're gone.

						 MERRITT
			    They've fallen back to regroup. 
			    They'll attack again.

						 NOWLAN
			    Stilson, check the monitors.  Tell me
			    where they are.

	    No response.

						 NOWLAN
			    Janet?

										(CONTINUED)

													    51.


	    Nowlan moves across the Command Center to her... finding her
	    dead.  Shot in the crossfire.

						 NOWLAN
			    Janet.

	    He cradles her in his arms, fighting back the tears.

	    The others just watch him, unsure what to do.

	    Nowlan holds her face up to his and kisses her gently.

						 NOWLAN
			    Sweet dreams.

	    Then sets her body down, closes her glassy eyes, then looks
	    up at Garby.

						 NOWLAN
			    It's the only time I ever kissed her. 
			    I always wanted to.  We used to flirt
			    back and forth.  Joke about her serving
			    under me.  I used to think about
			    holding her. Touching her face... But
			    fraternization is against the rules.
				   (frowns)
			    I always have to play by the rules.
			    Do what's right... even when it's
			    wrong.  Even when it's too late.
				   (beat)
			    It's always too late.

	    Nowlan is about to totally break down.					  
	    Merritt crosses the room and pulls him to his feet.

						 MERRITT
			    Nowlan, this thing isn't over yet.

						 NOWLAN
			    It's over.  First Bester, now Janet...

						 MERRITT
			    You've got to pull yourself together.
			    At least until we're out of here.
				   (beat)
			    We can't do this thing without you.

	    Nowlan looks at Merritt, confused by his compassion.

						 NOWLAN
			    I... I can handle it.

	    Merritt nods slowly, and lets go of Nowlan.

													    52.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- LATER

	    Merritt zips Stilson up in a body bag.  Then looks at the
	    others.  Pratt looks at the bag.

						 PRATT
			    Maybe we should say some words or
			    something.

						 MERRITT
				   (sotto)
			    Too bad they shot the Preacher.

	    Garby moves down next to the body bag.  Pratt bows his head.

						 GARBY
			    Janet, you were a good friend in a
			    world where friends are hard to find. 
			    And Good is even harder.
				   (beat)
			    You'd walk among the prisoners, and
			    never show fear.  I don't know how
			    you did that.
				   (beat)
			    Where ever you are now, walk without
			    fear.  And know that we'll miss you.

	    A moment of silence.

	    Then Merritt looks at Nowlan.

						 MERRITT
				   (softly)
			    Come on.  Give me a hand.

	    Merritt picks up one end of the body bag, and Nowlan lifts
	    the other.  Difficult at first, but Nowlan manages to control
	    his emotions, and just do the work.


	    INT. GERNSBECK'S OFFICE -- DAY

	    Gernsbeck looks up as the door opens.

						 GERNSBECK
			    You going to let me out?  So I can
			    punish that...

	    He sees Nowlan's expression and stops. They carry the body
	    bag into the room and set it down.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Who is it?


										(CONTINUED)

													    53.


						 MERRITT
			    Stilson.

						 GERNSBECK
			    You can't leave her here!  I won't
			    stand for it.  I refuse to be in the
			    same room with her!  She's dead!

	    Merritt crosses and grabs Gernsbeck's collar.

						 MERRITT
			    Look, asshole, we're all going to be
			    dead in three and a half hours.  We're
			    running out of oxygen, and they just
			    captured our pilot.
				   (beat)
			    Things are pretty well fucked, here,
			    Verne. The last thing we need is a
			    lot of screaming from some sadistic
			    pile of shit like you.
				   (beat)
			    So take my advice: Shut the fuck up.

	    Merritt lets go of Gernsbeck, dropping him back into his
	    chair.  He turns to Nowlan, who is staring down at the body
	    bag, on the verge of cracking again.

						 MERRITT
			    Come on.  We've got work to do.

	    Nowlan turns from the body bag.  He and Merritt leave
	    Gernsbeck's office...


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    And walk into Hell.

	    Pratt is holding the Command Center hostage, and the moment
	    Nowlan and Merritt enter, he swings his gun on them.

	    Merritt casually raises his hands.

						 MERRITT
			    Shouldn't you be aiming that thing
			    outside?

						 PRATT
			    I'm getting out of here.

						 MERRITT
			    There's the door.

	    Merritt nods to the door, and the Androids beyond.

										(CONTINUED)

													    54.


						 PRATT
			    Don't you get it, man? We're all gonna
			    die. First it was the Joker, then the
			    Preacher, then Cowboy, now the Girl.
				   (beat)
			    I mean, it's getting down to the nubs,
			    here.
				   (beat)
			    Next it'll be the Marshal and Daddy's
			    Girl... And after that it's either
			    you or me.
				   (beat)
			    I'm not hanging around long enough to
			    find out which.

						 NOWLAN
			    Where do you plan on going?  Seems to
			    me we're trapped.

	    Pratt swings the gun towards Nowlan.

						 PRATT
			    Why don't we just get on the shuttle
			    and get out of here?

						 NOWLAN
			    We wouldn't get far before we ran out
			    of fuel.
				   (beat)
			    Then we'd be adrift in the galaxy
			    without any life support systems.

						 PRATT
			    At least nobody'd be shooting at us.

						 MERRITT
			    Sure, why give up a quick death when
			    we could die slowly of asphyxiation?

	    Pratt reaims his gun at Merritt.						   
	    Behind him, Garby slowly creeps forward.

						 PRATT
			    I don't need any shit from you,
			    Merritt.

						 MERRITT
			    What do you want, Pratt?  The good
			    news?  There isn't any.  We're stuck
			    on this piece of shit planet for the
			    next three hours while that ship fuels.
						 (MORE)



										(CONTINUED)

													    55.


						 MERRITT (CONT'D)
				   (beat)
			    Now we can argue about it, and we can
			    fight about it, but we can't change
			    it.  So quit pointing the damned gun
			    at me.

	    Pratt keeps the gun aimed at Merritt.					   
	    Garby takes another step closer, ready for action.

						 PRATT
			    Why don't we wait in the shuttle,
			    then?

						 NOWLAN
			    Look at how much damage they've done
			    to this room.
				   (beat)
			    The shuttle couldn't take this much
			    damage and survive.  We'd never get
			    off the planet.

	    Garby takes another step... And Pratt swings around, aiming
	    his gun at her.

						 GARBY
			    You see, Pratt, we're the bait.  As
			    long as they're attacking us, they're
			    leaving the shuttle alone.

						 PRATT
			    Man, I can't take any more of this
			    fighting...  I'd rather end up drifting
			    through the galaxy in the shuttle
			    then be some sitting duck for those
			    droids.

						 NOWLAN
			    At least here we have a chance, Pratt.

	    Pratt aims at Nowlan, and Garby attacks.

	    She grabs the gun barrel, twisting it up at the ceiling.	   
	    BLAM!											    
	    The gun discharges, showering them with debris.

	    Pratt pulls the gun back down.					 
	    BLAM! BLAM!

	    The gunshots force Merritt and Nowlan to hit the dirt.

	    She struggles, pressing the gun back up at the ceiling.	   
	    BLAM! BLAM!


										(CONTINUED)

													    56.


	    Pratt pushes the gun around until it is aimed directly at
	    Garby.  His finger tightens on he trigger.

						 PRATT
			    Last words, Bitch?

	    Garby looks down the gun barrel, realizing she's about to
	    die.  Pratt's finger continues squeezing the trigger.   
	    Garby lets go and ducks out of the way quickly.		   
	    BLAM!

	    Bullet goes wild, hitting the vidmap with a shower of sparks.

	    Merritt jumps to his feet and tackles Pratt to the floor.
	    They crash into a work station, sending it down.

	    When they stop rolling, Merritt is on top of Pratt. But Pratt
	    still holds the gun.  He aims it directly at Merritt's face.

						 PRATT
			    Get off me, Smov, or I'll blow you to
			    hell.

						 MERRITT
			    Try it.

	    Pratt touches the gun barrel to Merritt's face and pulls the
	    trigger.

	    Click.  Out of shells.

						 MERRITT
			    You've got to learn how to count.  At
			    least as high as six.

	    Merritt slams the gun out of Pratt's hands and pins him to
	    the floor.

						 MERRITT
			    Look, Pratt, we're all in this
			    together.  Flesh against steel.  If
			    we start breaking up, fighting each
			    other, they'll kill us one by one.
				   (beat)
			    The only strength we have is working
			    together.

						 PRATT
			    You're gonna throw in with that screw?

						 MERRITT
			    What choice do I have?  What choice
			    do ANY OF US have?


										(CONTINUED)

													    57.


	    Merritt points at Nowlan.

						 MERRITT
			    I may hate him.  I may wish him dead.

	    Nowlan gives Garby a look.

						 MERRITT
			    But the four of us are stuck here
			    together.  And we're not getting out
			    of here any time soon.
				   (beat)
			    So I've got to learn to work with
			    him.  And work with you.

			    I may not like it, but I don't see me
			    having much choice in the matter.  Do
			    you?

	    He lets go of Pratt and moves to his feet.  Pratt just lays
	    there.  Finally Merritt reaches a hand down to help him up.

	    Pratt looks at Merritt's hand and reluctantly accepts.

	    Merritt pulls Pratt to his feet, then the two separate. Pratt
	    goes off to sulk, Merritt examines a cut from the scuffle.

	    Nowlan crosses to the Vidmap.  It's completely destroyed.

						 NOWLAN
			    No more early warning system.

						 PRATT
				   (sarcastic)
			    There goes our advantage.

	    Merritt goes into the wash room next to Gernsbeck's office
	    to wash and dress his wound.


	    INT. GERNSBECK'S WASHROOM -- DAY

	    Merritt is wrapping the cut as Garby enters, letting the
	    door close behind her.

						 GARBY
			    That was a nice speech, but did it
			    mean anything?
				   (beat)
			    Or were you just making music to sooth
			    the savage beast?

						 MERRITT
			    Meant every word.

						 GARBY
			    Especially the part about wishing
			    Nowlan were dead?

						 MERRITT
			    I might have exaggerated.

	    She moves closer to him, serious, now.

						 GARBY
			    Do you really think we're going to
			    get out of this alive?

						 MERRITT
			    I don't know.  But I have to keep
			    coming up with plans and possibilities,
			    or we're as good as dead.

						 GARBY
			    Then this might be my only chance.

						 MERRITT
			    To do what?

						 GARBY
			    To find out if what they say about
			    Smovs is true.

	    She moves into his arms and kisses him gently on the lips.


	    INT. GERNSBECK'S OFFICE -- DAY

	    Gernsbeck sees the silhouettes come together through the
	    pebbled glass of the connecting door.


	    INT. GERNSBECK'S WASHROOM -- DAY

	    When Merritt kisses back, Garby pulls away a little.		   
	    After flirting with Merritt for years, here they are about
	    to make love... and she's not sure she'd ready for it.

						 GARBY
			    I've never done it with an alien
			    before.

						 MERRITT
			    We're all alien to somebody.
				   (beat)
			    We look different, we smell different,
			    we act different.

						 MERRITT (CONT'D)
			    But even if we found someone who looked
			    just like us, they wouldn't be us.
			    They'd be their own person.  Have
			    their own thoughts, their own needs.
				   (beat)
			    You can spend your whole life thinking
			    about how different you are than other
			    people.  Me?  I'd rather think about
			    the ways we're the same.

	    Merritt kisses her gently.

						 MERRITT
			    Smovs kiss the same as humans.

	    They kiss again, more passionately.  She runs her hand under
	    his shirt, feeling his chest.

						 MERRITT
			    We feel the same as humans.

	    Another kiss.  They begin removing each others clothing,
	    gently kissing each new exposure of flesh.

						 MERRITT
			    We love the same as humans.

	    Their passion flares as they kiss again, bare chest against
	    bare chest.

	    Gernsbeck struggles against the handcuffs.

						 GERNSBECK
				   (sotto)
			    No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

	    Practically frothing at the mouth as the silhouettes of his

	    Nowlan watches the remaining monitors for signs of the

						 NOWLAN
			    They're out there someplace.

	    Pratt re-barricaders the windows.  Using the rest of the

	    INT. GERNSBECK'S WASHROOM -- DAY

	    Merritt moves his hand under her skirt, pulling her panties
	    down her legs.  Garby kicks them off, then guides his hand
	    back under her skirt.

						 GARBY
			    Almost the same.

	    They kiss again.  Then they glide to the floor and make love.


	    INT. GERNSBECK'S OFFICE -- DAY

	    Gernsbeck fights harder against the restraints as he hears
	    intimate laughter from the next room.

						 GERNSBECK
				   (sotto)
			    No.  He's a filthy alien.  A damned
			    prisoner.   Garby... Garby...

	    His voice becomes softer, resigned to the fact that his
	    daughter is no longer under his control.  Maybe never was.

	    Gernsbeck looks over to the body bag on the floor across
	    from him.

						 GERNSBECK

	    Pratt finishes barricading the windows.

	    Nowlan watches the screens for signs of action.  But they
	    show only empty hallways.  A sound behind him.

	    Nowlan spins to see Merritt exiting the washroom, tucking in
	    his clothes.

						 MERRITT
			    How much time until the shuttle's
			    refueled?

	    Nowlan looks at his watch.

						 NOWLAN
			    A little over two hours.

						 MERRITT
			    And until we run out of air?

						 NOWLAN
			    About the same.

	    Merritt nods, and joins Pratt.

						 MERRITT
			    We're gonna need a couple minutes
			    head start to get to the shuttle.

						 PRATT
			    Yeah?

						 MERRITT
			    Can we rig one of the doors to close?

						 NOWLAN
			    Sure. But where do we get the power?
			    All this equipment's hard wired in.

						 MERRITT
			    Batteries.

	    Merritt points at Nowlan's equipment belt.

						 MERRITT
			    There's one in your walkie talkie.
			    Enough juice in there to slow 'em
			    down for a minute or two.

	    Nowlan unclips the walkie talkie and tosses it to Merritt,
	    who begins to hot wire a door circuit on the control board.

	    Nowlan looks back at the monitor...

	    ON THE MONITOR

	    RALPH 124C41 holds a gun to Campbell's head.

			    Attention human scrap.  Let's make a

				   (beat)
			    Give us Gernsbeck, and we'll let you

						 MERRITT
			    I say we hand over the son of a bitch.

						 NOWLAN
			    I thought we were all in this together?
			    Flesh against steel?

						 MERRITT
			    The Warden's different.

						 NOWLAN
			    How?

						 MERRITT
			    They wouldn't be out there if it
			    weren't for that sadistic son of a

	    Nowlan aims his gun towards Merritt.

						 NOWLAN
			    I say we take a vote.

						 MERRITT
			    I vote we trade him.

						 PRATT
			    Trade him.

						 NOWLAN
			    I'm against it, and so's Gernsbeck...

			    That's two for, two against.

						 NOWLAN
			    Garby.

	    All eyes are on Garby. The deciding vote.

						 GARBY
				   (pleading)
			    You can't make me do this.  He's my

			    Look, he's an asshole.  He's always

						 NOWLAN
			    Which is it?  For or against?

	    Garby looks at her father's office, making the toughest
	    decision of her life.

						 GARBY
			    We can't get out of here without a
			    pilot.  We can wait the two hours
			    until the shuttle's fueled, but if no
			    one can drive it, we're stuck...
			    Trapped.

	    She turns away from the others, breaking down.

						 GARBY
			    I'm sorry.  God, I'm sorry.

	    Merritt raises his gun at Nowlan.

						 MERRITT
			    You heard the woman.  We trade.

	    Merritt switches on the microphone.

						 MERRITT
			    Okay, tinman. We trade.

	    Ralph 124C41 laughs.


	    INT. HALLWAY #9 -- DAY

	    Ralph 124C41 laughs when he sees Gernsbeck.

	    THE EXCHANGE is like something from a Cold War spy novel.

	    On one end of the hallway: the ARMY OF ANDROIDS lead by Ralph
	    124C41, who holds his gun to Campbell's head.

	    On the other end of the hallway: Pratt, Nowlan and Garby aim
	    guns at the Androids, while Merritt tries to control the
	    screaming, pleading Warden Gernsbeck.

						 GERNSBECK
			    You can't do this to me.  They'll
			    kill me.  Don't you understand? 
			    They'll KILL me.



										(CONTINUED)

													    64.


						 MERRITT
			    If you don't shut up I'll kill you.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Please Merritt....

	    Merritt ignores him, looking at the far end of the hallway
	    where Ralph holds the gun to Campbell's head.

						 MERRITT
			    Okay.  We trade.

						 RALPH
			    Not you.  The guard.

						 MERRITT
			    What do you mean?

						 RALPH
			    The Guard brings me the Warden.
			    Unarmed.

	    Merritt and Nowlan exchange looks.  Then Nowlan hands Merritt
	    his rifle and takes hold of Gernsbeck's shackles.

						 RALPH
			    Now.

	    Ralph and Campbell begin advancing to the center of the hall,
	    at the same speed as Nowlan and Gernsbeck.

	    THE FOUR face off in the center of the hall, about a dozen
	    feet between them.  Ralph keeps the gun jambed into Campbell's
	    head.  Nowlan has a six shooter, hidden behind his back.

						 RALPH
			    This one must be pretty important, if
			    you'll trade the warden for him.

	    Tension.  They can't let Ralph know how important Campbell
	    is.  They can't let him know he's the pilot.

						 NOWLAN
			    He's just a tech.

						 RALPH
			    I've never seen him before.

						 NOWLAN
			    They sent him on the shuttle to look
			    over the computer systems for salvage.




										(CONTINUED)

													    65.


						 RALPH
			    Computer tech?  Maybe we should keep
			    him.  Use him for repairs after you
			    have gone.

						 NOWLAN
			    He salvages, he doesn't repair.  He's
			    just a junk man...

						 RALPH
			    A junk man? You know what he told me?
			    He told me he was the shuttle pilot.
				   (beat)
			    Now why would he lie like that?

						 NOWLAN
			    Look.  Just let him go.  I'll give
			    you the Warden.

	    Ralph 124C41 laughs.

						 RALPH
			    No deal.  We'll TAKE the Warden.

	    BLAM!												
	    Ralph blows Campbell away, then reaims his gun at Gernsbeck.

	    Gernsbeck starts screaming.  Begging.

	    Nowlan kicks the gun out of Ralph's hands, then quick draws
	    his pistol, blasting away until the Androids dive for cover.

	    Merritt, Pratt, and Garby give cover fire for Nowlan and
	    Gernsbeck. Blasting away at the Army of Androids.

	    Gernsbeck drags his shackles back to the group.

	    Ralph rolls, coming up with his gun.  He aims it at Nowlan,
	    and the two exchange gunfire, like Cowboys at high noon.

	    Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!								  
	    It's a close quarters shootout, like something from a John
	    Woo movie.

	    Nowlan yells at the others as he fires at Ralph.

						 NOWLAN
			    Back!  Back!

	    The group races back down the hall to the Command Center.

	    Nowlan takes one final look at Campbell (he's dead), then
	    fires a couple more shots at Ralph and joins the others in
	    their mad dash to the Command Center.

										(CONTINUED)

													    66.


	    Bullets spatter the hallways as the five run.

	    RALPH AND THE ARMY charge after them.

	    Gernsbeck is lagging behind, dragging his heavy shackles. 
	    He trips on the chains.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Help me!  Oh, God, help me!

	    Nowlan helps Gernsbeck to his feet, and they try to catch up
	    with the others.


	    INT. HALLWAY #8 -- DAY

	    PRATT, GARBY, and MERRITT turn the corner into the next
	    hallway, and sprint to the Command Center doors.

						 MERRITT
			    Come on! They're right behind us!

	    Garby slides her mag key through the slot and nothing happens.
	    She tries it again.

						 GARBY
			    Shit.  It's demagnetized...

	    Nowlan and Gernsbeck round the corner, racing towards them.

	    THE ARMY OF ANDROIDS only fifty feet behind them.

						 GARBY
			    Nowlan! Your card!

	    Nowlan tosses Garby his mag key, then spins and fires at the
	    oncoming Androids.

	    Garby catches the key, glides it through the slot, gets the
	    green light.  The door opens.

	    Nowlan aims at a charging Android and pulls the trigger.
	    Click. Out of shells.

						 NOWLAN
			    Shit.

	    Nowlan DIVES and rolls down the hallway, popping to his feet
	    next to the others.

													    67.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    The five dive into the Command Center, closing the door behind
	    them only SECONDS before the Androids get there.

	    BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! Ralph pounds on the door.

						 RALPH (O.S.)
			    How are you going to get off the planet
			    without a pilot, Nowlan?  You're
			    trapped here.  My prisoners.

	    Nowlan and Garby look at each other.  Worried.

						 RALPH (O.S.)
			    In less than two hours you'll run out
			    of air....

						 MERRITT
			    Two hours, twelve minutes.

	    Nowlan looks at Merritt, and he explains.

						 MERRITT
			    Campbell's air, divided by five.

						 NOWLAN
			    You're sick.

						 MERRITT
			    I'm practical.

	    Ralph continues his tirade.

						 RALPH (O.S.)
			    ...After you're dead, I'll TAKE the
			    Warden. Put his head on a plate.

	    Gernsbeck begins crying.

						 RALPH (O.S.)
			    Then WE will fly the shuttle back to
			    Earth.  And kill every human we can
			    find. No one will be able to stop us.

	    Merritt puts his ear to the door, listening.

						 MERRITT
			    They're falling back.

	    Nowlan looks from face to face. Everyone has that hopeless
	    expression.  Their pilot is dead.



										(CONTINUED)

													    68.


						 NOWLAN
			    He's right.  Without Campbell, we're
			    trapped.  He was our only chance.

						 MERRITT
			    Not our only chance.

						 NOWLAN
			    What are you talking about?

	    Merritt looks up slowly.

						 MERRITT
			    I can fly us out.

						 NOWLAN
			    You're full of shit, convict.  Where'd
			    you get your pilot license?  San
			    Quentin?

	    Merritt moves fully to his feet, standing tall.

						 MERRITT
			    I used to make a good living hijacking
			    cargo shuttles.  I can fly just about
			    anything.

						 NOWLAN
			    I hope we live long enough to find
			    out if you're right.

						 GARBY
			    What do you mean?

						 NOWLAN
			    They can kill a lot of us in two hours.

						 MERRITT
			    Not if we kill them first.

						 NOWLAN
			    How do you propose to do that?

						 MERRITT
			    We use the Merritt System.

						 PRATT
			    What's that?

						 MERRITT
			    If they attack us with guns, we attack
			    them with cannons.



										(CONTINUED)

						 NOWLAN
				   (sarcastic)
			    Great idea.  Where do we get the
			    cannons?

	    CLOSE ON THE BROKEN VIDMAP

	    Merritt's finger touches a location, as he speaks.

						 MERRITT
			    There are a couple of crates of
			    explosives in mine shaft number seven.
			    We had to leave them behind when the
			    Deros came after us.

	    Pratt nods, remembering.

						 MERRITT
			    If we can get those explosives out of
			    shaft number seven, we can rig a bobby
			    trap that'll blow them into small
			    appliance heaven.

						 NOWLAN
			    Great.  How do we get to shaft number
			    seven?

						 MERRITT
			    Through the air ducts.  When we get
			    outside, we can use the last rebreather
			    tank.  There's about five minutes on
			    it.

						 GARBY
			    Five minutes.

						 NOWLAN
			    It could work.

	    Pratt shakes his head.  Desperation has turned to anger.

						 PRATT
			    That's a frigging suicide mission
			    you're talking about.  Get past the
			    Droids, get out of the complex, get
			    to shaft number seven, which we closed
			    because it was too dangerous, hope
			    the damned Deros aren't hungry, find
			    the crates of explosives and sneak
			    them back here, right past the
			    Droids...  All with only five minutes
			    of air?  You're crazy.  You're all
			    crazy.

													    70.


						 NOWLAN
			    You got a better idea?

	    Pratt turns away.

						 PRATT
			    Give them the Warden.  It's what they
			    want.

						 MERRITT
			    That kills him, but it doesn't save
			    us.

						 PRATT
			    Shit.  This is frigging shit!

						 MERRITT
			    Look, Pratt, we've got a choice. 
			    Hide here for two hours, waiting to
			    die, or stand and fight.

	    Pratt turns to Merritt and nods slowly.  Accepting.

	    It's obvious that Merritt has taken charge of the group.
	    He's become the leader by default.  The man with the plans.

	    Gernsbeck raises his shackled hands towards Merritt.

						 GERNSBECK
			    If you're not going to use me as a
			    bargaining tool, can you at least
			    unshackle me?

						 MERRITT
			    No.  The cuffs stay on.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Merritt, there's three hundred of
			    them and only five of us.  Seems like
			    you can use all the help you can get.

						 MERRITT
			    We don't need help from sadistic
			    mothers like you.

						 NOWLAN
			    Merritt, we need all the help we can
			    get and then some.

	    Merritt nods slowly, then looks Gernsbeck in the eyes.

						 MERRITT
			    Cut him loose.


										(CONTINUED)

	    Nowlan unshackles Gernsbeck, tossing the cuffs aside.

	    Gernsbeck smiles at Merritt and offers his hand to shake.

						 GERNSBECK
			    No hard feelings?

	    When Merritt moves to grudgingly take it, Gernsbeck pulls
	    back his fist and decks him.

	    WHAM!  Merritt hits the floor, hard.					   
	    Gernsbeck flexes his aching hand.

	    Pratt makes a move towards Gernsbeck, but Merritt stops him.

						 MERRITT
			    I guess I had that coming.

	    Merritt moves to his feet, rubbing his jaw.

						 MERRITT
			    Now that we're all even, it's time to
			    choose.  Which one of us is going out
			    there?

						 PRATT
			    Not me.

						 NOWLAN
			    Who decides?  You?

	    Merritt pulls out a huge knife and STABS it into the table
	    between he and Nowlan.

						 MERRITT
			    The knife decides.

	    The knife quivers in the table.  Nowlan nods.

	    THE TABLE

	    All five stand around the table, forming a circle.  The knife
	    lays in the center of the table.

						 MERRITT
			    Ready?

	    All eyes on the knife as Garby gives it a spin.

						 PRATT
			    Did this when I was a kid.  Spin the
			    bottle they called it.  Only the winner
			    got a kiss.

			    No winners here.

	    THE KNIFE continues spinning.

	    Everyone watches as it begins to slow down, blade pointing
	    from one to the other as it rotates.

						 GARBY
			    I don't want to look....

	    She closes her eyes.

	    THE KNIFE stops spinning.  The blade has found a victim.

	    The knife blade is pointing at PRATT.

						 PRATT
			    Shit.

			    Yeah.  But it's all bad luck.

	    A rope is tied around Pratt, and the rebreather (with an LCD
	    readout which will count down the 4:53 minutes of air left)
	    is strapped on his back.

						 MERRITT
			    Ready?

	    Pratt nods.  Gernsbeck claps a hand to his back.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Good luck, son.

						 PRATT
			    Wish you wouldn't have said that. 
			    People been wishing me good luck all
			    my life, look where it got me.

						 NOWLAN
			    You've got four minutes and fifty
			    three seconds of air.

						 MERRITT
			    Use it wisely.



										(CONTINUED)

													    73.


	    This gets a smile out of Pratt, who checks the action on his
	    gun and gets ready to go.

	    Garby gives him a kiss on the cheek.

						 GARBY
			    For luck.

	    Pratt grabs her and plants a major-rotor-rooter french kiss
	    on her, dipping her a little.

						 PRATT
			    There.  Now I feel I lucky.

	    Pratt looks at Nowlan and Merritt, who get their guns ready.
	    Then Garby opens the Command Center door, and they roll out.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Nowlan and Merritt aim their guns down the empty hallway, as
	    Garby helps Pratt pry off the air vent grate and climb inside.


	    INT.  AIR DUCT -- DAY

	    Pratt begins crawling through the duct, rope playing out
	    behind him. Gun in front of him, ready for action.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Garby keeps feeding the rope from the coils into the vent
	    opening, while Nowlan and Merritt stand guard.


	    INT. AIR DUCT -- DAY

	    The air in the duck is becoming smokey.  Pratt puts on the
	    rebreather, and the LCD numbers begin counting down.

	    AHEAD: Light at the end of the duct.

	    Pratt climbs towards the light, then kicks out the mesh screen
	    separating the duct from the outside world.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Garby keeps feeding the rope.

	    An echo in the hallway.  A sound.  A footstep?

	    Merritt and Nowlan keep their guns aimed, ready for action.

													    74.


	    EXT.  PLANET ISAAC -- DAY

	    Under the burning twin suns, Pratt treks across the red desert
	    landscape to the mines.  The rope playing out behind him.

	    The time on his rebreather ticking away.					
	    The LCD now reads 4:27 minutes of air left.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    Gernsbeck watches Pratt progress on the only undamaged
	    monitor, and yells to the others, in the hall.

						 GERNSBECK
			    He made it out!


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Merritt and Nowlan keep their guns trained.  Garby keeps
	    uncoiling rope.  A sound in the hallway echoes....

	    Tension builds.  Merritt keeps his gun ready.				
	    Nothing happens.


	    EXT. MOUTH OF THE CAVE -- DAY

	    Pratt makes it to the mines.							  
	    The heat has him breathing deeply.

	    3:39 minutes left on the rebreather.

	    Pratt enters the cave.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    Gernsbeck yells.

						 GERNSBECK
			    He's entered the cave!


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Gernsbeck's voice echoes in the hallway.  Merritt whispers.

						 MERRITT
			    Quiet.  Quiet.

	    When the echo dies down, there's another noise.  Footsteps.
	    Getting closer.

										(CONTINUED)

													    75.


						 MERRITT
			    Someone's coming.

	    Merritt and Nowlan keep their guns ready.				    
	    Garby continues playing out the rope.					   
	    Tension builds.


	    INT. CARNUBIUM MINE -- DAY

	    Pratt uses a flashlight to search the mines, until he comes
	    to a make-shift sign identifying Shaft #7.

	    3:07 remaining on the rebreather.

	    He moves deeper into Shaft #7, looking for the crates of
	    explosives.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Merritt and Nowlan keep their weapons aimed.

						 GERNSBECK (O.S.)
			    He's in the mine!

	    The voice echoes, obscuring the footfalls.  Merritt and Nowlan
	    keep their guns aimed.  Waiting for the attack.


	    INT. CARNUBIUM MINE -- DAY

	    Pratt's flashlight picks up the two crates of explosives. 
	    He pockets the flashlight and grabs one of the crates.

	    2:28 remaining on the rebreather.  He's going to have to
	    hold his breath on the way back.

	    WHAM! The Deros strikes!								 
	    The hideous, smelly, creature bursts from the cave, teeth
	    and tentacles reaching for Pratt.

	    Pratt runs like hell, carrying one of the crates, the Deros
	    right behind him.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Another footfall.  Someone is standing just around the corner
	    from where Nowlan and Merritt are.

	    Garby, unarmed, continues playing out the rope.

	    Another footfall.

										(CONTINUED)

													    76.


						 MERRITT
			    One more step and we'll blow you to
			    hell!

	    Nowlan looks at Merritt, wondering about his strategy.

	    Then they hear the laughter.							  
	    The laughter of machines.								
	    Hundreds of them.									   
	    Echoing through the hall.


	    EXT. MOUTH OF THE CAVE -- DAY

	    Pratt escapes from the cave only seconds before the Deros
	    would have caught him.

	    When the bright sunlight hits the Deros, it screams and ducks
	    back in the cave.

	    Pratt sets the crate down, then lays over it, trying to catch
	    his breath.

	    1:47 remaining on the rebreather.

	    Then Pratt sees the shoes.  He looks up to see Smith EE17
	    aiming a gun down at him.

						 SMITH EE17
			    Where do you think you're going?

	    Pratt knocks Smith EE17 back and makes a break for it.

	    He doesn't get far before Smith steps on Pratt's rope.

	    Pratt is trapped, tethered only a dozen feet from Smith.

						 SMITH EE17
			    Not so fast.

	    BANG! BANG!										    
	    Smith blows off Pratt's kneecaps.

	    Smith strolls over to where Pratt lays screaming and pulls
	    off the rebreather, tossing it as far away as he can.

	    With a laugh, Smith EE17 ambles back to the compound.


	    INT. BLOCK 11 BUNK ROOM -- DAY

	    Smith EE17 approaches Ralph 124C41.



										(CONTINUED)

													    77.


						 SMITH EE17
			    One down, four to go.

	    Ralph nods approval, then turns to his troops.

						 RALPH
			    Remember, I get the Warden.
				   (beat)
			    Here's my new plan of attack...

	    Ralph explains his strategy to the Army of Androids.


	    EXT. MOUTH OF THE CAVE -- DAY

	    Pratt holds his breath and drags himself to the crate, unhooks
	    his rope, and hooks it to the crate.  He gives it two tugs.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Garby feels the tugs and whispers.

						 GARBY
			    He's got it.

						 NOWLAN
			    Reel it in.

	    Garby begins reeling in the rope.


	    EXT. MOUTH OF THE CAVE -- DAY

	    Pratt smiles as the crate of explosives is dragged back to
	    the compound.

	    Then he closes his eyes and dies.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Garby continues reeling in the rope.					    
	    But there's laughing in the hallway.					    
	    The echoes of a dozen Androids.						    
	    Lead by Coblentz.

						 MERRITT
			    Hurry up. Hurry up.

	    Garby tugs as fast as she can, but the rope has stopped.

													    78.


	    EXT. PLANET ISAAC -- DAY

	    The crate is caught behind a big rock.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Garby gives the rope another tug.

						 GARBY
			    It's stuck.

	    Merritt lowers his gun and goes to help Garby.

	    THE FOOTFALLS continue echoing.						    
	    Closer.											   
	    Closer.											  
	    Closer.

	    Merritt and Garby give the rope a yank.


	    EXT. PLANET ISAAC -- DAY

	    The crate pops over the rock and continues.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Merritt lets Garby reel in the rope, and crosses to his gun.

	    BANG!  BANG!  BANG!									 
	    Coblentz rolls into the hallway and opens fire.  Bullets
	    ricochet around Merritt as he tries to make it to his gun.

	    Nowlan returns fire, trying to force Coblentz back.  But
	    Coblentz is joined by a half dozen other armed Androids.

	    Garby continues reeling in the rope, as bullets fly around
	    her.  Shredding the wall only inches from her face.

	    Merritt makes it to his gun, rolls it into his hands and
	    begins blasting away.  Hitting a couple of the Androids.

	    Nowlan hits a couple of androids, but they are out numbered.


	    EXT. AIR DUCT -- DAY

	    The crate gets caught on the outside of the air duct.		 
	    It's tugged a couple of times.

													    79.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Garby keeps tugging, but the rope won't budge.

						 GARBY
			    It's stuck again!

						 MERRITT
			    You're on your own, Garby.

	    Bullets spatter around her as she tries whipping the rope,
	    then yanking on it.


	    EXT. AIR DUCT -- DAY

	    The rope flips loose, then finally is pulled into the air
	    duct, dragging the crate behind it.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Garby continues reeling in the rope.

						 NOWLAN
			    I'm running out of shells!

						 MERRITT
			    They're not.

	    The shoot out between Coblentz's troops and Merritt and Nowlan
	    continues.  But for every Android they kill, another takes
	    it's place.


	    INT. AIR DUCT -- DAY

	    The crate of explosives drags along the inside of the airduct,
	    coming closer to Hallway #13.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Garby continues gets to the end of the rope, and pulls the
	    crate of explosives into the hallway.

						 GARBY
			    Got it!

	    Merritt tosses Garby his gun.  She catches it with one hand,
	    turns, and blows away an advancing android.

	    Merritt races to the crate, hefts it to his shoulder.


										(CONTINUED)

													    80.


						 MERRITT
			    Ready!

	    All three race into the Command Center, slamming the door
	    behind them.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    Nowlan locks the door seconds before the Androids reach it.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Coblentz and the androids begin scratching at the door with
	    their aluminum fingernails.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    The scratching fingernails creates a sound which drives them
	    up the walls.  Gernsbeck puts his hands over his ears and
	    closes his eyes.

	    Merritt, Nowlan, and Garby live with it.

	    Merritt begins rigging a detonator to the case of explosives,
	    and secures the explosives to a rolling file cart.

						 MERRITT
			    When this button's pushed, everything
			    goes.  Blam.

						 NOWLAN
			    Looking for volunteers?

						 MERRITT
			    We do it from across the room.  With
			    a bullet.  I think I can hit it.

	    Nowlan nods without conviction.  The detonator button is a
	    VERY small target.

	    The scratching stops, and Gernsbeck opens his eyes, looking
	    at the monitor.  His face shows terror.

						 GERNSBECK
			    They're coming.

						 NOWLAN
			    How many?

						 GERNSBECK
			    All of them.

										(CONTINUED)

													    81.


	    Nowlan looks to Merritt.

						 MERRITT
			    How many shells do you have left?

	    Nowlan checks his rifle, then breaks open his pistol.

						 NOWLAN
			    Three rifle, two pistol.

	    Garby checks her pistol.

						 GARBY
			    Four.

	    Merritt checks his shotgun.

						 MERRITT
			    Four shells.

						 NOWLAN
			    That's only thirteen rounds for a
			    couple hundred Androids.

						 MERRITT
			    How much time left until the shuttle's
			    fueled?

						 NOWLAN
			    Fifteen minutes.

						 MERRITT
			    We've got to hold them off.

	    Merritt looks at Nowlan.

						 MERRITT
			    Save one bullet to shoot the detonator.

	    Garby grabs the metal rods from the uniform closet.

						 GARBY
			    We can use these as spears.  When our
			    ammo runs out.

	    Merritt nods... Then the first bullets begin spattering
	    through the barricaded windows.

	    EVERYONE hits the dirt, weapons ready.					 
	    Merritt lands next to Nowlan on the floor.

						 MERRITT
			    Well, buddy, you know that fight you
			    and me was gonna have?

										(CONTINUED)

													    82.


						 NOWLAN
			    Yeah?

						 MERRITT
			    This is it.... Except, I always thought
			    we'd be fighting each other.

	    Nowlan smiles, and touches Merritt's shoulder.			    
	    They're equals, maybe even friends.

	    Garby tosses a spear to her father...					   
	    Then the real shooting begins.

	    BULLETS PUMMEL THE COMMAND CENTER, blasting the window
	    barricades to pieces.  Wood dust and smoke spatter around
	    the team as they take cover.

	    Merritt crawls to the hot wired door switch. With fifteen
	    minutes left, it's too early to hit it...

						 MERRITT
			    What the hell.

	    He clicks the walkie talkie switch.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    RALPH 124C41 leads a second wave of ANDROIDS towards the
	    Command Center... but the electronic door wooshes shut in
	    front of them.

						 RALPH
			    Open it! Open it!

	    One of the Androids tries to over ride the door at the control
	    panel... but has no mag card.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    Merritt aims his shotgun through the barricades, sights a
	    charging Android and fires.

	    BLAM!  The Droid explodes in a shower of sparks.

	    GarbY aims through the barricades at an advancing Android
	    and fires.

	    Bang!  The Android sparks and drops.  But more are coming!

	    Nowlan sights in on one of the Droids and fires.  The Android
	    drops.  He re-aims quickly and fires again.  Two hits.


										(CONTINUED)

													    83.


	    Gernsbeck jabs through the barricades with his metal spear,
	    poking through an Android's eye and out the back of his head. 
	    The Droid goes down, sparking and screaming.

	    Merritt sees two Androids coming from the left and blasts
	    both of them with one shot.

	    Garby fires at the three Androids rushing her, hitting two
	    of them.  Her third shot misses... and the Android continues
	    down the hall towards her.

	    Nowlan sights a third Android and fires.  Bang!

	    Nowlan's bullet hits one Android, sparking his face, and
	    ricochets to hit a second Droid in the chest.  Both go down.

						 NOWLAN
			    Hey.  A two-fer.

	    THE THIRD ANDROID continues rushing at Garby.  Now only five
	    feet away from her.  She aims her pistol at him and fires.

	    Click.  Out of shells.

						 GARBY
			    Shit.

	    The Android reaches through the broken window and grabs Garby
	    by the neck, strangling her.

	    Gernsbeck spears another Android through the eye.

	    Merritt sights another rushing Android and blows him to hell.

	    Garby tries pulling away from the Android, only succeeds in
	    dragging the droid through the window into the Command Center.

	    The Android continues strangler her.  She's turning blue.
	    She tries to scream for help, but only gurgles.  She can't
	    be heard over the gunfire from the Army of Androids.

	    Nowlan sees Garby struggling with the Android, spins and
	    aims at the Android, pulling the trigger three times.

	    Click.  Click.  Click.  Out of shells.

	    He clubs the Android with the rifle, careful not to hit Garby.

	    The Android lets go of Garby and faces Nowlan.

	    THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE BARRICADES, other Androids try to
	    enter the Command Center.  But Gernsbeck spears each one of
	    them through the eye socket, nose, or mouth.  Shorting them.


										(CONTINUED)

													    84.


	    Another Android starts through the barricades, and Gernsbeck
	    reaches for a spear.... all out!

						 GERNSBECK
			    Help!

	    Merritt turns in time to see the Android grab hold of
	    Gernsbeck.  He takes aim and BLASTS the droid off Gernsbeck.

	    Gernsbeck runs to the door leading to the Shuttle Bay.

						 GERNSBECK
			    We have to leave.  Now.

						 MERRITT
			    We all go at once!

	    Nowlan tries clubbing his Android with his rifle.  But the
	    Android grabs the gun and yanks it out of Nowlan's hands.

	    THE ANDROID laughs, raising the rifle to club Nowlan.

	    Merritt sees Nowlan predicament, spins, and fires his shotgun.
	    Click.  Out of shells.

						 MERRITT
			    Shit.

	    He pulls back the shotgun, throwing it like a spear.

	    The shotgun barrel hits the Android in the head... piercing
	    his face and popping out the other side.  Sparks fly.

						 NOWLAN
			    Thanks.

						 MERRITT
			    Any time.

	    WHAM!										   
	    An Android bursts through the barricades and attacks Merritt.

	    Merritt is defenseless, struggling.

	    Nowlan pulls out his pistol, trying to aim at the Android.
	    But Merritt keeps getting in the way of a clear shot.

						 NOWLAN
			    Get out of the way.  Damn!  Damn!

	    No chance of Nowlan hitting the Android from this distance
	    without endangering Merritt.



										(CONTINUED)

													    85.


	    THE ANDROID is squeezing Merritt, ribs about to snap.		  
	    Merritt can't breath.  His eyes flutter.  He's going to die.
	    He tries pulling the Android off, doesn't have the strength.

	    Then Nowlan gets an idea.

						 NOWLAN
			    Merritt!  Catch!

	    Nowlan throws his gun.  Merritt catches it with a free hand,
	    aims it over his shoulder at the Android's face, and fires.

	    BLAM!												
	    The Android's head comes off, and he falls away from Merritt.

						 MERRITT
			    Thanks.

	    Merritt gets ready to toss the gun back to Nowlan.

						 NOWLAN
			    Keep it.  One bullet left.  For the
			    detonator.

	    Merritt nods and pockets the gun.

	    THEN THE BARRICADES BLAST open and five androids storm the
	    Command Center: Coblentz HL2000, Smith EE17, and three NASTY
	    looking Biker Androids.

	    SMITH goes after Garby.								  
	    COBLENTZ goes after Nowlan.							   
	    The three BIKERS go after Merritt.

	    Gernsbeck goes out the door, leaving it open.

	    Garby rolls across the floor, coming up with the fire axe.
	    She faces Smith EE17 with the axe, ready for battle.

	    Nowlan pulls a hanger pole from the closet, holding it like
	    a bo as he faces off with Coblentz HL2000, ready for battle.

	    Merritt grabs the knife from the counter, spinning around to
	    keep the three Biker Droids away.


	    INT. HALLWAY #7 -- DAY

	    Gernsbeck huddles in the hallway near the Command Center
	    door, afraid to go down the hallways to the Shuttle Bay alone.

													    86.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    Smith EE17 gives Garby an aluminum smile seconds before
	    striking out at her with one of his pincher-claws.

	    Garby jumps away, the claw snaps on a pipe, severing it.

						 SMITH EE17
			    That could have been your neck.

						 GARBY
			    This could be your face.

	    She swings the fire axe at Smith's face, but he blocks it
	    with his arm, deflecting the blow.

						 SMITH EE17
			    Sure you don't want to be my main
			    squeeze?

	    Smith reaches out for her with his claw, snapping it closed
	    only inches from her face.  Garby is on the defensive.

		

	    Nowlan swings his hanger pole bo at Coblentz, who ducks and
	    rolls away.

						 COBLENTZ
			    You're SCRAP. All humans are SCRAP.

	    Nowlan swings again, just missing Coblentz's head.		 
	    Coblentz rolls again, this time popping to his feet by the
	    pipe Smith has severed.

	    Nowlan uses the pole as a spear, charging Coblentz.

	    Coblentz tears the pipe off the wall and uses it as a bo,
	    deflecting Nowlan's spear.

	    Coblentz and Nowlan engage in a bo fight.  Blocking, swinging,
	    thrusting their weapons at each other.

		

	    Merritt is surrounded by the three BIKER DROIDS.  He springs,
	    swinging the knife around and keeping the Bikers at bay.

	    The LEAD BIKER laughs.

						 BIKER
			    Why do you fight us, alien?  Look at
			    yourself.  We're just like you.
			    Prisoners of the humans....

										(CONTINUED)

													    87.


	    All three close in again, and Merritt spins, slashing the
	    knife across all three Droid chests.  Sparking off each one
	    of them as the blade screams over steel.

						 MERRITT
			    There's two sides to everything. 
			    I've chosen mine.

						 BIKER
			    You're one of us.  An outsider.

						 MERRITT
			    Two differences: I'm flesh, you're
			    steel.  You kill because you like it.
			    I kill only in self-defense.

						 BIKER
			    Three: You bleed, we don't.

	    WHAM!  The three attack simultaneously.  Three against one.

		

	    Garby bumps against the wall.							 
	    Nowhere to run.										
	    She has to fight.									   
	    She swings the fire axe out at Smith.

	    Smith pulls back, the axe whizzes past.					 
	    Missing.											  
	    He laughs.

						 GARBY
			    Let's make this quick.

						 SMITH EE17
			    Whatever you like.

	    Smith grabs the axe in his pincher and tries to yank it out
	    of Garby's hands.  She holds on, as Smith twists.  Spinning
	    her off her feet onto the floor.

						 SMITH EE17
			    Sitting this one out?

	    But Garby's still got the axe in her hands.

		

	    Coblentz swings his pipe at Nowlan's head.			  
	    WHACK!

	    Nowlan blocks it just in time.							
	    Coblentz laughs and swings again.  WOOSH!

										(CONTINUED)

													    88.


						 COBLENTZ
			    Silicon works faster than brain matter. 
			    I know where you're going to swing
			    even before you do.

						 NOWLAN
			    Really?

	    Nowlan fakes left, swings right.  And Coblentz blocks it.

						 COBLENTZ
			    Yes.

	    Nowlan fakes left, but SWINGS left.  Coblentz blocks it.

	    Coblentz laughs and flips the pipe into his hands like a
	    spear.  Then charges at Nowlan.						    
	    Nowlan is trapped.

		

	    Merritt has all three Biker Droids attacking from different
	    sides, and swings into action.

	    Kicking backwards, he hits BIKER #2 in the chest, swinging
	    forward, he hits BIKER #3 in the face, spinning, he hits the
	    LEAD BIKER in the neck.								  
	    All in one move.									    
	    All three go down...

						 MERRITT
			    My lucky day.

	    The three roll to their feet and attack again!

	    Merritt spins with his knife, sparking off all three Droid's
	    chest, and forcing them back.							 
	    For a second.								   
	    Then they ATTACK!

		

	    Smith EE17 looks down at Garby and smiles aluminum teeth.

						 SMITH EE17
			    Not so fast, sugar.

	    Garby tries to squirm away without giving up her grip on the
	    fire axe.  Impossible.

	    Smith moves his face in close, then his SECOND set of aluminum
	    teeth shoot out at her on their metal teether.

	    The teeth come within inches of Garby's face and SNAP closed.

										(CONTINUED)

													    89.


	    Garby twists the axe handle in her hands, popping it out of
	    Smith's grip.

	    She pivots the axe so that it swings...					 
	    Cutting off Smith's spare teeth at the tether.

						 SMITH EE17
			    Ahhhh!

	    Smith screams and falls back.							 
	    The metal teeth scurry along the floor like a snake.

	    Garby SLAMS the axe head down on them, smashing them to
	    sparking pieces.

						 SMITH EE17
			    Play time is over.

	    Smith attacks.										 
	    Pinchers ready to do real damage.

		

	    Coblentz rushes Nowlan with his pipe/spear.				  
	    Nowlan is trapped in the corner.

						 COBLENTZ
			    No escape, screw.

	    Nowlan twirls the pole in his hands, hitting the counter
	    top, POLE VAULTING over the counter out of harm's way.

	    Coblentz spear jambs into the wall where Nowlan was standing
	    only seconds ago.

						 NOWLAN
			    Your silicon chips missed that one,
			    huh?  Did they see this one coming?

	    WHAM!												
	    Nowlan spins the pole, cracking it into Coblentz's head with
	    enough force to send him over the counter.

	    Now Coblentz is weaponless.							   
	    The pipe still stuck in the wall.

	    Nowlan jabs Coblentz back.							   
	    Coblentz spins and strikes out at his face with a steel hand.
	    Nowlan uses the bo to block.

	    CRACK!											    
	    Coblentz cuts the pole in half with a powerful blow.

	    Now Nowlan has two short sticks... And Coblentz ATTACKS!

													    90.


	    INT. HALLWAY #13 -- DAY

	    Ralph 124C41 and the second wave of Androids (three times as
	    many as the first wave) finally crack open the door and rush
	    down the hall to the Command Center.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    Merritt has three Bikers attacking simultaneously.

	    When he pulls his fist back to hit Biker #2, his elbow jabs
	    Biker #3 in the throat.  After punching Biker #2, he uses
	    his left hand to punch the Lead Biker.

	    All three move back for about a second, and then attack again.

						 MERRITT
			    Don't you guys ever give up?

						 BIKER
			    Don't you?

						 MERRITT
			    Never.

	    Biker #3 charges him.  Merritt jumps up, landing a two footed
	    kick into the Biker's chest.

	    BIKER #3 slams back, head crashing into a monitor.  Explosion
	    of sparks as the Biker Droid short circuits.

						 MERRITT
			    One down.

	    Biker #2 tries to jump him, but Merritt twists his fist,
	    using the knife to sever the power cord on the Droid's neck. 
	    The knife's follow through almost cuts off Biker #2's head.

	    BIKER #2 hits the floor in two pieces: Head and body.

	    Merritt turns to the Lead Biker.

						 MERRITT
			    Ready for yours?

						 BIKER
			    More than ready.

	    Merritt and the Biker circle each other like caged beasts.

	    Biker #2's severed head waits until Merritt gets close before
	    it bites him on the leg.


										(CONTINUED)

													    91.


	    Merritt screams, then PUNTs the head out the window and
	    returns his attention to the Lead Biker.

	    Too late.  The Lead Biker charges at him.

	    Merritt feels (Coblentz's) metal pole at his back.  Trapped!

	    When the Lead Biker gets close, Merritt just steps aside.
	    Allowing the Biker to skewer himself on the pole.

						 MERRITT
			    Hope you got my point.

				

	    Smith EE17 attacks Garby, pinchers ready.

	    Garby swings her axe at Smith's head.

	    Smith ducks, and the blade whizzes overhead.

	    Garby swings her axe at Smith's legs.

	    Smith jumps, and the blade whizzes under foot.

	    Garby swings her axe at Smith's stomach...

						 GARBY
			    Ah, just right.

	    WHACK!  SLAM!  SPARKS!								   
	    The blade connects big time, cutting Smith in half.		    
	    Both halves hit the floor: Dead.

		

	    Coblentz HL2000 attacks Nowlan.  Nowlan uses the two halves
	    of the pole as escrima sticks, pummeling the Android.

	    Coblentz knocks Nowlan to the floor.  The two wrestle across
	    the floor, Coblentz the stronger of the two.

	    Nowlan has the Droid's stitched body pressing him to the
	    floor and gets an idea.  He snatches up a piece of broken
	    glass, and cuts one of the stitchings.

						 NOWLAN
			    Let's see what happens if I pull a
			    few strings.

	    He yanks open the seam, exposing Coblentz's metal insides.

	    Coblentz picks up a chunk of fallen metal and gets ready to
	    brain Nowlan.

										(CONTINUED)

													    92.


	    Nowlan uses the broken glass to cut wires and hoses in
	    Coblentz's chest, sparking and shorting and causing a gush
	    of lubricating fluid to spew out.

	    Coblentz falls over, twitching... then dies.

	    Nowlan moves to his feet and looks from Merritt to Garby.

						 MERRITT
			    Get to the shuttle.  I'll hold the
			    rest of them off.

						 NOWLAN
			    I'll help.

						 MERRITT
			    Do be a fool.  Get moving.  Take the
			    explosives.

	    Nowlan and Garby nod, and push the rolling cart of explosives
	    out the open door.

	    CRASH!											    
	    Behind Merritt, a dozen Androids lead by Ralph 124C41 break
	    through the barricades.

						 RALPH
			    Remember, he's mine.

	    Merritt is completely outnumbered... and weaponless.


	    INT. HALLWAY #7 -- DAY

	    Gernsbeck hears people coming through the Command Center
	    door and tries to hide....

	    But it's Garby and Nowlan, pushing the cart.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Thank God. I've been waiting for you.

						 NOWLAN
			    Let's go.

	    The three run down Hallway #7, pushing the cart of explosives
	    in front of them.

	    AT THE CORNER TO HALLWAY #6 there is a moment of suspense.
	    They don't know if Androids lay in wait around the corner.

	    Nowlan rolls out, ready for action.

													    93.


	    INT. HALLWAY #6 -- DAY

	    Nothing.											  
	    The hallway is empty all the way to the shuttle bay doors.

	    Garby and Gernsbeck swing around the corner with the cart of
	    explosives.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Come on.

						 NOWLAN
			    We'll wait here.  Maybe he'll need
			    some help.

						 GERNSBECK
			    You're crazy.  Fuck Merritt.

	    Gernsbeck takes off down the hall to the shuttle bay doors.

						 NOWLAN
				   (sotto)
			    Merritt's one of the few people I can
			    trust.

	    AT THE SHUTTLE BAY DOORS

	    Gernsbeck realizes he doesn't have a mag card on him.	    
	    He can't get into the shuttle.


	    INT. COMMAND CENTER -- DAY

	    Merritt faces off against Ralph, the other Androids ringing
	    the room around them.

						 RALPH
			    Ready to die, Alien?

						 MERRITT
			    I'm ready to finish what I started.
			    Turn you into scrap.

	    WHACK!											    
	    Merritt kicks Ralph in the face.						   
	    Ralph laughs it off, pressing Merritt back towards the wall.

	    Ralph moves in to attack.

	    Merritt scoops up a chair, using it as a shield.			  
	    Like a lion tamer keeping an angry cat at bay.

	    Ralph tries punching around the chair, but can't reach
	    Merritt's face.  He kicks up, forcing Merritt to jump back.

										(CONTINUED)

													    94.


						 RALPH
			    No one can fight an Android and win.
			    Flesh can't win against steel.

						 MERRITT
			    Is that right, tin man?

	    Merritt SLAMS the chair into Ralph, crashing him backwards.

	    Ralph hits the counter and GROWLS, charging at Merritt.

	    Merritt holds up the chair, but Ralph bats it out of his
	    hands and keeps on coming.

	    Ralph and Merritt trade punches.						   
	    Merritt takes the brunt.								 
	    He can't hold off this Android himself.

						 RALPH
			    You're no man of steel, Alien.

	    Ralph hits Merritt it the face.

						 RALPH
			    Die slow or die fast.

	    Merritt feels the gun in his pocket.  He could blow Ralph to
	    pieces... But he needs it for the detonator.

	    Ralph swings a fist, and Merritt rolls away, popping up near
	    the door to Hallway #7.

	    Ralph laughs, and starts towards him.

						 RALPH
			    No escape, Smov. We fight to the death.
			    Your death.

	    Merritt spots his fallen knife leaning up against a splitered
	    piece of wood.  He steps on the end, flipping it into the
	    air and catching it.

						 MERRITT
			    Come and get me.

	    Ralph takes the challenge, charging at Merritt.

	    Merritt rolls backwards through the door....


	    INT. HALLWAY #7 -- DAY

	    Merritt pops to his feet, stabbing Ralph as he comes out the
	    door.  But the knife hits his chest and SPARKS.

										(CONTINUED)

													    95.


	    THE OTHER ANDROIDS come out the door, forming a ring behind
	    Ralph 124C41.

	    Merritt swings the knife at Ralph's face, but he ducks.  
	    The knife severs the plastic casing over a power cord, sending
	    half the hallway into darkness.

	    The power cord sparks and sputters on the floor like a snake.

	    Ralph waits for Merritt to swing the knife again, then knocks
	    it from the Alien's hands.

						 RALPH
			    Now we have a fair fight.

	    Ralph moves in and begins pummeling Merritt with his fists.

	    Merritt tries blocking the blows, but flesh really is no
	    match for steel.  Ralph is going to beat Merritt to death.


	    INT. HALLWAY #6 -- DAY

	    Garby and Nowlan listen to the fight.					   
	    Garby moves to help Merritt, but Nowlan holds her back. 
	    It's Merritt's fight.


	    INT. HALLWAY #7 -- DAY

	    Ralph slams a fist so hard into Merritt's face, it knocks
	    him a dozen feet backwards.

	    Merritt hits the floor HARD.							
	    He touches the gun again, wondering if he should use it.

						 MERRITT
			    No fucking way.

	    Ralph laughs and charges him, ready to put an end to it.

	    Merritt looks up at Ralph.

						 RALPH
			    Now you die!

	    Ralph is almost on top of Merritt when he grabs the sparking
	    electrical wire and forces it into Ralph's eye socket.

	    Ralph screams, sparking, and catches fire.

						 MERRITT
			    Knew you'd get a charge out of that.


										(CONTINUED)

													    96.


	    Merritt moves to his feet as Ralph falls over, sparking,
	    twitching, dead.

	    THAT'S WHEN THE REST OF THE ANDROIDS ATTACK!			 
	    They charge at Merritt.  Two dozen metal killers.

	    Merritt RUNS!


	    INT. HALLWAY #6 -- DAY

	    Garby hears someone running around the corner, and gets ready
	    to attack.  But it's Merritt.

						 MERRITT
			    Come on!  Come on!

	    He keeps on running.  Nowlan and Garby fall in beside him.

	    THE POUNDING OF HUNDREDS OF ANDROID feet echoes, as the Army
	    Of Androids ROAR down Hallway #7 to Hallway #6.

	    Merritt, Nowlan, and Garby run like hell.

	    Then Garby trips and goes down.						    
	    Hard.

	    THE ANDROIDS round the corner from Hallway #7.

	    Merritt sees that Garby isn't with them.

						 MERRITT
			    Garby?

	    He sees her on the floor, trying to get to her feet.

	    THE ANDROIDS race towards them.

	    Merritt goes back for her.							    
	    Grabbing her hand and pulling her to her feet.			    
	    Then he rolls the explosives cart into the charging Androids,
	    knocking the three in the lead down.

						 MERRITT
			    Come on!

	    He and Garby run like hell down the hallway, until they come
	    to the shuttle bay doors.

	    AT THE SHUTTLE BAY DOORS

	    Nowlan uses his mag card to open the doors.



										(CONTINUED)

													    97.


	    Merritt pulls out his gun and takes careful aim down the
	    barrel at the detonator button.

	    THE ANDROIDS are on their feet, trying to get around the
	    explosives cart.  More and more of them pouring into the
	    hallway by the minute.

	    HUNDREDS OF ANDROIDS.

						 MERRITT
			    Ready?

						 NOWLAN
			    Do it.

	    Merritt squeezes the trigger.							 
	    Firing the last bullet.								 
	    Bang!

	    Misses the detonator, but takes off an Android's head.

						 MERRITT
			    Shit!

						 NOWLAN
			    We won't have time for lift off if we
			    can't keep them away from the shuttle.

	    THE ANDROIDS begin moving towards them.

						 GERNSBECK
			    I'll take care of it.

	    Before anyone can stop him, Gernsbeck begins charging the
	    army of Androids.

						 GARBY
			    Daddy!  No!  No!

	    Nowlan and Merritt drag Garby through the shuttle bay doors.


	    INT. SHUTTLE -- DAY

	    Nowlan locks the shuttle door behind them as Merritt starts
	    pressing buttons on the control panel.

						 MERRITT
			    Hope I remember how to drive one of
			    these things.

	    He hits a switch, and the rockets engines begin to ROAR.

													    98.


	    INT. HALLWAY #6 -- DAY

	    Gernsbeck is grabbed by a pair of androids before he can
	    make it to the detonator.  He uses all of his strength to
	    DRAG them back with him.

	    When Gernsbeck gets to the cart of explosives, an Android
	    grabs him from behind, choking him.

						 ANDROID
			    Now you die, Warden.

						 GERNSBECK
			    Go to hell.

	    Gernsbeck presses the detonator button.

	    BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM!

	    The Androids and everything else in the hallway is blown to
	    fiery bits.  Flames race the hallways.


	    EXT. PLANET ISAAC -- DAY

	    The shuttle takes off from the docking bay, zooming away
	    from the surface of Isaac and it's twin suns.


	    EXT. OUTER SPACE -- NIGHT

	    The shuttle zooms away from Planet Isaac.

	    BLAAAAAAAAM!										   
	    A massive explosion rips through the planet, turning the
	    surface into a fireball.


	    INT. SHUTTLE -- NIGHT

	    Merritt, Garby, and Nowlan look out the shuttle window at
	    the fireball which was once the planet Isaac.

						 MERRITT
			    Think we used too much dynamite?

	    The three are safe.

						 MERRITT
			    Fuel cells will take us all the way
			    to Saturn.

						 NOWLAN
			    We're safe.

										(CONTINUED)

													    99.


						 GARBY
			    Going home.

	    Garby smiles, and touches Merritt's shoulder.


	    EXT. SHUTTLE -- NIGHT

	    The shuttle zooms off into deep space and we....

												FADE OUT.
