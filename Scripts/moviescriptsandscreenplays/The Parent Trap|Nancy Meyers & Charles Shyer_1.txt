        THE PARENT TRAP 
        FADE IN:

            EXT.  MOUNTAIN ROAD - SOUTHERN MAINE - DAY
            
            A caravan of THREE CAMP BUSES with the name CAMP WALDEN FOR
            GIRLS emblazoned on their sides climb a tree-lined road.  The Buses turn down a
            narrow lane and pass through a freshly painted wooden gate as the CAMERA RISES giving us a
            sweeping view of beautiful CAMP WALDEN.  A magnificent lake sparkles in the distance
            with red canoes lined up on its shores. over this quiet serenity we HEAR the Bus HORNS
            HONKING to announce the first day of camp has officially begun. 
              EXT.  MAIN LODGE - CAMP WALDEN
Girls.  Girls.  Girls.  Tall ones, short ones and
            everything in between.  Some carry pillows, others carry stuffed animals, all wear
            backpacks.  There are more pony-tails swinging at this moment than you can
            imagine.  Teenage Counselors try to control the pandemonium without much luck. 
            The only men in sight, the Bus Drivers,. toss duffel bags out of the buses and into a
            large pile.
MARVA KULP, the owner of the Camp, late sixties, four and a half feet
            tall, wearing khaki shorts, talks through a BULLHORN.  Next to her stands her
            daughter and first lieutenant, MARVA JR., just under six feet, tanned and humorless. 
            She also holds a BULL-HORN.
  MARVA SR. 
            (into bull-horn) 
            Good morning, ladies and welcome to Camp Walden.  I'm
            Marva, your Camp Director and this is my daughter and right hand man, Marva, Jr. Girls,
            please find your duffels as quickly as possible, we've got a big, big day ahead of
            us.  Marva,'bunk assignments, if you please.
Marva Jr. lifts her BULL-HORN and starts barking out bunk assignments
            right into her Mother's ear.  Marva Sr. covers her ears in pain.
MARVA JR. 
            Berg, Kate, Iroquois, bunk seven Berg, Lily!  Chickasaw,
            bunk five! 
            (we HEAR a SCREAM of joy) Burnham, Daisy!  Kickapoos, bunk
            three!

A MOUNTAIN OF DUFFEL BAGS sits
            on the quad as one eleven year-old, Hallie Parker, pops up from behind the huge pile.
  Hallie 
            (to herself)
okay, found my duffel, now the question is, how do I get it out?
Hallie wears overalls, a baseball cap that says Girls Rule, sunglasses,
            and a sweat-shirt tied around her waist.  Her ears. are pierced, her hair is short,
            she wears bright red high tops and metallic blue nail polish.
Hallie 
            (finding her duffel bag strap) 
            Okay, I can do it.
Hallie pulls on the strap with all her might, her face turning bright
            red.
Hallie 
            Okay, no I can't.
A skinny kid with a long neck, ZOE, steps in, carrying her duffel bag on
            her shoulder and chewing gum.
ZOE 
            You must be new.
Hallie 
            How can you tell?
ZOE 
            You didn't know to grab your duffel before the apes tossed it
            into the heap.  I would say you need some serious help.
Hallie 
            Thanks. it's the big blue one.
ZOE 
            (helps Hallie pull on the 
            strap) 
            Cool hat.
Hallie
Thanks, it was a going away gift from my Dad.
As Zoe and Hallie pull on the strap together, the Bus Drivers
            
            toss another half-dozen new duffels onto the pile.  Hallie
            and 
              
3 
              
Zoe shoot the Bus Drivers a look.  Just then, NICOLE, a strapping
            ten year-old in a tie-dye T-shirt, beads and a bandana around her head arrives and easily
            pulls her duffel from the center of the pile.
Hallie 
            Now that's my kind of woman.
ZOE
(cups hands around her mouth) 
            Hey!  Tie-Dye girl!
Nicole turns around.
Hallie 
            Would you mind giving me a hand?  My duffells the red one,
            way in there.
Nicole nods and drops her duffel.  It LANDS right on Zoe's foot.
Hallie 
            You okay?
ZOE 
            (grabbing her foot) 
            That would be negative.
Nicole yanks Hallie's duffel out of the pile and drops it on Zoe's other
            foot. 
              
ZOE 
            Aaaahhh!   Why, thank you.
NICOLE 
            (smiles) 
            You're welcome.
(reading name-tag on Hallie's duffel) 
            Hey, you're from California?
ZOE 
            You are?  Do you live in Hollywood?
NICOLE
Do you like live next door to a movie star?
Hallie 
            -- What are you two, Lucy and Ethel? 
            I’ve never even been to Hollywood.  I live in Napa,
            that's in Northern California, and I live next door to a vineyard.
4 
              
              
ZOE 
            A whatyard?
Hallie 
            A vineyard.  It's where you grow grapes to make
            wine.  That's what we do, me and my I)ad, we own a vineyard.  What bunk are you
            guys in?
ZOE/NICOLE 
            (at the same time) 
            Arapaho.
Zoe and Nicole look at each other, not thrilled.
MARVA JR. 
            (yells from bull-horn) 
            Parker, Hallie... 
              
              
  Hallie 
            (yells back) 
            Yo! Right here!
MARVA JR. 
            (looks over and waves) 
            Arapaho!  Bunk eleven!
The Girls slap hands and head off toward their bunk.
Hallie
So, either of you by any chance know how 
             to play poker?
(Nicole and Zoe shake their 
             heads)
No? That's a shame.  So, tell me, how much cash did you guys bring
            with you this summer?
As the Girls walk off, CAMERA BOOMS UP to a LIMOUSINE pulling up in
            front of the MAIN LODGE.  Heads turn as the Driver, in a dark suit and cap, hops out
            and opens the limousine's back door.  Out steps a PROPER BRITISH BUTLER, perfect
            posture, elegant grey suit, extremely proper demeanor.  His name is MARTIN and he
            speaks with a stuffy ENGLISH ACCENT.
Martin leans into the back-seat and takes the hand of an elegantly
            dressed eleven year-old, Annie James. 
            Annie wears a powder blue suit and carries a purse and a small vanity case.  Her hair
            is perfectly neat, shoulder length and worn with a powder blue head band.  As Annie
            turns to Martin, we see her face and we realize SHE LOOKS ECACTLY LIKE
            Hallie Parker!  Same hair color,
            same eyes, same nose, same mouth, same height, same weight.  Identical in every way.
5 
              
              
MARTIN 
            Well, here we are - Camp Walden For 
                Girls.
    (looks around, with disdain) 
            We travelled six thousand miles for... this? 
            Annie looks around.  She also speaks with a BRITISH
            ACCENT. 
            Annie 
            It's rather picturesque, wouldn't you 
             say?
MARTIN
I don't know if that's precisely the term 
            I would use.
Annie smiles as the Limo Driver lines up four pieces of matching luggage
            by Martin's side.
MARTIN
So, lets review, your Mother's list, shall 
             we?
(pulls out a typed list) 
            Vitamins?
Annie 
            Check.
MARTIN 
            Minerals?
Annie 
            Check.
MARTIN
List of daily intake of fruits and vegetables?
Annie 
            Check.  Check. 
            (Martin looks up) 
            Check for fruits, check for vegetables.  Go on.
            
              
              
              
MARTIN
Herbal teas, sugarless candy, sun block, lip balm, insect repellent,
            umbrella, stationary, stamps, fountain pen, flashlight, batteries, photos of your mother,
            grandfather and of course.... 
            (turns page) 
            Yours truly!
6 
              
              
Annie 
            Got it all, I think.
MARTIN 
            Oh, and here's a little something from your 
                     Grandfather, a
            brand new deck of cards. 
                   Maybe you'll find someone
            on this continent 
                    who can actually
            whip your tush at poker.
Annie 
                   I doubt it but
            thanks.  And thanks for 
                    bringing me, Martin.
Martin is suddenly overwhelmed with emotion.  He looks away, about
            to burst into tears, quickly grabs Annie, hugs her tightly, then just as quickly - regains
            his dignity.
MARTIN 
            And remember, if you change your mind and want me to pick you
            up at the end of camp, I'm only a phone-call away.
Annie 
            I'll be fine.  See you in eight weeks, 
             Marty ol’ pal.
MARTIN 
             Eight weeks it is, Queen of my Heart.
Annie puts out her hand, Martin places his hand over hers and they
            proceed to do an extravagantly worked out SECRET HANDSHAKE - with all kinds of moves in it
            including a butt bump, a wave under the chin and a shimmy to-and-fro.  When it's
            over, Martin resumes his proper Butler demeanor and gets into the Limo.  As the Limo
            pulls away, we HEAR: 
              
MARVA JR. 
            Annie James?
Annie 
            Yes, hello.  I apologize if I'm late.  My plane was
            fogged in leaving Heathrow.  You )mow how- London is in June.
JR. 
            Can't say that I do.  Never been to jolly 01- England but
            never-the-less,.mllady, welcome to the U.S. of A. and what we like to think of as the most
            beautiful spot on God's green earth - Camp Walden. 
               (takes a huge sniff of fresh air)
            
               Oh, jeez, a bug flew up my nose. 
               (starts honking and swatting at 
            (MORE)

MARVA JR. (cont'd) 
            her nose and generally going 
             crazy)
Annie 
            Are you all right?
MARVA JR. 
            Oh sure.  Just one of the hazards of camp life.  You
            have a little shnoz ... you-11 be fine.
(indicates her' own nose) 
             With this honker, you got problems. 
            (looks at Arnie's luggage) 
             Okey-dokey, let's get this show on the road.
Annie 
            Can you manage?
MARVA JR. 
            Manage?  Uh, sure... Suppose I can... Why
            
             not?
Marva Jr. awkwardly gathers up all of Annie's luggage and leads her
            toward her bunk. 
              
              
MARVA JR. 
            I know this sounds weird, but ... have we 
             met before?
-Marva accidentally steps in a gopher hole and stumbles forward...
Annie 
               Met before?  No, no, I don't think so.
            
            (catching her) 
             I'm positive I'd remember you. 
              
EXT.  ANNIE'S BUNK - THE NAVAJOS --A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER
Marva Jr., huffing and puffing, leads Annie up the steps to her cabin.
MARVA JR. 
            Showers are to your right.  Rec room's to your left. 
            Mess hall's straight ahead.  Chow's at seven, twelve-fifteen and sixthirty. 
            Mother gives five demerits for being tardy, so don't be.
Marva Jr. holds the screen door open with her LEG as she balances
            Annie's suitcases under her arms

MARVA JR 
            Welcome to the Navajos. 
              
INT. NAVAJO BUNK
Eight cots with Seven Girls unpacking and getting into their
            uniforms.  Annie and Marva Jr. enter.
MARVA JR. 
            New arrival, girls.   Name's James.
A cherubic-looking Black girl, JACKIE, her hair in corn rows, looks up
            from her Game Boy.
JACKIE 
            Your name's James? 
              
              
MARVA JR. 
            Annie James.  Just arrived from London, 
             England.
(dropping Annie's luggage) 
            First time in the country, I believe, 
             right, Ann?
Annie 
            Yes, ma'am, just arrived this morning, which is actually
            tonight for me, which makes this tomorrow morning, which... (notices everyone watching
            her) makes me a ' bit jet-lagged. 
                                   
            (notices empty cot) 
            This one mine?
MARVA JR. 
            Yep.  Has to be made every morning right after
            reveille.  Mother's a stickler for neatness, so remember to police your area
            daily.  Now, change into your uniform, James, chow's at thirteen hundred.and Mother
            gives five demerits...
Annie 
            --for being-tardy. (MARVA stops short) I remember.
CROSBY, a freckled camper, with a CD Walkman around her neck, catches
            Annie's eye and smiles.
Annie 
            .But thank you for reminding me, Ma'am.
9 
              
              
MARVA JR 
            Quite welcome, James.
(as she exits) 
            Introduce yourself, ladies.  Be sociable.
Marva trips over a sneaker on her way out.  The Girls hold in their
            laughter as she BANGS her head on the door frame.  As soon as she's gone, the Girls
            crack-up.
CROSBY ' 
            How scary is it that that woman's in charge? 
              
INT. DINING HALL - TWENTY MINUTES LATER.
A hundred and fifty Girls, all in camp uniforms, have arrived for
            dinner.  Two lines of Girls approach a central buffet table.
IN ONE LINE we find Hallie.  IN THE OTHER LINE, headed right toward
            her, is Annie.  Both Annie and Hallie are busy talking to their friends and don't
            notice each other.
As Annie reaches the front of the line and approaches the buffet table,
            Hallie does the same.  For a split second, they stand directly next to each
            other.  Just as they are about to see each other, Marva, Sr. steps between them with
            a plate full of food.
MARVA SR. 
            Excuse me, girls ... I've just got to have 
             a scoop of those gorgeous strawberries. 
                                   
            (holding a large spoonful, turns to Hallie) 
            Care for some?
Hallie 
            Oh, no thanks, can't, I'm allergic. 
            Hallie takes her plate and moves off. 
            MARVA SR. 
            (turns to Annie on her other 
             side) .
 How bout you, dear?  Strawberries?
Annie 
            (moving off) 
            Sorry, wish I could but I'm allergic.
MARVA SR. 
               (confused, looks back to 
               Hallie, who is now gone) 
              Oh, yes, allergic, you just told me that.
            
            (MORE)
I 0
MARVA SR. (cont'd) 
            How'd you get over there?  Oh, well, 
            first day of camp... You'll have to 
            excuse the ol’ girl.  At least I'm not Putting salt
            in the sugar shakers yet.  I mean, sugar in the... 
                                       
            (turns back to Annie, who is 
                                        
            also gone) 
              Now, where'd she go? 
              
INT. SHOWER HOUSE - LATER THAT EVENING
Hallie ENTERS a shower stall and begins washing her hair.  She
            wears a small GOLD LOCKET around her neck.  A beat later, Annie ENTERS the stall next
            to her and turns on the water.  She wears the IDENTICAL LOCKET.  The Girls can
            not see each other over the partition.  Hallie drops her soap and it slides into
            Annie's stall.  Annie reaches over the partition and hands the soap back to
            Hallie.
Annie 
            Here you go.
Hallie 
                     Got it! 
            Thanks.
As their FINGERS TOUCH, they both STAND FROZEN for a moment... a current
            of some sort running between them.  They each TURN AND LOOK AT THEIR TOUCHING
            HAMS.  Then they both let go.  Hallie lifts her locket, sucks on it.  Annie
            does -the exact same thing as she turns off the water... 
              
EXT.  CAMP - THE FOLLOWING DAY
A FENCING MATCH.  Two Girls, each wearing nylon jackets and
            wire-mesh masks are in the middle of a duel.  The First Girl is whipping the Second's
            butt, knocking her sword out of her hand and pinning her against the wall.  The other
            Campers applaud and cheer.
Both Girls take off their masks and we see Hallie is the victor.
MARVA JR. 
            Touche!  Excellent, girls. 
            (raises Hallie's arm) 
            The winner and still undefeated champ, Hallie Parker!
Hallie takes a bow and moves off with her-friends.  Annie,
            
            Crosby and Jackie pass by in time to
MARVA JR. 
            Do we have any challengers?
Annie 
            (pulling on a mask) 
            Sure.  I'll take a whack at it.
She snaps on a vest, flips the sword into the air and catches it, then
            nods to Marva, Jr.
MARVA JR. 
            (blows her whistle) 
            En garde!
Hallie, still in her mask, turns to see Annie in her mask and
            vest.  Annie SALUTES briskly with her sword.  Hallie hesitates, then does the
            same.  They stand on guard... looking like bookends.  Marva, Jr. blows the
            whistle again and...
THE DUEL BEGINS
Hallie lunges, Annie parries, then attacks.  Hallie tries to knock
            the sword out of Annie's hand but Annie deflects the blade, whirls around and
            lunges.  Point for Annie!
Hallie gets the jump on Annie and comes in low.  Point!
            
            Hallie lunges but Annie catches her sword and sweeps it in a
            full circle pulling them together, mask-to-mask.  They break.
Hallie charges but Annie side-steps and Hallie runs past her. 
            Hallie stops and whips around to find Annie lunging toward her. ..Hallie steps back, loses
            her balance and falls butt-first into a WATER TROUGH, landing with a huge splash. 
            The Campers explode with laughter.
Annie reaches out to help Hallie but Hallie grabs Annie's hand and yanks
            her into the trough.  The Campers crack-up as the two Girls sit soaking,
            side-by-side.  They climb out together and angrily pull off their masks.  Annie
            tosses her long hair as Hallie shakes her short hair dry.
MARVA JR. 
            Looks like we got ourselves a new camp champ.  Miss Annie
            James!  Let's'shake hands, girls.
Neither girl turns around.
MARVA JR. 
            Girls!
Annie and Hallie turn, hands extended.  And for the first
            
            time, THEY LOOK INTO EACH OTHER'S FACES.  They freeze.
            
            Speechless. it's like looking into a mirror.  Hallie
            extends 
            her hand...Annie reaches for it.
12. 
              
              
CLOSE ANGLE - THEIR HANDS
as they touch, something electric again passes between them.
            
            Annie AND Hallie
            
            look down at their hands, then up at each other... not knowing
            what to say.  Just then, their friends join them and they immediately slip their
            hands into their pockets - at the same time.  Their friends stop in their tracks and
            look from Annie to Hallie - stunned at the resemblance.  The lunch bell RINGS and
            everyone else on the lawn runs toward the Mess Hall.
Hallie 
            Why's everyone staring?
Annie 
                      Don't
            you see it?
                     
            Hallie 
                      See
            what?
Annie 
             The resemblance between us.
Hallie 
                     Between you
            and me?!  A resemblance?  Let 
                     me see, turn
            sideways ... 
                    (Annie turns)
            
                    Now the other way...
            
               (Annie does) 
             well, your eyes are much closer together than mine. 
            Your  ears stick out, your teeth are crooked and that nose... well, don't worry,
            those things can be fixed.
Zoe and Nicole laugh.
CROSBY 
            (to Annie) 
            Want me to deck her for you? 
              
Hallie 
            Hold on, I'm not quite finished.  You want
            
             to )mow the real difference between us?
Annie 
            I have class and you don't?  Or I know how
            
             to fence and you don't?  Take your pick.
Hallie angrily steps forward but Marva steps between them.
13 
              
              
MARVA JR 
             Okay, ladies, time to break-up this 
                     little love
            fest.  Annie... Hallie... 
                (notices how they look alike)
            
                     I mean,
            Hallie... Annie...
The lunch bell RINGS again.  Jackie and Crosby pull Annie away, as
            Zoe and Nicole pull Hallie in the other direction.
ZOE 
            That girl is a major loser.
NICOLE 
            Yeah.  Too bad you couldn't look like somebody cooler.
ANGLE - Annie AND HER PALS - TRACKING
Annie 
            Do we really look as much alike as I think we do?.
CROSBY 
             It's just a weird freak of nature. (slaps her on the
            back) 
            Please accept my condolences.
Annie looks back at Hallie, who is sneaking a look at her.  She
            quickly turns away. 
              
              
              
              
              
INT.  ANNIE'S BUNK - THE NAVAJOS - NIGHT
CLOSE on a PILE of CHANGE, crumpled DOLLAR BILLS, CANDY BARS. 
            ANGLE BACK to see a Crowd of Girls watching a poker game Annie, with a Tootsie Pop
            dangling from the side of her mouth, is playing with Four Older Girls and winning
            big-time.
Annie 
            Sorry, ladies, read ‘em and weep.
Annie spreads out a full house.  The Older Girls groan and toss in
            their hands, as Annie rakes in the pot.
Annie 
            So... that's-it... no other takers?
LITTLE KID 
              You've already tooken everybody...
A CRISP NEW FIVE DOLLAR BILL floats on to the cot.

HALLIE'S VOICE 
            Not everybody.
ANGLE - Hallie
standing over Annie, a smile on her face. 
              
CUT TO:
HALLIE'S   HANDSS - SKILLFULLY-SHUFFLING A DECK OF CARDS
As she deals, we see A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS of Annie and Hallie, going
            one-on-one... shuffling, dealing, drawing, bluffing... First Annie rakes in the pot...
            then Hallie... then Annie... it's back and forth... until finally the entire pot sits in
            front of Hallie and Annie is down to her last dollar.
Hallie 
            (tossing in her bet) 
            Three bucks.
Annie checks her hand... she's holding a straight.  She bites her
            lip... knowing she's holding a winning hand.
Hallie 
            Tell you what I'm gonna do, since you're almost tapped out...
            I'll make you a deal.  Loser jumps into the lake after the game.
Annie 
            Excellent. 
              
Nude.
Annie 
            Even more excellent. 
            (revealing her hand) 
            Queen high straight.
Hallie 
             (spreads-a full house across 
             the blanket) 
                      Start
            unzipping, Princess... full-house. 
              
EXT.  LAKE - NIGHT
CAMERA IS CLOSE on Annie's CAMP UNIFORM as it falls to the sand. 
            Annie's BARE FEET step away from the clothes.
15. 
              
              
ANGLE - THE GIRLS FROM THE POKER GAME
huddled on the shore holding candles.  Hallie stands in the center
            of the group, a content smile on her face.
ZOE 
                 (watching Annie walk to lake)
            
              That girl's butt looks awfully familiar.
            
               (off Hallie's look) 
              It does!
CLOSE - Annie
She reaches the dock, teeth chattering.  She turns back, looks at
            the Girls.  Hallie and her friends wave.  Annie salutes them.
THE LAKE
as ANNIE'S LEGS gracefully slice through the water, in a perfect
            dive.  Annie pops up in the water, looks out at the Girls but THEY ARE GONE!
ANNIE'S WET FEET hurry across the sand and arrive at where her clothes
            were but all that's left are her sneakers.
ANGLE - ANNIE'S WET AND SHIVERING FACE
Annie 
            (catching on) 
                     Let the games
            begin. 
              
EXT.  CAMP WALDEN - THE FOLLOWING I)AY
Hallie and her friends are trudging home after a hike.  They're
            hot, sweaty and tired.
Annie 
                I swear I heard that girl sneezing all the
            
                way across the mess hall this morning.
            
                (the others laugh, Hallie 
                 yawns) 
                I'm so tired.  I'm crawling back into
            bed 
            and sleeping until lunch.
NICOLE 
                (stops, looking up at the roof
            
                of their bunk) 
                That does not seem like a possibility.
Hallie 
              Why not?
16. 
              
              
              
              
NICOLE 
            (pointing) 
            That's 'why not'.
Hallie stops in her tracks, her eyes rising to THE ROOF OF THE BUNK
            where every single COT is now perched.
Hallie 
            No way. 
              
EXT.  CAMP WALDEN - NIGHT
Lights are out.  Everything is quiet and peaceful.  Suddenly,
            THREE SHADOWY FIGURES run silently toward Annie's bunk.
INT.  ANNIE'S BUNK - NIGHT
CAMERA PANS past a sleeping Jackie, Crosby and Annie.  The door
            squeaks open and Hallie steps inside.  She signals the coast is clear" and
            Nicole and Zoe tip-toe in carrying strange, 
            unidentifiable objects.  They all quickly go to work and
            we SEE: A jar of HONEY is opened and poured into a pair of Addidas.  A can of SHAVING
            CREAM is squirted onto a pillow-case. 
            A ball of TWINE is wound around a bedpost, then zigzagged
            across the room.
An industrial-size can of CHOCOLATE M UP is emptied into a bucket.
WESSON OIL is poured all over the floor.
CUT TO: 
            MORNING - A SLEEPY SEVEN YEAR-OLD WITH A BUGLE
            
            plays reveille... badly. 
            INT ANNIE'S BLINK - FOLLOWING MORNING
The bunk looks like one giant spider web.  Mazes of string
            everywhere.  The sound of EMILLE reverberates through the room as the Girls get out
            of bed, slide in the Wesson Oil, get stuck in the honey, trip over the string... lots of
            yelling and screaming.  Annie stands dripping in shaving cream. 
              
Annie
She's without a doubt, the lowest, most awful creature that ever walked
            the planet!
EXT.  ANNIE'S BUNK - SAME TIME
Hallie, Zoe and Nicole are peeking in the windows, thrilled with their
            achievement.
Hallie 
            (ala Elvis) 
            Thank you, thank you very much.
Just then, the Two Marva’s appear behind them, clipboards in hand.
MARVA SR. 
            'Morning, girls.
Hallie/NICOLE/ZOE 
            'Morning, Marva's. 
            (then, freaked out) Marva's?!?!
MARVA JR. 
            (climbing steps to Annie's bunk) Navajos... Surprise
            inspection.  Ten-shun!  Mom, why don't you do the honors...
Marva Sr. nods and reaches for the screen door handle but Hallie rushes
            to her.
Hallie 
            No, no, don't go in there!
Annie crosses to her side of the SCREEN DOOR and watches, wondering what
            Hallie's up to.
Hallie 
            one of the girls got sick last night and it's a big mess. 
            Save yourself the aggravation.  It's really disgusting.
MARVA, SR. 
            Well, if someone's sick, dear, then 1 
             must go in.-
She starts to OPEN the door, not realizing she's PULLING on a string
            attached to a BUCKET that's about to tip right over her head.  Hallie's eyes shoot up
            to the bucket, then back to Marva, Sr.
No, really, let go of that door.  I insist.  She's highly
            contagious.
18. 
              
              
Annie 
            Actually, we're all fine in here.  Unless Hallie Parker
            knows something we don't know. 
            (Annie watches Hallie's eyes go up to the bucket)
            
            Open the door and come on in, ma'am.
With that, Marva Sr. swings OPEN the door, TIPPING THE BUCKET which we
            now see is filled with HERSHEY'S SYRUP.  Marva Sr. is instantly covered head-to-toe
            in CHOCOLATE.  Marva Jr. : SCREAMS, slipping in the syrup and tumbling down the
            stairs.  Marva Sr. turns to Hallie, slowly wiping the syrup from her eyes. 
            OVER, we HEAR:
MARVA, SR. (V.0.) 
            Congratulations, ladies ... 
              
INT.  MARVAIS TENT - MOMENTS LATER
Annie and Hallie stand side-by-side as Marva Sr. paces in front of them,
            holding a towel, still wiping off chocolate.  Marva, Jr. stands at her side, also
            spotted in chocolate.
MARVA, SR. 
            -- That little stunt was the most revolting display of
            hooliganism ever to take place on these hollowed grounds.
MARVA JR. 
            A-men.
MARVA SR. 
            And worst of all, coming from two sisters who should be setting
            an example for the entire...
Annie 
            we're not sisters, ma'am. 
            Marva Sr. turns, looks at them. 
            Hallie 
            -- We've never even seen each other 
               before.
MARVA SR. 
            That's impossible.
MARVA JR. 
            I'm afraid the look-alike thing has been the crux of the
            problem, Chief.
19. 
              
              
MARVA SR. 
            Well, whatever the excuse, I recommend 
             immediate dismissal.
Hallie 
            You're sending us home?
MARVA JR. 
            (sotto)
That does somehow say we failed, doesn't 
             it, Mom?
MARVA SR. 
            All right, all right... Let me just think...
MARVA JR. 
            (under her breath) 
            Uh-oh.
The Girls both bite their lockets, nervously awaiting their fate, as
            MUSIC BEGINS. 
              
EXT.  CAMP GROUNDS - A LITTLE LATER (MUSIC OVER)
The Two Marva's lead Annie and Hallie away from their bunks and up a
            long winding hill.  Hallie balances her duffel bag .-on her shoulder, as Annie
            struggles, her full of luggage.  The rest of the Girls, and we mean, the ENTIRE CAMP,
            marches in a line behind them. 
              
INT.  ISOLATION BUNK - A FEW MINUTES LATER
The Two Marvas catch their breath as they lead Annie and Hallie into a
            bunk with just two cots and two trunks.
MARVA, SR. 
            we've got six weeks left at camp and you two are going to spend
            every glorious one of them - together.  You'll eat together, bunk together and do all
            your activities together.  Either you'll find a way to get along or you'll punish
            yourselves better than I ever could.
MARVA JR. 
            You'll thank us for this, you'll see.
The Marvas exit, leaving Annie and Hallie alone and worse, with each
            other.  Annie lifts her suitcases onto the bed and neatly starts unpacking her
            things.  Hallie, on the other hand, flips
2 0. 
              
open her trunk, unzips her duffel and shakes her things out like she's
            emptying a bag of potato chips into a bowl.
A SIGN
that reads: Isolation Table - Do Not Disturb.  CAMERA TILTS DOWN to
            see Annie and Hallie eating at a table in the MESS KUL, directly under the sign. 
            They are separate from the other Campers and eat without speaking.  Annie eats a well
            balanced meal while she reads a book as Hallie munches on a cheeseburger and plays Game
            Boy.  They never look at each other.
INT. DANCE ROOM - DAY
Annie, wearing a black leotard, her hair in a bun, stands at the ballet
            barre, practicing her plies to SWAN LAKE.
Hallie ENTERS in black bike shorts and sports bra, carrying a boom
            box.  She ignores Annie, turns on a JANET JACKSON CD and starts practicing a hip-hop
            routine.  Annoyed, Annie TURNS UP Swan Lake.  Hallie BLASTS 7anet Jackson right
            back at her.
INT.  BATH HOUSE - NIGHT
Hallie stands in front of the mirror, in pajama bottoms and a T-shirt,
            combing her wet hair.  She wraps a towel around her -head as Annie's pal, Crosby
            enters.
. CROSBY 
            (mistaking her for Annie) 
            Annie, hi!  Oh, man, I can not believe they stuck you with
            that Hallie person, I feel so bad for you.
Hallie 
            (doing her best ENGLISH ACCENT, which is pretty melodramatic)
            You have no idea, luv.  It's just bloody awful being in isolation with that dreadful
            little monster.  I do miss you so, daahling.  Come give us a kiss... Right here
            on my rosy little cheek.  Come, come, don't be shy,.. I've been ev-uh so lonely.
Crosby gives Hallie a strange look, then kisses her awkwardly on the
            cheek.  Just then, Annie ENTERS, holding her toothpaste and toothbrush.
CROSBY 
              (leaping away) 
              Annie!
21. 
              
              
Annie 
                Crosby?
Hallie 
              Guess that makes me Hallie.
Crosby's SCREAM is drowned out by the SOUND of ROLLING TH = ER.
            
              
E:XT.  ISOLATION BUNK - ANOTHER DAY
It's pouring.  The wind howls. 
              
INT. ISOLATION BUNK - SAME TIM
Hallie, in flannel p.j.'s and a sweat-shirt, is pinning up postcards and
            photos above her cot.  Annie, in matching sweater and pants, plays solitaire. 
            Now and then, each sneaks a glance at the other.
A sudden GUST of wind blows the door open, sending Hallie's stack of
            photos flying into the air.  Hallie screams, trying to salvage them, as Annie rushes
            to the door and bolts it shut.  Together, the girls tie down the blinds.  Annie
            finds Hallie's favorite stuffed animal, CUPPY, lying on the floor and hands him to Hallie.
Hallie 
            Thanks.
Annie 
             Any of your pictures ruined?
Hallie 
             (holding torn photo) 
            Only the beautiful Leo DiCaprio.
Annie 
             oh, your boyfriend?
Hallie 
             (shows her photo) 
            Yeah, right. 
            (then) 
             You've never heard of Leonardo DiCaprio?
Annie 
             I've heard of Leonardo DiVinci.
Hallie 
            'How far away is London anyway?
22 
              
Annie 
            From here - six thousand miles.  But sometimes, it seems
            much further. -How far away is your home?
Hallie 
            California’s way at the other end of the 
             country. 
            (shows her photo) 
                                   
            Actually, here's a picture of my house.
Annie 
                                   
            Wow.  It's beautiful.
Hallie 
            We've got this incredible porch that wraps around the whole
            house with rocking chairs and a hammock and stables back thataway... and this great pool
            with a sliding board... 
              
Annie 
            How cool.
(points to the back of a Man) 
            Who's that?
Hallie 
            Oh, that's my Dad... He didn't know I was taking a picture or
            he would've turned around.  He's kinda like my best friend.  We do everything
            together.
Annie reacts strangely, as if chilled, she rubs the goosebumps on her
            arms.
Hallie 
              What's the matter?
Annie 
            (pulling down her sleeves) 
            it's chilly in here, that's all.
Hallie crosses to her trunk and takes out a bag of oreos.  Sees
            Annie watching her.
  Hallie 
            Want one?
Annie 
            Sure.  I love Oreos.  At home, I eat them with peanut
            butter. 
              
23. 
              
              
Hallie 
            (stops, surprised) 
            You do?  That's so weird.  So do I.
Annie
 You're kidding?  Most people find that 
             totally disgusting.
Hallie 
             I know.  I don't get it. 
              
Annie 
            Me either.
The Girls laugh, feel a little guilty for enjoying each other's company,
            then laugh even harder.  Hallie digs a jar of peanut butter from her trunk and opens
            it.  The Girls start eating.
Hallie 
            What's your dad like?  I mean, is he the kind of father
            you can talk to or is he one of those workaholic types that says, 'I'll talk to you later,
            honey', but never really does?  I hate that.
Annie 
            I don't have a father, actually.  I mean, I had one, once,
            I suppose, but my parents divorced years ago.  My mother never even mentions
            him.  It's like he evaporated into thin air or something.
Hallie 
            It's scary the way nobody stays together 
             any more.
Annie 
            Tell me about it.
Both Girls devour their Oreos and peanut butter.
Hallie 
              How old are you?
Annie 
              (her mouth full) 
            I'll be twelve on October 11th.
HALLE 
            (chokes) 
            So will I.
2 4 
              
Annie 
            Your birthday's October 11th? 
            (Hallie nods) 
            How weird is that? 
              
Hallie 
              Very. 
              (then, realizing) 
               Hey, it stopped raining.  Want to get a
            popsicle or something?
Annie walks to Hallie and looks her up and down, really studying her,
            biting on her locket.  Hallie, feeling her eyes on her, plays with her necklace.
Hallie 
               What's the matter?
Annie 
               Hallie, what's your mother like?
Hallie 
              I never met her.  She and my Dad split up when I
            was a baby, maybe 
            even before, I'm not sure.  He doesn't like to talk about
            her... but I know she was really beautiful.
Annie 
               How do you know that?
Hallie 
            Because my Dad had this old picture of her hidden in his sock
            drawer and he caught me looking at it all the time so he gave it to me to keep.  I'm
            really thirsty, you sure you don't want to go to the canteen and get something to drink?
Annie 
              Will you stop thinking about your stomach
            
               at a time like this!
Hallie 
              At a time like what?
                     
            Annie 
                                              
            Don't you realize what's happening?!? 
                         
            Don't you find it peculiar that we both 
              look so much alike and have the same birthday and...
            
              (putting it all together) 
               Oh man, this is beyond coincidence, this is
            
               beyond imagination!  I only have a mother,
            
            (MORE)
2 5.
Annie(cont'd) you only have a father..
            You've never seen your Mom, I've never seen my Dad.  You have one old picture of your
            Mom, I have one old picture of my Dad but at least yours is probably a whole picture.
            
            (Hallie drifts over to her trunk) 
            Mine's a pathetic little thing, ripped right down the middle...
            What are you rummaging in your trunk for?
Hallie 
            (turns, holding PHOTO to her 
             chest) 
            This.  It's the picture of my Mom.  And it's ripped,
            too.
Annie 
            (a little spooked) 
            Right down the middle?
Hallie 
            (nods, nervously) 
            Right down the middle.
Annie rushes to her trunk, wildly tossing out her things.  She
            pulls out a small box, opens it and carefully takes out her RIPPED PHOTOGRAPH.  She
            walks to Hallie, holding it to her chest.
Annie 
            This is so freaky.  Okay. on the count of
            
             three, we'll show them to each other, okay?
Hallie/Annie
            
            (at the same time) 
            One... two... 
            (they put their PHOTOS 
            together) 
            Three!
INSERT - THE TWO TORN PHOTOS
which, when placed next to each other, fit perfectly, forming one
            COMPLETE PHOTO.  ANNIE'S MOM sits cozily next to IE'S MM.  Behind them, is a
            life preserver with the name on it. 
              
(biting her nails) 
            That's my Dad...
Annie 
            That Is my Mom...
2 6 
              
              
              
The Girls stare at the photo, then at each other.  A formality of
            strangeness settles on them.  They both reach for their lockets.  O.S., the
            lunch BELL SOUNDS.
Annie 
              That's the lunch bell.
Hallie
I'm not so hungry anymore.  So if your Mom is my Mom and my Dad is
            your Dad... and we're both born on October 11th, then you and I are... like... sisters.
Annie 
            Sisters?!?  Hallie, we're twins!!!
Frozen, Annie laughs then tears come to her eyes.  Hallie's eyes
            fill up and soon tears streak her cheeks.  They put their arms around each other and
            embrace, sobbing.  They pull apart, look at each other, smile, then begin to
            laugh.  Hallie bites nervously on her locket.
Annie 
              What's that locket you're biting?
Hallie 
            Oh, I got it when I was born.  It has my initial "Ho
            on it.
Annie 
              (showing hers)
I got mine when I was born, too.  Except mine has an "Au on
            it.
Hallie 
             Now I’ve got goose-bumps 
            (realizing) 
            Oh my God.  I'm a twin?!?.  There's two of me! I
            mean, two of us?  Wow!  This is like... I have to sit down.
Hallie takes a seat on Annie's bed.
Annie 
            (sitting next to her) 
            Think I'll Join you.
They sit for a beat, then:
Hallie 
             Can I see your toes?
27 
              
Annie 
            (pulling off her sneakers) 
            Sure.
Hallie kicks off her shoes and they hold their feet out in front of
            them, side-by-side.
Annie 
            Identical!  Hands?
They hold out their hands together.
Hallie 
            Oh my god.  Exactly the same.  Except I bite my
            nails.
Annie 
            You should stop.  See how nice they could look.
Hallie 
            What's your favorite color?
Annie 
            Mint Green.
Hallie 
            Oh my God Oh my God!
Annie 
            (bending her right thumb down to her wrist) 
            Can you do this with your right hand only? 
              
Hallie 
            (bending her left thumb down) 
             No, but I can do it with my left hand only.
Annie 
             If you could only eat one food for the rest of your life,
            what would it be?
Hallie 
             I don't know.  Pizza...
Annie 
             Topped with... ?
Hallie 
             Olives, green pepper...
 2 8 
              
              
  Annie 
                      
            And... ?
  Hallie 
                      
            Anchovies.
     Annie
            
                       Oh
            my God.  We are twins! 
             The Girls hug.
INT. MESS HALL - DINNER TIME
 Annie and Hallie sit at their Isolation Table, talking a
            mile-a-minute.
   Annie 
             I don't know what our parents fought 
             about but it must've been pretty dreadful
            
             for them to bisect us like this.
  Hallie 
             I can't imagine anyone not getting along
            
             with Dad. Everyone loves him.
  Annie 
             I know, same with Mom.
  Hallie 
             Tell me about her, what's she like?
  Annie 
             She's a clothing designer.
  Hallie 
             Get out!
  Annie 
             She designs the most beautiful wedding gowns. That's her
            specialty. She's 
             becoming quite famous, actually. A Princess in Greece
            just bought one of her gowns.
  Hallie 
             Wow.
  Annie 
            You know what's interesting - neither of them ever got married
            again. Has your...my... our Dad ever been close to remarrying 
             2 9. 
              
              
Hallie 
            Never.  He always says I'm the only girl in his life.
Annie 
            Mom's never come close either.  You know what this means,
            don't you?
Hallie 
            Not exactly.  You’re obviously the older one, you get
            everything before me.  What does it mean?
Annie 
            (leaning in) 
            Secretly, in their innermost heart of hearts, they must still
            be in love with each other.
Hallie 
            You think so?  Then why haven't they tried to see each
            other all these years?
Annie 
            That's the way true love works.  History's filled with
            stories of lovers parted by some silly misunderstanding.  Anyway, Mom can be
            unbelievably stubborn when she wants to be.
Hallie 
            She can't be worse than Dad
Annie 
            (laughs) 
            They sound exactly like us. 
            EXT.  ISOLATION BUNK - ESTABLISHING - LATE AT NIGHT
            
            Everything is quiet and peaceful until we HEAR:
            
            Hallie’S VOICE (O.S.)
            
            OhmyGod!
INT.  ISOLATION BUNK - SAME TIME
The room is Dark, Annie is sleeping.  Hallie
            BOLTS STRAIGHT UP IN BED. 
              
              
              
Hallie
I have a brilliant beyond brilliant idea. 
            (gets out of bed, paces) 
            (MORE)

    Hallie (cont'd)
            
            I'm a genius.  Annie, wake up, you're related to a bona
            fide genius.
Annie 
            What are you raving about?
Hallie 
            You want to know what Dad is like, right?
Annie 
            I was just dreaming I was on your front porch with him.
Hallie
-- And I'm dying to know Mom.  So what I'm thinking is ... Oh man,
            this is so brilliant, it's scary.
Annie 
            What is it?!?
Hallie
I think we should switch places.  When camp's over, I leave as you
            and go back to London and you leave as me and go to California.
(off Annie's look) 
            We can pull it off.  We're twins, aren’t we?
Annie 
            Twins from different countries, with different accents,
            different hair-styles, different vocabularies... different everything.  Hallie, we're
            totally and completely, one hundred percent different.
Hallie 
            So? What's the problem?  I'll teach you to be me and you
            teach me to be you. 
             (gets on knees and begs)C'mon, I gotta meet my Mom.
Annie 
            (gets out of bed)
 The truth is, you know, if we switch, sooner or later they'll have
            to un-switch US.
Hallie
 And when they do, they'll have-to meet again.
Annie 
             Face-to-face.  After all these years.
Hallie 
             I told you I'm brilliant. 
              
INT.  DANCE ROOM - DAY
Hallie wears Annie's leotard and Annie wears Hallie's bike shorts and
            sports bra.  Hallie holds a large pad on which she has drawn the layout of her house.
Hallie 
            -- okay, dining room's on the right, but we never eat in there
            except on Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Living room's here... Dad's office is the
            first door down the hall.  You never have to knock, if you do, he'll think it's
            weird... Down here is... 
              
F-XT.  LAKE - SUNSET
Annie and Hallie sit on the dock looking through a stack of photos, as
            the sun sinks behind them.  Annie wears Hallie's Girls Rule baseball cap.
Annie 
            This is Grandfather.
Hallie 
            He's so cute.  What do we call him?
Annie 
            Grandfather.
Hallie 
            That makes sense.
Annie 
            (showing next photo) 
            This is Martin.  He's our Butler.-
Hallie 
            We have a Butler? 
              
MAIN HALL - NIGHT'
The entire camp is assembled for a screening of Father Of The ,Bride,
            Part II, and naturally, they're laughing hysterically.  Hallie and Annie sit in the
            middle of the crowd, whispering.
Annie
But I never bite my nails!
32. 
              
              
Hallie 
              But I always do.  Daddy'll know.
Annie
(sits on her hands) 
            I can't.
Hallie 
            Want me to do it for you?
Annie rolls her eyes and starts chewing away. 
              
INT.  MESS HALL - MORNING
Annie sits in Hallie's seat and Hallie sits in Annie's.  Hallie
            sips a cup of tea, very lady-like and Annie munches on Fruit Loops.
Hallie 
            (with a proper British accent) 
            I dare say this is frightfully good tea, wouldn't you agree?
Annie 
            (playing Game Boy) 
            What-ever. 
              
INT.  ISOLATION BUNK - DAY
PANS the walls which are now covered with charts, photos and diagrams of
            Annie's London Town House and Hallie's Napa Ranch House.  COMES TO REST on
            Annie, sitting on a stool in front of a mirror, biting her locket.
Annie 
            Okay, I'm ready.
CLOSE - A DRAWER SLIDES OPEN 
            and Hallie takes out a comb and a pair of scissors.
            
            CLOSE - Annie- CLOSING HER EYES
            
            Hallie steps INT FRAME, grabs a of clump of Annie's hair and
            
            closes her eyes, as well. 
            Annie 
            Don't shut your eyes! 
            3 3 
              
              
Hallie 
            Oh, right.  Sorry.  I'm just a little
            
             nervous.
Annie 
            You're nervous?!?  An eleven year-old is 
             cutting my hair.  Go ahead, just do it!
As Hallie raises the scissors ... 
            ANGLE - THE FLOOR 
            as ANNIE'S HAIR falls in a ring around her feet.  A beat
            and CAMERA TILTS UP to Annie staring in the MIRROR at her new
            look".  Hallie leans in next to her.  They are now IDENTICAL in every way.
Annie 
            This is scary.
Hallie 
            (New Yawk accent) 
            Honey, you never looked better. 
            (realizes something) 
            OhmyGod!
Annie 
            ohmygod what?
Hallie 
            I have pierced ears!
   Annie 
            Yeah... ? 
            (then, panicked) 
            Oh, no.  Forget it!  Uh-uh, not happening. 
            Sorry.  Wrong number.
Hallie 
            Then cutting your hair was a total waste.  There's no way
            I could go to camp with pierced ears and come home without 'em.  I mean, come
            on.  Get real.
Annie 
            This isn't fair.  I've had to chew my nails, cut off my
            hair and now you want to punch holes in my ears!  You didn't have to do one bloody
            thing to become me!
Hallie 
            Hey, can I help it if I'm a complicated woman with a look
            entirely my own?
3 4 
              
              
A MATCH
is FIRED UP.  Hallie holds a sewing needle over the flame.
Hallie 
            (very calmly) 
            Needle sterilized.
Hallie professionally carries the needle to Annie, who lies on her bed,
            petrified, holding an ice cube to her ear.
Annie 
            Y-Y-You sure you know what you're doing?
Hallie 
            (cool as a cucumber) 
            I've gone with all my friends to have their ears pierced. 
            Just close your eyes, it'll all be over before you know it.  Earring ready?
Annie holds up the earring as her reply.
Hallie 
            Okay, just relax.  On the count of three,
            
            remove the ice.  One, two, three!
Annie shuts her eyes TIGHTLY, pulls the ice away as Hallie -STICKS THE
            NEEDLE through Annie's ear lobe.  Both Girls SCREAM at the top of their lungs.
CUT TO: 
            Hallie - PASSED OUT COLD ON THE
            FLOOR 
            Annie, now wearing the earring, gently slaps Hallie's face
            
            trying to revive her. 
            Annie 
             Hal, are you okay? Wake up!  Hallie! Hallie OPENS
            her eyes. 
              
              
      Hallie
            
             Are you bleeding to death?
Annie 
             I'm fine.  It didn't hurt at all.  But I refuse
            to go through life with only one pierced ear. 
            (holds up NEEDLE.) 
             Back to work, darling.
3 5 
              
              
Hallie takes one look at THE NEEDLE and PASSES OUT AGAIN.
            
              
Annie 
            Hal! 
              
EXT.  MAIN LODGE - MORNING
Teary-eyed Campers are hugging good-bye, as they load into the buses and
            cars.
Crosby, Jackie, Zoe and Nicole hug Hallie and Annie good-bye and-climb
            into their buses.  Hallie is now dressed in Annie's blue suit and Annie is dressed in
            Hallie's overalls.
Annie 
            Okay, so remember, you're going to find out how Mom and Dad
            met...
Hallie 
            -- and you're gonna find out why they broke up...
MARVA JR. 
            (through her bull-horn) 
            -- Annie James!  Your car's here!  Annie James, front
            and center!
Annie 
            That's you. 
            (hands her envelope) 
            Here's your ticket and passport.  The plane leaves at
            noon. 
            (then) 
            Also, remember, you've got to figure out a way to bring Mom out
            to California.
MARVA JR 
            Last call, Annie James!
The Girls hug. 
              
Give Dad a kiss for me.
Annie 
            And give Mom one for me. 
            Hallie nods and takes off.  Annie watches her, biting her
            locket. 
            Annie 
            OhmyGod!  Hallie!  I mean, Annie! 
            Hallie! 
            (MORE)

Annie(cont'd) 
            (Hallie turns) 
            The lockets!
Hallie rolls her eyes, runs back and the Girls quickly switch lockets,
            kiss good-bye and Hallie takes off again.
Annie WATCHES FROM THE CROWD
as Hallie greets the Limo Driver, climbs in the back seat and speeds
            off.  Annie crosses her arms, then crosses her fingers.
Annie 
            Good luck.
CUT TO:
LONDON
from 10,000 feet.
ANGLE - Hallie - SEATED BY THE WINDOW
on British Air, just moments before landing.
Hallie 
            (to herself) 
            okay, this is it.  Oh, God, I hope she likes me. 
            Please like me. 
              
INT.  BRITISH AIR TERMINAL - A FEW M
A steady stream of Passengers fill the terminal.  Hallie cautiously
            enters, looking into the SEA OF FACES waiting behind a velvet rope, when she HEARS:
MARTIN (O.S.) 
               Annie!
Hallie looks up and sees Martin pushing through the crowd, holding a
            small bouquet of flowers 
              
Hallie 
            (with her best British accent) 
            Maaaw-tin!
She rushes to him and dives him a big hug.
MARTIN 
            You look fantastic.  What did you do to your hair?
Hallie 
            cut it.  Do you like it? 
              
3 7 
              
              
MARTIN 
              Love it.  It's the new you! 
            (notices)
And you got your ears pierced!  Give me five, girlfriend!
He puts out his hand to start "the handshake".  Hallie
            looks at him strangely for a moment, then remembers "the handshake" and executes
            it to perfection. 
              
LONDON - THE SIGHTS
as seen from a moving Limo.  We PASS the HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT,
            WESTMINSTER ABBEY and BIG BEN.
INT.  LIMOUSINE - MOVING - SAME TIME
Hallie has the window rolled down, her head resting on her hands, as she
            soaks up the sights.
Hallie 
              This is so amazing!  What a city!
MARTIN
Eight weeks at camp and suddenly you act like a American tourist.
            
              
Hallie
That's what camp's for, silly.  Makes you appreciate home.  I
            just love how everyone drives on the wrong side here. 
            (then, realizing) 
            I mean, here they actually drive on the right side, but after
            being in America where they drive on the wrong side, which after a while begins to feel
            like the right side, makes this seem like the wrong side... ObmyGod!  Martin! 
            Buckingham Palace!!!  Can we stop?!?  I'm dying to see one of the guards up
            close.
MARTIN
You've seen the guards up close a million times.
Hallie 
             But never with short hair and pierced ears.
MARTIN
Did they serve you anything funny to drink on that plane?
3 S. 
              
              
Hallie 
              Please, Martin.  Just for a sec.
MARTIN 
            Just for a sec?  Now you're even talking like an
            American.  Oh, dear... Gareth pull over, will you, old boy?
The Driver pulls up in front of BUCKINGHAM PALACE and Hallie gets out
            and runs up to one of the Royal Guards.  As is the custom, the Guard doesn't look at
            Hallie, doesn't even blink.
Hallie 
            (waves) 
              Hi, there.  How ya doin'? 
            (no answer, whispers) 
            My name's Hallie.  I'm from California.  We don't
            have anything remotely like you in California.  Oh, this is too cool.  My Dad
            has a nutcracker shaped just like you.  Same outfit... everything. is the Queen
            home?  What's she doing?  I know you can't answer.  Can you blink if she's
            home?
Suddenly, the Guard clicks his heels, lifts his rifle over his shoulder
            and snaps to attention.  A DOZEN OTHER GUARDS join him, doing the same. immediately,
            the other side of the gate is flanked by a MATCHED SET OF GUARDS, all switching their
            rifles from one shoulder to the other and snapping to attention.
The enormous Gates to the Palace MAJESTICALLY OPEN and a DOZEN PALACE
            HORS holding Royal Flags exit in formation, followed by A WHITE ROLLS ROYCE.  The
            Rolls slowly pulls through the Gates and heads directly toward Hallie, who stands frozen
            among the Palace Guards.
Hallie 
              oh jeez, tell me this isn't happening!
The Rolls comes to a stop in front of Hallie and the tinted window in
            the back-seat slowly lowers.  Hallie starts to fall backwards.  The Palace Guard
            pushes her back upright.
From the back-seat, behind the Driver, QUEEN ELIZABETH leans forward and
            peers out crown and all.
   QUEEN ELIZABM 
            Good afternoon.
Hallie 
            Good afternoon.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH 
            What's your name, dear?
Hallie 
            Hallie Parker.  I mean, Annie James, ma'am.  Not
            Hallie Parker.  Sorry.  Forgot my name.
QUEEN ELIZABETH 
            Yes, I have that effect on people.  So nice to meet you,
            Annie James.  Thank you for stopping by the Palace today.
39 
            Hallie
Thank you, Your Highness.  Very nice to meet you personally like
            this ... I didn't even know you were home.  I was excited just to see one of your
            Guards ... I'm supposed to curtsey, aren't I?
QUEEN ELIZABETH 
            That's okay, my dear, I shan't tell a single soul.  I
            promise.
Hallie 
            (nods, stunned) 
             You shan't?  Oh, thank you, ma'am.
QUEEN ELIZABETH 
            (waves, with a gloved hand) 
             Time for me to go.  Ta-ta.
Hallie 
            (waves back, shocked) 
             Ta-ta. 
              
The window rises and the Rolls pulls off amongst The Queen's Guard.
 PALACE GUARD 
            (through locked teeth) 
            Now that's a first.
Hallie turns to Martin and the Chauffeur, who watch, their mouths agape.
            
              
EXT. 18TH.  CENTURY HOUSE - REGENT'S PARK - A LITTLE LATER
            
              
              
              
An elegant town house on one of London's loveliest streets.
            
            The Limousine pulls up and the Driver gets out, opening the
            
            back door for Hallie.  She steps out and looks up at the
            house.
4 0. 
              
              
Hallie 
            (to herself) 
            This is it, 18 Cumberland Square.
Martin helps the Driver with the luggage as Hallie rushes up the
            steps.  She places her hand on the big round knob and turns it. 
              
              
INT.  TOWN HOUSE
A beautiful, sun-filled house with a fantastic carved staircase. 
            Hallie stands in the foyer, feeling very small.
Hallie 
            Hello?
She peeks into the Drawing Room, doesn't see anyone, heads around the
            stairs, counting the doorways and stops at:
THE LIBRARY
where she sees someone sitting in a leather chair, smoking a pipe,
            hidden behind The Financial Times.
Hallie 
            (softly) 
            Grandfather, I'm home.
Hallie's Grandfather, CHARLES James, a
            small, dapper man, with a moustache and wearing a Saville Row suit, rises with a smile.
CHARLES 
            Is that my little girl?  That tall gangly thing?
Hallie 
            Yes, it's me. 
              
(takes her in his arms) 
            Did you have a good time, sweet pea?
Hallie 
            (buried in his suit jacket) 
            Uh-huh... Great...
CHARLES 
            (amused) 
             What are you doing?
Hallie 
            Just smelling. 
              
 CHARLES 
            Smelling?
    Hallie 
            I'm making a memory.  Years from now, when I'm all grown
            up, I'll remember my Grandfather and how he always smelled of peppermint and pipe tobacco.
He pulls her close, she rests her head on his chest.  Then, from
            the top of the stairs, Hallie HEARS:
ELIZABETH'S VOICE 
            Annie...!
Hallie looks up to the balcony at the top of the stairs and sees her
            Mother - for the first time in her life.  ELIZABETH James
            is
a natural beauty in her mid-thirties.  Hallie walks trance-like to
            the bottom of the stairs.
 Hallie- 
            Mother?
    ELIZABETH 
            Honey, welcome home!
Elizabeth rushes down the stairs as Hallie flies up toward her.. Hallie
            falls into her Mother's arms, tears flooding her eyes.
Hallie 
               I can't believe it's you.
ELIZABETH
And I can't believe it's you and with short hair no less.
Hallie 
             A girl I met at camp cut it.  Do you hate it?
MARTIN 
            (entering with the luggage) 
            I think it looks awesome.
ELIZABETH
So do 1. I absolutely love it.  And you got your ears pierced?!
Hallie nods.
CHARLES
Looks very chic if you ask me, although nobody ever does.
42. 
              
              
ELIZABETH 
            Any other surprises - belly-button rings, tatoos ... ?
Hallie laughs, shakes her head, looks up at her Mother with tears in her
            eyes.
ELIZABETH 
              What is it, sweetie?
Hallie 
            I'm sorry, it's just... I've missed you so much.
            
              
             ELIZABETH 
            (hugging her) 
            Can you believe it?  It seems like it's been forever.
Hallie 
            You have no idea.
INT.  ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
We hear LAUGHTER OFF-CAMERA then Elizabeth and Hallie E R. Hallie takes
            in the room... it's beautiful, feminine and gracious.  Tea has been laid on a corner
            table.  Elizabeth leads Hallie to a small love seat.
ELIZABETH 
              So tell me all about camp.
Hallie 
            Ohmygod, I love your room, Mom... it's so... totally Mom-like.
ELIZABETH 
            Nothing's new... it's just as Mom-like as it's always
            been.  So... c'mon, tell 7ne... Did you like everyone?  Was it fun?
            
              
Yeah, it was great and I liked this one girl a real lot, I mean... in
            particular.  She's from California, actually. 
            (then) 
            Have you ever been to California?
  ELIZABETH 
            (pouring tea) 
            Yes... Once.  But that was a long time ago, before you
            were born. 
              
4 3 
              
              
Hallie 
            (staring at Elizabeth) 
            Man-o-Manichevitz ... I didn't realize you were so beautiful.
ELIZABETH 
            Man-o-Manichevitz ... I love your new vocabulary.
Just then, Martin knocks on the open door and with disdain, holds up
            Hallie's Teddy Bear, by it's ear.
MARTIN 
              I found a stowaway in your suitcase.
Hallie 
            OhmyGod, Cuppy. 
            (Elizabeth turns to her) 
            He belongs to a girl in my bunk... I don't know how on earth he
            ended up in my suitcase.  Gosh, whaddya know.
MARTIN 
            well, since he's not our 'Cuppy’, shall we dispose of him?
Hallie 
            (retrieving it) 
            No! I mean, no.  I'll mail him to her.  She loves
            this thing a lot.  A lot.  A lot.  She's like slept with that thing her
            entire life and she could never be like in a foreign country without him.  No, no,
            I'll take care. of it, thank you, Martin.
Just then, the PHONE RINGS.  Elizabeth answers it.
ELIZABETH 
            Hello?  Hi... Really?  Can't you manage without
            me?  Annie just got home from camp... Well, what's the problem?
As Elizabeth talks on the phone, Hallie crosses to the dresser and runs
            her hand across her Mother's brush, her pearls, smells her perfume, then lifts up a photo
            of Elizabeth as a little girl.  Hallie t = s back, looks at her Mom.  Elizabeth
            makes a face about the phone call.  Hallie laughs as Elizabeth continues on the
            phone.
Hallie notices Elizabeth's closet door is open and she enters, gazing at
            all of her Mother's clothes.  She looks at a row of evening clothes and touches the
            beautiful fabrics.
44. 
              
              
ELIZABETH 
              Annie!
Hallie pops out of the closet, worried she's been caught trespassing.
ELIZABETH
Would you mind very much running down to the studio with me?
            
              
EXT.  KINGS ROAD - LONDON - A LITTLE LATER
Through a LONG LENS, shooting through taxi cabs and traffic, we SEE one
            very happy Little Girl walking the streets of London, holding her Mother's hand.
            
              
A STORE WINDOW - MOMENTS LATER
IS CLOSE on a mannequin wearing an EXQUISITE WEDDING GOWN.  Above
            the window is the name Elizabeth Tames Designs.
   Hallie (O.S.)
            
            Wow, that's incredible.
ANGLE BACK to REVEAL Hallie and Elizabeth standing in front of the shop.
ELIZABETH 
            Really?  You don't think it's too over-the-top?
Hallie 
            No.  I love it.  You know who would look really
            beautiful in that gown?  I mean, beautiful?
ELIZABETH 
            Who?
Hallie 
            You.
ELIZABETH 
            Me? I think the time change has made you a little loopy. 
            Come on, let's see what all the fuss is about...
4 5. 
              
ELIZABETH James STUDIOS - DAY
A skylight fills the foyer of this converted town house with a splash of
            white light.  A huge vase of white orchids sit on an antique table.  Elizabeth
            and Hallie climb a circular stairwell, passing a Bridal Boutique on the first floor.
Hallie 
            -- You mean you never think about getting married again?
ELIZABETH 
            No, I like things exactly the way they are, thank you.
An Assistant hurries past them, carrying a veil.
ASSISTANT 
            Hi, Elizabeth.  Hey Annie, welcome home. Great haircut.
Hallie 
            Hi... Thanks ... 
            (shuts her yes, thinking hard) -- Fiona!  Yeah, I'm
            back.  Thanks. 
            (then)
But Mom, seriously, doesn't designing all these wedding gowns ever make
            you think about marriage... or maybe just think about the IF' word?
ELIZABETH 
            (stops) 
            The ‘F’ word?!
Hallie 
            My 'father'.
ELIZABETH 
            Oh. That ‘F’ word.  Well, no, actually it
            doesn't because I didn't even wear a wedding gown-when I married the IF' word.
HALLLIE 
            You didn't? -Why not?
ELIZABETH
Hey, how did we get into this discussion anyway? 
            (they arrive at a large loft filled with people)
            
            (MORE)
4 6
ELIZABETH (cont'd) 
            Okay, here we are.  Now let's see what disaster awaits us.
As they step into THE LOFT, we see a PHOTO-SHOOT is in progress.  A
            MODEL wears a beautiful wedding gown as a PHOTOGRAPHER, shoots away.  Make-Up, Hair
            people and Assistants scurry about.  MUSIC plays in the B.G. Hallie watches like a
            kid in a candy store.
PHOTOGRAPHER 
            Okay, she's here.- We're saved.
  ELIZABETH 
            (sotto, to Hallie) 
            Uh-huh, the pressure's on.
PHOTOGRAPHER 
            We don't know what to do with the veil. if she wears it, it
            covers the back of the dress, if she doesn't the dress looks-- 
              
              
    ELIZABETH 
             -- incomplete.  Right. 
            (to Model) 
            Can you try standing sideways..? Head up, kind of an Audrey
            Hepburn type... that's it.  That's perfect. 
            (to Assistant) 
            Now slip the veil on and drape it back... not over her
            shoulders ... straight back, there you go... 
            (to Model) 
            Now lift the train in your arms like you're carrying it. 
            Don't worry about the bouquet, you're married now, you gotta learn to juggle...
            Beautiful.  And look happy, it's your wedding day!
The Model laughs as the Photographer reels off shots.
Hallie 
            (to herself) 
             Mom is too cool. 
              
STUDIO CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
Elizabeth and Hallie make their way down the hall, passing a row of
            design offices.  Two Assistants carry a gown past them.
Hallie 
            So what did you wear to marry my Dad?
47. 
              
              
ELIZABETH 
              Why the sudden curiosity about your Dad?
Hallie 
            Well, maybe because he's never mentioned and you can't blame a
            kid for wondering...
ELIZABETH 
            (sticks her head in an office) 
              I'm going home, kids ... See you tomorrow.
Elizabeth and Hallie head back down the circular staircase.
Hallie 
              So, what was he like?  Really.
ELIZABETH 
            Who?
Hallie rolls her eyes. 
            EXT.  ELIZABETH James DESIGNS
            - LONDON - LATE DAY 
            Elizabeth and Hallie step onto the street. 
            Hallie 
            Mother, you can't avoid the subject forever.
ELIZABETH 
            Okay.  He was quite lovely to tell you the truth. 
            When we met, he was...actually entirely lovely.  All right?
Hallie 
            (smiles) 
            All right.
it starts to RAIN.  Elizabeth snaps open an umbrella.
ELIZABETH 
            (puts her arm around Hallie) 
            Are you cold?
@IE 
            I'm fine. 
            (looks up at her) 
            so, did you meet him here in London? 
            Elizabeth-takes Hallie's hand as they dash across the street.
            
            4 8. 
              
ELIZABETH 
            We met on the QE 2.
Hallie 
            The QE what? 
              
              
              
ELIZABETH
The Queen Elizabeth 2. It's an ocean liner that sails from London to New
            York.  I was nervous about flying in those days, so was your father.
            
            (remembering back) 
            We met our very first night on board the ship, actually. 
            We were seated next to each other at dinner.  He's an American, you know.
  Hallie 
            No kidding?
ELIZABETH 
            (nods) 
             We kind of hit it off immediately.
Hallie
Hey, I love Americans.  I mean, if I wasn't British, I'd be an
            American.  So, was it love at first sight?
ELIZABETH
I knew you were going to ask me all these questions one day.
            
            (yells)
Taxi!
Elizabeth raises her am and hails a cab.  It splashes to a stop and
            they hurry inside. 
              
INT.  TAXI - MOVING
Elizabeth and Hallie sit side-by-side.
      Hallie
So, did you see each other every single night?
ELIZABETH
You know, this part of your personality reminds me of you father. 
            You'd think he raised you instead of me.
(looking into Hallie's eyes) 
             Yes, we saw each other every night, every
4 9.
ELIZABETH (cont'd) 
            morning and every hour in-between.  Then one night, he
            popped the question, right there in the middle of the Atlantic.
Hallie 
            Cool.
ELIZABETH 
            And since a ship's Captain can do all kinds of special things,
            like even marry people...
Hallie
OhmyGod, you mean, you got married on the QE 2? 
            (Elizabeth nods) 
            That's beyond cool.  So what happened?  You didn't
            love each other when you weren't in the middle of the Atlantic?
ELIZABETH 
            I don't )mow, honey.  These things are complicated. 
            I'm very British and you father's very American.  I tried living in California, he
            tried living in London but...
Hallie 
             It just didn't work out.
ELIZABETH 
             No, it didn't.  Except for having you.
Hallie smiles.  Elizabeth puts her arm around her, pulls her
            close.  Hallie signs.
Hallie
Dear old Dad.  I wonder what he's doing at this very moment?
CUT TO:
DEAR OLD DAD
CAMERA is CLOSE on NICK Parker and he is
            lovely, indeed.  A smiling, ruggedly hancuome guy, who shines among a throng of
            people waiting anxiously at THE NAPA COUNTY AIRPORT.  Suddenly, he brightens and
            waves.
NICK 
            Hal!  Hey, welcome home, kiddo!
5 0 
              
              
ANGLE - Annie WALKING ACROSS THE TARMAC
carrying Hallie's duffel bag over her shoulder.  Nervous at first,
            she breaks into a grin at the sight of her father, waving and smiling at her.
Annie 
              Dad!!!
Annie runs to him and stops just as she reaches him.
Annie 
            (looking up at him) 
            Dad... Finally...
NICK 
             Get into these arms, you little punk.
 Nick wraps his arms around Annie and pulls her close.
NICK
I hope you had a lousy time at that camp 'cause you're never going back
            - I missed you too much.
(Annie smiles, Nick looks at her)
What happened to you?  Something's changed. Did you get taller?
They walk off, arm-in-arm, into the terminal, Nick carrying Hallie's
            duffel. 
              
INT.  TERMINAL
Annie 
            So, what's up, Dad?  How’s Chessy and everybody?
            
              
NICK 
            Great.  Everybody's great, can't wait to see you. 
            Eight weeks really is too long, Hal.  So much has been happening around here.
Annie
A lot's happened to me, too.  I feel like I'm practically a new
            woman.
As they walk, Annie keeps peeking at Nick.
NICK 
            What's the matter?  Did I cut myself 
            shaving? 
              
                Annie
            
            No, it's just seeing you for the first 
            time.  I mean, you know... in so long. 
            (giggles) 
            You look taller to me, too.
NICK 
            (pulls her to him) 
            C'mon, squirt, let's go home. 
              
EXT. NAPA, CALIFORNIA - AERIAL VIEW - DAY 
            A dark green Suburban drives past picture perfect wine
            vineyards. 
            INT.  SUBURBAN - MOVING 
            Nick drives wearing a straw cowboy hat.  Hallie sits next
            to him.
NICK 
            Hey, by the way, thanks for all those newsy letters.  I'm
            really glad I bought you all that personalized stationary you just had to have.
Annie 
            we meant to write, Dad, but we just got so busy with...
NICK 
             We? 
              
              
Annie 
            Oh. Me and my friend.  I met this girl at camp and we got
            really close.  Practically like sisters.  She was a lovely girl.
NICK 
            ‘Lovely’?  You seem to have gotten very Proper
            all of a sudden. 
            (takes her hand, looks at it) 
            Still biting those nails.
Annie 
            Dad!  You noticed!
52. 
              
              
NICK 
            Whaddya mean, noticed?  You've been biting them since you
            got teeth.
Annie 
            But I've decided to stop, Dad.  It's a horrid, habit,
            really it is, Dad.
NICK 
            'Lovely' girl ... 'Horrid, habit?  Did I send you to
            summer camp or finishing school?  And why do you keep saying 'Dad, at the end of
            every sentence?
Annie
I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was doing it, Dad.
(realizing she's done it again) Sorry, Dad.
They both laugh.
Annie 
            Do you want to know why I keep saying Dad... ? The truth?
NICK 
             Because you missed your old man so much?
            
              
              
              
              
              
Annie 
            Exactly! it's because in my whole life, I mean for these past
            eight weeks, I was never able to ever say the word 'Dad'. Never.  Not once!  And
            a Dad is an irreplaceable person in a girls' life.  I mean think about it, there's a
            whole day, devoted to celebrating Fathers, right?  Just imagine, someone's life
            without a Father.  Never buying a Father's Day card, never getting their Father a'
            birthday present, never sitting on their Father's lap, never being able to say, 'Hi, Dad',
            'What's up, Dad?,, 'Bye, Dad, catch you later, Dad'.  A baby's first words are always
            ]Dada, aren't they?  Then there's 'Daddy', 'Daddio', 'Pop', 'My old man'... Not to
            mention, 'Wait 'til your father gets home, and...
NICK 
            So, let me see if I get this ... you missed being able to call
            me Dad.
53
Annie 
            Yeah.  I really have, Dad.
Nick smiles as he turns in under a wooden sign that says Parker Vineyard
            and Winery. Annie looks out the window.
  Annie 
            ObmyGod.
NICK 
            Now you sound like your old self. 
              
EXT.  NICK AND HALLIE'S HOUSE - DAY
A rambling Victorian-style ranch house, with a wide porch that wraps
            around the entire facade.  Nick toots the HORN as he drives down the long gravel
            driveway.  SAMMY, a big golden mutt, races after the car, barking.
JOSE, Nick's right-hand man, arrives from the side of the house,
            drinking a small bottle of juice.  He opens the Surburban's door for Annie.
JOSE 
            Well, look who finally decided to come home.
Annie 
            Hey, Jose. 
              
JOSE 
            Did your old man tell you we decided no more camp for you?
Annie 
            (climbing out) 
            Yeah, he told me.
JOSE 
            (hugging her) 
            it got too quiet around here, Hal.  We couldn't stand
            it.  Nobody blasting music, nobody playing hide and seek in the vineyards, nobody
            getting stuck up on the roof...
Annie laughs as the screen door swings open and CHESSY EXITS, humming as
            if she's a one-woman welcome home band.  Chessy, the most lovable woman on the
            planet, early thirties, warm eyes, great sense of humor, lifts Annie right off her feet.
54 
              
              
CHESSY 
            Hell-o, Gorgeous!  You grew, you lost weight, you look
            fabulous, we missed you, don't let these bums talk you out of, going back to camp. 
            You're a growing girl.  You need adventure.  You hungry?  I made cornbread
            and chili.  Why're you so quiet?  What's wrong?
Annie 
             I'm just so happy to be home.
NICK 
            (passes, carrying Hallie's duffel)
Did I hear something about cornbread and chili?
CHESSY 
            It's on the stove... 
            (without even looking) 
            Wipe your feet, Jose!
Chessy looks Annie over, hugs her again.
CHESSY 
            You've changed, Hal ... I can't put my finger on it, but
            something about you has definitely changed..
Sammy bounds down the steps of the porch.
Annie 
              Really?  Me? 
            (then) 
              Hi, Sammy!
Sammy sniffs at Annie's shoes, looks up at her, then backs off
            suspiciously, BARKING at her.
CHESSY 
              What's with you, goofball!  It's Hallie.
            
            Sanmy continues BARKING. 
            Annie 
              I probably smell like camp, that's all.
            
            Annie runs up the porch steps, followed by Chessy.
55. 
              
              
  CHESSY 
            (to Sammy) 
             What's wrong with you? it's like you didn't even
            recognize her. 
              
INT. HOUSE
A spacious comfortable ranch house with high ceilings and panoramic
            views of Nick's vineyards.
Annie 
            (taking it all in) 
              Wow!  It's even better than the pictures.
CHESSY 
            Whaddya want to do first, kiddo - unpack or eat?  Or eat,
            then unpack?  Or, we can eat while we unpack.
Annie
 You mean I can eat in my room?
CHESSY 
            (looks at her like she's nuts) Yes, I would say that's a
            definite possibility.
-As Chessy and Annie head up the stairs, Nick ENTERS, eating a big bowl
            of chili.
NICK 
            Hal, when you're done, come on down, there's someone I want you
            to meet.
Annie 
            (looks down at him) 
            Okay, Dad.
NICK 
            (smiles) 
            Okay, Hal.
Annie continues up the stairs, suddenly stops.  Turns to Chessy.
Annie 
            Someone he wants me to meet?
CHESSY 
            (on the sly) 
            -He didn't tell you?
5 6 
              
              
Annie 
            Tell me what? 
            Annie HEARS the SOUND of A WOMAN LAUGHING.  She looks
            down. 
            ANNIE'S VIEW - THE LIVING ROOM BELOW 
            Nick turns as MEREDITH BLAKE enters from the patio. 
            Meredith is a tawny beauty of twenty-six, wearing a chic sleeveless dress, sleek hair and
            heels.' Nick takes her hand.
Annie turns back to Chessy and mouths "Who is that?” Chessy
            motions for Annie to follow her upstairs.
INT. HALLIE'S ROOM
Sunny, warmly furnished with lots of books, CD's, Horse Show ribbons and
            toys.  The French doors are wide open and a gentle breeze billows the curtains.
Annie- 
            Who’s the blonde?
CHESSY 
            Hal, it's none of my business how your father makes a fool out
            of himself, you understand?  He's a big boy, he can do what he wants.
Annie 
            Right.  So who is she?
CHESSY 
            Her name's Meredith Blake.  She's a publicist from San
            Francisco.  Your father hired her at the beginning of the summer to do some publicity
            for the vineyard and if you ask me, she's done a better job selling herself than the
            grapes.
Annie 
            Whaddya mean?
CHESSY 
            Look, you and I )mow your Dad's no suave debonair Bachelor of
            the Month-type, so I wonder what a young hot thing like her sees in a guy who walks around
            with his shirt-tail hanging out and his cereal bowl full of chili.  Then I realized,
            there's a .million reasons why that girl's giggling and they're all sitting in the Napa
            Valley Community Bank.
Annie 
            You mean you don't think she even really likes Dad...
CHESSY 
            -- What do I know?  But I'll tell you one thing. 
            This one could give Sharon Stone femme fatal lessons.  She's got your father eating
            out of the palm of her hand.  They ride together, they swim together, they're out to
            dinner every night.  Not to mention she treats yours truly like the shlepper help' of
            all time which has really endeared her to me, as you can imagine. = you go down and meet
            her and see for yourself.  Don't let me influence you. 
              
INT.  LIVING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Annie bounds down the stairs, wearing sunglasses and a faded
            
            Parker Vineyards T-shirt over a bathing suit-.  She looks
            
            Around, sees lots of PHOTOGRAPHS of Nick and Hallie when
            
            Hallie was a baby.
Annie 
            (admiring a photo) 
            We were such a cute baby.
She's distracted when she HEARS Meredith's LAUGH.  Annie lowers her
            sunglasses, peering over them at Meredith lounging by the pool ogling Nick.
            
              
EXT.  POOL
Annie joins Nick and Meredith under an umbrella.  The vineyards and
            mountains cascade down from the pool creating an incredible vista.
NICK 
            There's my girl!  Hal, I want you to meet a friend of
            mine.  Honey, this is Meredith Blake.
Annie 
            (waves) 
            Hi ...
ITH 
            Hi. Wow.  I can't believe I'm finally meeting the famous
            Hallie.  I've looked forward to this all summer.
58. 
              
              
Annie 
              Really?  Well ... here I am.
MEREDITH 
            Nicky, she's adorable.
Nick blushes as Annie mouths "Nicky-O
MEREDITH
The way your father talked about you I expected to meet a little girl
            but you're so grown up...
Annie 
             I'll be twelve soon.  How old are you?
MEREDITH 
            (a little thrown) 
            -- Twenty-six.
Annie
Only fourteen years older than me.  How old are you again, Dad?
NICK 
            oh, suddenly she's interested in math.  I'm gonna get some
            more chili and a bottle of champagne to celebrate.
Annie 
             What are we celebrating? 
            Nick pauses. 
              MEREDITH (jumping in) 
            You're home-coming of course.
Nick and Meredith exchange a quick look which is not lost on
            Annie.  Nick heads toward the house as Annie sits by the pool, dunking her feet in
            the water.  A cell-phone RINGS, Meredith flips it open.
MERIDITH
Hello.  Yes, Reverend Mosby... Uh-huh.  I'll certainly ask him
            but I doubt if he'll be 
            available.  I understand it's for a local charity. 
            Um-hmmm... I'm writing it all down. 
            (she writes nothing down) 
            Okay, got it.  Sounds very worthwhile, I-agree but
            unfortunately, I see that Mr. 
            Parker will be out of the country those days.  Yes, I'll
            be sure to mention it to him.  Thank you 
            (snaps phone shut) 
            So. How was camp, Hal?  Was it fabulous?
Annie 
            Yes, I loved it actually.  My Dad's going out of the
            country?  When?
MERIDITH 
            No, no, I just had to say that to get him out of something.
            
            (changing the subject) 
            You know I never heard a man talk about his daughter the way
            Nicky talks about you.  You two are obviously incredibly close.
Annie 
            We're closer than close.  We're all each other has...
Annie does a huge cannonball into the pool, SPLASHING water all over
            Meredith.  Pissed, but controlling it, Meredith walks to the edge of the pool picks
            up a towel and pats herself dry as Annie POPS to the surface.
Annie 
            Sorry, did I get you wet, Mer?
MEREDITH (trying to be sweet) just a little, Hal. 
            (then) 
            Hey, guess what?  Your Dad took me riding the other day
            and he let me ride your horse.  I hope that's okay with you.
Annie 
            Oh, sure.  Sprout's used to strange women riding
            her.  Not that you're strange or anything.- Actually, compared to the others, you
            seem relatively normal. 
            (she floats on her back)
MEREDITH 
            (curiosity getting the best of 
            her, walks to Annie) 
            Others?  What others?
Annie 
            What others?  Puh-leeze. 
            (laughs hysterically, sees 
            Meredith's concern) 
               You want the 411?
60. 
              
              
  MEREDITH 
            The 411?
Annie 
            The 'information'... the lowdown on the other women. 
            Can't say that I blame you.  I'd want to know if I was number twentyeight ... I
            mean... number twenty-nine in a man's life.
MERIDITH 
             I'm number twenty-nine?!
Annie 
            Well, yes but I didn't start counting ‘til I was about
            four.  God knows how many there were before then. it's always the same routine...
            horseback riding through the vineyards ... long romantic dinners with his special reserve
            label wine... moonlight swims ... 
            (Meredith nods, intrigued) 
            But I always say, it's none of my business if a man his age
            wants to make a fool out of himself.  Although, maybe he's changed and you're the
            real thing, Mer.
Just then, Nick arrives with a bottle of Champagne.
NICK 
            okay, here we go.  A bottle of my special reserve
            label.  You girls find something to talk about while I was gone?
Annie smiles and dives under the water, just like a little angel.
NICK 
              Does that mean 'yes'?
MERIDIITH 
            it sure does. 
            EXT.  ELIZABETHIS TOWN HOUSE - LONDON - FOLLOWING MORNING
            OVER, a PHONE RINGS. 
            INT. FOYER - SAME TIME
Grandfather walks right past the RINGING PHONE, reading the morning
            paper.  Elizabeth stands at the top of the stairs, slipping on pair of heels.
61 
              
              
ELIZABETH 
            Somebody grab that, please.
Martin passes through carrying a tray with coffee on it.  He picks
            up the phone, balancing the tray with his other hand. 
              
MARTIN 
             James residence... Annie? 
              Hallie walks by. 
              Hallie 
            Yes, Martin? 
            MARTIN 
            (does a double-take) oh dear, it sounded just like you on the
            phone. 
             (into phone)
I'm sorry, who did you wish to speak with?  Annie?  Of
            course.  One moment, please.
(hands Hallie the phone) 
            A Mildred Plotka for you... Sounds like your twin.
Hallie 
            My twin?  Very funny. 
            (into phone) 
            Hello?  Oh, Mildred, how you doin'? 
              
INT.  HALLIE'S BEDROOM - NAPA, CALIFORNIA - MIDNIGHT
Annie holds the phone as she crosses the bedroom, sneaks into the
            BATHROOM and locks the door.
Annie 
            (as herself) 
            Hey!  Howls it going over there?.
Hallie 
            (also as-Annie) 
            Oh, everything's quite lovely here.  We're expecting a bit
            of rain today but Mildred, can you... hold on for a moment7
Hallie sees the coast is clear and ducks into the hall closet, shutting
            the door just as Martin walks past.  He does another double-take... Where'd she go?
            
              
              
62
INSIDE THE CLOSET - SAME TIME 
            Hallie pulls a string above her head, turning on the light.
            
            Hallie 
            (as herself) 
            okay, now I can talk.  OhmyGod, Mom's incredible.  I
            can not believe I've lived my. entire life without knowing her.  She's beautiful and
            fun and smart and I love the gowns she designs and I got her talking about how she and Dad
            first met and what happened between them and if you ask me--
INTERCUT  -    Hallie
            AND Annie
Annie 
            (WHISTLING into phone) 
            Hallie!  Stop!  We've got a major problem. 
            You're going to have to bring mother out here immediately.
Hallie
Immediately?  Are you nuts?  I've had one day with her. 
            I'm just getting to know her.  I can't.  I refuse.
Annie 
            But this is an emergency.  Dad's in love.
Hallie 
            (laughs)
Get out of here.  Dad doesn't fall in love.  I mean, not
            seriously.
Annie 
            Trust me, he's serious, about this one.  He's always
            holding her hand, kissing her neck, waiting on her hand and foot..
Hallie 
            (sinking-to the floor) 
            He is... ?
Annie 
            it's disgusting.
Hallie 
            Well, you'll just have to break 'em.up. 
            Sabotage her.  Do whatever you have to.
6 3 
              
              
Annie 
            I'm trying but I'm at a slight disadvantage I only met the man
            twelve hours ago.  You've got to get back here to help me.
Hallie 
            Annie, I can't.  I want more time with Mom
            
              
Hallie FINDS A CANDY WRAPPER in one of Annie's coat pockets, WRINKLES it
            over the receiver making it SOUND LIKE STATIC.
MULIE 
            Annie, are you still there?  I can barely
            
            hear you... Ann.... 
            (clicks the receiver)
Annie 
             I'm here!  What are you..?
Hallie 
            (wrinkles the wrapper) 
            Operator... ! Operator... Sorry, think I lost you, Annie.
Annie 
            (knowing what's up, holds receiver out from her ear) Thanks for
            your help, Hal. 
              
INT.  FOYER - LONDON - SAME TIME
Hallie creaks open the closet door and crawls out on all fours, only to
            find her Mother, Grandfather and Martin standing in the FOYER, all looking down at her.
Hallie 
            had a phone call.  From a friend at camp.  It's an
            old camp tradition.-.. Talk to your best friend from inside a closet... kinda stupid, I
            know but... 
            (rises, replaces the phone on the table, sighs)
            
            So... Breakfast anyone?
CUT TO:
Two PLATES LOADED WITH BACON, EGGS, TOAST AND PANCAKES
ANGLE BACK- with Chessy, as she carries the plates across the
            
            KITCHEN to Annie.
64. 
              
              
CHESSY 
            okay, here we go, most important meal of the day... Eggs sunny
            side up, bacon, toast and just in case you're really hungry... a stack of humongous
            chocolate chip pancakes which smell incredible, if I do say so myself. 
              Chessy places all of this in front of Annie.
Annie 
            (not too interested) 
            Thanks, Chessy.
Chessy waves her hand over the food, sending it's aroma toward Annie.
CHESSY
Not hungry again?  You hardly ate your chili, your favorite food
            and now you're not eating your breakfast.  You're not sick, are you?
Chessy puts her hand on Annie's forehead, then joins her at the kitchen
            table.
Annie 
            I'm fine, I promise.  Where's Dad?
CHESSY 
            He and Miss-- 
            (imitating Meredith)
'I'll just have half a grapefruit, thank you, left about an hour
            ago.  You overslept and he didn't want to wake you.  Of course, I'd oversleep
            too if I was up at midnight making mysterious phone calls from my bathroom.
            
              
              
Annie 
            oh, that.  I was calling a friend from camp. 
            Mildred.  She lives in New York.
CHESSY
Oh, I see and you wanted to call Mildred at a time that was convenient
            for her.  Because of the time difference.
Annie 
            Exactly.  Because of the time difference.
CHESSY 
            Uh-huh.  So you waited until it was three in the morning
            her time.  That makes perfect sense.
Annie 
            Actually, it was seven at night her time.  You see she
            lives in New York but she was on vacation with her family in Bora Bora.
Annie takes a bite of bacon and gives Chessy a smile.  Chessy gives
            her a stare.
CHESSY 
            Very smooth.  Your Dad wants you to go over to his office
            as soon as you're done with breakfast.
Annie 
            He does?    Thanks. 
            (shoves bacon in her mouth) 
            I'm done.
She rises as Sammy enters, sees Annie and GROWLS as he scoots around
            her.
Annie 
            That dog has gotten so weird!  Bye, Chessy, thanks again
            for breakfast.  It was great.
Chessy looks down at the plate of untouched food.  Annie pushes on
            the screen door but it goes nowhere.
CHESSY 
            (watching her carefully) 
            Pull, Hal.
Annie laughs, pulls on the door and runs out.  CAMERA MOVES IN on
            Chessy, wondering what's going on. 
              
INT. Parker VINEYARDS - BARREL ROOM - A
            LITTLE LATER
Nick and Annie walk through a huge vaulted room that houses hundreds of
            wooden barrels filled with wine.
NICK 
            (puts his arm around her) 
            Honey, I'm glad you're here, there's something really important
            I want to talk to you about.
66. 
              
              
Annie 
            That's funny because there's something really important I want
            to talk to you about.
NICK 
            Okay, you go first.
Annie 
            No, you.
NICK 
            Okay, I want to talk to you about Meredith.
Annie 
            And I want to talk to you about my mother. 
            (then) 
            What about Meredith?
NICK 
            (thrown) 
            W-W-What about your mother?
Annie 
            Dad, I'm almost twelve, how long do you expect me to buy that
            story that The Stork dropped me on your doorstep?
NICK 
            C'mon, Hal, we've talked about your mother...
Annie 
            No we haven't.  Not really.  A girl needs more in
            life than half of a crumpled old photograph.  Dad, I'm almost a teenager, face it, I
            need a mother.
NICK
You know what?  You're right.  You do. 
            Which brings me to--
They turn a corner and-bump into MEREDITH who is walking with her
            British assistant, RICHARD
NlCK 
            Meredith! 
              
              MERIDITH 
            Hi. 
            (noticing Annie) 
            Hello, Hal.
67 
              
              
  Annie 
            Hi there.
MEREDITH 
            Hallie, this is my assistant, Richard. 
            Richard, this is Nick's daughter, the one 
            I've been telling you so much about.
RICHARD 
            (stuffy British accent) 
            oh, hello.  How are you, luv?
Annie 
            (with her best British accent) 
            oh, don't tell me you're British?  How lovely.
NICK 
            (surprised, to Annie) 
            How'd you do that? 
              
              
RICHARD
You do an absolutely marvelous British accent.
Annie 
            Yours isn't bad either, old chap-,Richard laughs.
            
            MEREDIITH 
            (whispers to Nick) 
            Did you tell her? 
            NICK 
            Almost.
MEREDITH 
            Hey, if you're free later, why don't we all have lunch on the
            terrace?
NICK 
            Actually, I promised Hal we'd hang out together this afternoon.
Annie smiles.
MEREDITH 
                 No problem. 
                (starts off) 
            I’ve got plenty to do... I'm working on a new label design
            , Nicky... featuring Y-0-U.  You're gonna love it.
68. 
             (throws a kiss) 
              See you for dinner, darling.  Bye, Hals.
            
            TRACKING ANGLE - MEREDITH AND RIC 
            As they walk away. 
            MEREDITH 
            (sotto, to Richard)
First change I make in that household is to send that two-faced little
            brat off to boarding school in Timbuktu.
RICHARD 
            (an exaggerated shiver) 
            Oooooooo.  Ice woman.
MEREDITH 
            And proud of it, babe. 
              
EXT.  HILLTOP – 0VERLOOKING NAPA VALLEY – A LITTLE LATER
A beat and Nick and Annie gallop on horseback OVER THE CREST of the
            mountain.  As they slow their horses to a walk.
NICK 
            So, you excited about our camping trip?
Annie
What camping trip?
NICK 
            What camping trip?  The one we go on every summer before
            you go back to school.
Annie
Oh, that camping trip.  Yeah, sure... I can't wait.
NICK 
            So, Hal, what do you think of Meredith?
Annie
As what, Dad?  Your publicist?  Your friend?  Your ... ?
NICK 
            -- Just what do you think of her... as a person?
      Annie
            
            well, she's cute, she has nice hair, good teeth, she can spell
            the word YOU... I (MORE)
KING NAPA VALLEY - A LITTLE LATER
69.
Annie(cont'd) 
            don't know.  Honestly, Dad, the woman's a complete
            stranger to me.  Why do you want my opinion anyway?
NICK 
            (takes a beat) 
            Well, I'll tell you why... because believe it or not, honey...
Annie 
            (cutting him off) 
            -- Race you back to the ranch, Dad!
Annie jams her heels into Sprout's flanks and the horse takes off like a
            bat out of hell.
NICK 
            Hallie, I'm trying to tell you something! 
              
EXT.  HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Out of breath, Annie runs up the porch steps and throws open the screen
            door.
INT.  LIVING ROOM
Annie stops, catches her breath.  She's a little panicky.
Annie 
            (to herself) 
            I'm in so over my head here.  I can't handle this
            alone.  I just can't.  I'm only one kid.
Chessy PEEKS HER H M AROUND THE CORNER of the arm chair she's been
            sitting in.
CHESSY 
            You got something you'd like to share with the class?
Annie 
            (jumps, :frightened) 
            Oh, Chessy, you gave me a fright!
CHESSY 
             I gave you a fright?
Annie 
            You scared me.  I didn't know you were like, in here.
7 0. 
              
              
CHESSY 
            (rising) 
            You sure there's nothing you want to talk to me about? 
            Like maybe why Sammy never comes near you anymore or why your appetite's suddenly changed
            or why all of a sudden you're neat as a pin and using expressions like, 'You gave me a
            fright.,
Annie ' 
            Chessy, I changed a lot over the summer, that's all.
CHESSY 
            if I didn't know better, I'd say it's almost as if you were...
            
            (shakes it off) 
            oh, never mind, that's too impossible. 
            (turns to leave)
Annie 
            -- Almost as if I were      
            Chessy?
CHESSY 
            Nobody.  Nobody.  Forget I even mentioned it.
Annie 
            Almost as if I were... Annie? 
            Chessy stops, stunned, goose-bumps popping up all over.
            
            CHESSY 
            You know about Annie? 
            Annie 
            I AM Annie. 
            Just then, Nick ENTERS, also a little out of breath.
            
              
NICK 
            -- Why'd you take off like that?  I told you I wanted-to
            talk to you about something?  Chessy, why are you looking at her like that?
CHESSY 
            (with a start) 
            Like what?  I'm not looking at her any special way.
            
            (eyes tearing up) 
            I'm looking at her just like I've looked at her for eleven
            years.  Since the day she (MORE)
71.
CHESSY (cont'd) 
            came home from the hospital, six pounds, eleven ounces,
            twenty-one inches long. 
            (crying now) 
            This is how I look at her.  Can I hug her?
Chessy, all broken up, hugs Annie like she's hugging her for the first
            time.
CHESSY 
             She's so beautiful and so big. 
            Annie gives Chessy a look that says, 'Please don't say
            anything!
CHESSY 
            I'm gonna go make you something special to eat.  What
            would you like?  Oh, it doesn't matter.  I'll whip up everything we've got.
Chessy takes off as Nick approaches Annie.
NICK
Why's everybody acting so nutty around here?  Hal, we gotta talk.
Annie 
            Okay.  Shoot.
NICK 
            Honey, look... I want to know what you 
            think about making Meredith part of the family?
Annie 
            Part of our family?
   NICK 
            Yes. 
              
Annie
I think it's an awesome idea. Inspired.  Brilliant really.
   NICK 
            You do?
Annie 
            Totally. it's like a dream come true.  I've always wanted
            a big sister.
NICK
Honey, I'm afraid you're kind of missing the point.
72. 
              
              
Annie 
            No, I'm not.  You're going to adopt Meredith.  That
            is so sweet, Dad..
NICK
I'm not going to adopt her, I'm going to MARRY her.
Annie 
            (leaping up)
Marry her?!?  That's insane!  How can you marry a woman young
            enough to be my big sister?!?
She starts ranting and raving, then slips into French.
NICK 
               Hal, calm down. 
            (realizing) 
               Now you speak French?!?
Annie 
            I learned it at camp. 
            (takes a breath) 
            Okay, I'm sorry.  Let's discuss this calmly and
            rationally... 
              
              
NICK
And in English, if you don't mind.  Man, what has gotten into you?
Annie 
             Nothing. it's nothing... Just... Just...
            
            (lets it all out) 
            Dad, you can't get married!  It'll totally ruin completely
            everything!!!
Annie storms out.  Nick notices Chessy standing in the doorway,
            biting her nails.
CHESSY 
            Don't look at me, I know nothing.
A HORN HONKS O.S. Nick looks out the window and SEES Meredith getting
            out of her red Mercedes convertible.  Nick sinks into a chair, as, he hears Hallie's
            DOOR SLAM upstairs.
NICK 
             Maybe I am too old for this. 
            Meredith sweeps into the room, wearing sunglasses.
            
            7 3 
              
              
MEREDITH 
            (to Nick) 
            Hi, doll.
She sits on Nick's lap, wraps her arms around him.  Kisses
            him.  Kisses him again.
MEREDITH 
            (running her fingers thru his 
            hair) 
            You look stressed, baby.  How about a Martini?
NICK 
            How about a double?
Meredith snaps open her purse and takes out a Tiffany box.
            
            She removes a small SILVER BELL which she holds up and RINGS.
MEREDIITH 
               Chessy?
She RINGS it again.  Nick gives her a curious look.
MEREDIITH 
            Don't you love it? it's just what we need.  It's such a
            big house.
-She RINGS again.  Chessy appears, not too wild about the bell.
. CHESSY 
            You rang?
MEREDITH 
            Two martinis, please.  And make Mr. Parker's a double.
Chessy just stands there.
NICK 
            Please, Chess.    I'm getting a migraine...
Chessy holds her shirt-tails out as if they were a skirt and curtseys.
            
              
(watching her leave) 
            I don't )mow if a uniform will make her look better or worse.
NICK 
            (rubbing his temples) 
            I told Hallie.
74. 
              
              
MEREDITH 
            You did?  And?
NICK
She went ballistic.  Started yelling in 
            French, which I didn't even know she spoke, 
            I just don't get her lately... 
              
              
              
MEREDIITH 
            Nicky, this reaction is totally classic.  It's 'Daddy's
            Getting Remarried - 101'.  I'd worry if she didn't react this way.  Look, why
            don't I talk to her... woman to woman.
NICK
She's a little sensitive about you right now.
MEREDIITH 
            (kisses him)-
That's why I need to do it.  We've got to break the ice sometime.
(unbuttons Nick's shirt button) 
            Wear your shirt like this... I like when 
            I can see a little chest hair. 
              
INT.  HALLIE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Hallie sits on her deck, feet propped-up on the bannister, shuffling a
            deck of cards.  Meredith appears behind her, knocking on the open door.
MEREDITH 
             Knock-knock. 
            (Annie turns) 
            Can I join you?
Annie 
            (shrugs) 
            Sure.
MEREDITH 
            Guess the news of the engagement came as a bit of a shock, huh?
Annie 
            Basically.
MEREDITH 
                  You know, I remember what it was
            like to be eleven.  I had my first beau at eleven. It's a wonderful age.  You're
            starting to feel like a woman and believe it or not soon You'll understand what it's like
            to be in love. 
              
Annie 
            Me? I don't think so.  I don't even have my twelve
            year-old molars yet.
MEREDITH 
            Well, take it from someone who got their molars very early in
            life... being in love is a fantastic mystery that takes a man and woman on a magical
            journey to a place...
Annie 
            -- I don't mean to be jerky when you're trying to be all mushy
            and everything but I think I know what mystery my Dad sees in you.
MEREDITH 
            You do?
Annie 
            You're young and beautiful and sexy and hey, the guy's only
            human.  But if you ask me, marriage is supposed to be based on something more than
            just sex, right?
ITH 
            Boy, your father underestimates you.
Annie 
            But you won't, will you, Meredith? 
            They study each other carefully.
MEREDITH 
            So what if I'm young and beautiful?  That's not a crime,
            you know.  And for your information, I adore your father.  He's exactly-the kind
            of man I always planned on marrying.  This is the real deal, honey and nothing you do
            is going to come between as.  The reality is, angel, you are no longer the only girl
            in Nick Parker's life.  Get over it.
Annie 
            .If this is the real deal, then my Dad's money has nothing do
            with you wanting to marry him, right?
'7 6 
              
              
MEREDITH 
            I hope you're not suggesting I'm marrying your father for his
            money.
Annie 
            All I know is, I've seen Cinderella a few zillion times and I'd
            rather not end up scrubbing the floors and befriending all the birds in the neighborhood
            while you're having breakfast in bed... if you get my drift?,
MEREDITH 
            You are unbelievably out of line, young lady. 
            (rising)
Now you listen and listen good.  I'm marrying your father in two
            weeks whether you like it or not.  So I suggest you do not tangle with me
            anymore.  You're in way over your-head. is that clear?
Annie 
            Crystal.
CLOSE ANGLE - A RINGING FAX MACHINE
as a FAX slithers out.  A HAND reaches for the FAX.  ANGLE
            BACK -to see Martin, standing in ELIZABETH'S KITCHEN in LONDON.  He looks at the FAX
            quizzically, then carries it into:
THE DINING ROOM
where Hallie is eating dinner with her Mother and Grandfather. 
            Martin refills the adults' wine glasses, holding the FAX behind his back as he pours.
ELIZABETH 
              This is fantastic wine by the way  Martin.
Hallie 
              May I have a-sip?
ELIZABETH 
            (offering her a sip) 
            I don't think you're going like it.
Hallie swirls the wine confidently, passes it under her nose, then takes
            a healthy sip.
77. 
              
              
              
Hallie 
            If you ask me, the bouquet is a little too robust for a
            Merlot.  But then again, I'm partial to the softer California grape.
Elizabeth and Grandfather laugh, as Martin moves next to Hallie, holding
            the FAX behind his back.  Hallie cocks her head to read it.
CLOSE - THE FAX
It's a drawing of SAMMY, Hallie's dog, laying on the front porch of
            Hallie's house.  A CARTOON BUBBLE coming out of his mouth says 911!
Hallie bends over so far to read the FAX she FALLS OFF HER CHAIR and
            RIGHT OUT OF FRAME.
ELIZABETH 
            Honey, are you okay?
Hallie 
            Had one sip too many, I guess. 
            (getting up) 
            You know, Mother, I feel like I could use a bit of fresh
            air.  Would it be okay if I stepped outside for a moment?
ELIZABETH 
            of course.  Are you okay?  Would you like me to come
            with you?
Hallie 
            No, no.  I'll be fine... Just got a touch woozy, that's
            all.
Hallie wipes her mouth with her napkin and excuses herself.  Her
            Grandfather watches her closely as she EXITS. 
              
EXT.  SHEPHERD'S MARKET - LONDON -
            EARLY       NG
Hallie hurries down the picturesque street, turns a corner, spots a
            phone and rushes to it.  She pulls the door closed and dials the Operator.
Hallie 
            Yes, I'd like to make a collect-call to 
            California, please.  Area code 707 ...
78. 
              
              
              
              
INT.  HALLIE'S ROOM    NAPA - SAME TIME
Annie paces, biting her nails for real now.  The PHONE RINGS. 
            She pounces on it in mid-ring.
Annie 
            Hello?  Yes, I'll accept the charges. 
            Hallie, thank goodness you got my fax. 
            I'm absolutely desperate.
Hallie (O.S.) 
            What's up?  Why the 911?
INTERCUT   Annie AND Hallie
Annie 
            Dad's getting married.
Hallie 
            (laughs) 
            Whaddya mean, getting married?
Annie 
            I mean black tie, white gown, the whole enchilada.  The
            wedding's in two weeks so, if there's any hope of getting Mom and Dad back together, we've
            got to do it fast.
outside the Phone Booth, a MAN reads the evening paper, waiting to use
            the-phone.
Hallie 
            okay, Mom and I are going to the theatre tonight so I'll drop
            the bomb on her first thing in the morning.
Annie 
            Give Mom a kiss for me, willya.  And Grandfather,
            too.  And Hallie, hurry.
EXT.  PHONE BOOTH
Hallie hangs up and steps out of the booth, BUMPING into the Man who's
            been waiting.
Hallie 
            Oh, excuse me.
The MAN turns around.  It's Hallie's GRANDFATHER.
79. 
              
              
  Hallie 
            Uh-oh...
GRANDFATHER 
            What do you say you and I take a little stroll in the park,
            young lady.
Hallie bites her locket as her Grandfather leads her into the park.
EXT.  James TOWN HOUSE - ESTABLISHING
            - MORNING 
            INT.  ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
            Elizabeth sits up in bed, in white satin pajamas, finishing a
            cup of coffee and a phone call to Paris.  She sketches a wedding gown on a pad as she
            talks.
ELIZABETH 
            (in French) 
            Au, Mademoiselle.  I will have the sketch to you by
            tomorrow.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Thank you.  Au revoir.
Hallie appears in the doorway, listening to her mother talk on the
            phone.  Grandfather walks by and gives Hallie a little nudge, pushing her into the
            room.
ELIZABETH
Hi, sweetie.  Come on in.
Elizabeth pats the bed.  Hallie crosses and climbs in next to her
            mother.
ELIZABETH 
            (with her arm around Hallie) 
            I have to finish this sketch and Fed Ex it to Paris, then how
            about you and I go out to lunch and spend the rest of the day getting lost in Harrods?
            
              
Hallie 
            (nervously)
I can't.  Mom, sorry, I have to go out of town today.
'ELIZABETH 
            You have to go out of town? 
            (thinks she's kidding) 
             And where may I ask are you going? 
            Hallie SQUIRMS UNDER THE COVERS, entirely disappearing.
            
            8 0 
              
              
ELIZABETH 
            Annie?
HALLIE'S VOICE 
            (from under the covers) 
            That's where I have to go.  I have to go see Annie.
ELIZABETH (playing along) 
             I see.  And where would Annie be? 
            Hallie's SHAPE SQUIRMS further UNDER the covers.
            
            HALLIBIS VOICE 
              in Napa with her father, Nick Parker. 
            CLOSE - ELIZABETH
as it hits her.  Her eyes widen.  She looks up to see HER
            FATHER leaning in the door frame, puffing on his pipe.  He nods.  Elizabeth's
            eyes instantly fill with tears.  She lifts the covers to see Hallie, hiding, scared
            to death. 
              
             ELIZABETH You're not Annie?
Hallie 
            That would be correct.
   ELIZABETH 
            You're Hallie... 
              
Hallie 
            I am. 
            (crawls out from under covers, then with her American accent)
            
            Annie and I met at camp and we decided to switch places. 
            I'm sorry, but I'd never seen you and I'd dreamt of meeting you my whole life and Annie
            felt the exact same way about Dad, so we just sorta switched lives.  I hope you-re
            not mad because I love you so much and I just hope one day you can love me as me and not
            as Annie.
ELIZABETH 
            oh, honey, I've loved you your whole life. 
            She takes Hallie in her arms.
81. 
              
              
ELIZABETH 
            Why didn't you tell me it was you all along?
Hallie 
            (thru teary eyes) 
            I was scared.
ANGLE - DOORWAY
where Martin stands, BAWLING hysterically.  Grandfather gently
            steps in and shuts Elizabeth's door.  Martin falls into Grandfather's arms, heaving.
MARTIN 
             I've never been so happy in my entire life.
            
            Grandfather pats him gently. 
            INT.  ELIZABETHIS ROOM    SAME TIME
            
            Hallie and Elizabeth break from their hug.  Elizabeth
            wipes her tears.
Hallie 
              I guess you have to switch us back now, huh?
            
              
ELIZABETH 
            Legally, you belong to your father and Annie belongs to me.
Hallie 
            'His' and 'Hers, kids.  No offense, Mom, but this
            arrangement really sucks.
ELIZABETH 
            I agree, it totally sucks.  I don't want to lose you now
            that we've been together.
Hallie 
            Well, then I guess we'll just have to fly to Napa, see Annie
            and Dad and work this whole thing out.
  ELIZABETH 
            I guess we will.
Hallie 
            Will you be nervous about seeing Dad again?
ELIZABETH 
            No, of course not. 
            (as if it's preposterous)
82.
               
            ELIZABETH (cont'd) 
            I can handle seeing Nick Parker after all these years. 
            People see their ex's all the time, don't they?  Not to worry, sweetheart.  I'll
            take care of everything.  Not-to-worry. 
              
INT.  ELIZABETHIS BEDROOM - THE FOLLOWING DAY
Elizabeth is a mess.  She wears a silk blouse over a slip and a few
            Velcro rollers just on top of her head.  She chain smokes as she paces.  Open
            luggage is laid out on the bed behind her.  Martin ENTERS carrying freshly pressed
            clothes.
ELIZABETH 
            I'm sorry, I can't handle this'.  I haven't seen or heard
            from Nick Parker in over eleven years and suddenly I'm flying halfway across the world
            to... I'm not mature enough for this. if the man didn't make me so nuts, I'd still be
            married to him.
(pulling out rollers) 
            We came up with this-arrangement so we'd never have to see each
            other again. 
            (puts on sunglasses) 
            Look at me, Martin, have you ever seen me like this? 
            Don't answer that. 
            (pacing) 
            What if he doesn't recognize me?  Be honest, Martin, how
            old do I look?  No, don't answer that either.  Hey, what am I worried
            about?  He could be fat or bald.  Or both.
MARTIN 
            Actually, Hallie says her Dad's quite the hunk.  And never
            re-married, either.  Just like you, ma'am.
ELIZABETH 
            Martin, it just so happens I'm not remarried by choice. 
            I've had my opportunities for llamour.  Not lately, of course.  But I've had my
            share of gentlemen callers.
   MARTIN 
            Not lately.
ELIZABETH 
              I just said that!  Hallie said he was a
            
              hunk, huh?  He was rather dashing.  He
            
              used to make me weak in the knees, if you Can imagine
            that. 
            (looks in the mirror) 
            Is that a grey hair?!
She yanks the hair out as Hallie ENTERS carrying an overnight bag.
Hallie 
              All set, Mom.
ELIZABETH 
            (suddenly composed) 
            Good.  Me too.  Almost.  Not quite.
Hallie 
             Mom, your suitcase is totally empty.
ELIZABETH 
            Oh. Right.  Sorry.  Did you speak to your father,
            dear?
Martin looks at Hallie.  She LOCKS EYES with him for an instant,
            then turns to her Mom.
Hallie 
            Uh, yeah, I just hung up with him, actually.  He said he's
            really anxious to see you.
ELIZABETH 
            He did?  Anxious-nervous, like he's dreading it or
            anxious-excited like he's looking forward to it?
Hallie 
            Anxious-excited, definitely.
Again, Martin SQUINTS at Hallie, just knowing she's lying.  But
            Hallie rolls on...
Hallie 
            He said he'll meet us tomorrow at noon at the Four Seasons in
            San Francisco.
ELIZABETH
Tomorrow?  My, my that's incredibly soon, isn't it?  Well,
            honey, why don't you run downstairs and gather our tickets from your Grandfather while I
            finish up here?
Hallie starts out, Martin follows.
84 
              
              
MARTIN 
            (sotto, to Hallie) 
            Liar, Liar, pants on fire...
ELIZABETH 
            Oh, Martin, could you come back for a moment, please?
Hallie raises her finger to her lips to 'Ssshhh" Martin, as he
            RE-ENTERS Elizabeth's room.
ELIZABETH 
            Martin, I have a really ridiculous, somewhat childish request
            to make.  Martin, you know you're more than a Butler to me.  You're like a
            lovable brother who just happens to wait on us and...
(Martin nods modestly) 
            Anyway, I was wondering if... 
              
              
              
MARTIN
-- I'd accompany you to make the trip a bit easier for you?
ELIZABETH 
            Would you, Martin?  I'd be forever grateful.  And you
            don't even have to go as our butler.  Just as a friend.
MARTIN
Madame, I'd be honored.  And as a friend, may I say...
(reaches into her closet) 
            -- if I were seeing my ex after eleven years and I had your
            legs...
(pulls out a little RED DRESS) 
               I'd wear this baby.  You'll kill in it.
            
              
EXT.  ELIZABETH'S TOM HOUSE - THAT AFTERNOON
A Limousine waits at the curb.  Martin, in a black leather jacket
            and shades, hands the luggage off to the Limo Driver.  Elizabeth hugs her Father
            good-bye.  Then, it's Hallie's turn.  She throws her @ around her Grandfather.
Hallie 
            Bye, Pop.
GRANDFATHER 
            Bye, Hal.
8 5 
              
              
Hallie 
            You're coming to Napa for Thanksgiving, right?
GRANDFATHER 
            I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Hallie rises up on her tiptoes and kisses her Grandfather good-bye.
GRANDFATHER (as she runs off) 
            Say hello to your Father for me!
Hallie 
            (waving as she gets in Limo) 
            I will!

            EXT. THE FOUR SEASONS - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY 
            A CLOCK above the hotel's entrance clicks to twelve noon.
            
            INT.  HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
Meredith walks across the lobby with her PARENTS, a stunning couple in
            their early fifties.  We can see where she gets her looks and confidence.
MEREDITH 
            (checks her watch) 
            Okay, they'll be here any minute... Be nice, Daddy.  He's
            everything you ever wanted for your little girl... plus millions more.
MR. BLAKE 
             Then you know I'll be nice.
MEREDITH 
            (laughs) 
            Okay, there he is... 
            (her face drops) 
             -- with the whole motley crew. 
            ANGLE  THE FRONT ENTRANCE 
            Nick, Annie, Chessy and Sammy ENTER the Lobby.  Meredith
            rushes to greet them, kissing Nick.
8 6 
              
              
 MEREDITH 
            Hi, darling... 
            (then, nods to the others) 
            Hallie, Chessy... And Sammy, what in the world are you doing
            here? 
            (to Nick) 
             Honey, a dog in The Four Seasons?
NICK 
             Hal begged me to bring him.
MEREDITH 
             And naturally you said 'yes'. 
              Sammy snaps at Meredith. 
            CHESSY 
            (sotto, pats Sammy) 
            Good doggy. 
            (then) 
             Meredith, these the folks..? 
            MEREDITH 
             Yes!  Mom... Dad... finally, you all meet.
            
            (links arms with Nick) 
            This is my fiance and the love of my life, Nick Parker and this
            is his adorable daughter Hallie who we can all thank for bringing us together this
            weekend... This entire get together was her idea I'll have you know...
MR. BLAKE 
            Well, how are you young lady, I've heard nothing but wonderful
            things about you.
Nick beams. 
              
EXT.  FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - SAMF.  TIME
A TAXI pulls up and Martin and Hallie step out.  Martin then
            reaches in the backseat and helps Elizabeth out.  She is wearing dark sunglasses and
            is more than a little tipsy.
She takes a small airplane-size vodka bottle from her purse and polishes
            it off, tossing it over her shoulder.  Martin CATCHES IT before it crashes to the
            ground.  As Hallie and Martin guide Elizabeth up the steps to the hotel...
'ELIZABETH 
            That was a great flight, wasn't it?  So quick.
87. 
              
              
MA.RTIN 
            I never saw you so... thirsty, before, ma'am.
ELIZABETH 
            -- You mean you never saw me drink so much vodka before! 
            Guess what?  I've got news for you, Marty old chap... never tasted the stuff
            before.  Not once.
MARTIN 
            Could've fooled me, ma'am.
ELIZABETH 
            (to Doorman) 
            Hello, Doorman.  Oh, you scared me, I thought you were
            real for a minute..
Hallie 
            (to herself) 
            I'm in such major trouble here.
INT.  HOTEL LOBBY
Martin and Hallie lead Elizabeth through the Lobby and deposit her at
            the Front Desk.  Miraculously, Nick and Meredith are nowhere in sight. 
            Elizabeth RINGS the BELL a zillion times. -Hallie stops her by placing her hand over the
            bell.
Hallie 
              Mom, you gonna be okay?
ELIZABETH 
            Absolutely.  Never felt better in my life.  But
            darling, tell me 'cause I'm a bit confused... Have we landed yet?
With that comment, Hallie lies her head down on the counter.
            
            WHIPS ACROSS THE LOBBY 
            where Meredith, her folks, Nick, Chessy, Annie and Sammy EXIT a
            Dining Room. 
              
              
              
              
MEREDITH
-- I'm just saying, I know it's short notice,, but if they can do it, I
            think it would be a brilliant room for the wedding... Not too big, not too cramped... Not
            that I don't like the idea of getting married at the house... I do but this could be...
            amazing...
CAMERA WHIPS BACK ACROSS THE LOBBY
as Hallie leads Elizabeth away from the FRONT DESK and toward a BANK OF
            ELEVATORS.  Elizabeth tries to hitch a ride on a passing luggage cart.  Martin
            peels her off.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOBBY
Sammy sniffs like a Hound Dog on the hunt, pulling Annie away from Nick,
            Meredith and Meredith's Folks.  Annie holds onto Sammy's leash while at the same
            time, holding Chessy's hand.  They are dragged across the lobby as they others stay
            behind.
MEREDITH 
            I've already checked us in, so why don't we go up to the rooms,
            freshen up, then meet for lunch?
MR. BLAKE 
            Sounds good, I'm starved.  Meet you back here in ten.
MEREDITH
(kisses her Dad on the cheek) 
             Perf.
(then, leaning on Nick) 
            Sweetheart, want to check out the Honeymoon Suite while we're
            here?  I bet it's to die for.
AT THE SAME TIME - ELIZABETH, Hallie AND
            MARTIN 
            step into an OPEN ELEVATOR.  As the doors are about to
            close ... 
            ELIZABETH 
            oh, jeez... 
            She sticks out her band and the doors POP BACK OPEN.
ELIZABETH 
             -- Forgot my purse.
She RUSHES OUT of the elevator and CROSSES BACK toward the
            
            Front Desk just as...
SNIFFS HIS WAY
toward HALLIE'S OPEN ELEVATOR.  Sammy looks up, sees his favorite
            girl!
Hallie 
            (from the elevator) 
            Sammy!
Hallie and Annie lock eyes as SAMMY BOLTS from Annie and leaps INTO THE
            ELEVATOR, paws up on Hallie, licking her face.
AT THE FRONT DESK - ELIZABETH GRABS HER PURSE
and heads back to the elevator where she joins Annie, putting her arm
            around her.
Annie 
            Mom!
Chessy's eyes widen, she does AN IMMEDIATE ABOUT-FACE so as not-to be
            seen.
ELIZABETH 
            Honey, you didn't have to wait for me, I could've found the
            room by myself.  Besides ... 
            (whispers) 
            I've got to make a pit stop.  Vodka makes you have to go
            like crazy... Go on,thweetie, I'll meet you upstairs ... 
            (Chessy sneaks a peek at her) 
            I mean, upthstair... uppth... upppthst... 
             I'll meet thyou up... thstairs! 
            (EXITS, then turns back) 
            I like that jacket by the way.  Were you 
             wearing that the whole time on the plane?
Elizabeth turns back and just misses colliding with a Bellhop carrying a
            huge BOUQUET OF FLOWERS.  Annie slaps her forehead.
Annie 
            (to Chessy) 
            She's drunk.  She's never had more than one glass of wine
            in her entire life and she chooses today to show up zonked.
CHESSY 
            (leading her into an elevator)' 
            Just do what the woman says and meet her upthstairs.
Chessy and Annie get into a waiting elevator, it's DOORS CLOSE and they
            are gone.
A BEAT LATER
Nick and Meredith stroll up to the same elevators.  Meredith
            nibbles on Nick's ear as an elevator arrives.  They step INSIDE THE ELEVATOR.
MEREDITH 
            Alone at last.
Meredith folds her arms around Nick's neck.  At that very
            
            moment, Nick spots:
ELIZABETH - STANDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIM
Nick blinks, unable to believe his eyes.  Elizabeth smiles and
            gives him a little wave.'
Nick's EYES WIDEN as Meredith, her back to Elizabeth, continues kissing
            Nick.  As the ELEVATOR DOORS START TO CLOSE, Nick leans further and further to his
            right, trying to keep his eyes on Elizabeth.  He leans, he leans ... but the DOORS
            CLOSE.  He stands there stunned, eyes wide open.
INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 
            Elizabeth barrels down the hallway, focused and furious.
            
            ELIZABETH 
            Hallie Parker!
Simultaneously, 7WO DOORS OPEN ACROSS THE HALL FROM EACH OTHER. 
            Hallie stands in one doorway, Annie in the other.
ELIZABETH (cont’d) 
            Don't do this to me, I'm already seeing double!  Which one
            of you is Hallie? 
            (Hallie raises her hand) 
            Okay, now... 
            (then, softens at the sight of Annie) 
            oh, honey ... hi... 
              
              
Annie 
            Hi, Mom.
Elizabeth crosses to Annie and hugs her.
ELIZABETH 
              You look beautiful.  So tan and healthy...
            
            (kisses her, then, remembering) 
            Okay you two:.. How could you do this to me?
CHESSY 
            (arriving behind Annie) 
            .may I suggest we take this little pow-wow inside.
            
             (to Elizabeth) 
            Hi, you probably don't remember me...
ELIZABETH 
            (warmly) 
             Chessy!
CHESSY 
             I knew I always liked you. 
            INT.  HOTEL SUITE - MOMENTS LATER The Girls sit
            side-by-side.
ELIZABETH 
            Let me put this as sucthinkinctly as possible.  You...
            
            (points to Hallie) 
             I mean, 
            (points to Annie) 
            -- One of you told me your father knew I was arriving here
            today... And I'm here to tell you the man I just saw in the elevator had absolutely no
            idea he and I were on the same planet, let alone in the same hotel.
Annie 
             You saw Dad already?
ELIZABETH 
            Yeth.  And it was completely and utterly
            humiliating.  I gotta lie down... (flops down on sofa, resting her head on a pillow)
            
            The man went completely ashen.  Like I was the bloody
            ghost of Christmas past. 
            (rubs her head) 
            Can one of you get me something cold for my head?
            
            (the Girls cross to the bar) 
            Don't you think I've pondered what it was going to be-,like to
            see your father again after all these years? 
            (the Girls exchange a look) 
            Well, let me tell you, me waving like a mindless idiot while
            Nick Parker is wrapped in another woman's arms is not exactly the scenario I had in
            mind.  No sireee... 
              (the Girls arrive with a wet washcloth and a glass of
            water) 
            Thank you. 
            (she places the wash cloth on (MORE)
92.
ELIZABETH (cont'd) 
            her forehead, shuts her eyes) 
            And furthermore and much worse, is the fact that I've been lied
            to by my own children and I'd like to know why.
On that note, Martin passes through the room wearing only a SPEEDO
            BATHING SUIT.  Elizabeth cracks open an eye, sits up.
ELIZABETH 
              Martin!  What are you doing?
MARTIN 
              Going for a swim.  Do you mind?
ELIZABETH 
            No, no, that's perfectly perfect.  By all means, yes, have
            fun... someone ought to.  Just put on a shirt... my God...
She lies down again as Chessy ENTERS from an adjoining room with
            Sammy.  She stops when she sees Martin.
CHESSY 
              Oh... Hell-o.
MARTIN 
            Hello, Hello...
There seems to be something in the air between them.
ELIZABETH 
              Oh, Chessy, this is our butler, Martin.
            
              
CHESSY 
            (plainly interested, extends her hand) 
            How do you do? 
            (indicates Hallie) 
            I'm her butler.
MARTIN 
            (gallantly kissing her hand) 
             Enchante, mademoiselle.
CHESSY 
             Gee, the pleasure's all mine, monsieur.
The Girls can't believe it and suppress their giggles.
ELIZABETH 
            Girls!  You were going to tell me why you lied and brought
            me here without telling your father!?!
93 
              
              
CHESSY 
              Were they? 0-kay, that's good. 
            (starts tip-toeing out) 
            Well, then why don't I just slip back into my room and check
            out  the ol' mini bar...
MARTIN 
            (trying to escape) 
             Allow me to assist you...
ELIZABETH 
            (sits straight up) 
            Wait!  You mean everyone knows but me?!?  What's
            going on here?
Everyone freezes.
Annie 
               Mom... Daddy's getting married.
ELIZABETH 
               Oh. I see... getting married...
Annie
-- To Cruella de Ville.  She's awful, Mom...We can't let him go
            through with it.
ELIZABETH
Girls, your father's a grown man and quite capable of deciding whom he
            wishes to marry..
Hallie 
            But she's all wrong for him.  And the only way he won't
            marry her is... 
            (to Annie) 
             You tell her, she )knows you better.
Annie 
             Is if he sees you again.
ELIZABETH 
            (piecing-it together) 
             You're trying to fix me up with your father.
Hallie 
             Why not?  You're perfect for each other.
Annie 
              A match made in heaven. 
            By now, Chessy and Martin have reached the door.
9 4 
              
              
ELIZABETH 
              Hold it!  You two knew about this?
MARTIN AND CHESSY 
            (turn, ad jibbing at the same time) No. Not exactly.  We
            tried to reason with them.  What could we do?  They made us do it.  We're
            the hired help.  Don't fire us.  It was a mistake.
 
   ELIZABETH 
            (rises unsteadily) 
            okay, let me say this loud and clear.  Nick Parker and I
            have nothing in common... anymore.  Plus, in case you haven't noticed, he seems
            extremely content with his leggy, long haired, tight-skirted fiance.  I want the two
            of you to explain to your father that I am here for one purpose only and that's to switch
            you two back.  Now, let's do what we have to do and be done with it. 
            Understood? 
              
              
CLOSE ANGLE - MEREDITH
in THE SUITE NEXT DOOR.
MEREDITH 
            No. I don't understand.
Nick nervously runs his fingers through his hair and straightens his
            clothes as he tries to get out the door.
NICK
I just need to go downstairs for a few minutes to c-c-clear my head...
            then I'll meet you for lunch.
MEREDITH 
            Clear your head?  What do you have to clear your head
            about?  Is something wrong?
'NICK
I hope not.  I mean... no.  What could be wrong?  We're
            getting married in ten days, everything's perfect. 
            (then, quickly) 
            I gotta go.
'He quickly kisses her on the cheek, opens the door.
95. 
              
              
MEREDITH 
            We're still going ring shopping after lunch, right?
NICK 
            Ring shopping?
MEREDITH 
             Nicky!
NICK 
            Of course!  For the funeral.  I mean, for the
            wedding.
  MEREDITH 
            The funeral?!?
NICK 
            I'm kidding. 
            (laughs)
Don't listen to me.  I'll see you there. I mean, here. 
            Downstairs.
He slips out the door, hurries down the CORRIDOR and bumps right into
            Annie.
Annie 
            (as Hallie) 
              Hey, Dad, what's up?
NICK 
            Just running down to the lobby.  Hey, Hal, do me a favor,
            keep Meredith company, willya? 
            (rushing off) 
            Thanks, kiddo. 
            (turns back)
Do I look alright?  Like presentable and everything?  Not too
            old?
Annie 
             You look fab, Dad.  Young and fabulous.
            
              
LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
Nick rushes off the elevator, looks around for Elizabeth. lie turns a
            corner and bumps into the real Hallie, who hasn't seen her Dad all summer.
  Hallie 
            Dad! 
              
9 6
NICK
I thought you were going to keep Meredith company?
Hallie
I was?  'I mean, I am.  Yeah.  I was actually just
            looking for her. 
            (then) 
            It's great to see you, Dad. She can't help herself and gives
            her Dad a quick hug.
NICK 
              It's great to see you too, squirt. (pats her on the
            tush) 
            Now go on, get up there.
Nick heads off in one direction as CAMERA TRACKS Hallie back to the
            elevators.  An elevator PINGS and Meredith steps out, checking herself in a
            compact.  She snaps the lid shut when she sees Hallie (who has never laid eye’s
            on Meredith).
MEREDITH 
              Have you seen your father?
Hallie 
              You talkin' to me?
ITH 
            What are you, Robert DeNiro?  Yes, I'm talking to you.
Hallie 
            (realizes)
oh! Meredith... Uh, yeah, I just saw him...
MEREDITH 
            (straightens out her suit) 
            Well, hel-lo?  Where was he?
Hallie 
            Oh, he went; thataway, I think. 
            (sizing her up)
MEREDITH 
             What are you staring at?
Hallie
Oh, nothing.  You really are pretty... -that's all.
97. 
              
              
MEREDITH 
            Don't tell me you're going to break your rotten streak and
            suddenly be nice to me? 
            (starts off)
If you see your father, tell him I'm waiting.
MULIE 
            (to herself, as Meredith exits) 
             Whatever you say,'Cruella. 
              
EXT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR
Nick ducks his head into THE HOTEL GIFT SHOP, looking for
            Elizabeth.  Instead, he sees Annie buying a candy bar.  He does a double-take.
NICK 
            What are you doing?  I thought you were gonna...
Annie 
             -- She wasn't in her room, Dad.
NICK 
            she wasn't?  Oh... okay... See you in a little bit, kid.
Annie 
                                    
            if not sooner, Dad. 
              
INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
Nick walks along the corridor, looks through a bank of windows and
            thinks he sees Elizabeth walking through the HOTELIS GARDEN.  He tries to get a
            closer look but gets caught in the midst of a group of Japanese Tourists.  Elizabeth
            notices him and gives a little wave.
Nick weaves through the Tourists but when he gets to the patio,
            Elizabeth is gone.  Discouraged, he pauses, then SEES Hallie sitting in a large
            wicker chair, under a palm tree, sipping a fruit cocktails He jumps, surprised.
Hallie 
            Lookin, for somebody, Dad?
9 8. 
              
              
              
HOTEL BAR - MOM = S LATER
Meredith enters, takes a seat at the nearly empty bar. only one other
            customer sits at the bar - Elizabeth.  Meredith sits one stool away from her. 
            The Bartender delivers a red concoction to Elizabeth, who holds a glass of ice to her
            head.
BARTENDER 
            Here you go.  This'll cure anything you got.  Just
            don't ask what's in it.
ELIZABETH 
            (hesitates) 
            Okay... Here's to..' 
            (turns to Meredith, not 
            recognizing her)
Here's to you.  May your life be far less complicated than mine.
MEREDITH 
            Thank you...
Elizabeth tosses down the drink and winces at the taste.
MEREDITH 
            (orders) 
               Martini, dry and a pack of Parliaments.
            
            Elizabeth belches. 
              ELIZABETH 
            Excuse me... 
            (to Meredith) 
            I apologize.  Really, I'm so... (belches again)
            
             -- sorry.  I think I just drank tar.
The Bartender hands Meredith her drink and Elizabeth her bill. 
            Elizabeth signs her check and Meredith sneaks a peak at her signature, practically choking
            on her Martini.
MEREDITH 
            You're Elizabeth James?
   ELIZABETH 
            Guilty. 
              
I can't believe it.  You're the designer, 
            Elizabeth James?
9 9 
              
              
              
  ELIZABETH 
            still guilty.
MEREDITH 
            I faxed your office just yesterday.  I 
            saw a wedding dress you designed and fell 
            completely in love with it.  Your office 
            said you were out of town and they didn't 
            know if you could make another one.  I 
            can't believe it.  This is fate. 
            (moves to' seat next to her, 
            extending her hand) 
            I'm Meredith Blake.
ELIZABETH 
            (shaking her hand) 
            How do you do? 
              
MEANWHILE - AT THE POOL
Nick steps into the sunlight, still searching for Elizabeth.  He
            sees a Woman resembling Elizabeth sitting under a large straw hat.  He crosses to
            her, takes a quick peek, realizes it's not her and smiles an apology to the Lady and her
            BodyBuilder Husband.  He backs into an umbrella as Meredith's Parents join him.
MR. BLAKE 
            There you are!  We've been looking all over for you!
MM. BLAKE 
            Nicholas, I think this hotel is perfect for the wedding... The
            more I see of it, the more I like it.
NICK 
            (still looking around) 
            Me too.  Absolutely.
Nick glances across the pool and spots Elizabeth arrive, talking on a
            cell phone.  She waves shyly at Nick, slipping on sunglasses.
MM. BLAKE 
            Tell me, dear, how many guests will there be from your side of
            the family?  Just a guesstimate?
NICK 
            (staring across at Elizabeth) 
            I'm not sure at the moment... Can I get back to you on that
            one?
I 0 0 
              
              
MRS.  BLAKE 
            Of course, And are we thinking formal attire or...
A small contingent passes in front of Elizabeth, blocking her from
            Nick's view.  Not wanting to lose her, Nick darts around a Towel Boy, side-steps a
            couple of Toddlers, then trips over a rubber duck.
CHESSY 
            (lying on a chaise next to Martin, looks up) 
            Boss, you okay?
Nick glances over at her, gets tangled up in Sammy's leash and almost
            crashes right into Annie.
Annie 
            Dad!  Watch out!
Too late!  Annie and Sammy jump out of the way as Nick SPLASHES
            head first into the deep end of the-pool.
ELIZABETH TURNS
and SEES Nick pulling himself out of the pool and coming toward her,
            soaking wet, cheek bleeding, not looking terribly happy.
ELIZABETH 
            Nick, hello... Long time no see... 
            (backing up) 
            Please try not to go crazy...
NICK 
            A little late for that advice.  What is going on?  I
            haven't seen or heard from you in eleven years and suddenly you're popping up everywhere I
            look and naturally on the day I'm--
Annie appears at her Mother's side.
Annie 
              -- Dad, I can explain why she's here.
NICK
  Hallie, you know who this is?
Annie 
            Actually, yes.  And actually I'm not Hallie.
            
            Hallie appears on Elizabeth's other side. 
            10 1 
              
              
Hallie 
            Actually, I am.
Nick looks from Annie to Hallie, back to Annie, then to
            Elizabeth.  She's nods.  He's speechless.
NICK 
              Both of them?  Annie... Hallie...
Annie 
            I guess you and Mom sort of think alike ,cause you both sent us
            to the same camp.  We met and the whole thing kind of just spilled out.
ELIZABETH 
             They decided to switch places on us, Nick.
NICK 
            Wait a minute.  You mean I've had Annie all this time5
Annie
(nods) 
            I wanted to know what you were like and 
             Hallie wanted to know Mom.  Are you angry?
it takes a moment to sink in, then Nick takes Annie in his arms.
NICK 
            Honey, of course not.  It's just... I can't believe it's
            you.  The last time I saw you... you had diaper rash.  Look at you...
Annie 
            Well, I'm quite grown up now and quite without a father.
Hallie 
            And I'm headed into my crazy mixed'-UP teenage years and I'll
            be the only girl I know without a mother to fight with.
NICK 
            (still trying to put it together) 
             Hal, you've been in London all this time?
            
            (Hallie nods) 
            Come here.
He pulls her to him..
I 0 2 
              
              
Hallie 
            Mom's amazing, Dad... I don't know how you ever let her go.
ELIZABETH 
            Girls, why don't you let your father and I talk for a couple of
            minutes, okay?
The Girls take off.    Nick grabs a towel ... dries his
            hair.
NICK 
            oh, man, I can't believe this.  Seeing them together...
            and you... and... 
            (a beat) 
            How are you, Lizzie or does everyone call you Elizabeth now?
ELIZABETH 
            No, no, Lizzie's fine.  My Dad still calls me
            Lizzie.  I've been terrific.  How 'bout you?
NICK 
             Well, I've had better days. 
            (touches his cheek) 
             Ouch!
ELIZABETH 
            Let me help you with that? 
            (to passing Towel Boy) 
             Excuse me, do you have a First-Aid kit?
TOWEL BOY 
             Sure.
ELIZABETH 
            Okay, lie down...
Nick lies on a chaise as the Towel Boy returns with a First Aid
            Kit.  Elizabeth sits beside Nick, tending to his cut.
NICK 
            (looking up at her) 
            How is your Dad, still sneaking those stogies?
    ELIZABETH 
            Every day.
They exchange a smile.
NICK 
            I can't believe it, you haven't changed at all...
103 
              
              
ELIZABETH 
              You thought maybe I'd be fat and grey?
NICK 
              Well, not grey... 
            (then) 
            Ouch!
ITH'S VOICE 
            -- Finally!  There you are!
Nick and Elizabeth turn, looking CLOSE ENOUGH to be kissing. 
            Meredith is taken aback.
MEREDITH 
            (thrown by seeing them together) 
            Oh. You've met Elizabeth.  Good.  Honey, Elizabeth's
            going to make my... wedding gown... But, I don't understand... How did you two meet and
            why are you so wet?
NICK 
              I wasn't paying attention and I... 
            (turns to Elizabeth) 
              You're making My fiance's wedding gown?
ELIZABETH 
              Nick, I didn't know she was y OUR fiance...
NICK 
            (confused) 
              How did we meet?  How did you two meet?
MEREDITH 
              Am I missing something here?
NICK 
              Sweetheart, you know what?  This is one all
            world...
MEREDITH 
             How small?
Just then, Annie arrives.
AI*IE 
            Oh, hi, Mer.
ITH 
             Hello.
10 4 
              
              
Hallie 
            (joining Annie) 
            How ya doin'?
Meredith SCREAMS at seeing double.
NICK 
               Honey, did I ever mention Hallie was a twin?
MEREDITH 
            No, as a matter of fact, you didn't.  Two of them?!? 
            How fabulous.
Hallie 
            Don't feel bad, Mer, he never mentioned it to me, either. 
            Imagine My surprise.  By the way, I'm the real Hallie.  This is Annie.  She
            was just pretending to be me while I was in London pretending to be her.  And this is
            our Mom, Elizabeth James.  By the way Dad, I want to change my name to Hallie
            James-Parker.
MEREDITH 
             This is your mother?
GIRLS 
             Yes.
MEREDITH 
            (to Elizabeth) 
             You were married to Nick?
ELIZABETH 
            Guilty again.
MEREDITH 
             well, this is a small world.
NICK 
             And getting smaller.
ITH 
            And what a coincidence that we're all here on the same exact
            weekend.
ELIZABETH 
            it's not exactly a coincidence.  The children arranged it
            so their father and I could work out their custody situation.
The Girls smile.
I 0 5 
              
              
MEREDITH 
              The children arranged it?  Oh.  How sweet.
            
              
INT.  TIFFANY - THAT AFTERNOON
CLOSE on a JEWELRY CASE filled with DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RINGS. 
            CAMERA TILTS UP to find Nick and Meredith, browsing in Tiffany.
MEREDITH 
            I'm sorry, I just don't see why you have to have dinner with
            your ex-wife with her little 'Mary Poppin's accent.  Why couldn't you just meet her
            in the lobby, discuss the custody, shake hands and say good-bye?  I'll tell you why -
            because your daughters don't want me to marry you.
NICK 
              That's not true.
MEREDITH 
            (to Saleswoman) 
                                 
            Can we have some help over here, please? 
            (then)
It-s totally true.  They see me as the ,evil step-mother., Trust
            me, I'm not being paranoid.  Those girls have something up their sleeve...
(without missing a beat, to Saleswoman)
Can I try on the emerald cut please?  No, the bigger one... The
            biggest one.
NICK 
            Honey, calm down.  The girls have never had a meal with
            both their parents in their entire lives.  How could I say no?
MEREDITH 
            (lightening up as she slips on 
            the ring)
I told you to let me represent you on all your negotiations, didn't I?
            
            (showing, him the ring) 
            This is incredible.  What do you think?
NICK 
            I think I have to get dressed for dinner.
MEREDITH 
            (whines) 
            Nicky...
I 0 6 
              
              
NICK 
            If you love it.  I love it.
MEREDITH 
            (throws her arms around him) 
            I love it. 
              
EXT.  FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - THAT NIGHT
Nick and Hallie exit, both dressed to the nines.  A LIMO waits by
            the curb.
NICK 
            Hal, I've had enough surprises for one day... just tell me
            where we're going...
Hallie 
            You're gonna love it, Dad, trust me.
Just then, Elizabeth and Annie step out of the hotel.  Elizabeth is
            wearing the red dress Martin recommended.  Nick tries not to admire her too openly.
NICK 
            Hey... Hi.
ELIZABETH 
            Hi. So do you know where they're taking us?
NICK 
             She won't crack.
Annie
(as they cross to Limo, hands them eye shades) 
            Okay, now put these on.  You can take them off when we
            reach our destination.
NICK 
             We're going in a limo?
Hallie 
            You want one of us to drive? 
            (off Nick's look) 
            Please, indulge us. 
              
A DARK STREET - NIGHT 
              
A FOGHORN sounds, as the Limo pulls to a stop.  The Girls hurry
            out.
107 
              
              
Annie 
             Okay, you can take them off.
Nick and Elizabeth exit, taking off their blindfolds.  Their eyes
            widen as they look ahead and SEE:
AN EXQUISITE 150 FOOT YACHT 
            all lit up and bobbing gently in the sparkling Bay.
            
            Hallie 
               She's ours for the night.
NICK 
               And exactly how are we paying for her?
Annie 
               Hallie and I pooled our allowances.
            
            Nick and Elizabeth look at her doubtfully.
Annie 
            Okay, Grandfather pitched in a bit. (they continue looking at
            her) Okay, he pitched in a lot.
Nick and Elizabeth exchange a quizzical look, as they follow -the Girls
            down the steps to the DECK, where a Uniformed Captain welcomes them aboard.
Hallie 
             okay folks, right this way... 
            Hallie and Annie open a pair of DOUBLE DOORS: 
            Hallie 
               Ta da’ 
            And in front of them, they SEE:
AN ROMANTIC DINING ROOM
where a candle-lit table is set for two.  The windows reveal the
            San Francisco Bay, lit by the yacht's twinkling lights.
NICK 
               The table's only set for two.
Annie 
            That's the other part of the surprise we're not joining you.
108 
              
              
ELIZABETH 
            You're not?
The Girls smile and shake their heads as Chessy ENTERS, dressed as a
            Ship's Steward, in tropical white.
CHESSY 
            No, but I am.  Good evening, I'm Chessy, I'll be your
            server tonight.  No wisecracks please.'
At that moment, out steps Martin, also dressed in ship's whites and
            carrying a bottle of champagne.
MARTIN 
            And I'm Martin, your Sommelier.  May I offer you both a
            taste of the bubbly in hopes that you'll get a little snickered and won't can this lovely
            lady and myself for following the orders of two eleven year-olds...
CHESSY 
            Annie, mood music, if you please.
Annie pushes a few buttons and the LIGHTS DIM.  Moonlight spills
            into the room as we HEAR Sade's Smooth Oper-ator play over the cabin's speakers.
Annie 
            (like a hypnotist) 
            Relax... Sail through time...
Hallie 
            -- Back to yesteryear...
The Girls disappear behind double doors, leaving Nick and Elizabeth
            looking thoroughly confused.  Chessy approaches with a tray of hors d'oeuvres.
CHESSY 
            You don't get it, do you?  Smooth Oper-ator...'Big hit in
            186 ... The year you two met... Hors d'oeuvre?
ELIZABETH 
            So, that's what this is all about.
Nick notices a LIFE RAFT with a homemade sign that says QE2 hanging on
            the wall.
1 09 
              
              
NICK
  They're recreating the night we met ... 
              The boat... the music ...
CHESSY 
            (points to herself) 
            The help.
'ELIZABETH 
            (a little misty-eyed) 
            it's incredibly sweet.
NICK 
            Martin, I think I'll have that drink. 
            Martin pours them both champagne, then he and Chessy slip away.
NICK 
            To tell you the truth, I haven't been on a boat since the -QE2.
ELIZABETH 
            Neither have 1.
A soft wind blows Elizabeth's hair.
NICK 
            (taken with her, lifts his glass) 
            Well then, here's to...
ELIZABETH 
            (finishing his sentence, lifts her glass) 
             Our daughters.
NICK
(not exactly what he was thinking, but okay) To our daughters.
THROUGH A PORTHOLE
Hallie and Annie sneak a peek, thrilled to see their Parents toasting.
BACK TO SCENE
NICK 
            You know, I always see you in Hallie.  I always
            have.  Something about her eyes ...
ELIZABETH 
            That's funny.  I always see you in Annie.
            
            Something about her smile.
An awkward moment, they each sip their champagne.  As they glance
            over at the porthole, the Girls drop out of sight.
NICK 
              Now I know how a goldfish feels. 
            (re: Girls) ' 
              They turned out pretty good though, huh?
ELIZABETH 
              We've been lucky.
NICK 
            Sometime, if we're ever really alone maybe we could talk
            about... what happened between us.  It all feels a bit hazy to me now... It ended so
            fast.
ELIZABETH 
             It started so fast.
NICK 
             Now that part I remember perfectly. 
            THROUGH ANOTHER PORTHOLE 
            Chessy and Martin watch.
MARTIN 
            Looks like things are heating up nicely. I'd say it's safe to
            serve the vichyssoise.
CHESSY 
            You ladle, I'll serve.
They start back toward the galley.  It's tight, they try to pass
            one another and get momentarily stuck, their eyes lock, then they squeeze past each other.
            
              
 (pulling himself together) 
              Yes, I'll ladle.
CHESSY 
              Right.  And I’ll...
MARTIN 
              serve.
CHESSY 
              Right.
THE I)INING ROOM - SAME TIME
ELIZABETH 
            So, you've done incredibly well.  Your dream of owning
            your own vineyard... it actually came true.
NICK 
            Hey, how about you, always drawing on napkins and corners of
            newspapers?  Now you're this major designer... pretty impressive.
.ELIZABETH 
            Yeah, it's amazing.  We both actually got where we wanted
            to go...
NICK 
            Yep.  We did.
Chessy ENTERS carrying two bowls of soup and places them in front of
            Elizabeth and Nick.
NICK 
              So, what do we do about the girls?
ELIZABETH 
            Well, I guess now that they've met, we can't very well keep
            them apart.  I could keep them half the year and you could--
CHESSY 
            -- Guys, they can't go to two schools every year.
   NICK 
            I agree.
ELIZABETH 
             Okay, I could keep them for a whole year, then you
            could--
NICK 
            -- Liz, this is why we... 
            (looks at Chessy.)
CHESSY 
             Sorry.  Ignore me.  I'm gone. 
              She backs out of the room. 
            112 
              
              
NICK 
            This is why we came up with the solution we have.
ELIZABETH 
            Really?  I thought it was because we 
            decided never to see each other again.
NICK 
            Not we Lizzie...
ELIZABETH 
            You know that part's become a bit hazy for me too over the
            years.                    
            for me too over the years.
NICK 
             You don't remember the day you packed?
ELIZABETH 
            No, that day I remember perfectly.  Did I hurt you when I
            threw that suitcase?  I've often wondered.
NICK 
            (rubbing his shoulder) 
            Let's put it this way, I'll never pitch for the Yankees.
            
            (starts his soup, stops) 
            So how come you never got married again?  I always figured
            by now you'd be re-married with a new family...
ELIZABETH 
             Me? No... no, no... no... 
              
NICK 
             That's a lot of no’s..
ELIZABETH 
            That's because I realized a long time ago marriage wasn't for
            me...
A beat of silence.  Nick starts to eat again, stops.
NICK 
            You know I may be alone with you again, so... About the day you
            packed... Why did you do it?
ELIZABETH 
            Nick, we were getting along so badly, we found out we each had
            tempers, we said
1 13 
              
foolish things... So I packed... Got on my first 747 and... you didn't
            come after me.
Dead silence.
NICK 
               I didn't know I was supposed to.
ELIZABETH 
            Well, it really doesn't matter now... Let's put on a good face
            for the kids, shall we and get this show on the road... 
             (looks at her watch)Gosh, I'm still on London time, so...
NICK 
            (resigned) 
            Okay.  Yeah.  You're right.  Let's get the show
            on the road.
Elizabeth starts her soup.  Nick joins her, not a word passing
            between them.
ANGLE - THE PORTHOLE
Annie and Hallie watch, crestfallen. 
            EXT.  FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - ESTABLISHING - FOLLOWING A.M.
            INT.  HOTEL LOBBY - FRONT DESK - SAME TIME
Elizabeth signs her bill, turns to Martin who tips the Bellman.
            
            ELIZABETH 
               All set then.  Where's Annie?
            
            MARTIN 
            I just called, she's on her way down. 
            Nick and Chessy join them.  Everyone's spirits are low.
            
            NICK 
            Okay, so 11.11 uh... send Hallie back to you over Christmas.
ELIZABETH 
            And I'll see that Annie spends Easter with you.
The ELEVATOR OPENS and Hallie and Annie step off, dressed identically in
            T-shirts and overalls. it's impossible to tell them apart.
I 1 5 
              
              
NICK 
            (to Annie) 
            This one's Hallie, I'm positive.
Hallie 
            (grins at him)
I hope you're right, Dad.  You wouldn't want to send the wrong kid
            all the way back to England.
Nick looks to Elizabeth, he can't be sure.
Annie 
            Here's our proposition.  We go back to Dad's house, pack
            our stuff and the four of us leave on the camping trip.
ELIZABETH 
            The four of us!?
Annie
And when you bring us back, we'll tell you who's Hallie and who's Annie.
ELIZABETH 
            Or... You do as we say and I take one of you back with me to
            London whether you like or not.
CUT TO: 
            A 747 SOARING INTO A CLEAR BLUE SKY
BOOMS DOWN to... 
            EXT.  NICK'S HOUSE - NAPA - THAT AFTERNOON
            
            As FOUR SLEEPING BAGS are tossed into the TRUNK of Nick's
            
            SUBURBAN.  Nick throws in the final bag as Meredith
            watches, wearing a tight suit and sunglasses.
MEREDITH 
            What am I supposed to do for three days sit home and knit?
Elizabeth exits the house looking very Out of Africa, carrying a
            backpack.
N=ITH 
            Excuse me, what is she doing here?
11 6 
              
              
NICK 
            That was the deal - the four of us go together.
MEREDITH 
            What are you suddenly, the Brady Bunch? 
             This is ridic--
   ELIZABETH 
            -- Hi, Meredith. 
            (off her look) 
            Everything okay?
MEREDITH 
            Well, no, as a matter of fact, it isn't.  I didn't realize
            you were going on this little outing and to tell you the truth, I'm not so sure I am okay
            with it.
ELIZABETH 
            I agree.  The ex-wife in the next sleeping bag is a little
            weird...
MEREDITH 
            Thank you.
ELIZABETH 
             I insist you come with us, really. 
              Meredith stops cold. 
            NICK 
            Liz ... 
            ELIZABETH 
            Nick, I messed-up up your entire weekend, it's the least I can
            do to pay you back.
EXT.  NICKIS HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Annie and Hallie exit-with Chessy.  As the Kids climb into the car,
            they notice Elizabeth and Meredith come out of the house.  Meredith is now dressed in
            tight black work-out gear.
Hallie 
              Dad, what's Meredith doing here?
NICK 
            (getting behind the wheel) 
            Your mother invited her.  Be nice.
The Girls look at each other, then to Chessy, as Meredith smiles and
            climbs into the front seat.
 ELIZABETH 
            (closes door) 
            Okay.  Have fun everybody.
NICK 
             Liz, what are you doing?
ELIZABETH 
            I really think you and Meredith need time alone before the big
            day.
Annie 
             Mom!  Come on, that's not the plan.
ELIZABETH 
            Honestly, you'll have much more fun without me.
MEREDITH 
            (having second thoughts) 
            Look, if you're not going... I don't have to go... Trust me,
            I'm not exactly a big nature girl.
ELIZABETH 
            But this'll be your chance to really get to know the girls...
            Starting next week, they're half yours.
Nick catches Elizabeth's eye.  She blows him a kiss.
ELIZABETH 
            Have fun yall'!
As the car pulls off, Chessy turns to Elizabeth.
CHESSY 
            I would pay to see that woman climb a mountain.
            
              
A VISTA OF RUGGED TERRAIN
as far as the eye can see.  CAMERA DISCOVERS Hallie and Annie
            climbing a steep hill, wearing back-pack and baseball caps.  They're followed by
            Meredith, puffing and perspiring, dabbing sunscreen, on her nose as she tries to keep her
            balance.  Nick brings up the rear.  Meredith plops down on a rock, trying to
            catch her breath.
MEREDITH 
            I'm gonna kill my trainer... He says I'm in such great shape...
            
            (rubbing her legs) 
            I can't believe people actually do this for fun.
NICK 
            (calls) 
            Girls, hold on, we're stopping.
Hallie 
            (coming back towards them) 
            Again?  Dad, at this rate, it'll take three days just to
            get up the mountain.
NICK 
            Meredith isn't used to the altitude... Just chill, okay?
Behind Nick and Meredith, we SEE Annie SLIPPING LARGE ROCKS into
            Meredith's Prada Backpack.
MEREDITH 
            Somebody hand me my Evian... I can't move.
Annie spots a SMALL LIZARD, grabs it and places it on top of Meredith's
            water bottle.
Annie 
            Here you go, Mer.
Meredith takes the bottle, lifts it to her mouth and finds herself
            =-TO-EYE with the LIZARD.  She SCREAMS, tossing the Evian bottle in the air, losing
            her balance and SLIPPING off the rock.
NICK 
              Honey, you okay?
Annie 
            (catching the Lizard) 
            This little guy was on her Evian bottle, I guess.
            
            (holding Lizard upside down by it's tail) 
            He won't hurt you, Mer. 
              
              
MEREDITH 
            (S CREAMS  again) 
            Get it away from me!  I hate things that .crawl. 
            It's disgusting... It's a lizard, it should be a belt.  Ugh, how can you touch
            it?  Put it down!
Annie 
             Okay.
Annie walks behind Meredith and gently DEPOSITS the Lizard right on top
            of Meredith's head.
NICK 
            Why don't I take the lead, you two help 
            Meredith.
Nick moves off.  Meredith rises, still not knowing the Lizard sits
            on top of her head. 
              
              
MEREDITH 
            (to Girls) 
            Sure, you're going to help me... right over a cliff, you'll
            help me.
Hallie 
            (sotto, to Annie) 
             Not a bad idea.  See any cliffs? 
            Meredith GROANS as she now lifts her much heavier backpack.
            
            Annie 
            Need a hand? 
              MEREDITH 
            (pulling away) 
            Not from you, thank you.  Don't think I can't see right
            past those angelic faces. one more trick from you two and I promise I'll make your lives
            miserable from the day I say 11 do'.  Got it?
Hallie 
             Got it, Cruella.
MEREDITH 
            (turns) 
             What'd you call me?
Hallie 
             Nothing.  Not a thing... 
            (sotto) 
             Cruella. 
            (then, turns back) 
            oh, Mer... I think there's something on your head...
The Girls-walk ahead.  Meredith reaches up and feels her hair...
            then her HAND lands on the LIZARD.  She SCREAMS a BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM and the
            Lizard panics and runs down her
12 0. 
              
              
FACE and right INTO HER MOUTH.  Meredith's EYES BULGE, she
            
            SPITS the Lizard out, GAGGING and COUGHING.  Nick and the
            
            Girls run back.
NICK 
            Are you okay?!?  What happened?!
Bright RED and in SHOCK, Meredith stomps her feet and points to Annie
            and Hallie.  We can almost see the smoke pouring out of her ears.
Annie 
            What did we do, Dad?  We were with you. 
              
EXT.  TRAIL - A LITTLE LATER
Meredith walks by herself, banging the buttons on her cell phone.
MEREDITH 
            Please work... Hello?  Hello?
Meredith stops when she SEES Annie and Hallie bent over examining
            something on the ground.  Meredith sneaks up behind them and OVERHEARS:
Annie 
            I didn't know they had mountain lions up here.
Hallie 
             Oh yeah, the place is crawling with them.
            
            (winks at Annie) 
            An old Indian guide once showed me how to keep them away.
            
            (picks up TWO STICKS and hits them together) 
            Just do this and they'll never come near you.
The Girls pick up sticks &,ad move off down the trail, CLACF,ING
            them together.  Meredith stoops, picks up two sticks, CLACKS them together and
            follows. 
              
A CRACKLING CAMP FIRE   THAT NIGHT
Nick, the Girls and Meredith sit around the campfire.  Everyone
            eats trout, except Meredith, who sits on a rock, wrapped in a blanket, swatting at
            mosquitos and rubbing lotion on her arm.
12 1. 
              
              
              
Annie 
            You sure you don't want some trout, Mom?  Is that okay, by
            the way?  If we start calling you Mom?
MEREDITH 
            I think your mother would prefer if you called me Meredith and
            no thank you, I do not eat trout... for the thousandth time.  I'll wait until
            breakfast.  What are we having?
NICK AND THE GIRLS 
             Trout.
NICK 
            We always live off the trail up here, it's part of the
            experience.
   MEREDITH 
            (swatting away) 
            What's the other part, being eaten to death by mosquitos?
            
            (swats at another mosquito, then looks at lotion)
            
             You'd think they actually liked this stuff.
NICK 
             What is that you're using? (looks at the bottle, puts
            some on his hand) 
            You're going to attract every mosquito on the mountain. 
            This is sugar and water... Where’d you get this stuff?
Meredith looks to the Girls, who busy themselves eating.
MEREDITH 
            That's it.  I’m taking a large sleeping pill and
            going to bed.
She picks up her two sticks and WHACKS them together as she moves off
            toward her tent.
NICK 
              Sweetheart, what are you doing?
MEREDITH 
              I don’t want the mountain lions to...
            
            (realizes she's been had) 
            --There are no mountain lions up here, are 
            there?
122 
              
              
              
Nick shakes his head.  Meredith glares at the Girls, drops her
            sticks in the fire, walks to Nick and gives him a luscious kiss goodnight, smiles at the
            Girls and marches off to her tent.
NICK 
            I'm telling you guys, lay off.  This isn't her thing,
            okay?  I'm not marrying her because she's Annie Oakley.
Annie 
             Who’s Annie Oakley?
NICK 
            Just cool it. 
              
EXT.  CAMPSITE - MIDNIGHT
Everything is quiet.  An Owl HOOTS in the distance.  The Girls
            sneak out of their tent and tiptoe over to Meredith's tent.
INT. MEREDITH'S TENT
The Girls step inside, see Meredith fast asleep on her air
            mattress.  They position themselves at Meredith's head and feet and on the
            "count of three", LIFT her up on her mattress.  It isn't easy.  As
            they carry her out, Meredith -moves her arm, brushing her hand across Hallie's nose. 
            Hallie twitches her nose but keeps going.
The Girls step out of the tent carrying Meredith on her mattress. 
            CAMERA TRACKS them down a path to the lake-front, where they quietly drag the air mattress
            into THE LAKE, nod to each other and push her off.
Hallie 
            (watching Meredith drift away) 
            Sweet dreams, Mommy Dearest. 
              
EXT.  LAKE - HIGH SHOT - DAWN
Meredith is sound asleep on her back in the middle of the lake.  A
            BIRD rests on-her nose.
CLOSER ANGLE - MEREDITH
She flops an arm into the water.
MEREDITH 
            (in her sleep) 
            That feels so nice...

She gently moves her fingers in the water, then her EYES SPRING
            OPEN.  She looks straight up as the BIRD flaps its wings and flies across her
            face.  Meredith SC sits up, realizes she's in the middle of the lake.  She SC
            again, her voice ECHOING off the mountains.
 MEREDITH 
            Niiiiiick!!!!!!
Nick sticks his head out of his tent, half-asleep, spots Meredith
            thrashing around, screaming, in the middle of the lake.
NICK 
            What's she doing in the lake?
Hallie and Annie peek out of their tent and see Meredith splashing back
            to the shore in her soaking wet pajamas.  She storms past the campfire, kicks the
            coffee pot into the air and marches up to Nick.
NICK 
              What's going on?
MEREDITH 
            Here's what's going on, buddy, the day we say I do" is the
            day I ship those brats off to Switzerland.  Get the picture?  It's me or
            them.  Take your pick.
NICK 
            Them.
MEREDITH 
            Excuse me?
NICK 
            (spells) 
            T-H-E-M.  Get the picture?
EXT.  NICK'S HOUSE - AT SUNSET
Elizabeth sits on a rocker on the front porch, reading when she hears
            Nick and the Girls pull up.  She rises to greet them.
ELIZABETH 
              Back so soon?  Did you have fun?
Annie 
            Not exactly.
124 
              
              
Hallie
 We've been punished through the end of the century.
NICK 
              Starting now.  Go.
   ELIZABETH 
            Where's Meredith?
Hallie 
              We played a couple of harmless tricks on her and she
            kinda freaked out a little.
NICK 
              A little?
 (shows Elizabeth the ring) 
              We broke up.
ELIZABETH 
               oh, jeez ... This-is all my fault.  If I
            hadn't suggested she go...
NICK 
              -- Tricked her would be more like it. 
              Like mother, like daughters...
ELIZABETH 
               I'm really sorry, Nick.
Annie 
               We are too, Dad... really.
Hallie 
               Will you forgive us?
NICK 
               Up to your room! 
            (when they're gone, he smiles) 
               I gotta remember to thank them one day.
ELIZABETH 
               You're relieved?
NICK 
              I think I am. 
             (not wanting to talk about it) 
             I’m also starving... Chessy around?
    ELIZABETH 
            She and Martin went off on a picnic around noon... yesterday.
12 5 
            (Nick looks up on that one) 
                                     
            Hopefully they'll be back... soonish...
NICK 
                                    
            Who would've thought my Nanny and you Butler... 
            (then) 
            So, listen, how 'bout I whip us up something to eat?
ELIZABETH 
             You know how to cook now?
NICK 
            of course, I )mow how to cook.  I can make pasta... and
            pasta... and...
   ELIZABETH 
             Pasta sounds good. 
              
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Nick, now clean shaven and wearing fresh clothes, passes the Girl's
            room.  Inside, we SEE Hallie and Annie in pajamas, getting into bed.
Hallie 
            Wow!  You look so nice, where are you going.
NICK 
            (shutting their door) 
            Good night, Ladies! 
              
INT.  KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Elizabeth sets the table as Nick enters.
NICK 
              Smells good in here.
ELIZABETH 
              Really?  I'm just boiling water.
NICK 
              oh. Then it must be you... 
            (takes out wine glasses) 
            So what are you in the mood for, red or white?
ELIZABETH 
            I think red.
12 6 
              
              
NICK 
            Follow me...
INT.  STONE STAIRWELL
leading to Nick's private WINE CELLAR.  A cavernous space lit by
            beautiful lanterns.  The walls are lined with bottles of wine... ladders lean against
            the walls, library style.
NICK 
            This is where I keep my private stash. Did you know I also
            collect wine?
ELIZABETH 
            Oh really?
NICK 
             Yeah, I'm a man of limited interests.
Elizabeth laughs.  Nick leads her into a small cozy room, pulls a
            bottle from a rack.
NICK 
            Here's a 1921 Burgundy... They say the rain that year made this
            the best Burgundy ever harvested... Oh wait, you'll appreciate this one...
            
            (shows her another bottle)
   ELIZABETH 
            (reads label) 
            Vi Day, 1946... incredible.
NICK 
             Yeah, I love that... 
            (shows her another bottle) 
            The same wine my parents served at their wedding... a 152
            Bordeaux.  I think my sister was conceived off this baby.
  ELIZABETH 
            What's this-one? 
            (reads label) 
            Where Dreams Have No End... 1983.
NICK 
            That one actually took me years to track down.
ELIZABETH 
            Why, where's it from?
127 
              
              
              
NICK 
             It's the wine we drank at our wedding.  I now have
            every bottle ever made.
ELIZABETH 
            (completely thrown) 
            You do?
NICK 
             I do.
ELIZABETH 
             Can we open one?
NICK 
             You're the only one I'd drink it with.
Nick pulls a bottle from the shelf, dusts it off.  He looks at
            Elizabeth and sees her eyes are teary.
NICK 
            You okay?
ELIZABETH 
             Just got a little dust in my eye...
NICK 
             I can offer you a clean sleeve to...
ELIZABETH 
            (pulling back from the offer) 
             No, no, I'm fine, now.  Really.' All better.
NICK 
             You don't always have to be so brave, you know.
ELIZABETH 
            Oh, but I do, actually...
just then, they HEAR the cellar door opening above them and footsteps.
CHESSY (O.S.) 
            Anybody home?
Nick hesitates, looks to Elizabeth, who shrugs.
NICK 
            Yeah... We're on our way up...
128. 
              
              
Nick and Elizabeth climb the stairs and enter the KITCHEN where they are
            greeted by Martin and Chessy.  Martin wears shades and a Laker baseball cap.
ELIZABETH 
              Welcome back... How was the picnic?
CHESSY
Who knew the man wanted to eat in L.A.?  We drove eight hours to
            have a picnic in a city with no parks.
MARTIN
But what a town!  I saw mountains, beaches, I saw Michael Keaton,
            not to mention I found out I have the same hand size as John Wayne and the same shoe size
            as John Barrymore.
CHESSY 
            The man is a lot to handle... but a lot of fun.  How was
            the camping trip?  Aren't you back early?  Are we interrupting anything? 
            We are.  Let's go, Marty.
ELIZABETH 
            No, no, you're not interrupting anything. Are you hungry? In
            the mood for some pasta?
Nick looks at Elizabeth, wishing she hadn't invited them to stay.
CHESSY 
            You don't mind?  We haven't eaten since Hearst Castle.
NICK 
             No, no, it's fine.
ELIZABETH 
            I'll set the table for two more...
As Chessy and in Join them, Nick slips the bottle of-wine into a cabinet
            and closes the door. 
              
CLOSE - ON A ROW OF SUITCASES
lined up IN FRONT OF NICK'S HOUSE.  CAMERA TILTS UP as Elizabeth
            comes down the front steps and joins Annie and Martin, who are dressed and ready to go.
12 9 
              
              
ELIZABETH 
            Okay, then, I guess that's that.  We're really off this
            time.
ANGLE   NICK, MULIE, CHESSY AND SAMMY
sadly watching as a Cab Driver loads the baggage into the trunk. 
            The Girls hug and promise to see each other over Thanksgiving.  Chessy and Martin hug
            and promise to see each other over Christmas...
Then Nick and Elizabeth hug in a distant way and let go very quickly.
NICK 
            Take care of yourself.
 ELIZABETH 
            You too.
The trunk is closed and Elizabeth hugs Hallie hard... Nick hugs
            Annie.  Elizabeth, Annie and Martin wave, then duck into the cab.  As the taxi
            pulls off, Chessy, Hallie and Sammy all look up to Nick.  He turns away...
            
              
EXT.  LONDON - ESTABLISHING - DAY
A Taxi ENTERS FRAME, rounds a corner and pulls up in front of
            Elizabeth's town house.
INT.  F.LIZABETHIS TOWN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
            Elizabeth and Annie ENTER, dropping their bags by the front
            door.
ELIZABETH 
            Hi ... We're home 
            They don't bear anything. 
            Annie 
            (calls out) 
            Grandfather? 
            ELIZABETH 
            I'll check his study.
Elizabeth ENTERS THE STUDY, and sure enough, there he is, sitting behind
            the desk, hidden behind The Financial Times.
ELIZABETH 
            Hey stranger...
13 0. 
              
              
              
The paper comes down and Elizabeth SEES it's Hallie
            sitting behind the desk.
Hallie 
            Hi, Mom.  Did you know the Concorde gets you here in half
            the time?
ELIZABETH 
            (stunned) 
             Yeah, I've heard that... 
            Annie arrives in the door behind Elizabeth, shocked to see
            Hallie. 
            Annie 
              What are you doing here? 
            Hallie 
            it took us around thirty seconds after you left to realize we
            didn't want to lose you two again.
 ELIZABETH 
            We?
NICK 
            (appears from the doorway 
            behind Hallie) 
            We. I made the mistake of not coming after you once, Lizzie and
            I wasn't going to do it again... no matter how brave you are.
'Elizabeth looks across the study at Nick, her eyes once again filling
            up, a smile on her face.
ELIZABETH 
            Thank you.
They stand frozen, their eyes locked on each other. 
              
Annie 
            Pssst....
She signals for Hallie to Join her in the hall.
EXT.  STUDY - SECONDS LATER
Hallie rushes up to Annie.
Hallie 
            We did it!  We did it!
13 1. 
              
              
They hug.
Annie 
               It's unbelievable.
Hallie
OhmyGod, you guys are gonna love living in California....
Annie
What do you mean ... California?  You two are going to love living
            in London...
Hallie 
            London???
CLOSE ON ELIZABETH AND NICK
embracing by the window.  CAMERA PULLS BACK through the WINDOW and
            CONTINUES into THE FRONT YARD, revealing Chessy and Martin, in each other's arms. 
            CAMERA BOOMS UP and AWAY finally REVEALING Sammy barking in the front yard at a little
            Poodle in the yard next door.  And as Grandfather walks down the street, opens the
            garden gate and enters the path to the house, we fade out
