		February 6, 1985






		 FADE IN:

		 MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

		 New York Rangers v. Edmonton Oilers.

		 15,000 screaming fans leap to their feet.

		 Gretsky steals the puck, streaks across the ice, beats two
		 defenders, shoots and scores.

		 Oilers 6, Rangers 0. Oiler fans bellow approval

		 One silent SPECTATOR, in overcoat, slacks and scarf, stands
		 out in the crowd, unmoved by the din. He is:

		 CONNER MACLEOD

		 An aura of power and charisma sets him apart. His hypnotic
		 eyes watch Ranger defenders slam Gretsky into the wall,
		 punching and kicking him.

		 SHOUTING PLAYERS storm onto the ice

		 STICKS SWING IN A BRUTAL FREE-FOR-ALL.

		 The crowd CHEERS. A DRUNK WHOOPS at the silent man.

							  DRUNK
				   Helluva fight, ain'it? Helluva fight.
				   Lotta fun, ain'it?

		 Oblivious, Macleod watches the battle. In his mind,
		 the STICK-WIELDING PLAYERS BECOME:

											CUT TO:

		 15TH CENTURY HIGHLANDERS WIELDING BROADSWORDS

		 CLASHING in battle. Mountains tower over rocks and heather.
		 WHINNYING HORSES, agonized CRIES, RINGING steel, SKIRLING
		 PIPES.

							  DRUNK V.O.
				   Let's go belt somebody, then i buy
				   you a drink. Whaddya say?

											CUT TO:

		 HOCKEY STICKS CLASHING IN MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

		 in the riot on the ice.

		 Concentrating, MacLeod scans the crowd. Like a predator
		 catching a scent, he leaves swiftly. The Drunk yells after
		 him.

							  DRUNK
				   Hey!  Where ya goin'?

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 striding past rows of cars. FOOTSTEPS ECHOING in the Garden's

		 underground garage. MacLeod senses a presence. It's very
		 close.

		 Suddenly, a MAN's silhouette appears in a tunnel, blocking
		 his path, breath steaming in the artic air.

							  MAN
				   MacLeod.

		 A huge sword appears in the Man's hands. He swings. MacLeod
		 sidesteps, drawing a weapon from inside his coat.

		 A Samurai sword, carved handguard, razor-sharp, 
feather-light.

		 The Man's overhead slams onto concrete, ripping up hunks of
		 stone. MacLeod fans his blade.

		 MACLEOD AND THE MAN"S SWORDS

		 clang in the tunnel, pulverizing cars, gouging columns in
		 showers of brilliant sparks.

		 Running Feet, Shouting VOICES, distant SIRENS.

		 His opponent is outmatched. Surging forward:

		 MACLEOD

		 cuts off the Man's head. A shimmering energy surges between
		 the corpse and MacLeod. MacLeod starts to glow. The garage
		 is crackling. Windshields EXPLODE. SIRENS closer.

							  VOICE O.S.

				   Over here -- !

		 Samurai sword in hand, MacLeod sprints off, swallowed by the
		 dark. People SHOUT.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 racing through the garage. Behind him, a woman screams.
		 Desperate, he hides his weapon in a roof duct hidden by
		 tiles, driving it out of sight.

		 In the arena above, New York scores. The CROWD CHEERS.
		 The SOUND DISTORTS, becoming --

											CUT TO:

		 CHEERING VILLAGERS LINING A ROAD

		 Loch Shiel, Scottish Highlands, 1536. Glamis castle
		 towers over thatched huts by the shore.

		 A DRAWBRIDGE CRASHES down like thunder, skirling BAG-
		 PIPES and DRUMS.

		 THE CLAN MACLEOD

		 Two hundred strong, rides out to battle, tartan cloaks,
		 bronze shields, claymores flashing in the sun.
		 Hatchet-faced FATHER RAINEY chants prayers.

							 FATHER RAINEY
				   God bless our brave heroes. May
				   this year of Our Lord 1536 bring
				   victory to the Clan Macleod.

							  VILLAGERS
						(cheering)
				   Death and damnation to the
				   Fraziers! Long live the Clan
				   MacLeod!

		 Riding in the column:

		 CONNER MACLEOD

		 The ice hockey spectator, 466 years earlier. The same age
		 but rough-hewn, not yet possessing the quiet strength of
		 later years. Eyes alight, huge claymore sword strapped to
		 his side.

		 Carved into the blade, the single word:

						  MACLEOD

		 Riding with him, two older clansmen: DUGAL, his
		 cousin, short, arms like trees, and ANGUS, bulky and
		 bearded. Dugal shouts over the din.

							  DUGAL
				   Are you scared, Conner?

							  MACLEOD
						(lying)
				   No, cousin Dugal. I'm not.

							  ANGUS
						(to MacLeod)
				   Don't talk rubbish, lad. I peed
				   my kilt the first time I rode to
				   battle.

							  DUGAL
						(to MacLeod)
				   Ah, Angus pees his kilt all the
				   time.

		 MacLeod laughs, hiding his nervousness.

		 A pretty girl, KATE, races down the column holding high
		 a bouquet.

		 MacLeod sweeps her up. She plants the flowers in his
		 hat. She jumps down excitedly.

							  DUGAL
						(continuing;
						 to MacLeod)
				   A girl like that can wound a
				   soldier more than a Frazier's
				   sword, my friend.

							  KATE
				   Angus, you and Dugal bring him
				   back in one piece. D'you hear?

							  DUGAL
				   We know which piece you want,
				   lassie.

		 Yell from Angus. DRUMS and BAGPIPES.

											CUT TO:
   
		 THE KURGAN

		 standing on a hill, watching the Clan MacLeod advance
		 into the gathering moorish fog below.

		 The Kurgan is a frightening hulk astride a massive
		 black stallion. Flashing eyes and a cruel mouth.

		 Frazier chief MURDOCH gallops up.

							  KURGAN
				   Is the one called Conner among
				   them?

							  MURDOCH
				   Aye.

							  KURGAN
				   Remember our pact. The boy is
				   mine.

		 Murdoch nods. He fears this giant.

		 FROM BELOW

		 can be heard the BATTLE CRIES and frenzied BAGPIPES of
		 the MacLeod and Frazier clans.

							  MURDOCH.
				   It's begun. Death to the MacLeods!

		 They charge.

											CUT TO:

		 THE BATTLE OF LOCH SHIEL, 1536

		 MacLeods and Frazers collide in fury. Raging carnage.
		 Fog slowly moving in.

		 MacLeod, Dugal and Angus in the thick of it. MacLeod
		 tries to engage the enemy. Each time they avoid him.

		 Dugal's helpless beneath three Frazers. Flying from
		 the saddle, Angus kills two of them. The third bolts.

		 Gradually, the fog makes it impossible to see more than
		 a few yards. Each man's battle is his own, hopelessly
		 separated from the battling clansmen around them.

		 Wild-eyed, MacLeod leaps off his horse, hauling Dugal up.

							  MACLEOD
						(shouting)
				   Nobody will fight me! They all
				   run away!

							  DUGAL
						(grinning)
				   Great, laddie. Stay by me.

		 Suddenly, they see:

		 A HULKING GIANT ON A BLACK STALLION

		 thundering down on them, sword wheeling, an unstoppable
		 juggernaut, butchering everything in his path.

		 It's the Kurgan

							  MACLEOD
						(transfixed)
				   Mother of God -- !

		 He feels dizzy. The Kurgan knocks Dugal senseless,
		 disintegrating MacLeod's shield.

		 Snarling, he vaults from his horse, driving his blade
		 deep into MacLeod's stomach.

		 Mortally wounded, MacLeod drops to his knees, vainly
		 swinging at the ghastly specter. The Kurgan swats away
		 his sword as though it were a toothpick.

		 Relishing the moment, he raises his blade high, voice
		 grating in triumph

							  KURGAN
				   There can be only one.

		 MacLeod is helpless. Time hangs suspended. Lost in
		 the blackness of the Kurgan's eyes, he prepares to meet
		 his maker.

		 At the last second, Dugal, Angus and others appear,
		 pile-driving the Kurgan back over dying clansmen.

							  KURGAN
						 
				   Another time, Highlander.

		 Life ebbing, MacLeod groans, staring at the sky.

											CUT TO:

		 POLICE CRUISERS

		 SCREECHING to a halt outside the Garden, SIRENS DYING, 
blocking
		 the exit tunnel. Cops pile out, guns drawn, GARFIELD and
		 HAGGERTY in charge.

		 Headlights appear. A BMW crests the ramp at 60, sees the 
block,
		 SQUEALS to a smoking stop. Cops take aim.

							  HAGGERTY
						(shouting)
				   Get out of the car! Put your hands
				   on the hood.
						(nothing)
				   Move -- !

		 MacLeod obeys. They frisk him. Garfield finds a wallet, 
checks
		 a license:

		 MacLeod's photo, name and address:

					   RUSSELL EDWIN NASH
					   1182 HUDSON STREET
					   NEW YORK, NY 10013

		 Garfield shines a light in the suspect's eyes. They seem 
bottom-
		 less, unafraid.

							  GARFIELD
				   Where you going in such a hurry,
				   Mr. Nash?

		 Garfield grabs his arm. trying to handcuff him. Bad idea.
		 MacLeod hurls him away. Garfield falls on his ass.

		 A ton of cops swamp MacLeod, slamming his face into the wind-

		 shield. Enraged, Garfield staggers up, jamming his .45 into
		 MacLeod's neck.

							  GARFIELD
				   Don't move, asshole. Don't even
				   breathe.

		 Another cruiser arrives. It's DYING SIREN becomes --

											CUT TO:

		 A LONE PIPER ON GLAMIS CASTLE TURRET

		 His mournful LAMENT rising to the stars bove

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 breathing his last on a trestle bed in a hut, torso bandaged.

		 Fire crackles in a hearth. Kate kneels by the bed. Battle-
		 scarred, Dugal and Angus stand by.

							  FATHER RAINEY

				   In nomine patri, et fili et spiritus
				   sancti. Amen.
						(leaving)
				   It is over. Other men are dying this
				   day. I must attend them.

		 Kate collapses, weeping. Dugal and Angus drag her away.

							  ANGUS
				   He's a Highlander, by God. The
				   last sound he hears shall not be a wailing woman.


		 They leave. Flickering shadows. MacLeod's ;abored
		 breathing slowly fades.

											CUT TO:

		 LIEUTENANT FRANK MORAN, HOMICIDE

		 In the garage under the Garden, breathing hard. Bulky,
		 in raincoat and hat, six months to pension. With him:

		 DETECTIVE WALTER BEDSOE

		 Honest, tough, not a million miles deep.

		 At their feet, the Man's torso. Further away, the
		 head. TV crews jostle under lights. Fans shout behind
		 barricades -- when can they get their goddamn cars?

		 BRENDA WYATT

		 Forensics, sexy in jeans, boots and windbreaker, shoves
		 through the crowd, ducking the barrier. She carries
		 bags of equipment.

		 JACK LEBOWSKY, Coroner's office, wild hair, pasty-
		 faced, takes flash shots, unfazed by the grisly scene.

		 Brenda joins Moran.

							  BRENDA
				   Damn it, Frank. Forensics is
				   supposed to be notified the same
				   time as Homicide.
						(noticing corpse)
				   What a mess.

							  MORAN
				   This one came unassembled.

		 Lebowsky laughs.

							  BRENDA
						(to Moran)
				   Did you make an arrest?

							  MORAN
				   Yeah. An antique dealer named
				   Nash on Hudson Street.

		 She moves away:

		 ANOTHER ANGLE

		 Frowning, she examines a row of cars, confounded by the
		 blitzed windshields. What the hell happened?

		 BESIDE THE BODY

		 Lebowsky takes final shots, winking at Bedsoe.

							  LEBOWSKY
						(to Moran)
				   How come you're not asking me the
				   cause of death, Frank?

		 Bedsoe chuckles.

							  MORAN
				   Cut the crap, Lebowsky. What time
				   did he buy it?

		 Lebowsky kneels, examining the corpse, checking his watch.

							  LEBOWSKY
				   Ten. Ten-thirty. And whatever
				   made this cut was razor-sharp.

							  BEDSOE
						(to Moran, indicating
						corpse)
				   Frank, wasn't there something on
				   the teletype about a guy killed
				   in Jersey 2 nights ago, just like
				   this?

		 Moran scratches his head.

		 BEHIND THE CORVETTE

		 Brenda freezes, staring down at a huge sword.

								BRENDA
						(shouting)
				   Hey, Frank. Look at this.

		 Moran and Lebowsky join her.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   It's a Toledo-Salamanca.

							  MORAN
				   It's a what -- ?

		 She dusts the jeweled hilt for prints.

							  BRENDA
				   A sword, Frank. A very rare sword.

							  MORAN
				   Worth much?

							  BRENDA
				   Only about a million bucks.
						(standing up)
				   Any antique dealer with a shop on
				   Hudson Street could tell you that.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 sitting in a room, waiting. Peeling paint, tape
		 recorder, table and chairs.

		 Garfield, the cop who booked him, leans on the wall,
		 itching to get even.

		 MacLeod suddenly stares at him. Garfield shivers. The
		 guy's eyes are like lasers. The cop looks away.

		 MORAN AND BEDSOE

		 enter, slamming the door. Moran's got a package and
		 folder. Bedsoe joins Garfield against the wall.

		 Moran sits down, package by his chair. He clicks on
		 the tape and opens a folder.

		 Inside: wallet, money and driver's license issued to
		 Russell Nash.

		 He tosses a mug-shot of a swarthy man onto the table.

							  MORAN
				   Ever see this guy before, Nash?

		 MacLeod hasn't.

							  MORAN
						 
				   Name's Osta Vazilek. Bulgarian
				   national. Got his head chopped
				   off two nights ago in Jersey.
						(unwrapping
						 package)
				   Ever get over to Jersey, Nash?

							  MACLEOD
				   Not if I can help it.

							  MORAN
				   You're an antique dealer, right?

							  MACLEOD
				   Yes.

		 Moran lays down the jewelled weapon.

							  MORAN
				   Okay, what's this?

							  MACLEOD
				   A sword

							  MORAN
				   It's a --
						(checks notes)
				   Toledo-Salamanca broad-sword.
				   Worth a million bucks.

							  MACLEOD
				   So?

							  MORAN
				   You wanna hear a theory?
						(MacLeod shrugs)
				   You went down to the garage to buy
				   this sword from some guy.
						(quickly)
				   What was his name?

							  MACLEOD
				   I don't know. You tell me.

							  MORAN
				   His name was Iman Fasil. You fought
				   about the price. Then you cut off
				   his head.

							  MACLEOD
				   Wanna hear another theory?
						(Moran nods)
				   This Fasil was so upset by the
				   Rangers' lousy performance tonight,
				   he went down to the garage and in a
				   fit of depression, cut off his own
				   head.

		 Bedsoe LAUGHS.

							  MORAN
				   That ain't funny, Walt

		 Garfield can control himself no longer.

							  GARFIELD
				   You a faggot, Nash?

							  MACLEOD
				   Why? You cruising for ass?

							  GARFIELD
						(leaning in)
				   I'll tell you what happened,
				   Russell -- you went down to the
				   garage looking for a hand-job,
				   and just didn't want to pay for
				   it.

							  MACLEOD
				   You're sick.

		 Garfield swings. Kicking the table aside, MacLeod jumps
		 up, SMASHING his fist into Garfield's sternum. Garfield
		 goes down.

		 Moran's on Garfield in a flash, knee on his chest,
		 Bedsoe struggles to restrain MacLeod.

							  MORAN
						(shouting)
				   Calm down -- !
						(to Garfield)
				   I mean it, damnit -- !

		 Flinging Bedsoe off him, MacLeod picks up his wallet.

							  MACLEOD
				   Am I under arrest?
						(no answer)
				   Then we're through.

		 He walks to the door.

							  MORAN
				   Nash, we're just getting started.

		 MacLeod is gone. Moran stands up. Garfield struggles
		 to his feet.

							  GARFIELD
				   Jesus. That guy hits like a
				   train.

							  MORAN
				   Shut up, Rocky. I'll deal with
				   you in a minute.

		 He turns to Bedsoe

							  MORAN
						 
				   Tail him, Walt. And try and pay
				   attention. That sucker's cool as ice.

		 Bedsoe leaves. Moran turns to Garfield

		 EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

		 MacLeod steps out into the crisp night air.

		 Oblivious to traffic, his eyes scan the dark. Sensing
		 something, he turns south, looking toward Jersey.

											CUT TO:

		 A TAN CUTLASS ON THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE

		 Knifing through the night. Inside, behind the wheel:

		 THE KURGAN - A CHILLING SPECTER

		 Shark's eyes, short curly hair.

		 Like MacLeod, he hasn't aged -- but a hideous scar runs
		 from ear-to ear across his throat. It affects his voice,
		 turning it into a metallic gurgle. News on the RADIO.

							  NEWSCASTER'S VOICE
				   Police arrested a man at the
				   decapitation scene in Madison
				   Square Garden. They have not
				   released his name.

							  KURGAN
						(turns it off)
				   I know his name.

		 His metallic gargle is even more grating.

		 He slams a cassette into the stereo, a high-decibel
		 heavy-metal ROCK SONG: It's the Kurgan's anthem.

		 Raving singer, pounding drums, shrieking guitars. In
		 the headlights, a sign:

				   YOU ARE NOW LEAVING NEW JERSEY
						THE GARDEN STATE
				    HOPE YOU ENJOYED YOUR STAY!

		 The Kurgan smiles grotesquely.

							  KURGAN
						 
				   I had a better time than Osta
				   Vazilek. That is for sure.

		 His voice sounds like nails on a slate.

		 BRENDA

		 sitting at a spectrograph, placing metal shards under
		 a lens. Clamping wires to them, she starts a machine.

		 HUMMING sound. Crackling arc. She checks a computer,
		 takes photos. The arc dies.

		 She waits. A printer starts. Data rolls. She studies
		 it.

							  BRENDA
				   It's not possible.

		 Incredulous, she runs the test again. Same result.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   Son-of-a-bitch.

		 Grabbing coat and bag, she heads for the door.

											CUT TO:

		 BEDSOE

		 following MacLeod along Central Park South, down Broad-
		 way to Times Square.

		 ANGLE

		 Hungry and tired, Bedsoe trudges past bums, porno-pits
		 and neon signs.

		 MacLeod descends stairs to a subway. Picking up speed:

		 BEDSOE

		 races down after him. Reaching the tracks, he can't
		 believe his eyes.

		 The platform's deserted.

											CUT TO:

		 BRENDA

		 driving her red Pontiac, turning south on 5th Avenue.
		 Late-night traffic. Lionel Ritchie on the RADIO.

		 AT 34TH

		 She turns west, arriving at Madison Square Garden.
		 Parking on the street, she gets out, carrying a bag.

											CUT TO:

		BRENDA

		 walking through the garage, flashlight piercing the murk.
		 She shivers, heading for where Fasil was killed.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD'S FACE IN THE FLARE OF THE LIGHTER

		 In the underground garage. Reaching into the roof-duct
		 hidden by tiles, he pulls out his Samurai sword.

		 Noting the chipped edge and missing pieces, he slides
		 it into a sheath inside his coat.

		 FOOTSTEPS. He snuffs the lighter

											CUT TO:

		 BRENDA

		 Guiding a metal-detector across the floor. Chalk out-
		 lines where Fasil's corpse used to be. Near a column,
		 a red light blinks on her detector.

		 Cradling the flash, she removes SHARDS with a scalpel,
		 dropping them into a plastic bag.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 hidden in shadows.

											CUT TO:

		 BRENDA

		 hears a distant CLANK. She whirls her flashlight up the
		 tunnel.

							  BRENDA
				   Who's there?

		 Silence. Something's down here. She can feel it.

		 Trying to control her panic, she heads for the exit. She
		 starts running, faster and faster.

											CUT TO:

		 BRENDA

		 trying to unlock her Pontiac. Heart racing, she drops her
		 keys.

							  BRENDA
				   Goddamn it.

		 Retrieving them, she opens the door and ROARS off.

											CUT TO:

		 BRENDA

		 entering P.J. Clarke's. Almost empty. It's late.

		 She takes a corner table, trying to calm down. PHIL,
		 the waiter, appears.

							  PHIL
				   Hi, Brenda. What can I get you?

							  BRENDA
				   Vodka. Lots of it.

		 He leaves.

		 Removing the plastic bag from her purse, she opens it,
		 tipping a metal shard into her trembling hand.

		 MACLEOD

		 enters and looks around. Spotting her, he sits in a
		 nearby booth. Phil re-appears with a bottle of vodka.

							  PHIL
				   Say when.

		 three-quarters full.

							  BRENDA
				   When.

		 She drinks. Noticing MacLeod, Phil glides over, return-
		 ing to Brenda

							  PHIL
				   The guy over there wants you to
				   join him for a drink.

							  BRENDA
				   What guy?

		 Leaning forward, she sees a dim profile.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   Thank him and tell him no.

		 Phil delivers the message. Brenda gulps vodka, mind in
		 turmoil.

		 Suddenly, MacLeod sits by her side. She jumps like a cat.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   What do you think you're doing?

							  MACLEOD
				   Joining you. I'd like to buy you
				   a drink.

		 Brenda drains her vodka, setting down the glass.

							  BRENDA
				   I don't drink

		 About to tell him to get lost, she looks into his eyes for
		 the first time. Unexpectedly, she's overcome by feelings
		 of warmth and safety.

							  MACLEOD
				   What's your name?

		 His voice caresses her. She's mesmerized by his gaze.
		 Adrift, she hears herself answer.

							  BRENDA
				   Brenda.

		 The silence between them is electric. Phil RINGS the
		 register. The spell is broken.

		 She's got to get away from this guy. Shouldering her bag,
		 she rises, heading for the door. He doesn't move.

							  MACLEOD
				   Do you get over to Madison Square
				   Garden much?

		 She freezes, heart pounding.

							  BRENDA
						(turning)
				   What did you say?

							  MACLEOD
				   Madison Square Garden. Get over
				   there much?

		 Eyes that were comforting 10 seconds ago are now cold,
		 drilling into her brain.

							  BRENDA
				   Why?

							  MACLEOD
				   They've got basketball.
				   The circus. Ice-hockey.
						(a beat)
				   What's your last name, Brenda?

		 She swallows hard.

							  BRENDA
				   How come you're asking me
				   about Madison Square Garden?
				   Did you follow me in here?

		 No answer. He smiles. Her blood turns to ice.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   Who the hell are you?

							  MACLEOD
						(rising)
				   Let me walk you home, Brenda.
				   Pretty girl, alone on the
				   streets at night. No telling
				   what could happen.

							  BRENDA
				   Forget it. I can take care
				   of myself.

		 He shrugs, sitting down. She walks out, pausing to look back 
at him
		 in the gloom. He raises his glass to her.

											CUT TO:

		 OUTSIDE THE BAR

		 Brenda waits in shadows, watching MacLeod leave. He stands
		 for a moment, looking up and down 55th Street.

		 Pulling up his collar, he moves off into the night, turning
		 down a dark alley.

		 Making a fateful decision, she follows him.

	

										CUT TO:
		 MACLEOD

		 walking briskly near the East River. Cold wind blowing. 4:00 
A.M.
		 Deserted.

		 Steam rises from vents. Cars line the curb. Cats YOWL. It's 
spooky.

		 Hearing FOOTSTEPS, he stops every few yards.

		 At the corner of 46th, his eyes rake the street. Nothing. 
Without
		 warning, he sprints off, disappearing into:

		 A SHADOWY CONSTRUCTION SITE

		 RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. He grasps the Samurai hilt inside his 
coat.

		 A FIGURE hurtles round the corner. Springing forward, MacLeod

		 grabs handfuls of hair.

		 SHOUTING in panic, Brenda fights to get free.

							  BRENDA
				   Get your hands off me!

		 Pumping with adrenalin, MacLeod shakes her, pulling her into 
the
		 dark, against a brick wall. She SCREAMS.

		 A light goes on in a nearby apartment.

							  MACLEOD
				   Be quiet. I --

		 He breaks off, listening to the night, eyes flashing. 
Instinctively
		 MacLeod ducks, yanking her with him to the dirt.

		 Next second:

		 A GLEAMING SWORD SHATTERS BRICK

		 inches above their heads. He rolls away from her, struggling 
to
		 avoid a slashing blade. Dumbstruck, Brenda stares up at:

		 A HOWLING GIANT WITH A SCAR ACROSS HIS NECK

		 wielding a huge sword. It's the Kurgan.

		 MacLeod grabs a steel pipe, blocking the Kurgan's murderous
		 blows. The Kurgan's so fast, MacLeod can't draw his sword.

		 In desperation, he side-steps and charges, tackling him.
		 Locked together, they topple down an embankment into:


		 A SHALLOW PIT

		 Untangling himself, sword in hand, the Kurgan attacks. 
MacLeod
		 defends himself with the pipe.

							  KURGAN
						(swinging)
				   Good to see you again, MacLeod.
				   400 years is a long time.

							  MACLEOD
						(blocking)
				   You slimy bastard --!

		 SOUNDS of DISTANT SIRENS.

		 UP THE EMBANKMENT

		 Brenda peers through the murk. Straining to see what's going 
on,
		 she loses her footing. CRYING OUT, she falls:

		 INTO THE PIT

		 Cannoning into MacLeod's back.

							  MACLEOD
				   Jesus Christ!
						(yelling)
				   Get the hell out of here!

		 Bellowing, the giant charges again. MacLeod shoves Brenda out 
of
		 the path of sudden death.

							  KURGAN
						(rasping)
				   There can only be one, Highlander.

		 The 2 men battle through the skeleton of a building. The 
Kurgan's
		 murderous blade misses MacLeod by inches, slicing through 
solid
		 iron.

		 The sky ERUPTS. THRASHING ROTORS. ROARING down-blast.
		 Blinding clouds of dirt and debris.

		 IT'S A POLICE CHOPPER

		 Searchlight beams probe swirling dust. From the sky, an
		 AMPLIFIED VOICE:

							  VOICE V.O.
				   You, on the ground! Stay where you
				   are!

		 Brenda CHOKES, blinded. From nowhere, MacLeod grabs her.
		 His arms are like steel.

							  KURGAN'S VOICE
						(SHOUTING out of
						the dark)
				   Some other time, Highlander.
				   There can be only one.

		 MacLeod hauls Brenda up the embankment, away from the
		 light, melting into the dark. SIRENS CLOSER.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 dragging Brenda across 1st Avenue.

							  BRENDA
						(lungs bursting)
				   Stop. For Christ's sake.

		 They halt under a street-light. She gasps for breath.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   Who in the name of God was that?
				   He called you Highlander. What
				   did he mean, "There can be only
				   one?" Only one what?

							  MACLEOD
				   Shut up!

		 He pulls her close, eyes like bullet-holes.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   Listen, lady. You almost got
				   yourself killed.

							  BRENDA
				   I want --

		 He shakes her, trying to scare her away.

							  MACLEOD
				   Don't you ever follow me again
						(intensely)
				   Forget about what you saw tonight.
				   You only have one life. If you
				   value it --
						(angrily)
				   Go home!

		 He strides off. A garbage can CRASHES in an alley.
		 Brenda jumps.

											CUT TO:

		 KENNY, A DESK CLERK

		 signing in the Kurgan. Ansonia Hotel, 73rd and Broadway.
		 A T.V. is on Derelicts litter the lobby.

		 KENNY, a chain-smoking greaser, checks the name the
		 Kurgan's written in the register, handing him a key.

							  KENNY
				   Okay, Mr. Victor Kruger. Room 315.
				   And I'm gonna hit you for 20 in
				   advance.

		 The Kurgan pulls out a thick roll of bills, dropping a
		 20. Kenny eyes the roll greedily.

							  KENNY
						 
				   Listen, you want anything. Broads,
				   blow. Just dial 0.

		 Picking up a black, oblong case, the Kurgan heads for the
		 elevator.

											CUT TO:

		 THE KURGAN

		 on a sagging bed in Room 315. Roaches crawl on a hot-
		 plate.

		 Shirtless, heavily-scarred, he munches tacos, watching
		 Yosemite Sam on T.V., digging the violence.

		 He opens his black case. Laid out in velvet slots:

		 THE COMPONENTS OF A LARGE SWORD

		 Meaty fingers caress quillions, pommel, hilt and blade.
		 Getting up, he moves to the window. Below, junkies
		 shiver in Needle Park.

							  KURGAN
				   At last... the Gathering.

		 He chuckles, an unnerving sound. KNOCK on the door.

		 A blonde HOOKER in hot-pants and boots, breasts burst-
		 ing from a tight sweater, leans on the jamb, cracking
		 gum.

							  HOOKER
				   I'm Candy.

							  KURGAN
				   Of course you are.

		 Dragging her in, he flings her on the bed. Fearfully,
		 she watches him unbuckle his belt. He slams the door.

											CUT TO:

		 DUGAL

		 slamming down a tankard of ale in the Glamis tavern.
		 Angus and Kate sit with him.

		 It's 1536, the day after the fight between the Frazers
		 and MacLeods.

		 Angry villagers pack the place, only one thing on their
		 minds -- MacLeod's strange delivery from the jaws of
		 death.

		 Kate's thrilled by all the excitement.

							  DUGAL
				   You saw the wound, Angus. He should
				   have died.

							  KATE
				   I say he's got the devil in him.

		 The tavern erupts in shouting

		 MacLeod enters. Sudden silence. Seeing Angus, he moves
		 to join his table.

							  DUGAL
						(rising)
				   Drinking with us, are you?

		 MacLeod freezes. Kate's eyes sparkle. Angus avoids
		 his gaze.

							  MACLEOD
				   What's the matter, Dugal?

							  DUGAL
				   You. Talking and breathing -- and
				   this morning, all but a corpse.
						(shouting)
				   How did you manage that, Conner
				   MacLeod?

							  MACLEOD
				   Would you rather I was dead?

							  KATE
						(to crowd)
				   It's not natural. He's in league
				   with Lucifer.

		 Uproar.

							  MACLEOD
				   Don't say that, Kate.

							  DUGAL
				   I'll say it. You've got the devil
				   in you.

							  MACLEOD
				   We've been kinsmen 15 years, cousin.

							  DUGAL
				   Conner MacLeod was my kinsman. I
				   don't know who you are.

		 Kate's eyes dance. The tension is electric

							  ANGUS
				   You'd best leave, Conner.

							  MACLEOD
						(bravely)
				   I'm not going anywhere.

		  Dugal swings at MacLeod's head, knocking him down,
		 kicking him in the ribs.

		 A plowman destroys a chair on MacLeod's back. Angus
		 shouts over the din --

							  ANGUS
				   For God's sake, stop -- !

		 A villager belts MacLeod with a jug. Struggling, he
		 disappears under a shouting heap of clansmen.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD WITH AN OX-YOKE STRAPPED TO HIS BACK

		 Arms bound to it with ropes, face battered, on his
		 knees in the dirt.

		 Beyond, Glamis Castle towers over Loch Shiel.

		 Dugal, Angus, Father Rainey and Kate stand in a circle
		 of yelling villagers. The excitement has unhinged
		 Kate's mind.

							  ANGUS
						(yelling at Dugal)
				   He's your cousin, man.

							  FATHER RAINEY
				   Burn him. It's the only way.

							  VILLAGERS
						(chanting)
				   Burn him! Burn him!

							  ANGUS
						(over crowd)
				   Quiet!

		 The NOISE subsides.

							  ANGUS
						 
				   There'll be no burning here today.
				   We'll banish him.

							  KATE
				   Burn him! Burn him!

		 Dugal's disgusted by Kate's religious frenzy.

							  DUGAL
				   Be quiet, Kate.

		 The villagers shout objections. He nods to Angus and
		 they help MacLeod to his feet. He staggers under the
		 yoke.

							  ANGUS
				   Can you walk?

							  MACLEOD
				   I'll bloody well walk out of here.

							  ANGUS
				   Move, friend. Before they change
				   their minds.

							  MACLEOD
				   I'll not forget you, Angus.

		 MacLeod is driven out. Villagers spit and curse.
		 Wild-eyed, Kate dances round him.

							  KATE
				   Devil! Devil! Devil!

							  VILLAGERS
						(chanting)
				   Devil! Devil! Devil!

		 ANOTHER ANGLE

		 Stumbling along the loch, MacLeod heads for the moun-
		 tains.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 walking west on Christopher. Dim streetlights. Dogs
		 BARKING.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD'S HOME - 1182 HUDSON STREET, SOHO

		 Surrounded by Irish bars, art galleries, rubble-filled
		 lots.

		 MacLeod heads for a run-down shop next to a dilapidated
		 ten-story glass-and-iron warehouse.

		 On the shop door:

						R. NASH -- ANTIQUES

		 Rummaging for keys, he unlocks the door and goes in-
		 side.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD IN A RISING FREIGHT ELEVATOR

		 The doors open. Before him:

		 A HUGE, OPEN, NEW YORK LOFT

		 The change from drab outside to sumptuous inside is
		 stunning. Exotic fish swim in a huge aquarium.

		 MacLeod descends the stairs to:

		 A SUNKEN LIVING ROOM

		 filled with modern art. High veilings, comfortable
		 sofas, Adam fireplace, spectacular views of the river.

		 Moving past speakers and TVs, he drops his keys on a
		 table beside an intercom and answering machine.

		 In a silver frame on the mantle: a photo of MacLeod
		 with a young girl, 1952. MacLeod moves through:

		 A GEORGIAN DINING AREA

		 Queen Anne table, silver candlesticks, tapestries on
		 the wall. He enters:

		 AN ULTRA-MODERN KITCHEN

		 Loosening his tie, he fixes a drink and walks out.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 entering his silver room. Elegant and oval. Fabric
		 walls. Sofas, tables, displays of ancient artifacts:

		 On one wall, like spokes of a wheel: 13 broad swords.

		 Beside them, a bronze shield, claymore and cloak -- the
		 black-and-yellow tartan of the Clan MacLeod.

		 Sipping his drink, he sinks into a sofa, eyeing a glass
		 case lit by pin-spots. Inside:


		 An ancient sheepskin doll.

		 A 16th century catalan feathered hat.

		 A rusty anvil and tongs.

		 MacLeod stares at the anvil and tons, remembering:

											CUT TO:

		 RED-HOT IRON IN TONGS

		 crashing onto an anvil in a sweltering blacksmith's
		 forge. It's 1541.
		 Wielding a hammer, streaked with grime and sweat,
		 MacLeod pounds out a horsehoe, plunging it into water.
		 HISSING STEAM.

		 In the five years since his banishment, he's filled out
		 -- although he's lost none of his wide-eyed, youthful
		 exuberance.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 shoeing a mare outside. The forge clings to a crag.
		 Miles down a precarious trail, the town of Jedburgh.

		 Up the hill, a 3-story stone house. From the house:

		 HEATHER MACLEOD

		 appears in sheepskins, bonnet and boots, carrying a
		 basket.

		 Full-breasted, lusty and apple-cheeked, she feeds
		 geese, watching him.

							  HEATHER
						(waving basket)
				   Pie and ale. D'you want it?

		 Dropping his hammer, he grabs her buttocks, crushing
		 her to him, grinning.

							  MACLEOD
				   All the time.

							  HEATHER
						(squealing)
				   You filthy sod. You're all muck
				   and muscle.

							  MACLEOD
				   Aye. The way you like it.

		 He grins, kissing her. Stripping his apron, he dunks
		 his torso in a rain barrel, shaking himself off like a
		 dog.

		 She smiles. He's the loveliest man in the world.

											CUT TO:
		 MACLEOD AND HEATHER

		 making love on the cliff-top in the grass. Remains of
		 a picnic.

		 Thunderheads soar over the mountains. A storm is com-
		 ing. MacLeod kisses her. She responds

							  HEATHER
				   You can do that forever if you
				   like, my lord. Will you, Conner?

							  MACLEOD
				   Aye, blossom. I will.

		 Foreign CURSES. Startled, they sit up.

											CUT TO:

		 JUAN RAMIREZ

		 climbing the trail to the forge. Olive skin, hawk
		 nose, twinkling eyes, flashing teeth. Flintlock pistol
		 in his belt, crossbow across his back.

		 Strapped to his side, a Samurai sword, carved hand-
		 guard, razor-sharp, feather-light.

		 Overheated in cloak, pantaloons, feathers and gloves,
		 he clambers higher, swooning with fatigue.

		 ANGLE

		 Dragging himself to the top, he mops his brow.

		 Seeing the peasant couple before him, he bows, hat
		 sweeping the ground.

							  RAMIREZ
				   Greetings! I am Juan Sanchez
				   Villa-Lobos Ramirez, Chief
				   Metallurgist to King Philip II of
				   Spain.
						(clicks heels)
				   At your service.

							  HEATHER
				   Who -- ?

		 Ramirez sees stars, looking down the trail.

							  RAMIREZ
				   My God, man. That's a climb!

		 Breathless, he replaces his hat, adjusting frills and
		 furbelows.

							  MACLEOD
				   What do you want?

							  RAMIREZ
				   Conner MacLeod

							  MACLEOD
				   Maybe you've found him.

							  RAMIREZ
				   The same Conner MacLeod wounded in
				   battle and driven from his village
				   five years ago?

		 The Spaniard narrows his eyes. Something seems to
		 seize MacLeod. He clutches his chest, unable to
		 beathe. Heather's alarmed.

							  HEATHER
				   Conner?

							  MACLEOD
						(gasping)
				   Heather, go in the house.
						(she hesitates)
				   Do as I say, woman

		 She backs up the hill and goes inside.

		 Ramirez flashes wall-to-wall teeth. THUNDER reverber-
		 ates down the valley.

							  RAMIREZ
						(re Heather)
				   A beautiful young woman. Is she your
				   wife?
						(MacLeod nods)
				   Sad.

		 MacLeod's temples are in a vise. Ramirez opens his
		 tunic, tracing:

		 A SCAR FROM NECK TO HIP

		 with elegant finger.

							  RAMIREZ
				   When I was young, a cart ran over
				   me. I should have died. But the
				   wound healed by itself.

		 Stars explode inside MacLeod's head. The forge, the
		 house, everything's spinning.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   The sensations you feel. It is
				   the Quickening.

		 THUNDER CRACKS overhead. The storm breaks. HOWLING
		 WIND. Ramirez's eyes blaze with unearthly light.

							  MACLEOD
						(shouting)
				   Who are you?

							  RAMIREZ
						(shouting)
				   We are the same, MacLeod. We are
				   brothers.

		 Lightning etches their silhouettes against the rolling
		 sky.

											CUT TO:

		 BRENDA

		 moving through a squad-room toward:

		 Moran on the phone, at his desk. Walls plastered with
		 mug-shots. Steam pipes HISS & BANG.

		 Seeing Brenda, he waves her to a seat with the receiver.
		 SHOUTING on the line.

							  MORAN
						(into receiver)
				   Listen, pal. My advice is, get
				   a bigger one next time. One
				   that'll bite him.

		 He slams down the phone, eyeing Brenda.

							  MORAN
						 
				   Here's what I'm dealing with.
				   Guy calls up Homicide. Wants to
				   swear out a complaint. His Viet-
				   namese neighbor ate his dog.
						(a beat)
				   How are things in Forensics?

							  BRENDA
				   Dull. Come on. let's have lunch.

							  MORAN
				   Who pays?

							  BRENDA
				   Me.

		 Moran likes it. He puts on his coat. Thay head for the
		 door. Brenda stops.

							  BRENDA
				   Frank, I left my purse. Go ahead.
				   I'll catch you by the elevator.

		 Moran leaves. Brenda returns to the desk, opens a drawer,
		 and finds what she's looking for:

		 A bound, blue folder containing photos of Fasil's body, the
		 sword, a copy of an interrogation report -- and:

		 NASH'S MUG-SHOT

		 It's the guy from the bar who fought the scarred giant.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   I'll be damned. Russell Nash.

		 She stares at the picture. Even in the harsh photo-flash,
		 his face is compelling. The eyes, haunting, evoking time-
		 less mystery.

		 Moran's phone RINGS. She jumps.

		 Glancing around, she jots down Nash's address, shuts the
		 drawer, gets her purse and heads out.

											CUT TO:

		 YUNG DOL KIM

		 Alone in a rising elevator. An oriental with mahogany
		 skin, obsidian eyes, guard's uniform and cap, carrying
		 a huge sword.

		 He watches the floor numbers, stops at 40. The doors
		 open. He creeps out into:

		 AN EMPTY, CARPETED HALLWAY

		 Silence. Gliding past silent offices, he spots:

		 A FIGURE WITH A SWORD IN AN ALCOVE

		 Swinging, he slices off the figure's head. It rolls into
		 the light. He stares down at it. It's plastic. He has
		 destroyed a mannequin.

		 Behind him, CROAKING LAUGHTER. Kim turns. The Kurgan
		 appears with his weapon, amused by his little joke.

							  KURGAN
				   Such a brave warrior
						(suddenly ice-cold)
				   Let's see how you can handle
				   the real thing.

		 The Kurgan charges, battering Kim into:

		 AN OFFICE

		 filled with rows of computer desks. The Kurgan goads Kim,
		 side-stepping blows which SMASH files and phones. He's
		 like a giant cat playing with a helpless mouse.

							  KURGAN
				   you fight like an old woman, Kim.
				   You're disgusting.

		 No longer amused, the Kurgan becomes a one-man wrecking-
		 crew. He chases Kim, blitzing the office. The brilliance
		 of his swordsmanship is staggering. unexpectedly:

		 Kim drops his sword on the carpet. Behind him, through a
		 window, the lights of Manhatten.

							  KURGAN
						 
				   What are you doing? Pick up your
				   sword.

							  KIM
				   Tradition, once more?

							  KURGAN
				   It is all we have

							  KIM
				   It's no longer enough. I'm tired,
				   Kurgan. Four hundred years without
				   release. Let's be done with it. I
				   want peace.

							  KURGAN
				   I will give you peace
						(raising sword)
				   There can be only one.

		 He cuts off Kim's head. A shimmering energy flashes between
		 the corpse and Kurgan.

		 He starts to glow. Computer-screens EXPLODE. From nowhere,
		 a terrifying wind starts blowing. Pares fly. Water-coolers
		 CRASH to the floor.

		 The window IMPLODES, sucking Kim's body out into space. It
		 falls 40 floors.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD AT HOME

		 sharpening his Samurai sword with a jeweler's file before
		 a CRACKLING FIRE. He's in his sunken lounge.

		 On a coffee-table in front of him, a book:

							  A
					  METALLURGICAL HISTORY
							 OF
					   ANCIENT SWORD-MAKING
							 BY
						BRENDA J. WYATT

		 He studies the smiling photo, reading the bio. The author
		 does forensics work for the City of New York.

		 Above him, fish swim in the aquarium. He watches them,
		 mind drifting back through time.

											CUT TO:

		 RAMIREZ & MACLEOD

		 In a boat, heading for an island in the middle of a loch.

		 Resplendent in feathered hat, jewelled tunic, cape and
		 boots, the Spaniard mans the oars.

		 Alarmed, MacLeod sits facing the Spaniard, white-knuckling
		 his claymore.

							  MACLEOD
				   I don't like boats. I don't like
				   water. I'm a man, not a fish.

							  RAMIREZ
				   You complain endlessly. I wonder
				   if I'm wasting my time with you,
				   brother.

							  MACLEOD
				   Stop calling me brother. You look
				   like a woman, you stupid haggis.

							  RAMIREZ
				   Haggis? What is haggis?

							  MACLEOD
				   A sheep's stomach stuffed with
				   meat and barley.

							  RAMIREZ
				   What do you do with it?

							  MACLEOD
				   You eat it.

							  RAMIREZ
				   How revolting

		 Resting the oars, he takes snuff, inhaling deeply.
		 LOUD SNEEZE. The boat rocks violently.

							  MACLEOD
						(quaking)
				   Be still, for God's sake. You'll
				   tip us over.

							  RAMIREZ
				   So?

							  MACLEOD
				   I can't swim -- you Spanish pea-
				   cock.

		 Their angry voices carry across the lake.

							  RAMIREZ
				   I am not Spanish. I am Egyptian.

							  MACLEOD
				   You said you were from Spain.
				   You're a liar.

							  RAMIREZ
				   You smell like a dung-heap. You
				   have the manners of a goat. And
				   no knowledge of your potential.

		 Gleefully, Ramirez starts violently rocking the boat.

		 MacLeod is terrified. See-sawing wildly, he grabs for an
		 oar. Ramirez suddenly throws him overboard.

		 HUGE SPLASH. YELLING, MacLeod disappears, bobbing up,
		 flailing his arms.

							  MACLEOD
				   Help me. I'm drowning.

		 Ramirez rows for the island.

							  RAMIREZ
				   You can't drown, you fool. You're
				   immortal.

		 MacLeod sinks in bubbles. Ramirez keeps rowing.

		 She heads for the door.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 staring into the fire in the sunken lounge. A flashing
		 light distracts him. He flips a switch, hearing VOICES
		 on the INTERCOM.

							  FEMALE VOICE
				   I'm sorry, Miss Wyatt. Mr. Nash
				   is unavailable.

							  BRENDA'S VOICE
				   I need to talk to him now. Can I

		 Glancing at Brenda Wyatt's book on the coffee table, he
		 gets up. He pushes a button that opens a door leading
		 to the outer office.

											CUT TO:

		 IN THE OUTER OFFICE

		 RACHEL ELLENSTEIN, 52

		 Good-looking, business-like, in pant-suit and glasses,
		 sits at a desk in Nash's shop, talking to Brenda.
		 Antiques everywhere.

							  RACHEL
				   I'm afraid not.

		 MacLeod appears

							  MACLEOD
				   Hi.

							  RACHEL
				   This is Brenda Wyatt, Mr. Nash

							  MACLEOD
						(to Brenda)
				   Ah, Wyatt. That's your last name.
						(turning)
				   We've already met, Rachel.
						(to Brenda)
				   What can I do for you.

		 Resolute, she takes a deep breath.

							  BRENDA
				   I'd like some advice.

							  MACLEOD
				   Are you the kind of woman who
				   takes advice.

							  BRENDA
				   That depends.

		 She meets his gaze, ready for anything. He grins. Rachel
		 enjoys the sparring.

							  MACLEOD
				   Advice about what?

							  BRENDA
				   What can you tell me about a seven-
				   foot lunatic hacking away with a
				   broadsword at one o'clock in the
				   morning in New York City, 1985?

							  MACLEOD
				   Not much.

							  BRENDA
				   Then how about a Japanese sword
				   made in 600 B.C.?
						(he frowns)
				   The metal in the blade folded
				   200 times.

		 MacLeod shakes his head. This woman just keeps coming.

							  MACLEOD
				   i don't deal in exotic weapons.

		 Taking her arm, he guides her to a display-case.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   Can I show you something in 18th
				   Century silver?

							  BRENDA
				   That's not why I came here, and
				   you know it.

		 She looks right into his eyes. Her closeness unsettles
		 him.

							  MACLEOD
				   Do you cook?

							  BRENDA
				   Why?

							  MACLEOD
				   I thought we might have diner

							  BRENDA
						(provocatively)
				   Did you?

							  MACLEOD
				   Yes.

		 He finds her aggressiveness sexy. Before he can speak,
		 the street door opens.

		 Bedsoe bursts in.

		 Seeing MacLeod and Brenda, he turns away, scrutinizing
		 a tapestry -- mermaids frolicking with sea-monsters.

		 By the door, Macleod pauses at Bedsoe's elbow, contem-
		 plating the garish creation.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   The Rape of Neptune's Daughter by
				   the Fish Creatures.
						(Bedsoe blinks
						 at him)
				   Do you like fish?

							  BEDSOE
				   To eat, you mean?

		 MacLeod is gone.

											CUT TO:

		 RAMIREZ

		 On the island, by a CRACKLING fire, back to the loch.
		 The boat's on the beach.

		 Bright sunshine. Stunning scenery. He enjoys the soli-
		 tude, sword at his side on the ground.

		 Behind him, 50 yards away, the lake surface swirls silently.
		 Something is out there. A glowering head appears.

		 IT'S MACLEOD

		 rising up out of the lake. Spotting Ramirez, he wades
		 cautiously to the shore.

		 Covered in duck-weed and slime, he draws his claymore,
		 creeping silently to within feet of the Spaniard's back.

		 Slowly he raises his sword in both hands high over Ramirez's
		 head. He's going to cut the bastard in half.

		 With all his might, he brings the sword down. Something
		 incredible happens.

		 Like lightning, without looking back, Ramirez grabs his
		 Samurai, parries the blow and is up and facing him in
		 one blind motion.

		 MacLeod's claymore flies from his hands.

							  RAMIREZ
				   What took you so long?

		 MacLeod watches his sword land on the beach 50 feet away.

							  MACLEOD
				   This can't be. It's the devil's
				   work.

							  RAMIREZ
						(laughing)
				   You numbskull! Clod! You're no
				   better than the villagers who
				   threw you out.

		 Livid, MacLeod splutters water, staring back at the loch,
		 trying to make sense of what's happened.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   You cannot die, MacLeod. Accept
				   it.

		 2 fish wriggle free from the Highlander's tunic, flopping
		 to the sand.

		 Scowling at the Spaniard, he wishes this cup would pass
		 from him, suspecting in his heart it will not.

							  MACLEOD
						(through his teeth)
				   I...hate...you...

							  RAMIREZ
				   Good! it's a place to start

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD AND RAMIREZ SPARRING BY A WATERFALL

		 CLANGING steel-on-steel. Rainbows of spray span the gorge.
		 MacLeod is strong but awkward. Ramirez's Samurai SINGS in
		 a brilliant display of swordsmanship.

							  RAMIREZ
				   No, no, pendejo. Protect your
				   stupid head.

		 MacLeod thrusts. Ramirez blocks.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   Concentrate! You can survive
				   anything but steel against your
				   throat. If your head leaves
				   your neck, it's over.

		 Bellowing, MacLeod strikes. Ramirez deflects the blow with
		 ease.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   Move your feet!
						(advancing)
				   We must fight until only one
				   remains. There can be only
				   one.
						(shouting)
				   Move your feet, I said!
						(ducking a swing)
				   You are safe only on holy ground
				   None of us will violate that law.

		 Exhausted, MacLeod staggers. Ramirez taunts him, jabbing
		 him in the butt.

							  MACLEOD
						(yelling)
				   You over-dressed haggis. I'm
				   going to split you in half.

		 Swinging his claymore, MacLeod goes berserk, missing Ramirez
		 altogether, smashing brush, demolishing trees.

		 Finally, he collapses, gulping for air in the grass. Ramirez
		 stands over him.

							  RAMIREZ
				   Get up!

							  MACLEOD
				   Go to hell. I've had enough.

		 The Spaniard's expression changes. Switching tack, he sits 
beside
		 his young charge, watching the THUNDERING falls.

							  RAMIREZ
				   You must fight. You must learn to
				   keep your head. On you may depend
				   the fate of mortal men.

							  MACLEOD
				   I don't care. i don't want it.

							  RAMIREZ
				   None of us chose it.

							  MACLEOD
				   Then how did it happen,
				   for God's sake?

							  RAMIREZ
				   How does the sun know when
				   to come up?

		 Ramirez points to SQUIRRELS CHATTERING under an oak.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   Those squirrels all look alike.

		 MacLeod frowns.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   But once in a while, one is born
				   different. With blue eyes. And
				   fur white as snow. Others of its
				   kind try to destroy it or drive
				   it away.

		 Flicking a bee off his pantaloons, he moves into the oak's 
shade.
		 The squirrels scamper away.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   You must learn to conceal your
				   special gift. To harness your
				   power.
						(a beat)
				   Until the time of the Gathering.

							  MACLEOD
				   What gathering?

							  RAMIREZ
				   Questions, questions. Too much
				   talk.

		 Slicing the air with his Samurai, he waves MacLeod up.

							  MACLEOD
				   I'm not moving.

							  RAMIREZ
				   Then I'll cut you where you sit.

		 Wearily, MacLeod rises. The Spaniard advances, pounding
		 MacLeod backwards.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   It is said that when only a few
				   of us are left, eons from now, we
				   will feel an irresistible pull to
				   a faraway land -- to fight for the
				   Prize.

											CUT TO:

		 MORAN

		 smoking a cigar at his desk in the squad-room. Before him,
		 a copy of the New York Times. Headline:
   
				 HEAD-HUNTER STALKS NEW YORK

		 Bedsoe slumps in a chair.

							  MORAN
						(to Bedsoe)
				   You're sure it was Brenda?

							  BEDSOE
				   In Nash's shop. Talking to him.

							  MORAN
						(half-smiling)
				   That ballsy broad. I never know
				   what's going on with her.
						(thinking)
				   What did she and Nash talk about?
				   Did he say anything?

							  BEDSOE
				   Yeah. He asked me if I liked
				   fish.

							  MORAN
				   Fish -- ?

											CUT TO:

		 MONTAGE - MACLEOD AND RAMIREZ FIGHTING

		 Various locations and times.

		 Slowly, MacLeod improves, gaining control -- his blows,
		 stronger, his coordination surer.

		 Ramirez is pleased.

		 HEATHER

		 bartering for a flapping chicken in Jedburgh Market.
		 In a group of SHOUTING WOMEN.

		 Bright sunshine. FLAGS and BANNERS CRACK in the wind
		 off the sea.

		 Farmers sell cows and sheep. Crowds mill around. Open
		 fires, Musicians and Hawkers.

		 MacLeod and Ramirez watch Heather. Ramirez holds onto
		 his hat. He buys an apple, bitting into it.

		 Far up the valley, MacLeod's forge is a dot on the
		 craggy mountainside.

							  RAMIREZ
				   You will have no family. We
				   cannot have children.

		 A BAND PLAYS. Girls dance around a maypole. MacLeod
		 lovingly watches Heather bag a SQUAWKING BIRD.

							  MACLEOD
				   That won't please Heather. I'll
				   tell you that for nothing.

		 Ramirez shrugs. Heather holds up the sack.

							  HEATHER
						(calling)
				   Here's dinner. Be off now. I
				   fancy a new dress.

		 They watch a Juggler.

							  RAMIREZ
				   You must leave her, brother.

		 MacLeod scowls. The Juggler drops his balls in the
		 swirling wind. The CROWD WHISTLES.

		 They arrive at a grassy arena. Huge men in kilts toss
		 40-foot cabers to the CHEERS of the crowd.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   I was born 2,437 years ago. In
				   that time, I have had three wives.

		 MacLeod tries to figure the man's age.

		 A Whore sashays past, skirts billowing, ogling Ramirez.
		 Graciously, he bows to her.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   The last was Shakiko, a Japanese
				   princess.
						(indicating Samurai)
				   Her father, Kamakura, a genius,
				   made this for me in 593 B.C. It
				   is the only one of its kind.
						(remembering)
				   Like his daughter.

		 Drawing the Samurai, he tosses it to MacLeod, who
		 catches it, testing its weight.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   When Shakiko died, I was
				   shattered. I would save you that
				   pain. Please -- let Heather go.

							  MACLEOD
				   She's my wife, man. I love her.

		 He sees her, gaily pushing through the crowd, ablaze
		 with colored silks.

							  RAMIREZ
				   Then you will cause yourself great
				   anguish. I buried Shakiko with my
				   own hands.
						(emotionally)
				   I had to go on, never again to hear
				   the sound of her voice, her laughter.
				   She left behind such a silence.

		 Heather flies into MacLeod's arms, kissing him, showing
		 him the cloth.

							  HEATHER
				   D'you like it? Tell me true.

							  MACLEOD
						(eyeing Ramirez)
				   Aye, blossom. It's fine.

		 Delighted, she dances around him, entwining him in the
		 colored cloth.

											CUT TO:

		 WIND-WHIPPED WAVES ON THE STORMY NORTH SEA

		 off the Scottish coast. Cold sun. Seagulls on the
		 wind. Mountains against cumulus.

		 Suddenly, on the shore:

		 A GIANT STAG WITH SHINING ANTLERS

		 rears up in the gorse. Head high, still, it watches:

		 RAMIREZ AND MACLEOD WALKING ON THE BEACH

		 MacLeod's freezing to death.

							  RAMIREZ
				   Now for the last of our training.

		 The Spaniard points to the stag, shouting above the
		 surf.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   Trust me. Let your mind feel the
				   stag. His blood. Coursing. His
				   heart. Beating.

		 The SOUNDS OF THE TWO HEARTS POUND in his brain.

							  MACLEOD
						(enthralled)
				   I feel him.

							  RAMIREZ
				   It is the Quickening. We are at
				   one with all living things.

		 The stag bolts.

		 MacLeod's perception is forever changed. The high-
		 lands, the sea, the trees -- they're like old friends
		 he'll never see the same way again.

							   RAMIREZ
						 
				   When we first met, you felt ill.
				   Remember?

		 Shivering, MacLeod nods.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   Did you ever feel that way
				   before?

							  MACLEOD
				   Yes. When the MacLeods fought
				   the Frazers, and a black knight
				   ran me through. Only it was
				   different, more painful.

		 Herons swoop low over the waves.

							  RAMIREZ
				   That black knight was the Kurgan.
				   It is because of him that I sought
				   you out.
						(MacLeod blinks)
				   There is great power in the Quickening.
				   But Nature has not given us equal shares.
				   Some, like you and the Kurgan, have more.

		 MacLeod's ears are freezing.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   And when one of us takes another's
				   head, the victor becomes stronger.

		 They clamber through rocks, away from the angry sea.

											CUT TO:

		 A DEEP-WATER POND SURROUNDED BY FERNS

		 silent and old, under a dome of fir trees.

		 MacLeod and Ramirez sit on the bank.

		 Shedding his boots, yanking up his pantaloons, Ramirez steps
		 gingerly into the pool, reacting to the cold.

							  MACLEOD
				   Who is the Kurgan? Where does
				   he come from?

							  RAMIREZ
				   The Kurgans were an ancient people
				   from the steppes of Russia. For
				   amusement, they tossed children
				   into pits with hungry dogs to
				   fight for meat.

		 In the trees above, a blue jay arrives home with food for 
hungry
		 mouths.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   I have fought the Kurgan 3 times.
				   In Babylon, Greece and China.

		 He skips out of the water, drying his feet.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   The last time, I was lucky to
				   get away with my head.
						(replacing boots)
				   The Kurgan is the strongest
				   of all immortals. He is
				   the perfect warrior.

		 MacLeod shudders.

							  RAMIREZ
						 
				   He cares about nothing or no-one.
				   He is completely evil.
						(intensely)
				   If he wins the Prize, mortal men
				   will suffer an eternity of darkness
				   and slavery beneath his boot.

							   MACLEOD
				   How do you fight such a savage?

							  RAMIREZ
				   With heart, faith and steel.

											CUT TO:

		 RAMIREZ AND MACLEOD ON A WOODLAND PATH

		 Above them, sunset changes green to gold. Ramirez
		 draws his Samurai.

							  RAMIREZ
				   Now. Let us see what kind of
				   swordsman you have become.
				   On guard, pendejo.

		 MacLeod's already moving, claymore spinning. He
		 feints. Ramirez ducks.

		 Off-balance, the Spaniard retreats, warding off deadly
		 thrusts.

							  RAMIREZ
				   In the end, there can be only
				   one.
						(swinging)
				   It is the Prize for which we
				   all struggle. The Kurgan must
				   never win it. Alone, I cannot
				   stop him.
						(retreating)
				   You may have a chance.

		 Sure-footed, MacLeod tracks him through fallen timber.

							  MACLEOD
				   If it came down to just us two,
				   would you take my head?

		 Ramirez doesn't answer. MacLeod leaps forward, clay-
		 more a WHISTLING RAZOR.

		 Ramirez parries, but it's no good. The student has
		 become the master.

		 Losing his balance, Ramirez topples into a gully.
		 MacLeod's on him in a second, blade against his throat.

		 Breath rasping, they hold each other's gaze in green
		 twilight. An eternity passes, then:

		 MacLeod throws his sword away.

		 Reaching out.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   Give me your hand, brother.

		 Ramirez smiles. His work done. MacLeod hauls him
		 up.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD STRIDING THROUGH CENTRAL PARK

		 Skaters on the ice. Kids fight with wooden swords in Sheep 
Meadow.

		 Behind him, trying to look inconspicuous, the faithful Bedsoe 
dogs
		 his tracks.

		 Ahead in the trees. MacLeod sees:

		 SUNDA KASTAGIR

		 An elegant black African in blue-gold robes, head crowned 
with an
		 ermine-trimmed cap.

		 Standing on a stone bridge over the lake, he feeds bread to 
the
		 ducks.

		 MacLeod joins him, locking eyes with the African. They're 
both
		 tense, ready for anything.

		 Unexpectedly, Kastagir grins wall-to-wall teeth, grabbing 
MacLeod in
		 a huge bear-hug.

							  KASTAGIR
				   MacLeod. It's good to see you.
				   Seems like a hundred years.

								MACLEOD
						(chuckling)
				   It has been a hundred years.

		 Kastagir LAUGHS, removing a flask from his robe, offering it 
to
		 MacLeod

							  KASTAGIR
				   A little something to put
				   hair on your chest?

							  MACLEOD
						(suspiciously)
				   What is it?

							  KASTAGIR
				   Boom-Boom

		 MacLeod sniffs the open flask. It's a head-winder. The 
African
		 appraises him critically.

							  KASTAGIR
						 
				   You've become so strong, MacLeod.
				   Surely, you're not afraid of a
				   little Boom-Boom.
						(twirling eyebrows)
				   Do you think I'm trying to
				   poison you?

		 They LAUGH. MacLeod drinks. Retrieving the flask, the African

		 takes a long swig.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   You're crazy, Kastagir.
				   You always were.

							  KASTAGIR
						(offering flask)
				   Have some more.

		 MacLeod drinks. Kastagir feeds the ducks.

							  KASTAGIR
				   The Gathering is here.
				   Time has almost caught us,
				   my friend.
							  MACLEOD
						(grinning)
				   has it? Do you think we should
				   go on?

							  KASTAGIR
				   I think we should have a party.

		 They take off across the park. Bedsoe emerges from
		 bushes, following them.

											CUT TO:


		 MACLEOD AND KASTAGIR IN THE DUG_OUT BAR

		 A steel-&-neon Village hang-out. Sawdust on the floor. It's 
late.
		 They're drinking and talking, glancing over at:

		 Bedsoe, alone in a nearby booth, spying on them from behind a 
New
		 York Post.
			 ----

		 Unexpectedly, MacLeod and Kastagir appear at his table, 
sitting
		 down.

							  MACLEOD
				   Mind if we join you?

		 Bedsoe folds his paper, gathering his wits.

		 His cover's blown, but this might just be the opportunity 
he's been
		 waiting for. He decides to play along.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   Sundra Kastagir, meet --
						(to Bedsoe)
				   What's your name?

							  BEDSOE
				   Bedsoe.

							  MACLEOD
				   He's a cop. He questioned me after
				   Fasil lost his head. He's trying to
				   pin a murder on me.
						(winking)
				   If I'm guilty, they'll give me the
				   death penalty.

		 They ROAR with laughter. Bedsoe's eyes narrow. He makes 
mental
		 notes. A WAITRESS in pirate costume appears.

							  WAITRESS
						(to Bedsoe)
				   Want anything?

							  BEDSOE
				   I'll have what they're having.

							  KASTAGIR
						(booming)
				   Bring more.

		 She leaves.

		 MONTAGE -- THE PARTY

		 The waitress brings endless rounds of drinks. Amidst 
LAUGHTER,
		 the trio gets drunk.

		 Bedsoe starts having fun, finally going to work on Kastagir's 
flask
		 of Boom-Boom.

		 MACLEOD, KASTAGIR & BEDSOE

		 completely potted. Their table is a forest of bottles.

							  KASTAGIR
						(to MacLeod)
				   D'you remember the night Washington
				   lost his teeth at Valley Forge?

							  BEDSOE
						(to Kastagir)
				   I was in Washington once.

							  MACLEOD
						(answering
						Kastagir)
				   Freezing our asses off, crawling
				   around in the snow looking for a
				   set of wooden dentures.

							  BEDSOE
						(to MacLeod)
				   Which Washington are we
				   talking about?
							  KASTAGIR
				   Ever fight a duel, Bedstead?

							  BEDSOE
				   Bedsoe.

							  KASTAGIR
				   Me, neither.
						(indicating
						MacLeod)
				   He has.

		 Bedsoe tries to focus on MacLeod.

							  MACLEOD
				   It was in 1797. I was using the name
				   Adrian Montagu. I insulted the wife
				   of a pompous Boston lawyer named Bassett.
				   Hotchkiss, his second, dragged me to
				   Beacon Common. I was very drunk.

							  BEDSOE
						(dazed)
				   1797 --?

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 red-eyed, dishevelled and weaving.

							  MACLEOD O.S.
				   Bassett chose rapiers at dawn.

		 BASSETT, a corpulent, ferret-faced lawyer, tests blades
		 under a tree. Horses graze nearby.

		 HOTCHKISS, a tall, lantern-jawed toadt, brushes his
		 master's coat.

							  HOTCHKISS
				   The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett, I
				   implore you.

							  BASSETT
				   You are my second, Hotchkiss. I
				   am fighting this duel. Not you.

			He watches MacLeod trying to kill a bush.

							  BASSETT
						 
				   See if the imbecile is ready.

		 Rocketing over the grass, Hotchkiss keeps clear of
		 MacLeod's unpredictable thrusts.

							  HOTCHKISS
				   Mr. Bassett is waiting, sir.

		 MacLeod whips around, almost dislocating his neck.

							  MACLEOD
				   I'm Bontagu. Not Massett.

		 His wig slides over his eyes.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   Christ, I've gone blind.

							  BASSETT
						(advancing)
				   On guard, sir.

		 Hotchkiss waits for the kill. MacLeod can't see.

		 Bassett runs him through.

		 Bassett sees it's finished. Hotchkiss kisses his master,
		 escorting him to his horse.

		 Wound healing, head aching, MacLeod staggers up.

							  MACLEOD
						(slurring)
				   Bassett. Is that you?

		 Dumbstruck, they wheel. He's waving at them.

							  HOTCHKISS
				   You missed him, Mr. Bassett.

							  BASSETT
				   I did not miss him, you idiot. I
				   ran him through.

		 MacLeod blinks at his sword, wondering what it is.

							  HOTCHKISS
				   He is still standing, sir.

		 Shoving Hotchkiss aside, Bassett lunges, running
		 MacLeod through again. MacLeod falls down.

							  MACLEOD (O.S.)
				   Bassett kept running me through.
				   I'd fall down.

		 More frenzied attempts by Bassett, each time receiving
		 kisses from Hotchkiss.

							  MACLEOD (O.S.)
						 
				   Hotchkiss would embrace Bassett.
				   They'd head for their horses. I'd
				   stagger up.

		 Eyes zooming, MacLeod rocks on his heels.

		 Bassett thinks it's a nightmare. Hotchkiss shoves a
		 pistol into his hand.

							  HOTCHKISS
						(screeching)
				   Shoot him! Shoot him in the head!

		 Finally, grasping what's happening, MacLeod raises his
		 hand.

							  MACLEOD
				   Stop, sir. I beseech you.

		 Bassett tries to cock the gun, Hotchkiss urging him on.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   I apologize, Mr. Bassett, for
				   calling your wife a bloated wart-
				   hog.
						(unsteady)
				   I trust honor has been satisfied,
				   and bid you good day.

		 He staggers off into the mist. Hotchkiss tries to
		 wrench the gun from Bassett.

							  HOTCHKISS
				   Let me do it. You botched the
				   whole thing.

		 Wrestling it from him, Bassett wheels in circles, look-
		 ing for someone to kill.

		 Suspecting it will be he, Hotchkiss flees. Bassett
		 raises the pistol and FIRES.

											CUT TO:

		 KASTAGIR

		 howling with LAUGHTER in the Dug-Out Bar. Zooming, Bedsoe
		 staggers up, knocking over bottles.

							  BEDSOE
						(slurring)
				   I wanna thank --

		 He blinks at them. He can't remember anybody's name.
		 HICCUPING, he weaves off, MUMBLING.

							  BEDSOE
						 
				   Wonderful evening...

		 No one notices he's gone. The pirate-waitress looms over
		 the table, Kastagir and MacLeod squint up at her.

		 Imagining they're in another century, they adopt Long John
		 Silver voices.

							  KASTAGIR
				   Avast, ye bonny wench.

							  MACLEOD
				   Bring us two barrels of scurvy and
				   a bucket of cleats.

							  WAITRESS
				   Okay, that's it, guys. You're
				   history.

		 She's right. The party's over.

											CUT TO:

		 KASTAGIR AND MACLEOD

		 on swings in a children's playground at dawn, rocking back 
and
		 forth. Both men are sober.

		 A bitter wind tosses newspaper, swirls leaves. Skyscrapers 
blaze in
		 the rising sun.

							  MACLEOD
				   There are 3 of us left. You,
				   me and the Kurgan.

							  KASTAGIR
				   Are you suggesting we join
				   forces against him?

		 MacLeod watches a JOGGER flounder by.

							  KASTAGIR
						 
				   Ramirez filled your head with
				   nonsense. Sooner or later. you
				   and I would have to fight.
						(beat)
				   Nothing personal. I've always
				   liked you, actually.

		 He points a finger at MacLeod, pulling an imaginary trigger.

							  KASTAGIR
						 
				   Boom-Boom.

		 MacLeod gets up and walks away. Kastagir swings in the wind.

											CUT TO:

		 RAMIREZ AND HEATHER

		 having lunch in the MacLeod home. A WOODEN STAIRCASE runs
		 from ground to 3rd floor.

		 Unexpectedly, Ramirez's body jolts violently. His face
		 contorts, voice strangled.

							  RAMIREZ
				   Run, Heather --!

		 Suddenly, the front door EXPLODES, splintering in fragments.
		 Sword in hand, eyes burning, the Kurgan surges in.

		 Heather races back. Ramirez dives for his sword on the
		 table. The Kurgan swings, barely missing Ramirez, chopping
		 the table in two.

		 Ramirez counters, his Samurai slicing the Kurgan's throat,
		 severing his vocal chords.

		 GARGLING in fury, the Kurgan clutches his neck. Warding off
		 the Spaniard's attack, he reels backward up the stairs.

											CUT TO:

		 RAMIREZ AND THE KURGAN

		 fighting on the staircase. Savage forces are unleashed.
		 Sparks fly from CLANGING blades. Outside, THUNDER CRACKS
		 overhead.

		 Despite his wound, the Kurgan fights like a mad dog. Ramirez
		 loses ground.

		 The stone house is reduced to rubble. All that remains is
		 one wall and the staircase rising to nowhere.

		 Outmatched, Ramirez retreats up the stairs. Unstoppable,
		 the Kurgan follows.

		 HEATHER

		 paralyzed with fear, crouches by a wall, watching the 
desperat
		 battle -- Ramirez and the wounded giant silhouetted against 
an
		 electric sky.

		 RAMIREZ AND THE KURGAN

		 hanging in space at the top of the stairs. Ramirez can retrea

		 no further. The Kurgan runs him through. LIGHTNING sears the
		 sky.

		 Gasping, the Spaniard sags to his knees, sword falling 3 
stori
		 to the ground. Below, Heather SCREAMS.

		 Ramirez tries to rise. The Kurgan grabs his hair, pulling him

		 close.

							  KURGAN
				   The Highlander. Where is he?

		 Ramirez's blade has turned the Kurgan's voice to a
		 METALLIC GARGLE.

							  RAMIREZ
				   You're too late. I have prepared
				   him for you.

							  KURGAN
				   You waste your time. He is nothing.
						(indicates Heather)
				   Who is the woman?

							  RAMIREZ
				   She's mine.

							  KURGAN
				   Not for much longer.

							  RAMIREZ
				   I can't hear you, Kurgan. What's
				   wrong with your voice?

		 Ramirez SPITS in his face. The Kurgan goes mad, raising
		 his weapon.

							  KURGAN
				   There can be only one.

		 He cuts off Ramirez's head. A SHIMMERING CLOUD engulfs
		 him.

		 He kicks the corpse off the stairs. Turning, he stares
		 down at Heather shivering by the wall. His pitiless eyes
		 burn into her.

		 The next second, the remaining wall gives way, taking the
		 staircase with it. Surprised, the Kurgan disappears under
		 a mass of timber and stone.

		 Deathly stillness. Clouds cast a pall over the ruins.

		 Cautiously, Heather inches forward, staring down at the
		 debris, trying to comprehend what's happened. Suddenly:

		 THE KURGAN'S HEAD ROCKETS OUT OF THE RUBBLE

		 grabbing her by the throat. She SCREAMS. He RISES.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 in his silver room, studying Ramirez's hat in the glass
		 case. Rachel enters, standing behind him. MacLeod
		 doesn't move.

							  MACLEOD
				   What are you looking at?

							  RACHEL
				   The eyes in the back of your head.

		 Rising, he heads for the door. Rachel follows him.

							  RACHEL
						 
				   People are asking about you. What
				   am I supposed to say?

							  MACLEOD
				   Tell them I'm immortal.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 In an overcoat, carrying a wrapped gift, walking through
		 his closed antique shop, followed by Rachel.

							  RACHEL
				   Would you listen to me for one
				   moment, please?
						(he nods)
				   You can't hide your feelings from
				   me. I've known you too long.

							  MACLEOD
				   What feelings?

							  RACHEL
				   How about loneliness?

		 He conceals his true reaction.

							  MACLEOD
				   I'm not lonely. I've got everything
				   I need, right here.

							  RACHEL
				   No, you don't. You refuse to let
				   anyone love you.

							 MACLEOD
				   Love is for poets. I have other
				   things to do.
						(kissing her forehead)
				   You're such a romantic, Rachel.
				   You always were.

											CUT TO:

		 BEDSOE ON STAKE-OUT

		 parked outside a building in Murray Hill, still suffering
		 from his evening in the Dug-Out Bar. His head's killing
		 him, he's got the shakes and he needs a shave.

		 Balancing a cup of coffee, he tries to work an Alka-Seltzer
		 into a container of water, inadvertently hitting the horn
		 with his elbow. It BLARES.

		 Grabbing his temples, he drops the water, spilling scalding
		 coffee into his groin.

							  BEDSOE
				   Oh, shit...

		 Unnoticed, MacLeod enters the building.

											CUT TO:

		 BRENDA

		 in bra and panties in her bedroom.

		 Finishing make-up, brushing her hair. Nervous, she
		 slips into a sexy dress and boots, studying the effect
		 from different angles.

		 Adjusting her hair, she adds a lizard belt, clinching it
		 tight around her narrow waist.

		 Satisfied, she walks out into:

		 A glass and chrome living room.

		 Dinner set for two. Agitated, she opens the table-
		 drawer. Inside: A pistol.

		 She cracks it open. It's loaded.

		 Replacing it, she opens a cabinet. A hidden tape-
		 recorder is set to go.

		 BUZZER. It's the front door.

		 Starting the recorder, she shuts the cabinet, takes a
		 breath, and opens the door.

		 It's Russell Nash.

		 In suit, tie and overcoat, with gift-wrapped package and
		 bottle.

							  MACLEOD
				   Good evening, Miss Wyatt.

		 He smiles warmly. Those eyes again, fixed on her. She
		 forgets everything.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   You want to dine in the hall, or
				   shall we step inside?

							  BRENDA
						(blinking)
				   Come on in.

		 For a second, they're very close. Her heart pounds.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   May I take your coat?

							  MACLEOD
				   No, thanks. I'll hold onto it.

		 Flushed, she can't think what to say. Impulsively, she
		 heads for the bedroom.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   Where are you going?

							  BRENDA
				   I'll be right back. The glasses
				   are over there.

		 Putting his gift on the coffee-table, he takes off his
		 coat, glancing around.

		 IN THE BEDROOM

		 She stares at her rigid image in the mirror.

							  MACLEOD O.S.
				   I like your place, Brenda.
						(a beat)
				   You never told me what it is you
				   do for a living.

		 Her face goes white.

							  BRENDA
						(into mirror)
				   Do you know what you're doing?

		 Mind racing, she improvises.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   I...
						(closing eyes)
				   I work for the Metropolitan Museum --

		 She tries to calm down. What has she gotten herself into?

		 IN THE LIVING ROOM

		 MacLeod spots Bedsoe through the blinds.

							  BRENDA O.S.
				   In Acquisitions.

		 Covering the room like a cat, he checks the table-drawer,
		 sees the pistol.

							  MACLEOD
				   That explains your interest in
				   ancient weapons.

		 He finds the recorder in the cabinet.

							  BRENDA O.S.
				   Yes. Particularly the Samurai.

		 Opening the bottle, he sits on the sofa.

		 Brenda enters, joining him, feeling more confident, smooth-
		 ing her skirt over her thighs. He fills glasses, handing
		 her one.

							  BRENDA
				   Shall we have a toast?

		 He thinks for a moment.

							  MACLEOD
				   Yes.
						(raising glass)
				   To the child going to bed,
				   And the man on the stairs
				   Who climbs to his dying love
				   In her high room.
						(she's transfixed)
				   And let us hope tonight
				   He shall find no dying,
				   But his love alive and warm.

							  BRENDA
				   That's beautiful. What is it?

		 The CLINK GLASSES.

							  MACLEOD
				   Dylan Thomas.

		 They drink. She blinks as it hits her throat. She
		 likes it.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   Brandy. Bottled in 1783.

							  BRENDA
				   Jesus. That's old.

							  MACLEOD
				   1783 was a very good year. Mozart
				   wrote his Great Mass. The
				   Montgolfier brothers went up in
				   the first hot-air balloon. And
				   England recognized the
				   independence of the United States.

							  BRENDA
				   Is that right?

		 Who is this guy who fights scarred giants, drinks 200-
		 year-old brandy and has a antique shop on Hudson
		 Street?

		 He seems to be staring into her soul, seducing her in
		 erotic, unfamiliar ways.

		 She notices the package.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   What's that?

							  MACLEOD
				   It's for you.

							  BRENDA
				   Can I open it?

							  MACLEOD
				   If you like.

		 She picks it up and rips off the gift-wrap, staring
		 down at:

							  A
					   METALURGICAL HISTORY
							  OF
					   ANCIENT SWORD-MAKING
							  by
						BRENDA J. WYATT

		 The blood drains from her face.

							  BRENDA
				   You Bastard

							  MACLEOD
				   Odd thing.
						(indicating book)
				   Your bio doesn't mention the Met.
				   It says you work for the police
				   in Forensics.
						(she's stunned)
				   Are you and Moran trying to set
				   me up?

		 Angry, she rises, moving away.

							  BRENDA
				   I don't work for Moran.

							  MACLEOD
				   Then why's that fat policeman
				   sitting outside, watching your
				   apartment?

		 She peers through the blinds, seeing Bedsoe in the car.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   You remember him. Moran's had
				   him tailing me.

		 She sits close to the table containing the pistol. He
		 refills his glass. The silence is deadly.

							  BRENDA
				   What are you going to do?

							  MACLEOD
				   The question is, what are
				   you going to do?
						(she frowns)
				   Are you going to turn off the
				   tape. or are you going to shoot
				   me with the .38?

							  BRENDA
				   You're really something.

		 Crossing to the recorder, she rips out the tape. Removing the

		 pistol, she empties it, tossing it away.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   I'm not looking for a killer.
				   I'm looking for a sword
						(pause)
				   The one used on Fasil. I found
				   pieces of it under the Garden.

		 He stands, getting ready to leave. She blocks his way

							   BRENDA
				   I only want to see the Samurai.

							  MACLEOD
				   Why?

							  BRENDA
				   I told you. It's not supposed
				   to exist.

		 Picking up the shards, she waves them in his face.

							  BRENDA
				   I dated these pieces of the blade
				   at 600 B.C. The metal's been folded
				   over 200 times.
						(tapping shards)
				   The Japanese didn't start making
				   swords that way until the Middle Ages.

		 Her eyes are alight.

							  BRENDA
				  So where the hell did it come from?

		 He glances at the shards. Her energy is uncompromising.

							  BRENDA
				   If I could verify the existence of
				   such a weapon, it'd be like finding
				   a 747 made a thousand years before
				   the Wright brothers flew.
						(drolly)
				   With a find like that, I could
				   get on "Good Morning America".

							  MACLEOD
				   This is crazy.

		 Ignoring her, he heads for the door. Furious, she spins him
		 around.

		 Face-to-face, he can smell her perfume. It's driving him 
crazy.

							    BRENDA
				   I want some straight answers, Nash.

							  MACLEOD
				   Don't you ever think about anything
				   except what you want?

		 Before he can stop himself, he's got a handful of her
		 hair, pulling her mouth onto his, kissing her passion-
		 ately.

		 She struggles. Releasing her, he touches her cheek,
		 then leaves.

		 Breathless, Brenda sits on the couch. The front door
		 SLAMS.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 descending a rear stairwell, FOOTSTEPS ECHOING off the
		 concrete. He stops on a landing, shutting his eyes.

		 MONTAGE: HEATHER GROWING OLD

		 MacLeod and Heather leave Jedburgh and move east, set-
		 tling on a farm outside Montrose.

		 Years become decades. She changes. Her youth fades.
		 MacLeod is with her constantly.

		 Breathing her last, she lies in his arms, clutching a
		 sheepskin doll. She strokes his ageless cheek.

							  HEATHER
				   My beautiful man. My husband.

							  MACLEOD
				   I am that, my love.

		 Her eyes fill with tears. MacLeod fights for control,
		 smoothing her hair.

							  HEATHER
				   I have never...really known.

							 MACLEOD
				   What?

							  HEATHER
				   Why you stayed.

							  MACLEOD
				   Because I love you as much now as
				   the day I first met you.

							  HEATHER
				   And I love you.

		 Crying, she turns away. Tormented, he cradles her
		 head, holding her tight.

							  HEATHER
						 
				   I don't want to die. I want to
				   stay with you forever.

							  MACLEOD
				   I want that, too.

							  HEATHER
				   Will you do something for me,
				   Conner

							  MACLEOD
				   What, blossom?

							  HEATHER
				   In years to come, will you light a
				   candle and remember me on my
				   birthday?

							  MACLEOD
				   Aye, love. I will

							  HEATHER
				   I wanted to have your children.

		 She collapses, clinging to him.

							  MACLEOD
						(huskily)
				   They would have been strong and
				   fine.
											    
							HEATHER
						(struggling)
				   Don't see me, Conner. Let me die
				   in peace.

		 Heart breaking, he rocks her. Breathing faster, she
		 closes her eyes.

							  HEATHER
						 
				   Where are we?

							  MACLEOD
				   We're in the Highlands. Where
				   else? Running down a mountain-
				   side.

		 She smiles, young again.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   The sun's shining. It's not cold.
				   We'll swim in the loch, maybe.

		 She fades.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   You've got your sheepskins on.
				   And the boots I made for you.

		 She dies. He squeezes her tighter, blinking back
		 tears.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   When I met you at the fair, you
				   said: "You're all muck and
				   muscle." Then you smiled. What a
				   beauty.

		 Grief overwhelms him. Lowering her gently, he closes
		 her eyes, taking the doll from her hand. He kisses her
		 cheek.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   Good night, my bonnie Heather.
				   You were always beautiful to me.

		 He sobs.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 laying Heather to rest at sunset on a hill above the
		 farm. His horse stands under a tree.

		 Drawing his claymore, he sinks it deep into the earth,
		 marking Heather's grave.

		 He buckles on Ramirez's Samurai, eyes raking the
		 heavens.

							  MACLEOD
				   You were right, haggis. There
				   will never be another.

		 Grimly, he leads his horse down the mountain.

		 Left behind, his claymore. Carved into the blade,
		 glowing in the dying sun, the name:

						  MACLEOD

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD IN HIS NEW YORK LOFT

		 surrounded by his past. Everywhere he looks, objects
		 remind him of distant places and times, intensifying
		 his painful isolation.

		 VOICES and SOUNDS scramble his brain, gathering in
		 volume:

							  OVERLAPPING VOICES
				   My beautiful man. My husband --
						(cheering crowd)
				   Lotta fun, ain't it --?
						(cannon-fire)
				   Devil! Devil --!
						(police sirens)
				   Head chopped off two nights ago --
						(horns blaring)
				   600 B.C. It's not supposed to exist --
						(a baby crying)
				   Tell them I'm immortal --
						(pipes and drums)
				   There can be only one --!

		 The pressure's too much. BELLOWING, MacLeod erupts.

		 Picking up a vase, he spins round in fury, flinging it
		 against a wall. It SHATTERS in a million pieces.

		 MONTAGE: The same frustration vented bacward through
		 the centuries. The vast today, marble statue in 1880,
		 a wine bottle at a French castle wall, the beer glass
		 at his attackers in the Scottish tavern.

		 GLASS FRAGMENTS RING IN THE STILLNESS

		 falling to the floor. MacLeod struggles to control his
		 feelings. Sitting down on a couch, he stares out of the
		 window. His hands are shaking.

											CUT TO:

		 MORAN AND BEDSOE MUNCHING BURGERS AT TONY'S

		 a stand at 59th & Lexington. Around them, crowds, traffic
		 jams, BLARING HORNS.

		 TONY, the huge owner, in apron and baseball cap, eats cole-
		 slaw, checking the News headline:
						----

				   HEAD HUNTER 3 -- COPS ZERO

							  TONY
				   Hey, Moran. Have you read what it
				   says here?

							  MORAN
				   Come on, Tony. You know cops
				   can't read.

							  TONY
						(checks story)
				   What does "incompetent" mean?

		 Tony cackles. Moran chews burger, eyeing Bedsoe.

							  MORAN
				   The damn Mayor's calling my
				   apartment at two in the morning.

		 Bedsoe sympathizes. They finish up, getting into a
		 green Dodge. Bedsoe FIRES THE ENGINE.

							  TONY
						(re: paper)
				   Hey, Moran. What does "baffled"
				   mean?

		 The Dodge PEELS OFF into traffic.

											CUT TO:

		 MORAN

		 talking to Rachel in the antique shop.

		 She's at her desk. He strolls about, looking things over.
		 He makes her nervous.

							  MORAN
				   You do see him every once in a while?

							  RACHEL
				   Rarely.

							  MORAN
				   How do you reach him?

							  RACHEL
				   I don't

		 He sits across from her.

							  MORAN
				   He kind-of keeps you in the dark,
				   right?
						(a beat)
				   Alright, Miss -- or is it Mrs.?

							  RACHEL
				   Miss. Rachel Ellenstein. Why?

							  MORAN
				   Just curious. I'm a bachelor myself.
						(rising)
				   If you see Nash, have him call me,
				   okay?

							  RACHEL
				   Okay, Sergeant.

							  MORAN
						(smiles)
				   Lieutenant.

		 He leaves.

		 BRENDA READING "CERTIFICATES OF BIRTH, 1941-48"

		 in the Hall of Records. She finds a photostat:

				 BORN: 11.17 A.M. OCTOBER 22nd, 1945
				MERCY HOSPITAL, SYRACUSE, NEW YORK
					   TO: KAREN JOAN NASH
					   ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:
						DR. W.B. KADELL

											CUT TO:

		 DR. WILLIS KADELL

		 82, thumbing through files in his cluttered study. Brenda
		 sits on a sofa. He's never seen legs like hers.

							  KADELL
						(finds file)
				   Here we go. Karen Joan Nash.
						(reading)
				   Yes, I remember this one. I was
				   practicing in Syracuse. Didn't
				   get many of these.

							  BRENDA
				   What?

							  KADELL
				   Unwed mothers.
						(checks her legs again)
				   Nowadays that's no big deal.
				   Back then in Syracuse it was a
				   stoning offense.

		 He CHUCKLES, spinning his eyebrows.

							  BRENDA
				   What happened?

							  KADELL
				   She had the baby. Then she died.

							  BRENDA
				   So Nash was illegitimate?

							  KADELL
				   Yeah, he was illegitimate. For
				   about a minute-and-a-half. He
				   died right after she did.

							  BRENDA
						(stunned)
				   He died?

											CUT TO:

		 BRENDA

		 getting out of a cab at 42nd and 5th, dressed in coat, fur
		 hat, gloves and scarf.

		 Moving through lunchtime crowds, she walks up the steps to
		 the Public Libary.

											CUT TO:

		 ERIK POWELL

		 seated at his computer-console. He's the Chief
		 Archivist, New York State.

		 Macho, gay, short-hair, moustache and tattoos. Before
		 him, two display screens.

		 Brenda perches on a stool at his elbow, coat, hat and
		 scarf over her arm.

							  ERIK
				   I did what you asked, Brenda. And
				   do I have something weird.

							  BRENDA
				   What?

							  ERIK
				   The computer will display certain
				   documents on micro-film.
						(indicating 2nd
						 screen)
				   They'll pop up there.

							  BRENDA
				   Erik, what's weird?

							  ERIK
						(punches data)
				   This guy Nash's signature. He's
				   the legal owner of the property on
				   Hudson Street.

							  BRENDA
				   I know that.

							  ERIK
						(touchy)
				   He could have been renting. Or
				   leasing. You don't know.

		 Brenda sighs. Talking to Erik is a pain in the ass.

		 A document appears on the 2nd screen.

							  ERIK
						 
				   Okay, here we go. This is the
				   original deed to the Hudson Street
				   property. Dated 1796. Look at
				   that signature.

		 On screen, a dramatic scrawl: ADRIAN MONTAGU.

							  BRENDA
				   Who's Adrian Montagu?

							  ERIK
				   The first owner of Hudon Street.
						(checks print-out)
				   An English immigrant.

				   Can we cut to the chase, Erik?

							  ERIK
						(ruffled)
				   I'm taking you through a process
				   here, Brenda. I spent hours on
				   this. Okay?

		 Brenda shivers in the cold.

							  ERIK
						 
				   Adrian Montagu left his property
				   to Hamilton Kopp.
						(cracking knuckles)
				   Even in the old days, if somebody
				   left you something, you had to
				   sign a receipt.

		 New program. On the 2nd screen, a receipt signed:
		 HAMILTON KOPP.

							  ERIK
						 
				   This shows that Kopp actually
				   received Montagu's inheritance.
						(enjoying himself)
				   Check out Kopp's signature.
				   Familiar?

							  BRENDA
				   It looks a little like the first
				   guy's -- Montagu.

							  ERIK
				   Brilliant.

		 He returns to the console.

							  ERIK
						 
				   The next thing I did was see if I
				   could find a Hamilton Kopp who
				   died at birth some time before the
				   receipt was signed by Montagu.

							  BRENDA
				   Why?

							  ERIK
				   Logical minds search for
				   connections.
						(taps forehead)
				   I've got a logical mind. The Nash
				   kid died at birth, right?

		 She nods. On screen, a DEATH CERTIFICATE for HAMILTON
		 KOPP.

							  ERIK
						 
				   Here we go. Hamilton Kopp. Born,
				   January 16th, 1819. Died at birth
				   -- 20 years before he allegedly
				   signed the receipt inheriting
				   Hudson Street from Montagu.

							  BRENDA
				   It's a coincidence. It's got to
				   be a different Kopp.

							  ERIK
						(grinning)
				   Thin so? Watch this.
						(programs new stuff)
				   Kopp died and left his wordly
				   goods to one Alfred Burgess.

		 On-screen, a receipt signed: ALFRED BURGESS.

							ERIK
						 
				   Burgess left his possessions to
				   Wallingford Benoit.

		 On-screen, a receipt signed: WALLINGTON BENOIT.

							  ERIK
						 
				   And Benoit left his stuff to your
				   guy. Russell Nash.

		 On-screen, a receipt signed RUSSELL NASH. Erik swivels
		 in his chair. Brenda puts on her gloves.

							  ERIK
						 
				   In all five instances, Montagu
				   through Nash, I found a death
				   certificate for a kid with the
				   same name, who died at birth --
				   years before he pretended to sign
				   for his inheritance.
						(eyeing her)
				   Still think it's a coincidence?

		 She replaces her fur hat. She's never been so cold.

							  BRENDA
				   Erik, isn't there any heat in
				   here?

							  ERIK
				   No. Heat's bad for the circuits.
						(taps more keys)
				   And now, just in case there's any
				   doubt.

		 On-screen, Brenda examines five magnified signatures.

					   ADRIAN MONTAGU
					    HAMILTON KOPP
					   ALFRED BURGESS
					 WALLINGFORD BENOIT
					    RUSSELL NASH

		  Erik runs another program, overlaying individual let-
		 ters from the combined signatures -- T's on T's, N's
		 over N's, etc.

		 They're identical.

		 Dramatically, he spins around on his chair.

							  ERIK
						 
				   So what you got here, Brenda is a
				   guy who's been creeping around
				   since at least 1700. Pretending
				   to croak every once in a while,
				   leaving all his possessions to
				   kids who've been corpses for years
				   -- and assuming their identities.

							  BRENDA
				   It's not possible.

		 KENNY WATCHING TV NEWS

		 in the Ansonia lobby. Derelicts snore in harmony.

							  NEWSCASTER
				   Public outrage mounts this hour as
				   New York's finest seem powerless
				   to stop the Head-Hunter.

		 The Kurgan leaves the elevator.

		 Carrying his oblong case, crossing the lobby.

		 It's late.

							  KENNY
						(seeing him)
				   Hey Rockefeller. How did you
				   like Candy? She said you were

		 The Kurgan stops, staring at him.

							 KENNY
				   You watch your ass out there.
						(cackling)
				   Don't let the Head-Hunter getcha!

		 The Kurgan walks up to him, inches from his face.
		 Kenny stares into eyes that are a vision of Hell.

							  THE KURGAN
						(rasping)
				   Don't speak to me.

							  KENNY
				   I didn't mean --

							  THE KURGAN
				   Don't ever speak to me. Do you

		 He understands. The Kurgan leaves, Kenny staring after

											CUT TO:

		 KIRK MATUNAS

		 driving 23rd in a souped-up Mustang.

		 He's wiry, in fatigues, T-shirt, forage-cap and boots.
		 Headlights reflect in his sunglasses.

		 Gun magazines on the seat, assault weapons in the back,
		 Uzi machine-pistol on the dash. Nobody's gonna mug
		 this sucker.

							  MATUNAS
						(singing)
				   Oh, she jumped in bed,
				   And she covered her head,
				   Bet I couldn't find her.

		 He turns down 2nd Avenue, gathering speed.

							  MATUNAS
						(continuing;
						 singing)
				   Oh, her titties were pink
				   As a red rooster's --

		 He brakes suddenly, revving back, fishtailing to a
		 halt, staring down an alley.

		 A black guy and a white guy battle with swords.

		 Matunas grabs the Uzi, springing into action.

											CUT TO:

		 THE KURGAN AND KASTAGIR IN THE ALLEY

		 Fighting savegely. Matunas appears, thunderstruck.

							  MATUNAS
						(shouting)
				   What the hell's going on?

		 They continue hammering at each other. Matunas slams a
		 clip into the Uzi, taking aim.

		 Horrified, he sees the white guy decapitate the black
		 guy.

		 Matunas starts FIRING.

		 Five slugs tear into the white guy's chest, flinging him
		 against a fence. He falls. Matunas disappears down the
		 alley.

											CUT TO:

		 A SMALL CROWD GATHERS

		 on 2nd Avenue. A vintage Chevy pulls up at the curb,
		 ENGINE RUNNING. Inside, AN OLD COUPLE try to see what's
		 going on.

		 MATUNAS

		 creeps down the dark alley. He checks the black guy.
		 He's a goner.

		 Suddenly, the white guy he shot lunges with a sword,
		 driving the blade into Matuna's stomach. SCREAMING,
		 he falls, dropping his Uzi.

		 Ignoring him, the Kurgan hunches over Kastagir's body.
		 Matunas sees weird things happen:

											CUT TO:

		 THE CROWD

		 on 2nd Avenue freaks. STREET-LIGHTS DIM. WINDOWS
		 EXPLODE in buildings. NEON SIGNS ERUPT. MANHOLE
		 COVERS BLAST skyward.

		 Riddled with bullet-holes, the Kurgan staggers out
		 of the alley, CURSING, wielding his sword. The crowd
		 scatters in terror.

		 Hearing distant SIRENS, the Kurgan looks for a ride,
		 spotting the Chevy on the curb.

		 Bellowing, he charges, sword swinging, opening the
		 Chevy's roof like a tin can.

		 Prying it open with his bare hands, he sees the old
		 couple staring up at what used to be their roof. The
		 next second, they're airborne, hurled to the sidewalk.

		 Leaping inside, the Kurgan takes off. Tires SHRIEKING,
		 roof flapping, he hurtles away down 2nd Avenue.

							  MORAN
				   Right. Drunk out of your skull.

		 Embarrassed, Bedsoe checks his shoes. Moran gets a

				  20 people were there and nobody

						(a beat)
				   That's New York for you.
						(lights cigar)
				   So tell me about this guy Matunas.
				   Is he on drugs?

							  BEDSOE
				   No. Some kind of survival nut.

							  MORAN
				   Survival nut?

							  BEDSOE
				   Yeah. Into guns. Former Marine.
				   Vietnam. I checked with his

				   Okay, I guess -- for a guy who got

				   Come on, Matunas. It was dark in
				   that alley.

							  MATUNAS
						(screeching)
				   The freak was stabbing me to

						(re: photo)
				   And that ain't him.

		 Moran sags onto the bed.

							  MATUNAS
						 
				   Depressed?

		 Moran shrugs.

							  MATUNAS
						 
				   You don't know grunt about

						(sits up painfully)
				   I got me a .357, a trunkful of

				   can't protect myself.
						(shouting)
				   I ain't safe -- !
						(wincing)
				   That weirdo with the sword, man.
				   He got up and stabbed me after I

						(collapsing)
				   Don't talk to me about depressed.

		 Moran rises wearily.

							  MORAN
				   Could you work with an artist and

				   Sure.

				   Hey, cop.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD

		 lighting candles in St. Patrick's Cathedral.

		 Beside the altar. Soaring columns, stained-glass win-
		 dows. People pray. Priests glide about.

							  MACLEOD
						(1st candle)
				   For you, my bonnie Heather. Happy
				   birthday.
						(lights 2nd)
				   And you, Juan Ramirez.
						(remembering)
				   Take care of her, you overdressed
				   haggis.

		 Moving to an empty pew, he sits silently, lost in the
		 past.

		 In front of him, the candles blur. The ceiling starts
		 to spin. Turning, MacLeod see the Kurgan beside him
		 in the pew.

		 He's become a punk-rocker, straightened his hair, dyed
		 it orange, and put on make-up.

		 A line of safety-pins dangle from the scar across his
		 throat. His mocking eyes roam the church.

							  KURGAN
				   Kastagir is gone. Only you and I
				   remain. Chatting together here on
				   holy ground.

		 He leers.

							  MACLEOD
				   You're revolting. What d'you think
				   this is -- Hallowe'en?

							  KURGAN
				   I am disguised. This way people
				   will not recognize me.

							  MACLEOD
				   What do you want?

							  KURGAN
				   Your head.

		 MacLeod is a coiled spring. 2 MATRONS cross themselves,
		 heading down the aisle.

							  KURGAN
				   And the Prize.
						(the matrons pass by)
				   Happy Hallowe'en ladies!

		 Scared witless, they leave.

							  KURGAN
				   It was destined that the board
				   would be cleared for the real
				   players.

							  MACLEOD
				   I feel something coming from
				   you. You're trying to conceal
				   it from me. What is it?

							  KURGAN
				   I conceal nothing.

		 MacLeod's glittering eyes fix on the Kurgan's safety-
		 pinned throat-scar.

							  MACLEOD
				   Ramirez's blade did not cut
				   deeply enough. He was right
				   about you. You're slime.

							  KURGAN
						(harshly)
				   Ramirez was an effete snob.
				   He died on his knees.

		 Gloating, he remembers:

											CUT TO:

		 THE KURGAN

		 clutching Heather's neck, rising up from the ruins of
		 MacLeod's 16th century stone house. SCREAMING, she tries
		 to break free of his grip. It's hopeless.

							  KURGAN V.O.
				   I took his head and raped his woman
				   before his body was even cold.

		 Throwing Heather down, he rips off her clothes. She
		 CRIES OUT brokenly. There's no one to hear.

											CUT TO:

		 THE KURGAN

		 eyeballing MacLeod's stricken face in St. Patrick's.
		 Understanding dawns in his lurid eyes.

							  KURGAN
				   I see. Ramirez lied. The woman
				   was not his. She was yours.
						(leering)
				   And she never told you. I wonder
				   why. Perhaps I gave her something
				   you never could, and secretly she
				   yearned for my return.

		 On his feet, MacLeod shakes with fury.

							  MACLEOD
				   You sick bastard -- !

		 He lunges for the sword inside his coat. The Kurgan's
		 hands fly up in mock-horror.

							  KURGAN
				   Holy ground, Highlander. Remember
				   what Ramirez taught you.

							  MACLEOD
				   You can't stay in here forever.

							  KURGAN
						(smiling)
				   You're weak, Highlander. You will
				   always be weaker than I.

							  MACLEOD
				   I'll be out front. Waiting.

		 MacLeod leaves by the front doors. Metallic laughter
		 rings through the church. Worshippers are outraged.
		 A bald PRIEST confronts the Kurgan.

							  PRIEST
				   This is the house of God. People
				   are trying to pray. You're dis-
				   turbing them.

		 The Kurgan kisses the Priest's hand noisily, dropping
		 to his knees.

							  KURGAN
				   Forgive me, father. I am a worm.

		 Patting the Priest's head for luck, the Kurgan boogies
		 down the aisle in hobnail boots.

		 Safety-pins jangling at his throat, he heads for the
		 back exit.

		 He leaps out into the night. The DOOR BANGS. The
		 Priest crosses himself.

											CUT TO:

		 BRENDA GRILLING RACHEL IN NASH'S ANTIQUE SHOP

							  BRENDA
				   I want to see him, goddamnit.

							  RACHEL
				   I'm afraid that's impossible.
				   Mr. Nash --

							  BRENDA
				   Nash is dead. He died at birth.
				   Didn't he, Miss Ellenstein.

		 MACLEOD

		 suddenly SLAMS open the door, seeing Brenda.

							  MACLEOD
				   What are you doing here?

							  BRENDA
				   Looking for a dead guy named Nash.
				   He died at birth in Syracuse.

		 MacLeod looks at Brenda. She's done her homework, and
		 she's not going to leave. He makes a decision.

							  MACLEOD
				   Come on.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD AND BRENDA ENTERING HIS PRIVATE APARTMENT

		 She's dumbfounded staring at the opulent surroundings.
		 He moves to the bar.

							  MACLEOD
				   Do you want a scotch?

							  BRENDA
				   Is is Old?

							  MACLEOD
				   It's 12 years old. Do you want
				   some or not?

		 She nods. He pours drinks, handing her one. Taking
		 her arm, he leads her down a hall.

		 MACLEOD AND BRENDA ENTER HIS SILVER ROOM

		 Her expression changes to awe.

		 The room is filled with suits of armor, Italian statuettes,
		 Persian fetishes, and a thousand other oddities from a
		 hundred eras.

		 The sight is overwhelming.

							  BRENDA
				   My God.

		 Astonished, she strolls around, touching artifacts. He
		 watches her.

							  BRENDA
					    (continuing; pointing)
				   Is that claymore real?

		 He lets go. Years of isolation melt in the sound of
		 her voice.

							  MACLEOD
				   Yes.

		 Brenda runs her hand along the delicate weaving of a
		 Carolingian tapestry.

		 She turns and faces him.

							  MACLEOD
				   I have been alive for four and a
				   half centuries. And I cannot die.

							  BRENDA
						(nervously)
				   Right. And I'm an Amazon princess
				   sent by Martians to save the world.

		 He's caressing her with his eyes, confushing her again.

		 Crossing to a glass table, he picks up an ornate stiletto.

							  BRENDA
						(continuing; alarmed)
				   What are you going to do with that?

		 He offers her the hilt.

							  MACLEOD
				   Take it.

		 Reluctantly, her fingers close over the handle.

		 Suddenly, MacLeod kneels before her, tearing open his
		 shirt, exposing his chest.

		 In one blurred move, he grabs her fist. She tries to drop
		 the dagger, but his grip is like steel.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   I am Conner MacLeod of the Clan
				   MacLeod. I was born in 1518, in
				   the village of Glamis, on the
				   shores of Loch Shiel.
						(tightening his grip)
				   And I am immortal.

		 In a flash, he pulls her fist forward:

		 Plunging the stiletto into his heart.

		 Letting go, she screams. He collapses, moaning.
		 Freaking out, Brenda watches:

		 MacLeod pulls the dagger out of his heart.

		 The wound heals. He stands up. Brenda is lost.

											CUT TO:

		 BRENDA AND MACLEOD AT THE DINNER TABLE

		 She's flushed, excited in the presence of living history.
		 MacLeod pours brandy, getting comfortable. Brenda watches
		 him draw on his cigar.


							  BRENDA
				   I've got a million questions.
				   I don't know what to ask first.

							  MACLEOD
				   I have all the time in the world.

							  BRENDA
				   You were with Napoleon at Waterloo.
						(he nods)
				   What was he like?

							  MACLEOD
				   Short. French. Wore his hat
				   sideways.

		 She spots the silver-frame photo of MacLeod with a 
12-year-old girl.

							  BRENDA
				   Is this your daughter?

							  MACLEOD
				   Yes.

							  BRENDA
				   What's her name?

							  MACLEOD
				   Rachel.

		 Brenda frowns. Slowly realizing, she points O.S.

							  BRENDA
				   You mean that Rachel?

							  MACLEOD
						(nodding)
				   Yes. She was an orphan. I can't
				   have children. I adopted her.
						(drolly)
				   Over the years, our relationship
				   has gone through qquite a few changes.

							  BRENDA
				   She's old enough to be your mother.

							  MACLEOD
				   Sometimes she thinks she is.

		 Rising, he takes the Samurai from the sheath in his coat, 
laying it
		 before her.

							  MACLEOD
				   This was forged in 593 B.C.
				   Metal folded over 200 times.

		 He enjoys her amazement.

							  MACLEOD
						(continuing
						gently)
				   Like finding a 747 a thousand
				   years before the Wright Brothers
				   flew. Right?

		 She runs her fingers over the blade.

							  BRENDA
				   This belonged to Ramirez?

							  MACLEOD
				   Yes.

		 Reality hits her like a bolt. She's alone with an immortal, 
holding a
		 sword forged half-a-century before Christ.

							  BRENDA
				   How many men have you killed
				   with this?

							  MACLEOD
				   Too many. They're all gone.
				   Except for one.

		 He kisses her.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD AND BRENDA MAKING PASSIONATE LOVE

		 She grips his scar-covered back. He tastes her face
		 and neck.

											CUT TO:

		 HEATHER DYING IN THE 16TH CENTURY

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD AND BRENDA IN BED

		 Head on his chest, she feels his breathing, stroking
		 his muscular chest.

							  BRENDA
				   You're like the sun, going on
				   for ever and ever.

							  MACLEOD
				   The sun will burn out in ten
				   billion years.

						    BRENDA
				   Then what'll you do -- walk around
				   in the dark?

		 He kisses her. She touches his cheek.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   Tell me more about Heather.

		 He frowns, sitting up.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   In all these years, she was the
				   only one you really loved, right?

		 He bounces out of bed stark naked, deciding to go into
		 the bathroom. She SHOUTS after him.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   And losing her was too painful to
				   bear -- was that it?
						(silence)
				   Come on. In every relationship,
				   somebody has to die first.

							  MACLEOD O.S.
				   Yes, but the survivor doesn't have
				   to go on forever.

		 He turns on the SHOWER, FULL-BLAST.

							  BRENDA
				   It's not just your body that's
				   covered in scars. D'you know that?

		 The shower STOPS. Towel around his waist, he marches out
		 of the bathroom.

							  MACLEOD
				   I don't want to talk about this.

							  BRENDA
				   I wouldn't want you to spend 10,000
				   years in a hair shirt if I was Heather.

		 Doing his best to ignore her, he stacks magazines.

							  BRENDA
				   I heard Christiaan Barnard
				   on TV one time.

							  MACLEOD
				   Who?

							  BRENDA
				   Heart guy. He did the first
				   transplant.

							  MACLEOD
				   I don't have heart trouble.

							  BRENDA
				   Oh, yes, you do.
						(a beat)
				   Anyway, Barnard's patients always
				   wanted to live longer. That's why
				   they came to him. For new hearts.
				   But he wouldn't give any guarantees.
				   All he could promise them was
				   freedom from pain.

							  MACLEOD
				   What is your point?

							  BRENDA
				   My point is, Ramirez was wrong.
				   Just one year of love. though
				   it ends in death, is better than
				   an eternity alone.

							  MACLEOD
				   Are you making a proposal?

		 Seductively, she pulls the sheet around her.

							  BRENDA
				   Not me. Besides, we've only
				   just met.
						(pause)
				   Come here a minute.

						   MACLEOD
				   Why?

							  BRENDA
				   I want to check your pulse.

		 He's on her in a flash.

											CUT TO:

		 MORAN AND BRENDA WALKING DOWN A HALLWAY

		 She's pissed.

							  BRENDA
				   Frank, call off Bedsoe. I don't
				   need any protection.

							  MORAN
				   You saw Nash at least twice.
				   Why?

		 They descend stairs in a wave of milling cops.

							  BRENDA
				   I was looking for something.

							  MORAN
				   Did you find it?

							  BRENDA
				   Maybe.

		 Moran jams his cigar in his mouth. They arrive at
		 Brenda's office.

							  MORAN
				   Brenda, there's stuff going on
				   in this Head-Hunter case you
				   wouldn't believe. Nash is
				   involved somehow. I don't
				   want you hurt.

							  BRENDA
				   I'm okay. I promise.

		 She smiles, unlocking her office, going inside.

											CUT TO:

		 BRENDA AND MACLEOD TOURING THE BRONX ZOO

		 eating popcorn. They pause at:

		 THE GIRAFFE ENCLOSURE

		 He's pensive. she's energized

							  BRENDA
				   I had it all laid out. Forensics.
				   In 3 years, a lectureship at
				   Columbia. Tenure. Husband, couple
				   of kids.

		 He nods distractedly, eyes riveted on:

		 A LONE WOLF IN A CAGE

		 staring at him. The connection between man and beast
		 is timeless. Their heartbeats and breathing become one.

		 In his mind, Ramirez's VOICE ECHOES down 400 years:

							  RAMIREZ'S VOICE
				   I had to go on, never again to hear
				   the sound of her voice, her laughter.
				   She left behind such a silence.

		 The wolf turns away. MacLeod's mind reels.

							  BRENDA
				   You're not, listening.

							  MACLEOD
				   Brenda, this isn't going to work.
				   I can't get involved with someone.
				   Not again.

							  BRENDA
						(quickly)
				   Who said anything about being
				   involved?

		 Hiding her feelings, she moves to:

		 BIRDS IN AN AVIARY

		 Parrots SCREECH. He joins her.

							  BRENDA
				   If all you want's an occasional
				   night together, that's fine with
				   me.

		 All around the zoo, wild-life starts to act strangely. Tigers 
claw
		 their cages. Monkeys go crazy. Hyenas attack one another.

		 Bears try to climb out of their pit. The hairs on the back of

		 MacLeod's neck stand up. His mind reels.

							  MACLEOD
						(looking around)
				   It's not that simple.

							  BRENDA
				   You think I'm going to turn
				   you in to Moran

		 From every direction, SHRIEKS, GROWLS, TRUMPETINGS.

		 Visitors think it's feeding time, but MacLeod knows 
different. His
		 eyes are everywhere, searching for the Kurgan.

							  MACLEOD
				   No, I don't think you'll do that.

		 He reaches for her hand. She pulls it away.

							  BRENDA
				   There's something I want to say.

		 A happy-faced CLOWN wanders past, selling balloons.

		 MacLeod's hand is under the shoulder of his coat, gripping 
his
		 sword, scanning every passing face, searching for his mortal 
enemy.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   I love you.
						(a beat)
				   But you're locked away in your
				   own private world of memories.
				   No future. Unable to care.
				   Afraid.

		 THE KURGAN IN THE CHILDREN'S ENCLOSURE

		 Surrounded by kids petting sweet, furry things. He
		 peers through the trees.

		 AT THE PENGUIN-POOL

		 Excited kids jostle and SHOUT. MacLeod is in turmoil.

							  BRENDA
				   You know what's kind of weird? Most people
				   are afraid to die. That's not your
				   problem. You're afraid to live.
						(rises)
				   Take care of yourself
						(kisses him)
				   Don't lose your head.

		 She turns and walks for the exit.

											CUT TO:

		 THE KURGAN

		 watches Brenda leave. A KID hands him a rabbit. He
		 strokes it. It struggles, biting him hard. Flinging
		 it from him, he takes off.

		 BRENDA GETS OUT OF HER APARTMENT ELEVATOR

		 It's dark and late. The building's empty.

		 Jostling an armful of books, she starts down the corridor.

		 Turning a corner she suddenly FREEZES.

		 The books tumble out of her arms onto the floor.

		 Standing at the end of the corridor, smiling, is the Kurgan,
		 in black leather, buckles and stomping-boots. His hair is
		 shaved into an orange mohawk.

							  KURGAN
				   Hello, pretty.

		 The Kurgan starts for her, carrying a huge, broadsword.

		 Brenda screams and runs for her apartment.

		 The Kurgan is in no hurry.

		 Brenda looks back at the Kurgan. Crying in fear, she
		 frantically tries to get her keys into the lock of her
		 apartment.

		 The Kurgan is nearly upon her.

		 Brenda throws open the door, runs inside, and locks it.

		 Beat.

		 CRASH!!

		 THE KURGAN hammers his sword deep into the wood of the
		 door.

							  BRENDA
						(crying)
				   Oh, God...

		 He strikes again. And again. Splinters smack
		 everywhere.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   Go away! Oh, God, go away!

		 Hysterical, Brenda sinks to the floor against her
		 desk.

		 THE KURGAN stands back and gives the door a last two-
		 fisted swing.

		 Brenda screams.

		 The door collapses.

		 The hellish figure stands over her in the doorway.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   For God's sake...

							  KURGAN
				   There is no God. Only me.

											CUT TO:

		 A SPEEDING CAR RACES THROUGH THE CITY

		 The Kurgan takes a cassette from his pocket, slotting
		 it in. DEAFENING MUSIC fills the car:

		 It's the KURGAN'S ANTHEM.

		 Brenda is trying to get her bearings.

		 MUSIC SHRIEKS, her ears burst. Cars rocket past like
		 bullets. Speedometer 90 and climbing.

		 Brenda stares at the Mohawk abortion with his foot to
		 the floor.

							  BRENDA
						(shouting)
				   Stop. Please, stop.

		 The Kurgan erupts in maniacal laughter.

		 Brenda hangs on for dear life. Everything's a blur.
		 Any second, she's going to die.

		 Engine WHINING, MUSIC POUNDING, eyeballing his captive:

		 The Kurgan runs chicken down the avenue, not stopping
		 for red lights.

		 Flat-out, stopping for nothing, getting his rocks off,
		 shrieking like a banshee.

		 In his wake, a maelstrom of wreckage and terror.

		 ANTHEM BLARING, he flings the Cutlass into the dark
		 mouth of the Mid-Town Tunnel.

		 Brenda screams.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD SLUMPED ON A COUCH IN HIS LIVING ROOM

		 replaying a RECORDED message:

							  KURGAN'S VOICE
				   She gave me your number. She
				   didn't want to at first. Listen.

		 Brenda sobs.

							  KURGAN
				   She's hot, Highlander. I think
				   she wants me. What part of her
				   shall I cut off first?

		 More CRYING. MacLeod shuts it off. Rachel at the
		 door.

							  RACHEL
				   The endless killing has driven
				   him mad.

		 Rising, he puts on his coat and checks his Samurai,
		 holding her face in his hands.

							  MACLEOD
				   Rachel, there are some instructions
				   in the desk drawer. I want you to
				   follow them. There's a power-of-
				   attorney for you. You'll have
				   everything you need.

							  RACHEL
						(realizing)
				   You're not coming back.

		 Silence.

							  RACHEL
				   Even if you kill him, you're not
				   coming back. Are you?

		 He sits her down, holding her hands.

							  MACLEOD
						(gently)
				   Sweet Rachel, you always knew
				   this would happen.
						(a beat)
				   Russell Nash dies tonight. One
				   way or the other. It's time.

							  RACHEL
						(crying)
				   There's no one in my life but
				   you.

		 MacLeod gives her a handkerchief.

							MACLEOD
				   You still have a lot of life to
				   live.

							  RACHEL
				   I'm afraid.

							  MACLEOD
				   A beautiful woman like you
				   need never be alone or afraid.

		 He stands up, smiling down at her.

							  RACHEL
				   What about Brenda?

							  MACLEOD
				   He's given me an hour.

							  RACHEL
				   I understand.

		 He kisses her, hugging her tight.

							  MACLEOD
				   Goodbye, dearest Rachel. My
				   daughter. My good friend.

		 He leaves. Long silence. Tears roll down her cheeks.

							  RACHEL
						(whispering)
				   Goodbye, Russell Nash.

											CUT TO:

		 CONEY ISLAND AMUSEMENT PARK AT NIGHT

		 Bitter cold. A sign reads:

						 CLOSED
					   NO ADMITTANCE

		 Breakers pound the beach. WIND HOWLS through the park.

		 The roller-coaster's a prehistoric monster. Light
		 flickers from a merry-go-round pavilion.

											CUT TO:

		 THE KURGAN ASSEMBLING HIS SWORD

		 Inside the pavilion, slotting the blade into place.

		 Sprawled in sawdust, Brenda stares at carved wooden
		 horses. Shivering, she sits up, trying to figure out
		 where she is.

		 The Kurgan looms over her, blade gleaming.

							  KURGAN
				   A nice sleep, yes?

		 She tries to rise. He sets his sword-point at her
		 throat.

							  KURGAN
				   One move, whore, and I'll slice
				   you to bits.

		 He forces her back. She's freezing and terrified.

							  BRENDA
				   You're an animal.

							  KURGAN
				   I am Kurgan. Warrior eternal.
				   I have carved my name in the
				   flesh of Venetian princes, raped
				   the daughters of Attila the Hun,
				   and set ablaze the seven hills
				   of Rome.
						(grating)
				   You are nothing. Born and dead
				   in the blink of my eye.
						(a beat)
				   You are my slave, and will give
				   me whatever pleasure I demand.

							  BRENDA
				   You puffed-up turd. You don't have
				   the equipment.

		 She spits at him. He glares in fury.

							  BRENDA
				   Come on. Kill me. You're going
				   to do it anyway.
						(a beat)
				   What's the matter? No balls?

	   The Kurgan smiles. She's clever, this bitch.

							  KURGAN
				   I see. You try to anger me, so
				   I kill you before you lover
				   arrives. Then I have no advantage.

							  BRENDA
						(staggers up)
				   I'm nothing to him. Just a roll
				   in the hay.

		 Breath billowing, mohawk trembling, he wonders if
		 that's true. Suddenly he freezes, staring out into
		 the dark.

							  KURGAN
				   He cares for you. More than you
				   think. I can feel his approach.
						(a beat)
				   My advantage is real.

		 Grabbing a hammer, she hurls it at him. He bats it away
		 with his sword, slapping her across the face.

		 MacLeod appears, samurai in hand.

		 The Kurgan drags Brenda up by the hair, hand over her
		 mouth, blade resting across her neck. MacLeon starts
		 forward.

							  KURGAN
				    Stop, or I'll cut her.

		 Tense as a cobra, MacLeod stops.

							  MACLEOD
				   Let her go.

							  KURGAN
				   I don't think so.

		 He yanks her head farther back, eyes on the Highlander.

							  KURGAN
				   If you care what happens to her.
				   put down your sword and walk away.
						(pointing)
				   Over there.

		  Brenda fights to break his grip. The Kurgan chokes
		 her. MacLeod puts down his sword.

							  KURGAN
						 
				   Very good. Now move.

		 MacLeod moves.

							  KURGAN
						 
				   Kneel down, neck exposed.

							  MACLEOD
				   Let her go first.

							  KURGAN
				   Do you think thousands of years
				   have made me an idiot?
						(barking)
				   Kneel -- !

		 Boiling, he obeys.

		 Hurling Brenda away from him, the Kurgan swings mur-
		 derously at MacLeod's exposed neck.

		 Like a panther, MacLeod rolls, grabs his samurai, and
		 meets the ROARING BLADE with a THUNDEROUS CLANG and a
		 shower of sparks.

		 MacLeod leaps to his feet.

							  KURGAN
						 
				   So now it ends. Generation upon
				   generation. Millions of miles.

		 Wielding his sword like a scythe, MacLeod attacks,
		 driving the kurgan back in showers of sparks. BLADES
		 CLANG in the gloom.

		 The Kurgan blocks his parries brilliantly. They lock
		 sword-hilts, face to face.

							  BRENDA
				   Kill him! Kill him!

		 The Kurgan hurls him across the pavilion. He lands
		 on his back, winded.

		 Yelling, the Kurgan charges, driving MacLeod out into
		 the night. Brenda follows fearfully.

											CUT TO:

		 A SAVAGE BATTLE RAGING THROUGH THE PARK

		 Between the reptilian day-glo nightmare and the 466-
		 year-old Highlander.

		 Roller-coaster pilings are severed and collapse.
		 Arcades demolished, ferris-wheel chairs hacked to
		 bits. Energy crackles all around them.

		 They battle beneath a huge red wooden fruit. Painted
		 on it in lurid colors:

					  FUN IN THE BIG APPLE

		 Circling, MacLeod's eyes burn into his ancient enemy.

							  MACLEOD
				   I can sense it again. What I felt
				   in the church. What are you hiding?

							  KURGAN
				   Nothing.

		 They grapple like primordial beasts, sweat pouring off
		 their bodies.

							  MACLEOD
						(realizing)
				   It's fear. That's what I feel.
				   You're afraid of me. Kurgan, you're
				   afraid of me.
						(hurling him back)
				   That's why you needed the woman.
				   You didn't think you could take me.

							KURGAN
						(hoarsely)
				   Lies -- !

		 His rabid eyes can't hide the truth. MacLeod charges
		 again, wielding Ramirez's sword full-strength.

		 The Kurgan's arms feel like lead. Gasping, he re-
		 treats to:

		 The icy beach.

		 MacLeod beating him back.

							  MACLEOD
				   All these years, I thought I was
				   running from you. But it was
				   myself.
						(contempuously)
				   You're not the perfect warrior.
				   You're a coward.

		 MacLeod batters him relentlessly. Each blocked blow
		 saps Kurgan further.

		 Beaten, he stands, gulping for air. MacLeod faces him,
		 samurai poised for another blow.

		 The Kurgan can't get it up. Brenda's rooted to the
		 spot.

							  MACLEOD
						(continuing, to the Kurgan)
				   For Heather, Ramirez, Kastagir and
				   all the others I never knew. And
				   last, for the Highlander MacLeod of
				   the Clan MacLeod --

		 He raises his Samurai.

							  MACLEOD
				   There can be only one.

		 Blade a WHISTLING blur:

		 He cuts off the Kurgan's head.

		 Transfixed, Brenda watches a sparkling energy leave the
		 corpse and engulf MacLeod. Standing up:

		 MacLeod glows all hues of the rainbow.

		 His hair stands on end. Color erupts from his eyes.
		 He's like a roman candle against the waves. The WIND
		 HOWLS.

							  MACLEOD
						(continuing;
						 screaming)
				   Mother of God -- !

		 Terrified, she tries to touch him. It's like his skin's
		 on fire.

							  BRENDA
						(shouting)
				   What is it -- ?

		 Glowing, he falls to his knees in the sand.

							  MACLEOD
				   The Prize. It is the Prize.

		 Suddenly, everything's still. His eyes probe the darkness.
		 There's a TERRIFYING EXPLOSION.

		 Brenda watches MacLeod's body transform into many different
		 people. His voice ECHOES over the surf.

							  MACLEOD
				    Everything's alive. The
				   Quickening overpowers me.
						(becoming
						Ramirez)
				   All resistance is gone.
				   I am generations being born
				   and dying.
						(becoming
						Fasil)
				   I am night air, breathing.
						(becoming
						unknown people)
				   The life-force smothers me.
						(becoming
						the Kurgan)
				   I am all of them.
						(becoming
						himself)
				   I can feel everything

		 She's terrified. His form shifts and changes before her.
		 Waves CRASH on the beach.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   I can feel your love. The blood
				   in your veins.

		 He reaches out to her.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   Your fear of me.

											CUT TO:

		 FIRE TRUCK

		 converging on MacLeod's antique shop.

		 SIRENS SCREAMING. It's a blazing inferno. Cops hold
		 back crowds. Firemen direct hoses. Tears in her eyes:

		 Rachel moves through the crowd.

		 She's carrying the silver-framed 1952 photo of herself
		 with Nash. Beams split in cascades of sparks.

											CUT TO:

		 MORAN

		 stands on the sidewalk. T.V. crews film the blaze.
		 Cops hold back gawkers behind barriers. Seeing Rachel,
		 Moran takes her arm.

							  MORAN
				   I'm sorry. We couldn't get him out.

							  RACHEL
				   I know.

							  MORAN
						(eyeing her)
				   The Head-Hunter got another one tonight.

							 RACHEL
						(anxiously)
				   What was his name?

							  MORAN
				   Some guy named Kruger.

		 Relieved, she closes her eyes for a moment. MacLeod has won.

							  MORAN
				   Why d'you ask, Miss Ellenstein?

							  RACHEL
				   You can call me Rachel if
				   you want.

							  MORAN
				   Rachel's a nice name
						(seeing photo)
				   What's that?

		 She shows it him.

							  MORAN
						 
				   Nash.
						(she nods)
				   Who's the pretty young girl?

							  RACHEL
						(smiling)
				   Would you like to get some coffee?

		 Puzzled, he looks at the photo, then at her. Taking his arm, 
she
		 walks him off down the street.

		 Behind them, the inferno RAGES

											CUT TO:

		THREE U.P.S. GUYS

		 unloading MacLeod's aquarium off a truck.

		 Reeling under its weight, they stagger up the steps
		 of a brownstone, ringing the bell repeatedly.

		 After an eternity, Bedsoe appears in striped pajamas,
		 rubbing his eyes.

							  UPS GUY
				   You Bedsoe?

							  BEDSOE
				   Yeah.

							  UPS GUY
				   Delivery. Fish. Heavy. Get
				   out of the way.

		 Pushing past him with the tank, they disappear inside.

							  UPS GUY'S VOICE
				   Where d'you want it?

							  BEDSOE
				   Wait a minute. There must be some
				   mistake. I didn't order any fish.

											CUT TO:

		 MACLEOD ON THE FAN-TAIL OF A LINER, ALONE

		 Bright sun, gulls astern. Passengers bask by a pool. Waiters 
serve
		 drinks.

		 He stares at the rolling ocean. Everything is different. 
There's a
		 power and growing confidence in his eyes.

		 Brenda appears in a summer dress, carrying glasses and an 
open
		 bottle. She joins him, setting them on the rail, watching him 
in
		 silence.

							  MACLEOD
				   A man named Armando Rafael Garcia,
				   right now, is planning a military
				   coup in Honduras. Many people may
				   die.

							BRENDA
				   How do you know?

							  MACLEOD
						(searching
						for words)
				   I can't explain it. I just do.

							  BRENDA
				   You mean like when the phone
				   rings sometimes, and before you
				   answer, you know who's calling?

							  MACLEOD
				   Something like that. I'm just
				   learning about it --
						(pause)
				   In Paris, Jean-Robert Tousche
				   and Sylvie Arnaud live in adjoining
				   houses.
						(turning to her)
				   They're deeply in love, but they
				   never speak to each other.

		 The breeze stirs her hair. The implications of what he's 
saying
		 astound her.

							  BRENDA
				   What are you going to do
				   with all this power?

							  MACLEOD
				   I don't know. I think I can help
				   the people in Honduras, the lovers
				   in paris.
						(shakes his head)
				   I'm not sure how yet. I don't
				   fully grasp it.

		 Gulls hang on the wind. Changing mood, Brenda grins, digging 
him
		 in the ribs.

							  BRENDA
				   Before you start saving lives
				   in Honduras and lovers in Paris,
				   will you do something for me?
	   
		 He blinks, focusing on her. His eyes are still magic. She 
loves him
		 to death.

							  MACLEOD
				   Yes. What would you like?

							  BRENDA
				   Will you take me to Scotland?
				   I want to see where you were born.

		 MacLeod is pleased. After all the years he's lived, the miles 
he's
		 travelled, the thought of returning to the place where it all 
started
		 moves him.

							  MACLEOD
						(embracing her)
				   Are you sure this is what you want?

							  BRENDA
				   I'm sure.

		 He strokes her face.

							  MACLEOD
				   Will you call me Conner MacLeod?
				   It's my real name. I long to
				   hear it again.

		 She tries not to cry. He holds her tight, looking into
		 her eyes. He knows what she's thinking.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   Ramirez was wrong. Just one year
				   of love is better than an eternity
				   alone.

		 Composure regained, she grins.

							  BRENDA
				   Right. Now it's time for the
				   ceremony.

							  MACLEOD
				   What ceremony?

		 She fills the glasses, handing him one.

							  MACLEOD
						 
				   What's that?

							  BRENDA
				   Plum brandy. 1976.

							  MACLEOD
				   1976?

							  BRENDA
				   It was all I could find. Listen,
				   1976 was a very good year.
						(reciting)
				   America celebrated its 200th year
				   of independence from England. One
				   Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest won
				   five Academy Awards. And
				   Pittsburgh beat Dallas in the
				   Super Bowl.

							  MACLEOD
				   Is that right?

							  BRENDA
				   Yes. 21 to 17.

		 He cracks up, kissing her eyes, mouth, hair. She
		 pushes him away.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   Wait. I'm not finished. I want
				   to make a toast.

		 He smiles, remembering the night at her apartment.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   To Time.

		  They raise their glasses. She forgets her lines.

							  MACLEOD
				   How long do we have to stand
				   like this?

							  BRENDA
				   Hold it a second. I'm trying
				   to remember.

		 Next second, she's ready. He wonders what's coming.
		 She looks at him lovingly.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   In the sun that is young once only
				   Time lets me hail and climb
				   Golden in the heyday of his eyes.

		 He blinks.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   In the moon that is always rising
				   Time holds me green and dying
				   Though i sing in my chains
				   Like the sea.

		 They clink glasses.

							  BRENDA
						 
				   Dylan Thomas.

		 Moved, he drinks. Putting down her glass, she flings
