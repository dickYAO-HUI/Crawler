PART
ONE
DELETED
EXT. TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAY
A wild, romantic castle perched on a cliff beside
the sea.
MORGAINE
(V.O.)
The Roman empire had
fallen, and Britain was alone, under siege from the barbarians as they poured
across Europe. My father the Duke of Cornwall had taken up arms to hold them at
bay - while at home in Tintagel, my mother sat in her chamber - spinning.
INT. tower CHAMBER (Tintagel) - DAY  
(gallery)
Tight on a spinning wheel, turning hypnotically.
MORGAINE
(V.O.)
But spinning was
dangerous for Igraine of Avalon. That endlessly revolving wheel could bring on,
unbidden, the Sight.
Pull back to reveal the wheel is a reflection in
a moonstone pendant hanging from a silver chain around   the neck of
IGRAINE, DUCHESS OF CORNWALL: a beautiful, gentle woman in her early twenties.
MORGAINE
(V.O.)  (cont'd)
Igraine was closer to
the doors of the other world than most mortals - closer, in truth, than she
wanted to be.
The chamber is a tower room, with rough-hewn
granite walls, softened by tapestries.  Logs
burn in the stone fireplace. There is a thick fog outside; tendrils of it creep
in through the stone embrasures of the windows. Igraine's daughter, MORGAINE, a
dark-haired, intense girl in her teens is studying a book. For a moment the
scene is cosy, domestic, tranquil. 
MORGAINE
(V.O.)  (cont'd)
She came of a line of
women in whom the power of the Goddess ran strong. She thought she had already
paid the price for that inheritance: but in reality, the payment was just about
to begin.
When I think back on
it, that afternoon at Tintagel was the last moment of real peace any of us were
ever to know.
Morgaine looks up lazily from her book - and
realizes something is wrong.
MORGAINE
(cont'd)
Mother! 
Look away!  You'll go into
the trance!
But Igraine does not respond. 
Morgaine jumps up.
MORGAINE
(cont'd)
Mother!
A hand falls on her arm: 
it is her aunt MORGAUSE, Igraine's sister. 
At twenty Morgause has a soft, sensuous,  catlike quality: 
she is lying on a couch now, and does  not want to be disturbed.
 
MORGAUSE
Leave her be! 
Let her have her visions.  There's
little enough else here to amuse her.
(with
some regret of her own)
Not even a man, since
Duke Gorlois went to the wars.
MORGAINE
But aunt, she hates it
when the Sight comes on her:  her
head hurts for days.  And my father
will be angry if he hears she has gone back to the old ways.
MORGAUSE
Your mother is of the
blood of Avalon, Morgaine; the Sight will come to her whether she wills it or
not.  And the Duke need never hear
any of this.
(She
grips Morgaine tight)
Need he?
A clash of wills: then suddenly Igraine speaks
out in a trance-like voice.
IGRAINE
The Merlin is coming.  And my sister Viviane with him. 
We must make ready.
Morgaine and Morgause look at her: although they
are both familiar with the Sight, it still generates a tingle of
supernatural awe.  
IGRAINE 
(cont'd)
They bear tidings. All
our fates are in their hands:  and
all Britain's. 
MORGAUSE 
And what are they
bringing for me,   sister?  A
husband?  Is Viviane  bringing
me a duke as she brought  Gorlois to you? 
(coming
closer)
Or am I to remain your
unmarried  sister forever? 
Morgause's urgent questioning snaps Igraine out
of her  trance: she stares at her sister and daughter as if she had
forgotten their existence - and then suddenly becomes utterly focused and
businesslike.  
IGRAINE
Sister: 
see the kitchen-master - we must kill the calf from the north 
pasture.  Daughter - tell the 
servants to prepare rooms for the  lady and the Merlin both. 
And have the harper found - we must  have music! 
MORGAINE
I have my harp,
Mother.  I can play.
IGRAINE
You know what Father
Cuthbert says about girls who -
MORGAINE
Mother - I can
play.
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
A PEASANT is digging in his fields as a wind
rises   around him:  a
supernatural breeze we will always   associate with the arrival of
Viviane.  The peasant looks up to see Viviane, Merlin and their
servants riding swiftly by on their errand. He crosses himself in superstitious
fear. 
At the top of a rise Viviane reins in her horse
and draws a deep breath. There before them, on the skyline, is Tintagel Castle.
VIVIANE
And so - it begins.
MERLIN
And where will it end,
lady?
VIVIANE
In a future neither of
us can know, Merlin.  But that does
not stop us trying to shape it.
And as she rides down towards Tintagel a bolt of
lightning crackles across the sky. 
INT. GREAT HALL (Tintagel) - NIGHT
The feast of welcome is almost over. 
Merlin, Igraine, Morgause and Viviane sit at the head of a table of about
a dozen courtiers, with Morgaine playing on the harp. 
The hall, though its walls are massive and its beams ancient, isn't
particularly grand; torches flicker against rough, undecorated stone; but the
eerie sweetness of Morgaine's music seems to transport them into another world.
MERLIN
(softly)
Does it not remind you
of Avalon, Igraine?
Igraine looks at him sharply.
IGRAINE
The memory of Avalon
has been painful to me since you and Viviane cast me out, Merlin.
VIVIANE
Cast you out? 
We gave you in marriage to a great Christian duke. 
You went forth as an emissary of Avalon, not an outcast.
IGRAINE
You sent me into
exile, sister, for the sake of the island of mists.
(She
looks away from her)
You have done such
things before, you will do them again. You are the High Priestess.
MERLIN
Has not Gorlois
treated you kindly, child?
IGRAINE
As kindly as a warrior
lord twice her age can ever treat a frightened virgin. 
As kindly as a Christian ruler can ever treat a pagan.
VIVIANE
Never use that word,
sister.  You are a follower of the
Goddess, a devotee of the old religion:  the
true religion.
IGRAINE
Are you so sure of
that, Viviane?
There's a moment of shocked silence. Viviane's
face hardens.
VIVIANE
Have you turned
apostate since you came to Cornwall?
Igraine gestures down the table to where a
Christian priest, FATHER CUTHBERT, is conversing with TALBOT, the commander of
the guard.
IGRAINE
Father Cuthbert would
have me believe that our only hope of heaven is through Christ.
VIVIANE
Heaven! 
Have you forgotten the power that lies in Avalon?
Father Cuthbert breaks off from his other
conversation to turn to her.
FATHER
CUTHBERT
The world has moved on
since the days of the Goddess, lady - since our Lord died on the cross to atone
Eve's sin.
Suddenly we see Viviane assume the posture of the
Lady  of the Lake: larger than life; genuinely awe-inspiring: the very
embodiment of the Goddess.
VIVIANE
Eve committed no sin,
priest.   The story of the
apple is a fantasy concocted by a tribe of desert nomads to frighten their
womenfolk. Come to Avalon and you will see the truth.
FATHER
CUTHBERT
Set foot on that
island of sprites  and evil spirits?  Never!
Viviane stares at him: the priest - quails.
INT. tower chamber (Tintagel) - night 
(gallery)
Merlin, Viviane and Igraine are seated around the
fire, watching the log disintegrate into ashes.
MERLIN
So Avalon crumbles,
Igraine, drifting
away from the world of
men and fading into the mists.
VIVIANE
Unless we here prevent
it.
IGRAINE
We can turn the tides
of history, can we?
MERLIN
If the Saxon
barbarians overwhelm this island, the wisdom of Avalon is lost.
IGRAINE
The Christians believe
they can hold the Saxons at bay.
VIVIANE
But they cannot do it
alone, Igraine. This land needs a leader to whom both Christians and
followers of the Goddess can give allegiance. Someone with the blood of Avalon
in his veins.
IGRAINE
Perhaps so. But the
High King is too old to father a son, and even you cannot imagine -
MERLIN
Ambrosius will be dead
within the month, Igraine. Viviane has foreseen it.
Igraine looks at them, shocked - and then thinks
she understands.
IGRAINE
You mean Gorlois, my
husband, will become High King in his place? That I will
bear the king you speak of?
MERLIN
You will bear that
king, Igraine. Yes.
Viviane leans in close to her sister. 
Her hand moves in a strange gesture over a goblet.
VIVIANE
But not to Gorlois.  Gorlois will not be chosen High King.   
A brooch appears in the water of the goblet with
a curious dragon design embedded in it. Igraine stares at it, hypnotised. 
VIVIANE 
(Softly)
You will bear the
child to the man   whose sign this is, Igraine. 
MERLIN 
And through your loins
will come the future of Britain.
Igraine snaps out of the trance into which they
are lulling her and rounds on them.
IGRAINE 
But I am married by
your will to Duke Gorlois  of Cornwall! 
I have borne him a child!
They stare at her implacably.
IGRAINE
I will not betray him!
MERLIN 
Igraine, willing or
not we are the guardians of something so precious, so holy, we must sacrifice
anything to protect it. 
IGRAINE 
(to
Viviane)
Then you sacrifice
it, Viviane. You make the man who wears this brooch fall in love with you, and
you bear this great new king.  I
have done my part: it is enough.  
Once more Viviane seems to grow taller as she
assumes the authority of the Goddess. 
VIVIANE 
Would that I could
do what is being asked of you, Igraine: would that I had that high destiny, but
I know I do not.  I know it is
written in the stars that you should bear Britain's savior.
(Coming
closer)
And I tell you this:  if you seek  to avoid your fate -  it will pursue
you for life after life, on into eternity - and I will not condemn you to that.
VOICE
(O.S.)
There is no need. I
will bear the child, Viviane. I will find this man and make him fall in love
with me and produce this new king for you.
Morgause emerges into the firelight.
MORGAUSE
I am of the same blood
as you and Igraine.  I have no
husband to betray.  Why not me?
They stare at her, taken aback: 
Viviane is the first to recover.
VIVIANE
No man or woman can
live another's fate, Morgause.  There
is a king in your future, and sons:  but
not this king or this son.  Be
content with that.
Morgause's eyes flash. 
She has as much steel as her sister - though perhaps it's more brittle.
MORGAUSE
Be content, sister?  Because you say so?
MERLIN
(placing
a hand) on her shoulder)
Because it is written,
Morgause.  And be gone:  this matter is not for your ears.
She is about to flash back at him - but his
steady goodness drains away her anger.
MORGAUSE
Come, Morgaine, they
are sending us away.
And suddenly they realize that in sneaking into
the room to listen, Morgause had brought her young niece with her.
IGRAINE
What business had you
bringing Morgaine with you, sister?  That
a child should hear such things  ...
Morgaine goes to her mother and takes her hand.
MORGAINE
It's all right,
Mother. I know you will do what is right. Good night, Father Merlin. Good night,
Aunt Viviane.
Viviane looks at Morgaine - and sees, in her, her
own   younger self.  Of
all the people in this room, this is   the one with whom she feels the
strongest emotional tie.
VIVIANE
(softly)
Little Igraine. 
Grainne, do you remember when I used to call you, Grainne, when we first
did service together to the Goddess?
 She
touches a pendant around Morgaine's neck. 
VIVIANE
Do you remember when I
first gave you this?
MORGAINE
Of course, Aunt. 
It was the day I began to have the Sight.
And with this stunning revelation she turns and
leaves the room leaving a small astonished group behind her.
EXT. DOWNLAND - DAY
Pouring rain. 
A little party of horsemen makes its way along a ridge of the downs, the
rain streaming off their leather cloaks, pouring down the scabbards of their
swords.  As they come towards us we
close in on DUKE GORLOIS OF CORNWALL - a handsome, strong-willed man of
considerable authority and courage:  a
warrior of the old school.  He wears
a distinctive ring on his right hand. 
GORLOIS
Well, do you regret
begging me to take you to the great council, Igraine? 
Do you miss the comforts of Tintagel now as we struggle the long miles to
Londinium?
Igraine is riding beside him, soaking wet.
IGRAINE
I was trained as a
priestess of Avalon, husband.  In
Avalon we treat cold and rain as the illusions they are.
FATHER
CUTHBERT
Cold and rain are sent
by the heavenly Father to remind us we are mortal and sinful, my lady. It did
not rain in the garden, before Eve tempted Adam with the apple.
MORGAINE
Then how did the
flowers grow, Father Cuthbert?  Without
any water to drink?
A flash of annoyance crosses the priest's face.
FATHER
CUTHBERT
It is not a woman's
place to question holy writ, Morgaine, and certainly not a child's.
MORGAUSE
Especially when she
has the better of you, eh, Father?
Cuthbert bites back his anger - with difficulty.
GORLOIS
Don't fret yourself,
Father Cuthbert.  Morgaine's a good
lass - and sharp as a needle. Are you looking forward to the great council,
daughter?
MORGAINE
I'm looking forward to
London, Father.  I'm looking forward
to meeting real people.
Suddenly a weird figure rises up from the bushes
beside the path:  the CRONE. 
The lead horses shy, and the party comes to a halt, gripped for a moment
by superstitious awe.  The old woman
is blind, and for an eerie moment she feels her way along the horses - until she
comes to Morgaine.  One hand she
places on her bridle - and the other reaches out to clutch at Igraine.
CRONE
The mother, the
sister, the mother of the once and future king. 
And would be king.  May the
Goddess protect you.
Gorlois stares at her in fear and horror - and
then digs into his horse's flanks.
GORLOIS
Begone, crone, begone!
And he spurs his horse away along the ridge.

EXT. CHURCH TOWER (London) - DAY
Tight on a great bell as the rope is pulled and
it begins to TOLL.  A slow tilt down
the ancient stones of the tower towards the street below, with the noise of
HOOVES, SQUEAKING CARTS, BARKING DOGS, SHOUTING street vendors and YELLING
children GROWING LOUDER - and thus creating a soundscape of Dark-Ages London
much larger than anything we will actually need to see. 
As the camera reaches the foot of the tower, the worshippers in the
church are emerging into the crowded street - as Gorlois arrives.
AMBROSIUS
(V.O.)
Gorlois, it is good to
see you. Has the wound healed?
EXT. STREET (London) - DAY
AMBROSIUS, the aging but handsome High King of
Britain is leading the procession out of the church as the crowd outside presses
forward, trying to touch Ambrosius's robe.
GORLOIS
The wound is
forgotten, Your Majesty.  But the
Saxons will not forget the blows you dealt them.
AMBROSIUS
You and I, Gorlois,
you and I.  But I fear I will smite
no more Saxons.
GORLOIS
Nay, my lord, it will
be many years before you -
AMBROSIUS
(gesturing
him to silence)
It is why I have
called the council.  Let us break
fast together, and talk.
LOT OF ORKNEY steps forward: a dark-haired Scot
in his thirties, intense and ambitious.
LOT
Your Majesty, you must
rest -
AMBROSIUS
There will be time
enough for rest all too soon, Lot.  Come,
Gorlois. And bring the lovely Igraine with you. 
I would fain meet the sister of the Lady of the Lake while I have the
chance.
As Ambrosius and the others disappear into the
crowd, Gorlois turns to look for Igraine - who is taking a cloth-wrapped package
from a MESSENGER dressed in travel- stained clothes. 
His eyes narrow.
IGRAINE
(to the
Messenger)
From Viviane?
MESSENGER
From the lady, ma'am.
Gorlois's hand closes around the package.
GORLOIS
My wife does not
receive gifts from messengers unknown to me.
IGRAINE
He is not unknown to
me, my lord. He is sent by my sister from the Isle of Avalon.
But Gorlois has opened the package - and exclaims
in surprise.
GORLOIS
But this is the stone
you wore  when we were wedded!  How
came this to Avalon?
For a brief instant we see panic in Igraine's
face - and then she takes control of herself.
IGRAINE
When my sister visited
me, I gave her the stone to have the clasp put right. 
The goldsmiths of Avalon are greater than any in Cornwall.
(taking
the pendant from him and putting it on)
Now it is returned to
me.
Gorlois looks at her for a moment and then
decides to drop the matter.
GORLOIS
Come - the High King
awaits us. He has heard you are come to Londinium with me and has named you as
his guest.  It does you honor,
Igraine.
Suddenly, as Igraine looks at him, the
living Gorlois is replaced by a corpse, a bloodied figure in battle-garb, his
hair plastered with rain to his head - and a great sword slash right across his
face. 
She looks in horror at the vision - and then
blinks.  And Gorlois is before her
again, just as he was.
IGRAINE
It does us both honor,
husband.  I am ready.
INT. council room (London) - DAY 
(gallery)
Ambrosius is at the head of the table, with Lot
on one side, the Welsh King URIENS on the other and Gorlois and Igraine beside
him.  Next to them, among the LESSER
KINGS, is a lean, shrewd, weathered man in his forties: BISHOP PATRICIUS.
Ambrosius holds Igraine's hand with great
tenderness.
AMBROSIUS
So you are a daughter
of the Holy Isle, Lady Igraine. 
(With a
look at Patricius)
My priests do not like
it that your Druids should be placed on equal footing with them: 
but I tell them you both serve the Great One above us, by whatever name. 
IGRAINE
Of late, My Lord, it
seems the Christians have begun to push Avalon away from Britain, into the
mists.
PATRICIUS
If Avalon is drifting
away, it is because the people no longer believe in it.
IGRAINE
It is because you work
night and day to pry lose its hold, Bishop Patricius. Because you stand in the
pulpit and tell them the Goddess is evil, which is a lie.
GORLOIS
Igraine - it is not
for you to question an anointed bishop!  Or
for any woman to engage in religious debate before her king.
AMBROSIUS
Your wife speaks for
what she believes in, Gorlois, and I honor her for it.
As Gorlois is about to answer, the room is filled
with the sound of YAPPING HOUNDS - and UTHER PENDRAGON comes in, dragged along
by their sheer exuberance. A tall, broad-shouldered man in his thirties with a
handsome, open face.
UTHER
Quiet, quiet, you
hounds from Hell.  My Lord, forgive
me.
Surprisingly, Ambrosius smiles indulgently and
beckons Uther to join them.  Uther
gives the leashes of the dogs to a serving man and squeezes somewhat clumsily in
on the bench around the table - finding himself directly opposite Igraine - and
finds himself staring straight at Igraine's breasts, as if hypnotized.  Between them lies the moonstone.
GORLOIS
(with
suppressed anger)
Allow me to introduce
you, Uther Pendragon, to my wife, the Lady Igraine, Duchess of Cornwall.
But Igraine's eyes are fixed too.
Uther is wearing the dragon brooch she saw
in Viviane's vision.
UTHER
Your pardon, my lady.  Your pendant ... it is as if I had seen it 
... long ago.
IGRAINE
In Avalon, my lord, it
is said we lead many lives.
Patricius is about to interject, but Ambrosius
speaks up.
AMBROSIUS
My Lady Igraine - it
has been balm to my heart to look upon the wife of my most loyal and valiant
Gorlois.  When you next see the Lady
of the Lake, tell her the High King sends his greetings.
IGRAINE
(rising)
I will, my lord. 
With all my heart.
Her smile encompasses the whole table: 
but as it reaches Uther, his look seems to look with hers - and she has
to tear her eyes away. Gorlois's face darkens in anger.
EXT. STREET (London) - DAY
Igraine emerges from the building and leans back
against the door, fighting to control her emotions.
IGRAINE
Viviane, Viviane -
what have you done?
Her hand closes around the moonstone pendant and
she looks at it as if she will tear it from her neck. 
An APPLE SELLER emerges out of the crowd.
APPLE
SELLER
Fruit for you, lady,
red, ripe fruit.  Only two denari.
Igraine looks at the apple as if it is the
original temptation, looks at the masses of faces filling the street, and
fighting her rising claustrophobia, flees into a gap between two buildings.
EXT. ALLEY (London) - DAY
Igraine runs down a narrow alley between tall
stone walls.
INT. council room (London) - DAY 
(gallery)
The council is in the midst of its debate.
GORLOIS
If Roman Legions are
not to return to defend us from the barbarians, we must create our own.
URIENS
It is horsemen the
Saxons fear - we need cavalry to ride them down.
LOT
Commanded by a Caesar,
as in the old days.
UTHER
A Scottish Caesar,
perhaps?
LOT
You have something
against Scots fighting men, Uther?
UTHER
I'm not sure I've ever
seen one, King Lot.
As Lot starts to rise to his feet a GOBLET falls
to the floor and SMASHES.  It has
fallen from Ambrosius's hand.  When
he speaks it is clear he is in the last stages of a fatal illness. 
AMBROSIUS
I have little time
left, my friends.  Listen, and
listen well to what I have to tell you.
EXT. RIVERBANK (London) - DAY 
(gallery)
Igraine sits in an orchard running down to the
river, hypnotized by the running water.  A
shadow falls on the grass, and someone slides into a sitting position beside
her.  She turns to see Uther: 
he too is staring into the river.
UTHER
Where does it go to,
Igraine?
IGRAINE
To the sea, my lord.  It flows down to the sea.
UTHER
We should go with it,
you and I.
She looks at him - and can scarcely breathe.
UTHER
I have known you - in
another life. Have I not?
Igraine still cannot speak.
UTHER
You are the lost half
of my soul. You know it.
With a great effort of will Igraine gets up and
walks away from the river to a gnarled old apple tree, and leans against it as
if for comfort.
Uther follows her.
IGRAINE
I am the sworn wife of
Gorlois, Uther, and so I will remain.
UTHER
My heart reaches out
to you, Igraine. 
IGRAINE
(with an
effort)
Return to the council,
my lord.  And remember, for all his
anger, Gorlois is a good man.
Uther pauses for a long moment. Finally:
UTHER
As you bid, my lady.
And he then turns to go.
And comes face to face with - Gorlois.
GORLOIS
Ah, my Lord Pendragon.  I was looking for -
And then he sees Igraine, almost hidden among the
blossoms - and his face sets into stone.
IGRAINE
My lord -
But she is lost for words. Uther steps smoothly
in.
UTHER
I grew weary of the
council, Gorlois, and came down to the river. 
Your wife urged me to go back to my duty.
GORLOIS
Did, she, Pendragon?
UTHER
Yes, my lord, she did.
GORLOIS
To no avail. 
The council is over.
UTHER
How so? 
We had not decided -
GORLOIS
The council is over
because Ambrosius is dead.
UTHER
No!
(trying
to push past Gorlois)
I must go to him -
Gorlois grasps him.
GORLOIS
Too late, Uther. 
He is gone. But he died with your name on his lips.
(bitterly)
He named you High
King after him.
Uther gives a cry of shock and grief, breaks free
of Gorlois' grip and strides away across the lawn. 
Gorlois turns to Igraine.
GORLOIS
My lady - you should
be more careful to avoid gossip.  No
chaste woman is safe with Uther Pendragon.
IGRAINE
Is that what you think
of me? That I am the sort of woman who would slip away to couple with a strange
man like a beast in the field?  Would
you like to inspect my gown to see if it is rumpled from lying with him on the
ground?
Gorlois strikes her across the mouth.
GORLOIS
You will not play the
shrew with me, madam. I told you to avoid him: obey me!
IGRAINE
Touch me at your
peril, Gorlois, or I shall teach you that a daughter of the Holy Isle is no
man's slave or servant.
Gorlois opens his mouth to reply - and then
thinks better of it.
GORLOIS
Come, we must return
to the church.  They are saying a
mass for the soul of the king.
(in an
undertone)
And with Uther as his
successor, they may well say a requiem for all Britain.
EXT. MOORLAND - DAY
A lone rider - UTHER'S CAPTAIN - gallops across
bleak, dramatic moorland, with great prehistoric cairns on the skyline behind
him.  Ahead in the distance -
Tintagel Castle.
INT. tower CHAMBER (Tintagel) - DAY 
(gallery)
Gorlois is being outfitted in his war-gear. 
Igraine, Morgaine and Morgause are in attendance. 
We note   Gorlois' distinctive ring. 
MORGAUSE
(Admiringly)
The Saxons will never
dare attack Cornwall when they hear Duke Gorlois himself is coming. 
And looking like a Roman Emperor of old!
GORLOIS
Ha! 
The Saxons care nothing for fine armor and great titles, Morgause. 
All that answers for them is cold steel.
MORGAINE
But you have the cold
steel, too, Father.  I cut my finger
on your great axe today.
GORLOIS
May it be a lesson to
you, Morgaine.  War is for men, and
for women - intrigue and the hearth. 
IGRAINE
And supplies, my lord.  I have seen to it that the troop is provided with food for a
week's riding.
The door opens and Talbot, the captain of the
guard comes in.
TALBOT
A messenger from the
High King, my Lord. He would speak -
But Uther's Captain strides in immediately after
him and bows. Gorlois looks at him coldly.
CAPTAIN
I have come, my lord -
GORLOIS
(Cutting
him off)
You are come to ask
for my troops to aid Uther.
CAPTAIN
It is the High King's
bidding, Duke.
GORLOIS
So it may be, but my
troops are needed here in Cornwall. The Saxons are massing off the coast.
CAPTAIN
The High King believes
it is but a feint, my Lord Gorlois. He has ordered all his war dukes to assemble
on the South Coast.
GORLOIS
Uther Pendragon cannot
know the mind of the Saxons, Captain.  And
I cannot risk the safety of the Duchy.
CAPTAIN
My Lord - this is not
a request: It is an order from your king. You are to bring your army to him at
once.
GORLOIS
I am Duke of Cornwall,
Captain, not Uther Pendragon.
CAPTAIN
And as Duke you have
sworn fealty to Uther, who now commands you. 
Will you betray him at the first test?
Gorlois grasps the Captain by the collar, lifts
him off his feet.
GORLOIS
If you wish to live,
Captain, never let such words leave your lips again. 
When I have seen off the Saxon menace here, then I will consider whether
I am able to aid the Pendragon in his schemes.
CAPTAIN
(with
difficulty)
If you refuse the High
King now, he becomes your enemy.
Igraine and Morgaine watch the battle of wills
with horror; Morgause with just a hint of excitement.
GORLOIS
If Uther Pendragon
thinks he can fight the Saxons and the Duke of Cornwall - let him try.
And he lets the Captain fall, half-strangled, at
his feet.

EXT. BATTLEMENTS (Tintagel) - NIGHT 
(gallery)
The noise of trumpets, marching men and galloping
horses floats up from below as Igraine, Morgause and Morgaine watch Gorlois and
his troops ride off.
MORGAUSE
They look so fine,
riding off to battle.
IGRAINE
Would that they were
riding off only to fight the Saxons.
MORGAINE
But that is who
they're going to fight, Mother.  Isn't
it?
IGRAINE
Your father has defied
the High King, Morgaine.  How long
will it be before his men and ours are at war?
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY  
Morgaine's unbidden vision of the horrors of
battle;   she is in the thick of it, with swords and axes slicing 
through flesh and bone all around her. 
EXT. BATTLEMENTS (Tintagel) - DAY  
MORGAUSE
And it's all because
of you, Igraine, isn't it?  They
lust after you, both of them, Gorlois and the High King. 
It sends thrills through my body to think of it.
IGRAINE
It is not because of
me!  Gorlois hated Uther long before
I ever met him.  He hoped Ambrosius
would name him High King.
MORGAUSE
But he might have
accepted it if he hadn't caught you two making love in an orchard.
Igraine slaps her.
IGRAINE
How dare you! 
That is a lie, and you know it.
MORGAUSE
You were seen! Gorlois
saw you! He pulled you apart under an apple tree!
IGRAINE
Who told you that?
(She
backs Morgause up against a battlement)
No one knows what
happened except ...
(realizing)
Gorlois told you,
didn't he?
(And
realising still more)
You and he -
She is pushing Morgause out over the sheer drop
from the battlements.
MORGAINE
Let go of her, Mother!  She'll fall!
IGRAINE
Fall? 
Do you think this witch would fall? 
She'd float.
(To
Morgause)
You bewitched him,
didn't you?
MORGAUSE
As you did Uther?  No, there was no need:  after
you'd driven Gorlois from your bed why shouldn't he come to mine?
Igraine looks at her, appalled.
MORGAUSE
You want everything,
Igraine! Gorlois, and the High King; Cornwall and Britain! 
And to be the mother of the King who is to come! 
Why should I be left out? Why am I the sister who gets nothing? 
Is my blood not as rich as yours?  Go
on - push me over. Add murder to your list of crimes.
Suddenly all the energy seems to have gone out of
Igraine - and she lets Morgause regain her footing.
IGRAINE
There are no crimes,
Morgause. There is no ambition.  Would
that Viviane and Merlin had never taken it into their heads to make me their
plaything.
She walks over to a turret on the far side of the
battlements and gazes out over the sea.
IGRAINE
Hear me, Morgause, and
you too, my daughter.  I have not
lain with Uther Pendragon, nor have I betrayed my husband Gorlois. 
While we were in Londinium I spoke long with Pendragon, and know he is my
soul's mate, and while we spoke Duke Gorlois came upon us and thought the worst,
as is his nature.  But my soul is
clean, and you must know that.
MORGAINE
(taking
her hand)
I know it, Mother.  And I love you.
IGRAINE
(Gently,
to Morgause)
Take my hand too,
sister. Let not this stand between us.
A beat - and then Morgause obeys.
IGRAINE



We
three are alone in a cold world, and we must cling to one another.  Come, put your arms around me. 
The darkness is deep now; it will grow deeper yet.
