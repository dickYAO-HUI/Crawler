						 THE WILD WILD WEST

			FADE IN:

			CAMERA MOVES OVER the warehouse district of town.  It's 
			night.  A dog barks in the distance.  A train whistle 
			blows.  Then silence.

				  SUPER: "SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS -- 1873"

			CAMERA STOPS ON:


			EXT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

			A deserted cobblestone street leads downhill to a bleak 
			warehouse.


			INT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

			START CLOSE on a combination lock.  PULL BACK to reveal a 
			large ornate SAFE.  A safe-cracker, SLIM, is hard at work, 
			listening with a stethoscope as he spins the tumblers.

			REVEAL a tough gang of TRAIN ROBBERS.  The safe sits in 
			the back of a wagon that was used to carry it there.

			The gang's leader, LARSON, is one cold-blooded character.

			He paces, occasionally glancing out the windows.

							LARSON
					Come on, come on.  How much longer?

							SLIM
					Keep your britches on.  This is a 
					tough one.  Railroad's getting 
					tired of losing their money.


			EXT.  WAREHOUSE - UP THE STREET - NIGHT

			CLOSE ON a pair of feet scurrying along the cobblestones.  
			MOVE UP to reveal WALTERS, a pudgy local sheriff, WHEEZING 
			as he runs along.  He's headed for the warehouse when --

			A hand shoots out of the darkness and bodily yanks him 
			into a shadowy doorway.  He YELPS in panic, then realizes 
			he's face to face with a U.S. Marshal --

			CAPTAIN JAMES T. WEST.  From his distinctive Western attire 
			to his "Colt Single-Action Army," this guy's the real 
			thing.  He's here to catch bad guys and nothing else.  
			This is one dog you don't turn your back on.

							WALTERS
					Jesus, Marshal!  I'm like to have 
					wet myself!

			Jim is wound up, itching for action, glancing toward the 
			warehouse every few seconds.

							JIM
					Well?

							WALTERS
						(placating)
					They're coming.

							JIM
						(gritting it out)
					When are they coming?

							WALTERS
					They're rounding up a posse.  Figure 
					an hour?

							JIM
						(re the warehouse)
					In an hour they're gone!

			Jim's eyes dart everywhere.  He's going to will a solution 
			into existence.  He spots something.  An idea hatches.  
			He whips out his Colt SAA.  Then grabs Walters' pistol, 
			too.

							WALTERS
					Hey...!

							JIM
					You're not going to use it, are 
					you?

							WALTERS
					Well, come on, that's half a dozen 
					armed men...

							JIM
					Right.

			And Jim's gone.

			ANGLE - A FREIGHT WAGON

			sits at a loading dock across the way, parked on a grade, 
			the rear wheels chocked, piled high with a load of 
			supplies, barrels, etc.  Jim races over and eyeballs the 
			sloping street -- it leads straight down toward the 
			warehouse.

			He yanks out the chocks and heaves on the spokes of the 
			rear wheel.  With an ominous CREAK, the heavy wagon starts 
			to roll backward.  He moves to the front, grabs the wagon 
			tongue, tilts it back against the seat and leaps aboard.

			The wagon's iron-rimmed wheels CLANG along the cobblestones 
			as it rumbles faster and faster.  Jim stands atop the 
			load, steering the unwieldy rig by muscling the tongue 
			left and right like a ship's tiller.

			It's not easy to control -- first the wagon SCRAPES along 
			an iron fence -- SPARKS FLYING.  Then it veers the other 
			way, taking out a row of horse hitches.  But Jim wrestles 
			it back on course, straight for the warehouse doors.

			Closer.  Closer.  He gets ready to duck.


			INT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

			Slim swings the safe door open and the men start swiftly 
			transferring cash and gold bars to saddlebags.  But now 
			they hear the thunderous CLATTER of the approaching wagon.  
			Larson peers out a window in the warehouse doors.

			He staggers back, panic-stricken.

							LARSON
					What the hell...?  Look out!  LOOK 
					OUT!

			The gang scrambles back across the room.  They dive for 
			cover as the wagon EXPLODES into the warehouse, crushing 
			everything in its path, finally smashing into the wagon 
			carrying the safe.  The room is choked with dust.

			Before they can get their bearings, Jim leaps up on the 
			load of barrels, two six-guns ready.

			The men get up, slowly realizing it's just one guy.

							LARSON
					What the hell is this?

							JIM
					This?  This is where you surrender.

			Tense standoff.  Suddenly two of the men draw!  Jim FIRES 
			dropping the first before he can even get off a shot.

			Jim dives to one side to avoid the second man's shot, 
			FIRING as he goes.  It's fast, furious.

			Jim drills the second man, who spins in agony, colliding 
			with Larson and Slim.  A third man draws and fires.

			Bullets ripping into the wagon around him, Jim coolly 
			nails the fool -- leg, chest, head.  The guy drops.

			The remaining men throw up their hands.

							LARSON
					We're done!  We're done!

			Jim rises slowly, pistols poised, his eyes darting.  The 
			bad guys don't move.  They know this guy can go off at 
			any time.  But now there's a weird sound.  CREAKING and 
			CRACKING from below.  Just as Jim glances down --

			The floor collapses beneath the weight of the safe and 
			the wagons!  With a ROAR, it all plummets into the 
			basement!


			INT.  WAREHOUSE LOWER FLOOR - NIGHT

			Jim lies dazed in the wagon, its wheels pancaked under 
			it.  The massive safe has just missed crushing him.  A 
			few barrels have broken open under him.  In the darkness 
			whatever has spilled out feels like sand.  Jim gets to 
			his knees, realizing -- he's lost his guns in the stuff.  
			Then he notices the labels on the barrels -- "TITAN 
			BLASTING POWDER."  He's knee-deep in explosives.  As he 
			frantically digs in the powder, he hears from above:

							LARSON (O.S.)
					Get him!  Shoot the bastard!

			The gang appears above him at the jagged hole, GUNS 
			COCKING.  Jim dives aside into the darkness!

			Hidden in the shadows, he sneaks along the wall, looking 
			for a way out.  He spots a stairway leading up.  He heads 
			for it, but

			light hits him as the stairway door opens above.  There 
			stands Slim, his gun drawn.  He grins:

							SLIM
					Aww, you lost your shooters.

			Slim gleefully cocks his gun, but Jim reaches into his 
			lapel, pulling out a deadly throwing knife.  SWISH!  Slim 
			is pinned to the wall by his ear.  He screams in agony.

			More FOOTSTEPS above.  In seconds the other men will be 
			upon him.  Jim backs up, looking around, trapped.

			Larson and his men clatter down the stairs.  They fan 
			out, warily looking for their dangerous prey.  But there's 
			no sign of him.  Suddenly, with a HISS, a brilliant light 
			flares up.  The men spin, aiming their guns.  Oh shit!  
			It's a flaming trail of blasting powder -- racing toward 
			the jumble of broken powder kegs!

			The horrified gunmen YELL in panic as they scramble over 
			themselves trying to get away.  They don't make it.


			EXT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

			We hear the men SCREAMING.  Then the whole place goes up 
			in a HUGE EXPLOSION.

			The debris rains down all over the street.  As the smoke 
			clears, a stunned, awestruck Sheriff Walters peeks out 
			from his hiding place, then edges cautiously up to the 
			smoldering crater.


			ANGLE - CRATER

			Down in the ruins nothing is recognizable except -- the 
			scorched safe, now lying on its side.  Its door THUDS 
			open.  And out rises dazed Jim.  He looks up at Walters.

							JIM
					See?  Stand up to 'em and they go 
					all to pieces.

			We hear the CLINK of wine glasses and a MOZART QUARTET 
			and

													CUT TO:


			INT.  MANSION - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

			SUPER: "NEW YORK CITY"

			This lavishly decorated room is filled with upper-crust 
			SOCIETY PEOPLE having their version of a good time.

			Among them is an elegant and dashing Frenchman, the BARON.  
			He wears pince-nez glasses above a mustache and full beard.  
			He walks with a pronounced stiff-legged limp.  At the 
			moment he's sniffing an inferior wine and scowling at a 
			really bad painting.  He winces as a hefty Margaret Dumont 
			type society MATRON slinks flirtatiously up behind him.

							MATRON
					Oh Baron, so here's where you've 
					been hiding.  All the ladies are 
					asking about you, but I told them 
					you are mine tonight!
						(re the painting)
					Ah, the Baron appreciates a fine 
					painting, n'est-ce-pas?

			The Baron tries to overlook her godawful French and 
			responds indulgently in a Pepe le Pew FRENCH ACCENT:

							BARON
					In-croy-able.

							MATRON
						(translating)
					In-croy-able...?  Incredible, yes?

							BARON
					Incredible, yes, that this charlatan 
					has found anyone to buy these 
					paintings.  Ah, but perhaps the 
					poor man is, how you say, paralyzed 
					and is forced to hold the paint 
					brush in his mouth, non?

			The lady is speechless.  The Baron notices a man urgently 
			beckoning to him from across the room.  It is POMEROY, a 
			shifty-eyed business tycoon

							BARON
					Ah!  I am desolate to be pulled 
					from your large presence!  But I 
					believe I am required... uh, you 
					would say "yonder."

			And he hurries away from the overheated, disappointed 
			dame.


			INT.  MANSION - LIBRARY - NIGHT

			Pomeroy ushers the Baron and three other distinguished 
			GENTLEMEN into the richly appointed library.  Suddenly 
			serious, he locks the door and crosses to a bookshelf.

							POMEROY
					Gentlemen, down to the real business 
					of the evening.  Allow me to present 
					our...
						(American accent)
					... piece de resistance.
						(to the Baron)
					Is that how you parlay it, Baron?

			The Baron smiles graciously and corrects his French:

							BARON
					Piece de resistance, Monsieur.

							POMEROY
					Uh... yes...

			Pomeroy swings open a section of bookshelf revealing a 
			hidden compartment.  And there stands -- a gleaming brass, 
			carriage-mounted Gatling gun.  Pomeroy proudly rolls it 
			into the room.  The men are impressed.

							POMEROY
					Dr. Gatling's latest model.  Fires 
					eighty rounds without reloading.

							GENTLEMAN
					How many of these do you have, 
					sir?

			Pomeroy smiles as he moves to a side table and opens a 
			box of expensive cigars.

							POMEROY
					Sixteen.  All of them freshly, 
					shall we say, "removed" from a 
					poorly guarded local armory.  And 
					available to you at a very 
					reasonable price.  Cigars, 
					gentlemen?

			The three gentlemen gather round, taking cigars.

			Unseen by them, the Baron has moved away and is pulling 
			something strange out of his pants leg -- a loaded magazine 
			for the Gatling gun.

							GENTLEMAN
					Mighty effective, I'd imagine, for 
					keeping the damn regulators out of 
					my business.  Let's talk money.

			Pomeroy smiles greedily and toasts them:

							POMEROY
					My kind of music.

			KER-KLATCH.  They all turn at the sound.  The Baron is 
			sliding the magazine into the Gatling gun.

							POMEROY
						(nervously)
					Uh... Baron, sir, what...? Uh...  
					ne touchez la...

			To their horror, the smiling Baron starts calmly cranking 
			away -- BLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAM!!!

			Pomeroy and his terrified guests hit the floor.  But the 
			Baron aims just above them, strafing the oak-paneled wall.

			The Baron pauses.  He now aims the smoking gun barrels at 
			the men as they poke their startled faces up from behind 
			the furniture.

			Then he notices another big, awful painting by the same 
			no-talent painter.  He swivels the big gun --

			BLAMBLAMBLAM! -- and decimates it.  He sighs, satisfied:

							BARON
					Art lovers will thank me.

			He swings the gun back onto the baffled men.  Pomeroy's 
			enraged client turns to him.

							GENTLEMAN
					Who is this madman?!

							POMEROY
					The... the Baron!  He said he came 
					with you.

							GENTLEMAN
					He most certainly did not!

							POMEROY
					Well, then who the hell...?!

			They stop in mid-argument, wide-eyed as they see --

			The Baron removing his fake mustache and beard.  He drops 
			his pince-nez, along with his French accent.  He is in 
			fact:

							ARTEMUS
					Artemus Gordon, U.S. Marshal.  And 
					you, my good sir, are under arrest 
					for possession of stolen Government 
					property...

			Artemus takes a sip of wine, wincing at the flavor.

							ARTEMUS
					...And for serving a decidedly 
					inferior Pouilly-Fuisse.


			EXT.  THE WHITE HOUSE - ESTABLISH - DAY

			It looks pretty much the same except for the dirt driveway 
			and the herd of sheep tending the lawn.


			INT.  WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY

			The doors fly open and in marches PRESIDENT ULYSSES S. 
			GRANT, a cigar in his teeth, followed by COLONEL RICHARDS, 
			a veteran lawman, and Grant's diffident assistant PANGBORN.

							GRANT
					Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel.  
					Has another scientist been kidnapped 
					or not?

							RICHARDS
						(apologetic)
					Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, 
					but with just a little more time, 
					sir, I can assure you a breakthrough 
					on this case...

			Grant marches to his desk, flinging his spent cigar into 
			an ashtray.

							GRANT
					Listen, in two days I'm embarking 
					on a tour of the western 
					territories.  And I want to know 
					at least one problem is being 
					handled competently in my absence.

							RICHARDS
					Of course, sir, that's why I've 
					assigned a new man.  And he's no 
					ordinary Marshal.  He's quite 
					sophisticated.  Three college 
					degrees.  A master of disguise.  
					Speaks French...

							GRANT
						(unimpressed)
					French?

							RICHARDS
					Yes sir.

							GRANT
					French?  Damn it, I want my own 
					man on this case.  Somebody I trust.  
					Somebody who doesn't mind breaking 
					up the furniture!

			CRASH!  They HEAR a SCUFFLE outside the door.  The 
			President smiles.  He glances at his watch.

							GRANT
					Sounds like him now.

			The doors fly open.  TWO GUARDS are tossed onto the carpet.  
			Jim stands over them, straightening his gun-belt.

							JIM
					Sorry, sir.  What's this about no 
					guns in the White House?

			Grant walks over to greet him.

							GRANT
					Captain West...

			They shake hands warmly.

							JIM
					Mr. President, good to see you 
					again, sir.
						(re the guards)
					Sorry about all that.

							GRANT
						(to the guards)
					That'll be all, boys.

			The guards get up and leave.  Jim nods to them:

							JIM
					Good work.  Really.

							GRANT
					This is Colonel Richards.

							JIM
					Nice to finally meet you, sir.

			Jim shakes hands with a baffled Richards who turns 
			helplessly to Grant and blusters:

							RICHARDS
					Why surely, Mr. President, there 
					must be some mistake.  I mean...

							GRANT
					A mistake?  To assign this case to 
					the man who blew up all the bridges 
					on the Chattanooga River and single-
					handedly trapped Jackson's entire 
					cavalry?  How is that a mistake?

			Richards stews but he knows when to shut up.  Grant turns 
			to Jim and gestures to a pile of newspapers on his desk.

							GRANT
					Here's the problem, James.  Somebody 
					has been abducting this country's 
					best scientists.
						(pointedly to Richards)
					That's eight in the last three 
					years.  It's becoming a national 
					scandal... and God knows I've had 
					enough of those.

			Grant goes to get another cigar, but his humidor is empty.  
			He starts searching the room for a cigar during:

							JIM
					Eight?  Is there some connection?  
					Did they know each other?

							RICHARDS
					No.  No connection at all.  Other 
					than the fact that each one was a 
					top man in his field.  A chemist, 
					an expert on electricity...

							PANGBORN
					... a railroad engineer, a 
					ballistics expert...

							GRANT
					Etcetera, etcetera.  The terrible 
					thing of it is they've all turned 
					up dead a number of months later.  
					Brutally murdered.
						(re the newspapers)
					And I have little doubt the same 
					fate awaits this last poor fellow.

			He opens another humidor -- damn, it's empty.

							JIM
					But what would anyone have to gain 
					from all this...?  Unless it were 
					a foreign power.

							GRANT
					Exactly.  Any number of nations 
					would love to cripple our scientific 
					growth.  And what better way to 
					tip the scales in their favor than 
					by killing off the greatest minds 
					this country has produced.

			He is now looking from one ashtray to another.

							GRANT
					We find ourselves at the dawn of 
					the Golden Age of Science.  And it 
					is the God-given destiny of this 
					glorious nation to carry the torch 
					that lights the way!

							JIM
						(impressed)
					Nicely said, sir.

							GRANT
						(tossing it off)
					Part of some speech they wrote for 
					this trip I'm taking.

			Grant fishes an unappealing half-smoked cigar from an 
			ashtray, then catches himself:

							GRANT
					Goddamnit!  What am I doing?
						(to Pangborn)
					What's happened to all my cigars?
						(to Jim)
					Colonel Richards here has had a 
					dozen agents on these cases for 
					over a year.  No arrests, no leads, 
					no clues...

							JIM
					And?

							GRANT
					And now the job's yours.

			Grant smiles for the first time.

							GRANT
					You start in the morning.  Pangborn 
					here will make all the 
					arrangements... as soon as he brings 
					a goddamned cigar for the President 
					of the goddamned United States!

			As Pangborn scurries out, we hear a STEAM WHISTLE BLOWING 
			and we:

													CUT TO:


			EXT.  THE C STREET TRAIN STATION - PLATFORM - DAY

			The train platform bustles with TRAVELERS and PORTERS.  
			Jim moves through it all, his saddlebags over his shoulder.  
			He stops short at the amazing sight of a strange vehicle -- 
			a heavy-duty bicycle outfitted with an early, LOUDLY 
			ROARING, smoke-belching internal combustion engine.  The 
			Harley Hog of its day -- the NITRO-CYCLE.

			Its high-strung INVENTOR shouts at his ASSISTANT who is 
			trying to drive the vehicle up a ramp onto a freight car.

							INVENTOR
					Gently, gently.  It's not a horse, 
					you idiot!

			Jim gazes at the amazing contraption but keeps moving 
			toward --

			ANGLE - STEAM ENGINE NUMBER FOUR

			A gleaming, steaming, new state-of-the-art steam engine 
			waits at the platform.

			Jim eyes the train.  Can this be the one?  It's just an 
			engine, tender car and two custom private passenger cars.  
			He pulls out his orders to double-check.

			Up in the cab is the engineer, DOYLE, a tough little 
			Irishman whose chaw of tobacco gives him the look of a 
			chipmunk in a derby hat.  Jim calls to him:

							JIM
					I'm looking for a train.  Supposed 
					to be on track three.  Did it leave 
					already?

			Doyle spits out a stream of tobacco juice and smiles:

							DOYLE
					Yes sir and no sir.  Yes sir if 
					you're not who I think you are.  
					And no sir if you are.

			Jim cuts to the chase:

							JIM
					Look, I'm Captain James West...

							DOYLE
					Well, Captain, then the answer is 
					your train is still here.

			Jim eyes the train.  It doesn't look long enough.

							DOYLE
					Your private train, sir.

							JIM
					Private train?

							DOYLE
						(confidentially)
					That would be correct.  Orders 
					from the President himself.  Trans-
					portation at your beck and call.  
					No delays.
						(shaking his head)
					Although, the government's 
					generosity takes me a tad by 
					surprise, as well.

			He hops down, doffs his derby, and pumps Jim's hand:

							DOYLE
					Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the 
					Connemara Doyles.  And there's not 
					a man riding the rails who holds a 
					candle to meself.  That having 
					been said, sir, you're five minutes 
					late so let's be on our way!  Your 
					friend's already aboard.

							JIM
					My friend?


			EXT.  THE WANDERER - PARLOUR CAR - OBSERVATION DECK - DAY

			Jim reaches the end of the train and spots a plaque affixed 
			to the ornate railing: "The Wanderer."  Not a bad name.

			But as he climbs the steps he hears -- VIOLIN MUSIC?  
			It's coming from inside.  He swings the door open 
			curiously.


			INT.  THE WANDERER - PARLOUR CAR - DAY

			Jim stands in the doorway, impressed at the sight of the 
			richly furnished interior -- a Victorian parlour on wheels.

			Half-unpacked crates and steamer trunks are scattered 
			about.  Incongruously, there's a work table in one corner 
			cluttered with tools and lab equipment.

			The VIOLIN MUSIC continues and now, out of the narrow 
			passage at the head of the car, steps Artemus -- playing 
			the violin, and not too badly.  Artemus spots Jim but is 
			lost in the music:

							ARTEMUS
					Just three more measures...

			Finishing with a flourish, he comes back to earth, smiling.

							ARTEMUS
					J. S. Bach.

							JIM
					Jim West.

							ARTEMUS
					Artemus Gordon.
						(off Jim's confused look)
					Bach, he's the composer.

							JIM
					I don't mind him, but who the hell 
					are you... my valet or something?

							ARTEMUS
					Valet?  You jest of course.  I am 
					a U.S. Marshal.

							JIM
					Funny.  So am I.

							ARTEMUS
					Congratulations.  Unfortunately, 
					my train is about to leave, and I 
					really must insist you disembark.

							JIM
					Your train?  Listen, friend, you're 
					obviously lost.
						(pulling out his orders)
					... I've got orders here to take 
					possession of this train and to 
					investigate a certain crime.

							ARTEMUS
						(pulls out his orders)
					Interesting.  Mine say the same 
					thing, and they don't mention you, 
					not even as a valet, although we 
					could talk...

			Jim takes a glance at Artemus' orders and thrusts them 
			back.

							JIM
					Just another bureaucratic foul-up.  
					You know how these pencil-pushers 
					are.  So, why don't you just run 
					on back and explain what happened?

							ARTEMUS
					Funny, I was just thinking you 
					should do the same.  Since I am 
					already in residence, and am 
					obviously the man for the job, 
					it's been grand making your 
					acquaintance, sir.  And best of 
					luck in all your future endeavors.

			Artemus steps to the rear door and swings it open for Jim 
			to leave.  Jim can't believe this dude's moxie.

							JIM
					You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle 
					boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his 
					way into my assignment.

							ARTEMUS
					If you're implying our little 
					imbroglio has reached an impasse 
					whose only resolution can be found 
					in a more primitive fashion, then 
					I for one am fully prepared to do 
					so... al fresco.

			And with that, Artemus throws open the door, gesturing 
			outside.

							JIM
					Suits me fine.  I'm just glad you 
					got to the end of that sentence.

			Jim eagerly steps out, ready to take this joker.  Artemus 
			pauses by the door to talk into the end of a speaking 
			tube:

							ARTEMUS
					Mr. Doyle.  We're ready.  Full 
					steam ahead, if you please.


			EXT.  THE WANDERER - PARLOUR CAR - OBSERVATION DECK - DAY

			Jim steps off the car, pulling off his jacket.  He spins 
			at the sound of the TRAIN WHISTLE, and is caught off guard 
			by Artemus giving him a swift kick.

			Jim staggers back across the platform, crashing into a 
			stack of luggage and is buried under an avalanche.  As 
			the train lurches forward, Artemus calls pleasantly:

							ARTEMUS
					And it's not a fiddle, it's a 
					violin.

			Jim angrily tosses luggage aside, scrambles to his feet 
			and sprints down the crowded platform -- but he'll never 
			catch the train.

			As he slows angrily to a stop, he HEARS:

							INVENTOR (O.S.)
					Throttle, you damnable idiot!
					More throttle!

			The inventor is still browbeating his assistant as he 
			shows him how to operate the ROARING Nitro-Cycle.

							INVENTOR
					Oh, get off, you useless nitwit!  
					Let me do it!

			The inventor shoves the hapless man off the vehicle and 
			starts to climb on himself.  But Jim rushes over.

							JIM
					Excuse me.  I need this.

			And he leaps onto the machine.

							INVENTOR
					What?  Get off, sir!  This is the 
					Nitro-Cycle!  The only one of its 
					kind!

			Jim fiddles with the controls.

							JIM
					Is this how you do it?!

			Jim twists the throttle and -- VAROOOM!  Up the ramp he 
			sails!  Right into the freight car.  There's a brief pause.

			Then the Nitro-Cycle blasts back out and takes off up the 
			platform.  All the inventor can do is SCREAM:

							INVENTOR
					Unhand my machine, you brigand!!

			Jim wildly rockets along, managing just barely to steer 
			the amazingly fast machine around the startled, terrified 
			PEOPLE who gape at the incomprehensible contrivance ROARING 
			through their midst!

			Jim tests the throttle and cranks it all the way open!  
			The Nitro-Cycle does a wheelie as FLAMES jet out its 
			exhaust!

			He heads for the end of the platform -- a four foot drop!  
			He hangs on tight and goes airborne!  The Nitro-Cycle 
			slams down, gravel flying, wobbling wildly.  But he's 
			able to get it back under control.


			EXT.  RAILROAD YARD - DAY

			With his eye on the Wanderer, Jim streaks down the tracks 
			leaving a cloud of blue smoke.  The engine SCREAMS, way 
			overcranked.


			INT.  THE WANDERER - PARLOUR CAR - MOVING - DAY

			Artemus, at his lab table, works on an invention -- a 
			derringer concealed in an ornate belt buckle.  He hears 
			the peculiar ROAR of the Nitro-Cycle and glances outside.

			ANGLE - ARTEMUS' P.O.V. OUT WINDOW

			Suddenly Jim appears outside, zooming along on the 
			inexplicable contraption, keeping pace with the train!

			He shoots Artemus a look -- "You're mine, buddy!"


			EXT.  THE WANDERER - OBSERVATION DECK - DAY

			Jim's racing alongside the parlour car.  He pulls his 
			feet up onto the seat.  Then leaps across to the 
			observation deck, landing gracefully.

			The Nitro-Cycle careens off and crashes into a field.

			With a satisfied flourish, Jim yanks open the door to 
			find --

			Artemus standing there with a big smile, offering a glass 
			of Chateau Margaux '68.

							ARTEMUS
					Mr. West, I have underestimated 
					you.

			Jim, out of breath, fixes him with a cool stare.

							JIM
					A common mistake, Mr. Gordon.

			He decides to accept the peace offering.  Jim takes the 
			wine and leans close, deadly serious:

							JIM
					But don't pull that again.

							ARTEMUS
					Wouldn't dream of it.


			EXT.  EASTERN COUNTRYSIDE - THE WANDERER

			THUNDERS across the bucolic farmland.


			INT.  THE WANDERER - PARLOUR CAR - MOVING - DAY

			Jim is unpacking his few belongings.  Artemus smokes a 
			cigar as he studies the files on the dead scientists.

							ARTEMUS
					Eight scientists.  Eight different 
					fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, 
					optics, ballistics...

							JIM
					Put them all together and what do 
					we have?

							ARTEMUS
						(speculating)
					A giant... hydraulically operated 
					microscope... that explodes?
						(shrugs)
					Or maybe just someone who hates 
					scientists.

							JIM
					Then why kidnap them?  Why not 
					just kill them?

							ARTEMUS
					"Ay, there's the rub."  Take a 
					look at this file on Professor 
					Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... 
					metallurgy.

			But as Artemus hands the file to Jim -- CLICK -- a 
			concealed derringer springs out of his sleeve aimed right 
			at Jim.  Artemus, embarrassed, quickly slides it back up 
			his sleeve and apologizes.

							ARTEMUS
					Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a 
					little device of mine...

							JIM
					Wait a minute.  Now I know where 
					I've heard of you.  You're the 
					gadget guy.

							ARTEMUS
						(indignant)
					"Gadget guy?"  While I may not be 
					in a league with these unfortunate 
					geniuses, I am, sir, in my own 
					humble way, a man of science.

			Artemus proudly flings open a cabinet full of exotic 
			devices and weapons.

							ARTEMUS
					My inventions... An arsenal for 
					fighting crime.

			He pulls out a vest adorned with metal buttons.

							ARTEMUS
					Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank 
					one off, toss it, and poof!  It 
					emits a cloud of sleeping gas.

							JIM
					You need that real often?

							ARTEMUS
					Always hoping.
						(grabs another device)
					Or this...

							JIM
					No offense, but all I ever need...
						(holds up his fists)
					Are these...
						(draws his gun)
					And this.

							ARTEMUS
					Good Lord, man.  The world is 
					changing.  And mark me, it is always 
					the criminal mind that is the first 
					to exploit modern invention.  We, 
					as defenders of the right, must 
					keep pace!

							JIM
					All right, if it'll make you happy, 
					I'll try that.

							ARTEMUS
					Try what?

			Jim indicates Artemus' sleeve-gun.

							JIM
					Your little jack-in-the-box gun.
					That might be useful.

							ARTEMUS
						(hesitant)
					Well... it's the only one I have.  
					It's gotten me out of quite a few 
					tight spots...

			Then he gets an idea and hands Jim the belt buckle he was 
			working on.

							ARTEMUS
					But here!  It's yours.  My latest 
					concept.

			Jim is dubious, but takes the thing.

							ARTEMUS
					Now slap the buckle like this.

			He demonstrates.  Jim tries it -- SPROING!  A derringer 
			pops out, wiggles on its mount -- and promptly falls off, 
			CLATTERING to the floor.

							JIM
					That should put us ahead of the 
					criminals.

							ARTEMUS
					I'll work on it.


			EXT.  PROFESSOR MORTON'S LABORATORY - NIGHT

			The remote laboratory sits beside a cornfield.  A moving 
			lantern shines through the darkness carried by an old 
			WATCHMAN leading Jim and Artemus to the gate.

							WATCHMAN
					That's the place.  Professor 
					Morton's laboratory.  Ever since 
					he went missing, I've kept it locked 
					up tight.

			A single LIGHT goes on in the dark building.

							JIM
					So, who's in there now?


			INT.  PROFESSOR MORTON'S LABORATORY - NIGHT

			The door swings open and Jim and Artemus step into the 
			dimly-lit lab.  Behind a lab table covered with a jumble 
			of equipment they spot someone moving about.  Whoever he 
			is, he's MUTTERING crazily to himself.

			They draw their guns and ease around the table to find -- 
			a wild-eyed, unshaven man in filthy clothes squatting on 
			the floor.  This is PROFESSOR THADDEUS MORTON.  His shirt 
			is ripped open.  Tools are scattered around him.  He's 
			desperately trying to pry open a strange-looking metal 
			belt locked around his waist.

							ARTEMUS
					Excuse me...

			Morton looks up in terror and dives under the table.

							MORTON
					No!  No!

			He scampers on all-fours out the other side of the table, 
			heading for the door.  He runs into the watchman.

							WATCHMAN
					Professor!

							MORTON
					Help me!  Help me!  They're after 
					me again!  They're after me!

			Jim and Artemus glance at each other -- this is the 
			Professor?

							JIM
					Professor Morton.  We're here to 
					help you.  We're Federal agents.

							WATCHMAN
					The God's truth, Professor.

			The wild-eyed Professor still isn't sure.

							MORTON
					Badges!  Badges!

			Jim and Artemus show him their badges.  He calms a little 
			but keeps looking around nervously.

							MORTON
					I... I got away from them.  I got 
					away.  They didn't expect it, but 
					I did.

							JIM
					Who'd you get away from?

							MORTON
					I don't know.  No names.  No names.  
					They beat me.  I had no choice.  I 
					gave them what they wanted.

							ARTEMUS
					What was that?

							MORTON
					My research.  My formula for a 
					stronger metal.  Stronger and 
					lighter.  Twelve years and they 
					stole it from me!  They said they'd 
					let me go.  But no.  They were 
					going to kill me like all the 
					others!

			Jim grabs the hysterical scientist.

							JIM
					Calm down, Professor.  You're safe 
					with us.

			Professor Morton yanks away.

							MORTON
					No.  No, I'm not!

			He frantically claws at the metal belt around his waist.

							MORTON
					Got to remove this belt!  That's 
					how they'll get me!  Help me!

							JIM
					Why?  What is that?

			But the Professor just keeps wildly struggling.

							ARTEMUS
					Hold still.  Let me look at it.

			The Professor freezes, but only because he HEARS something.  
			His panicked eyes go even wider.  Then we HEAR it -- a 
			HIGH-PITCHED OSCILLATING WHINING NOISE coming closer.

							MORTON
					Oh God!!  The thing!

			SMASH!!  The window beside them shatters and into the lab 
			flies a bizarre object -- like a wide-winged boomerang, 
			sleek and black, it spins through the air.  It arcs high, 
			then banks to one side and streaks with a pulsing, ear-
			splitting SCREECH straight at Dr. Morton -- homing-in on 
			the metal belt!

							MORTON
					NO!  GOTTA GET AWAY!

			He bolts out the door.


			EXT.  PROFESSOR MORTON'S LABORATORY - NIGHT

			The Professor scrambles out, the spinning SCREECHING object 
			following him like a bird of prey!  Jim and Artemus sprint 
			after him.

			The Professor glances back.  The thing is almost on top 
			of him.  He hits the dirt.  It blasts overhead, barely 
			missing him, then turns and SHRIEKS back toward him.  He 
			jumps up, dashing for a tall stand of corn.


			EXT.  CORNFIELD - NIGHT

			The desperate Professor dashes along between rows of corn.

			The flying device whips along behind him, slicing the 
			tops off cornstalks as it zeros-in on its doomed target.

			CLANK!  The vicious thing slams into the Professor's metal 
			belt and locks onto it!  He SCREAMS and -- KABOOOM!  An 
			explosion lights up the night.

			ANGLE - JIM AND ARTEMUS

			as they rush to the smoldering crater in the cornfield, 
			staring in bewildered horror.  Gun drawn, Jim squints 
			into the darkness for any sign of a perpetrator -- nothing.

			Frustrated, he turns back to find Artemus down on his 
			hands and knees beside the crater.  Must be sick to his 
			stomach.

							JIM
					Yeah, this kind of thing used to 
					make me sick, too.

			But Artemus is fine.  He's searching the ground.  In a 
			moment he spots something and picks it up.

							ARTEMUS
					Aha!

							JIM
					Aha?

							ARTEMUS
					Yes, aha.  A brass screw.

							JIM
					Is this leading somewhere?

							ARTEMUS
						(trying to be patient)
					Potentially.  This is the 
					painstaking process of piecing 
					together clues.  The cornerstone 
					of the modern science of 
					criminology.  Piece by piece we 
					reconstruct the identity of the 
					villain.

							JIM
					Starting with a screw?

							ARTEMUS
						(annoyed)
					Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, 
					it's not fair of me to expect 
					someone who's spent his life 
					wrangling with Western desperadoes 
					to fully appreciate what I'm doing 
					here, but...

							JIM
					What about the explosive?

			Artemus doesn't get it.  Jim picks up a still-smoldering 
			shard of the flying bomb.  He sniffs it.

							JIM
					It's not black powder... It's one 
					of those new nitro-celluloses.  
					Should be easy to find out who 
					made it.

			Jim looks innocently at impressed Artemus.

							JIM
					I think that beats a screw.

			Artemus has to agree but he's not going to say it.


			EXT.  ROBERT & ROSS EXPLOSIVES - DAY

			HIGH ANGLE of a bare field pock-marked with craters.  
			KABOOM!!  An explosion blows another hole.  CAMERA MOVES 
			DOWN to a sign on the roof of a small office -- "Robert & 
			Ross Explosives."  CONTINUE DOWN to a window where we 
			see:


			INT.  ROBERT & ROSS EXPLOSIVES - OFFICE - DAY

			Jim and Artemus talk with the company's quirky explosives 
			expert, NORBERT.  Throughout the scene test EXPLOSIONS 
			from outside jolt the room.  Each time, Jim and Artemus 
			flinch.  But Norbert is oblivious.  Jim hands him the 
			fragment of the flying bomb.

							NORBERT
					Murder weapon you say...?

							JIM
					That's right.  We've been to every 
					powder maker between here and 
					Philadelphia.  Nobody knows what 
					the stuff is.

			Norbert sniffs the residue of the powder, fingers it.

							NORBERT
					Should've come to me first.  No 
					question.  Special batch.  Custom 
					order.  I remember it.

			KABLAM!  The building shakes.  Norbert matter-of-factly 
			catches a falling book.

							JIM
					Do you remember who ordered it?

							NORBERT
					Nope.  Don't have to.  Keep records 
					of everything.

			He rolls his chair over to a desk piled impossibly high 
			with papers.  Jim and Artemus glance at each other -- 
			this will take forever.  But Norbert just stares at the 
			stack like a cat watching a bird and suddenly snatches 
			out the exact piece of paper.

							NORBERT
						(reads)
					Lansbury Rock and Gravel... of New 
					Orleans, Louisiana.  A limestone 
					quarry.  Funny, don't know why 
					they'd be blowing people up.

			And the building is rocked by another mighty BLAST.


			EXT.  FARMLAND - THE WANDERER - DAY

			The Wanderer barrels along, heading south.


			EXT.  NEW ORLEANS - ST. CHARLES AVENUE - NIGHT

			Gas lamps light the cobblestone streets in the well-to-do 
			Garden District of New Orleans.  Spanish moss drapes the 
			trees.  Jim and Artemus ride along in a carriage, Doyle 
			at the reins.  They stop at a tall, ornate iron gate.

							DOYLE
					Forty-three St. Charles Avenue?

			They look off, confused.  This is no mining operation.  
			This is --

			ANGLE - MIGUELITO'S MANSION

			Elegant in a weird, overstated way.  The theme park version 
			of itself.  And, at the moment, a line of fancy broughams 
			and cabriolets parade through the carriage entrance as 
			turbaned FOOTMEN rush to help PARTY GUESTS descend.  
			Classical MUSIC wafts toward us.

			BACK TO SCENE

			Baffled Jim and Artemus recheck the address.

							ARTEMUS
					Limestone quarry?

							JIM
						(shrugs)
					Limestone quarry, Southern mansion.  
					Easy to get them mixed up... I say 
					we invite ourselves to the party.

							ARTEMUS
					Absolutely.  Have to look for 
					clues... even if it means dancing 
					with beautiful women.

			Artemus pulls a leather case from his jacket.  It's a 
			make-up kit complete with mustaches, eyeglasses, etc.

							ARTEMUS
					Doyle, once around the park.  I 
					need a moment to prepare.

							JIM
					Prepare what?

							ARTEMUS
					My disguise.  And here...

			As the carriage moves off, Artemus hands Jim the belt 
			with the concealed derringer.

							ARTEMUS
						(re Jim's sidearm)
					One doesn't attend these soirees 
					packing a forty-four.
						(off Jim's dubious look)
					Don't worry.  I fixed it.


			EXT.  MIGUELITO'S MANSION - CARRIAGE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

			Doyle pulls up to the entrance.  The turbaned footmen 
			rush to open the carriage doors.  Jim steps down.  No six-
			gun, but wearing the concealed belt buckle derringer.

			Artemus follows.  Disguised with a trim waxed mustache 
			and a long wig, he wraps a flamboyant scarf around his 
			neck.  Holding a silver-handled walking stick, he tips 
			his hat at a rakish angle and speaks with an affected 
			ENGLISH ACCENT:

							ARTEMUS
					Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.

							JIM
					Call me that again, and you're 
					going to find a boot where it 
					doesn't belong.

							ARTEMUS
						(explaining)
					Jim, people talk to foreigners, 
					speak more openly, especially to 
					those as famous as I, Chauncey 
					McNeil Armstrong, English lyric 
					poet.

			Jim resigns himself to his fate.  As they head for the 
			entrance, he unhappily adjusts his belt buckle.

							JIM
					Does this thing shoot real bullets?


			INT.  MIGUELITO'S MANSION - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

			Jim and Artemus step into the huge entrance hall and survey 
			the unusual scene.  Not your average society bash.  The 
			well-heeled CROWD is a bit eccentric with a Bohemian bent.  
			Whites, blacks, mulattos, Creoles and Cajuns mingle.  
			Liberated LADIES smoke cigarettes.  A MAN saunters past 
			with a monkey perched on his shoulder.

			SERVANTS wearing fezzes offer champagne.  Somewhere a 
			STRING QUARTET plays Mozart.

			Suddenly a very large hand reaches down to Jim and Artemus.  
			They look up into the ominous face of -- VOLTAIRE, at 
			nearly eight-feet tall he's the world's biggest butler.  
			They smile tensely, hand him their hats and coats, and 
			move off into the crowd.

							JIM
					That's a lot of butler.

							ARTEMUS
					Quite.  Come, let's mingle.

							JIM
					Do your own mingling.  I'm not 
					hanging around with some dandy 
					named Chauncey.

			And Jim swerves away.  Artemus shrugs:

							ARTEMUS
					It's lonely being a poet.

			He steps up to a boisterous GENTLEMAN, introducing himself:

							ARTEMUS
					Good evening, sir.  Chauncey McNeil 
					Armstrong.

			The gentleman points off:

							GENTLEMAN
					Why, yes.  Mr. Armstrong I believe 
					is on the veranda regaling the 
					ladies with some of his verse.  
					But I didn't get your name, sir.

			Oops.  Artemus needs a new identity fast.


			INT.  GRAND SALON - NIGHT

			Jim strolls along, nodding pleasantly to the guests.  He 
			pauses to admire a large painting -- Rembrandt's "David 
			Slaying Goliath."  Surprisingly the painting changes into 
			Jacques Louis David's portrait of "The Emperor Napoleon." 
			(It's some kind of lantern-slide rear-projection system.)  
			It's then he notices the mansion features a variety of 
			quirky inventions.  But even as he studies the place, 
			he's being studied as well.

			We see her face through the crowd -- CASSANDRA THOMPSON, 
			a stunning Southern beauty whose seductive charms mask a 
			single-minded toughness.

			Her eyes on the good-looking stranger across the room, 
			she listens with only feigned interest to the boring 
			chatter of the people around her.

			Jim continues through the room when, from behind him:

							CASSANDRA
					Taittinger?

			He turns to her.  This weird party has just gotten a lot 
			more interesting.  She offers him a glass of champagne.

							JIM
					Thank you, ma'am, but I never touch 
					anything I can't pronounce.

			She smiles the kind of smile that makes a man forget his 
			name.

							CASSANDRA
					I'm Miss Thompson... Cassandra 
					Thompson.  Can you pronounce that?

			Jim's surprised by her forwardness, but he rolls with it:

							JIM
					Possibly.  With some practice.

			They stare at one another for a moment too long, then:

							JIM
					My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler.  
					Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

							CASSANDRA
					I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. 
					Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who 
					doesn't believe men are much more 
					than a complete waste of time.  
					But after spying you across the 
					room, I'm tempted to suspend my 
					disbelief, at least for the evening.

							JIM
					You know, ma'am, you remind me of 
					a pearl-handled pistol I once owned.  
					A beautiful thing to look at, but 
					too hot to handle.

							CASSANDRA
					I don't recollect ever being 
					compared to a pistol before.

			Shall I take that as a compliment?

							JIM
					Please do.  I'm a man who 
					appreciates a good firearm.

							CASSANDRA
					Really?

							JIM
					Well, where I come from it kind of 
					goes with the territory.
						(off her quizzical look)
					Texas.

							CASSANDRA
						(seductively)
					My... the wild west.

			Jim studies her and smiles charmingly:

							JIM
					You don't know how wild.

			ANGLE - A HAND

			stealthily snatches a gold pen from the pocket of a PASSING 
			GUEST.  REVEAL the pickpocket is Artemus who has abandoned 
			the Chauncey disguise.  He's ditched the wig, grown a 
			goatee, and grayed his hair.

			He glides over to a cute MAID, setting the purloined pen 
			on her tray, speaking in a seductive ITALIAN ACCENT:

							ARTEMUS
					Please, Signora, I have brought 
					this fine gold pen all the way 
					from Milano.  A little surprise 
					for my gracious host.  But, silly 
					me, I am too embarrassed to give 
					it to him.  So, if you would only, 
					for me, put it on his desk in his 
					private office, wherever that might 
					be, then I, Giuseppe Verdi, am 
					your faithful servant.

			The infatuated maid smiles, hurrying off with the "gift."

			ANGLE - JIM AND CASSANDRA

			still moving through the party.

							CASSANDRA
					Well, sir, you are proving to be 
					one of my more interesting guests.

							JIM
					Your guests, ma'am?

							CASSANDRA
					Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's 
					social secretary.  I handle his 
					correspondence, send out the 
					invitations, you know.

			Jim tries not to look worried, but she sees through him.

							CASSANDRA
					Oh, don't worry.  I've already 
					overlooked the fact your name's 
					not actually on our guest list.

							JIM
					Well, I owe you one, don't I?

							CASSANDRA
					You most certainly do.

			Just then the room resounds with a TRUMPET FANFARE.

			ANGLE - TWO UNIFORMED TRUMPETERS

			playing a fanfare as Voltaire grandly swings open a set 
			of double-doors.

			CASSANDRA ESCORTS JIM OVER:

							CASSANDRA
					Come, you're in for a treat.

			A mysterious woman, ANTOINETTE, steps forward to announce:

							ANTOINETTE
					Ladies and gentleman...  A man of 
					science, invention, and great 
					genius.  Your host, Dr. Miguelito 
					Loveless!

			ANGLE - THROUGH THE DOORS

			Marching toward us, like a king making a entrance, comes 
			a tall, elegant gentleman, a glass of wine in his hand.

			The party guests APPLAUD, delighted at the sight.

							GUESTS
					Such a sense of humor... What an 
					entrance...  Brilliant!

			Then, strangely, just as he's about to come through the 
			doors, in from the side steps a little man -- three and a 
			half feet tall, identically dressed and also holding a 
			glass of wine.  We realize we've been looking at his 
			elongated reflection in a warped funhouse mirror.  This 
			is DR. MIGUELITO LOVELESS, whose genius, refinement and 
			towering ego more than compensate for his lack of physical 
			stature.

			He takes a bow.  The guests all APPLAUD.  Jim doesn't 
			know what to make of all this.  Miguelito greets his guests 
			as Cassandra escorts Jim over to him.

							CASSANDRA
					Dr. Loveless, allow me to introduce 
					Mr. Tyler... from Texas.

			They shake hands.  Miguelito scans Jim with a studied 
			eye, then smiles slyly at Cassandra.

							MIGUELITO
					A new friend?

							CASSANDRA
					We'll see.

							JIM
					A pleasure, Dr. Loveless.  You're 
					obviously a man of many talents.

			Miguelito eyes him with apparent suspicion.

							MIGUELITO
					Yes, and among them the facility 
					for seeing straight through a 
					person.  Indeed, to know their 
					secret thoughts.  For example, I 
					can tell what you're thinking right 
					now...

			Jim tenses, wondering if the little man is on to him.

							MIGUELITO
					You're thinking... "he's really 
					short!"

			A tense moment.  Then Miguelito bursts into laughter.

			Cassandra and the guests join in.  Jim smiles.

							JIM
					I admire a man with a sense of 
					humor.

							MIGUELITO
					When you're three and a half feet 
					tall, sir, life turns you into a 
					comedian whether you like it or 
					not.... Come with me, won't you?

			Miguelito leads Jim and Cassandra toward the doors to the 
			veranda.  Jim is surprised when a well-muscled brute, 
			BRUNO, falls into protective step right behind our host.  
			Jim glances back at the lug and smiles sweetly.  Miguelito 
			shouts off:

							MIGUELITO
					More Mozart, please!

			Another Mozart QUARTET instantly fills the air.  But we 
			now see it's coming from an amazing contraption -- an 
			automated string quartet machine.


			EXT.  MIGUELITO'S MANSION - VERANDA - NIGHT

			Miguelito, with Bruno still shadowing him, leads Jim and 
			Cassandra out onto the veranda, crowded with more guests.

							JIM
					I must compliment you on Miss 
					Thompson... an exceptionally 
					charming assistant.

							MIGUELITO
					Thank you.  I confess to a 
					preoccupation with acquiring 
					precisely that which the world 
					says I cannot have.

			The veranda overlooks a pond surrounded by acres of 
			beautifully tailored gardens.  Party lanterns hang 
			everywhere, lighting the whole area brilliantly.

			As they walk, Miguelito seems to be getting taller.  He's 
			actually walking up a ramp onto a platform.  Voltaire 
			steps over and silently hands him a double-barrel shotgun.  
			Miguelito takes a deep breath and:

							MIGUELITO
					PULL!

			We see two SERVANTS standing by two unusual devices -- 
			all springs and levers.  One of them pulls a lever --

			And a glass ball, sparkling in the light of a hundred 
			lanterns, is launched high into the night sky.  Miguelito 
			snaps the shotgun up and FIRES, blowing the ball into a 
			million scintillating shards that splash melodically into 
			the pond.

			OOHS and AHHHS and APPLAUSE.  Miguelito turns to a dapper 
			MALE GUEST and gestures to another shotgun being held by 
			Voltaire:

							MIGUELITO
					Be my guest.

			The man's FRIENDS goad him on.  He embarrassedly takes 
			the gun and assumes the shooting position.

			Another glass ball is launched.  He shoots.  He misses.  
			His friends LAUGH.  He hands back the gun.  Voltaire 
			reloads it.  Miguelito smiles pleased and looks around.

							MIGUELITO
					Anyone?

							CASSANDRA
					Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a 
					certain skill at handling firearms.

							MIGUELITO
					Wonderful!  Our new friend from 
					the wild west.  Please...

			Jim steps up and takes the shotgun, expertly testing its 
			balance.  He nods to the trapmen.  A ball is launched.  
			POW.  It's history.

			More APPLAUSE.  Miguelito honors the shot with a slight 
			nod.  Jim hands back the gun to Voltaire.

			Miguelito raises two fingers to the trapmen.  They nod, 
			and launch two balls simultaneously.  POW!  POW!  He 
			expertly blows them both out of the sky.  Big APPLAUSE.

			All eyes shift to Jim as Voltaire again offers the gun, a 
			clear challenge.  Jim takes it, looking Miguelito right 
			in the eye.  Then he turns to the trapmen.

			Two fingers.  Two balls.  Two shots.  Score tied.  Even 
			bigger APPLAUSE!

			Miguelito's impressed.

							MIGUELITO
					Very good, sir!  I think my guest 
					might be a sharpshooter by trade.

							JIM
					No, sir... just a businessman.

							MIGUELITO
					Really?  Must be a dangerous 
					business.

							JIM
					I deal with some tough customers.

			Miguelito smiles.  Figuring he can hustle this cowboy, he 
			lays a hundred dollar bill on the table.  The crowd reacts.  
			This is a lot of money.

							MIGUELITO
					Continue doubles to the first miss?

			The crowd watches.  Cassandra watches, eyes flashing.  
			She likes this action.

			Jim coolly matches the bet.  CHEERS from the crowd.  
			Miguelito smiles and reloads.

			Miguelito's turn.  BOOM!  BOOM!  The guy never misses.

			Jim nods graciously and holds up -- three fingers.

							MIGUELITO
						(snickering)
					Sir... I believe you have only two 
					barrels.

							JIM
					How embarrassing.  Did I hold up 
					three fingers?

			Then he holds up -- four fingers.

			The rattled trapmen look to Miguelito -- what do we do?  
			He scowls.  Is this guy for real?  But he gives them the 
			nod.

			Four balls fly at once.  Jim snaps up the shotgun -- POW! 
			POW! -- that's two.  He drops the gun and swiftly reaches 
			left and right, pulling a six-gun out of Voltaire's jacket 
			and another one out of Bruno's belt.  BLAM!  BLAM!

			He breaks the last two balls just before they hit the 
			water!

			The crowd goes bonkers.  Cassandra stares at Jim downright 
			hungrily.  Jim hands the guns back to their owners.

							JIM
					You know, you really shouldn't 
					loan your guns to strangers.

			Miguelito's not having fun anymore.  A SERVANT rushes up, 
			whispering to him urgently.  Miguelito nods to his guests:

							MIGUELITO
					Will you excuse me?  Perhaps Quick-
					Draw here can give you all some 
					pointers.
						(to Cassandra)
					Miss Thompson, come!

			With an apologetic smile to Jim, Cassandra hurries to 
			follow them.  Jim tries not to be too obvious as he follows 
			them out.


			INT.  MIGUELITO'S MANSION - THE GRAND SALON - NIGHT

			Jim glides into the salon, catching sight of the hurried 
			group disappearing into a dark, wood-paneled library.  He 
			ambles over and develops a fascination for a Chinese vase 
			near the open door.  But Bruno closes the door.  Damn.


			INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SERVANTS' STAIRWAY - NIGHT

			Artemus peeks out the servant's stairway into the long 
			hallway.  He ducks as the pretty maid he spoke to earlier 
			comes out an impressive set of doors.  She walks past 
			unseen Artemus.  The coast is clear.  He strolls down the 
			hall.

			He stops at the doors, pulling a pen-sized object from 
			his pocket.  He holds it up to the keyhole and squints 
			through the end of it.

			ANGLE - ARTEMUS' P.O.V. - A FISH-EYE VIEW

			of Miguelito's office.

			BACK TO SCENE

			Artemus smiles and tests the doors -- locked.  No problem.  
			Out of his lapel he pulls a concealed lockpick.  CLICKETY-
			CLICK.  Door's open.  He slips inside.


			INT.  MIGUELITO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

			Artemus locks the door behind him.  An oversized desk 
			with a small, throne-like chair dominates the office which 
			is cluttered with papers and books.  A row of portraits 
			adorn the wall: Miguelito as Ramses, Miguelito as Caesar, 
			Miguelito as Richard the Lionhearted.

			Artemus moves quickly to the desk and starts looking 
			through the papers, reading from a stack of receipts:

							ARTEMUS
					"Loveless Carriage Company, 
					Baltimore, Maryland... Loveless 
					Investments Limited, Atlanta, 
					Georgia..."


			INT.  MIGUELITO'S MANSION - GRAND SALON - NIGHT

			Jim is still outside the library.  The doors open and

			Voltaire lumbers out.  Jim gets a quick look inside --

			Miguelito sits at a writing table, taking down information 
			given him by a tall, imposing GRAY-BEARDED MAN to whom he 
			is unusually deferential.  The man paces the room, unhappy 
			about something.

			Jim eyes the man.  He recognizes him but can't place him.

			Miguelito uses an ink blotter to dry the ink and thrusts 
			the paper at Bruno, who takes it and hurries out.

			Miguelito escorts the mysterious man out, giving Jim the 
			cold shoulder.  Cassandra smiles, coming over.

							CASSANDRA
					You must excuse the Doctor.  No 
					one has ever beaten him at his 
					little game.

							JIM
					I don't like to lose, either.

			Jim steps over to the string quartet machine, now playing 
			a QUADRILLE.  He slides a control lever over to "WALTZ."

			The machine shudders and segues into "The Blue Danube."

							JIM
					I assume, Miss Thompson, that you 
					waltz.

			Of course she does.  Jim whirls her off across the floor.


			INT.  MIGUELITO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

			Artemus notices on a shelf beside the desk -- a scale 
			model of a cannon, but it's a cannon outfitted with all 
			manner of pistons, gears and flywheels.  A pressure hose 
			connects it to a small steam engine.  Intrigued, Artemus 
			gingerly throws the lever on the engine.

			With a HISS the cannon comes to life, automatically 
			pivoting as it RAPID-FIRES marble-sized cannonballs with 
			steam pressure -- FOOSH!  FOOSH!

			The balls fly across the room, knocking over a row of tin 
			soldiers.

			Artemus is impressed.  He spots a little brass plate on 
			the steam engine:

							ARTEMUS
					"Loveless Steam Engine Works, 
					Houston, Texas."


			INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT

			The romantic waltz continues.  Jim dances Cassandra right 
			out of the Grand Salon into the dark, empty library.

							CASSANDRA
					Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. 
					Tyler?

							JIM
					You tell me.

							CASSANDRA
					I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would 
					like to find his social secretary 
					dancing in the dark with an 
					uninvited stranger.

							JIM
					Forgive me, but you don't strike 
					me as the social secretary type.

							CASSANDRA
					Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm 
					a single woman in a man's world.  
					That leaves me very few choices, 
					doesn't it?

							JIM
					I suppose so.  But life can be 
					hard for a man, too.

			They drift closer and closer.  Cassandra whispers heatedly:

							CASSANDRA
					Oh, I know well how hard things 
					can get for a man.

			She presses against him, their lips are only inches apart 
			when we hear a soft metallic CLICK.  Her eyes widen with 
			interest.

							CASSANDRA
					Speak of the Devil.

			She glances down, surprised to see what's got her attention 
			isn't part of Jim's anatomy.  It's the concealed derringer 
			which has popped out uninvited.  Jim clicks it back into 
			place, embarrassed.

							JIM
					Just a little insurance... against 
					the unexpected.

							CASSANDRA
					Would that include me?

							JIM
					Oh, I would hope not.

			He kicks the door shut.  They've both reached the boiling 
			point and they're in each others arms in a flash.  They 
			kiss greedily.

			As she pulls Jim's jacket off, he's backing her across 
			the dark room, kicking chairs and foot-stools out of his 
			way until he's got her up against the end of the writing 
			table.  She rips his shirt open and starts hungrily 
			devouring his chest.  But Jim is mixing business with 
			pleasure.  Over her shoulder he's trying to get a closer 
			look at --

			ANGLE - JIM'S P.O.V. - THE INK BLOTTER

			Miguelito has just used -- the reversed blotchy letters 
			of a name are soaked into it.

			BACK TO SCENE

			Cassandra heatedly throws herself onto the table and, 
			with one sweep of her arm, sends everything on it cascading 
			to the floor.  She grabs Jim and pulls him down on top of 
			her.  They're going at it like sharks in a feeding frenzy.

			Whatever Jim's doing to her, Cassandra can't help but 
			start MOANING.  She comes up for air.

							CASSANDRA
					You've... done... this... before.

							JIM
					I've had some practice.

			And with that, Jim grabs her and rolls the both of them 
			off the table to the floor.

							CASSANDRA
					Yes!  I like it on the floor.

			Jim's looking around and spots the fallen ink blotter 
			slowly swiveling to a stop beneath the table.

							JIM
					Under the table.

			He grabs her, rolling with her under the table.

							CASSANDRA
					Yes!

			In her frenzy, Cassandra knocks the ink blotter skittering 
			off against the far wall.  Jim looks at it hopelessly 
			then -- buries his face in her neck.

							CASSANDRA
					Yes... yes...

			And he rips off her pearl necklace with his teeth.  Pearls 
			scatter everywhere.

							JIM
					Oh, I am sorry.

			Jim crawls straight for the ink blotter, scooping up pearls 
			as he goes.

							CASSANDRA
					To hell with them!

			And Cassandra practically tackles him against the wall, 
			rolling with him until she comes up astride her stud.  
			She wildly yanks off his belt and tosses it.  Now Jim 
			rolls on top of her, making a lunge for the blotter.  He 
			snags it!

			And, below frame, Cassandra has snagged what she's after.  
			As Jim's face registers appreciation for her well-practiced 
			ministrations, he strains upward with the blotter toward 
			a mirror above him.

			Finally he's able to glimpse the reflection of the blotter.  
			The letters, now reversed, can be easily read:

						 "V. L. Pemberton"

			Jim can't help but express his happiness:

							JIM
					Yes!


			EXT.  THE WANDERER - DAWN

			As dawn breaks, FOLLOW a wire down from a telegraph pole 
			into the parlour car.  We HEAR A TELEGRAPH CLICKING.


			INT.  THE WANDERER - PARLOUR CAR - DAWN

			CLOSE ON the CLICKING telegraph key.  PULL BACK to see 
			Jim hunched over it while Artemus hovers in the background.  
			Jim sits back with the message.

							JIM
					Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew 
					it.  He's a scientist all right.  
					Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed 
					Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, 
					Artemus, Loveless is our man.

							ARTEMUS
					Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't 
					arrest this little pillar of society 
					on maybe.

							JIM
					All right.  How about this?  We 
					put a watch on this Pemberton, 
					somebody tries to grab him...

							ARTEMUS
					Then we've got our proof.  
					Excellent.  And where do we find 
					this fortunate scientist?

			The telegraph key starts CLICKING again.  Jim holds up 
			his hand for silence.  They listen, both translating:

							JIM/ARTEMUS
					"Opel... ousas... Louisiana."

			Jim grabs the speaking tube and shouts to Doyle:

							JIM
					Mr. Doyle!  We're off to Opelousas, 
					Louisiana, wherever the hell that 
					is!  How soon can we leave?

			BAM -- the train instantly JOLTS forward.  Doyle's voice 
			rings back through the tube:

							DOYLE (V.O.)
					Would that be soon enough for ya, 
					sir?

			Jim smiles, impressed.  He and Artemus settle back for 
			the journey.

							ARTEMUS
					You know your Morse Code almost as 
					well as I.

							JIM
					Almost?

							ARTEMUS
					Yes.  Now, observe....

			He starts winking his eyes, one eye then the other, in an 
			exaggerated way.  Jim stares at the strange sight.

							JIM
					You feeling all right?

							ARTEMUS
					Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.
						(points to his right eye)
					Dot...
						(and to his left eye)
					Dash.  It'll be our secret means 
					of communication should we ever 
					need it.

			He gives Jim a quick flurry of winks.

							ARTEMUS
					Now, what was that?

							JIM
					You're either having a seizure or 
					you just said "hello."

							ARTEMUS
					Good, I wasn't sure you were up to 
					it.

			Jim leans forward and angrily winks a message back.

			Artemus is insulted.

							ARTEMUS
					No need for profanity.


			EXT.  LOUISIANA - RAILROAD TRACKS - DAY

			Billowing clouds of smoke and steam trail from the Wanderer 
			as it thunders across the delta.


			EXT.  OPELOUSAS, LOUISIANA - ESTABLISH - DAY

			The little town is a charming jumble of antebellum brick 
			and wooden buildings.


			EXT.  OPELOUSAS - NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

			Artemus and Jim hurry along a muddy street looking for an 
			address in a row of houses.  They spot it and rush up the 
			steps.  When Jim knocks on the door it swings open partway, 
			unlocked.  Bad sign.  Jim pulls his gun.  Artemus nudges 
			the door open with his walking stick.


			INT.  DR. PEMBERTON'S HOUSE - FRONT HALL - DAY

			Jim and Artemus ease inside, listening.  All is silent.  
			Then -- PLINK, PLINK, PLINK.  Water is dripping down the 
			stairwell, faster and faster, now starting to pour.

							JIM
					Dr. Pemberton?  Are you there?

			No answer, so they race up the stairs.


			INT.  DR. PEMBERTON'S HOUSE - LABORATORY - DAY

			BAM!  The locked door is smashed open by Jim.  As he 
			charges in we see Artemus crouched in the doorway, his 
			lockpick poised where the lock used to be.

			The room is a cluttered, top-floor workshop.  Nobody there.  
			Steam billows from a small test boiler.  And the water is 
			pouring from a spigot in a holding tank, left running, 
			overflowing a bucket.  Artemus sloshes over and shuts it 
			off.

							ARTEMUS
					Seems like he left in a hurry...

			Outside, they hear a SCUFFLE.  They dash to the window.

			THEIR P.O.V. - THE BACK ALLEY

			Three floors below they see familiar faces -- big Bruno, 
			even bigger Voltaire, and TWO OTHER THUGS -- wrestling 
			someone into an enclosed carriage!  The DRIVER lashes the 
			horses.  The carriage speeds down the muddy alley.

			BACK TO SCENE

							ARTEMUS
					It's them all right!  Damn it!

			They're getting away!

							JIM
					From you maybe.

			Artemus is baffled as Jim backs up and bursts into a 
			furious run -- straight for an open side window!  He dives 
			straight through!

							ARTEMUS
					JIM!


			EXT.  ROOFTOPS - DAY

			Jim sails through the air and tumbles onto the flat roof 
			of the lower house next door.


			EXT.  WINDOW - DAY

			Artemus races to the window, relieved to see his partner 
			alive and dismayed that his partner is, in fact, his 
			partner.  Artemus turns and runs for the stairs.


			EXT.  ROOFTOPS - DAY

			Jim is already up and sprinting across the roof, keeping 
			an eye on the carriage below.  He races to the edge of 
			the roof and leaps into space again!

			On he goes, leaping from roof to roof, but gaining on the 
			carriage.


			EXT.  LAST ROOFTOP - DAY

			Jim gets ahead of the carriage, but he's run out of 
			rooftops.  He slides to a stop at the roof edge.  Now how 
			to get down?

			Beside the roof he spots the top of a railroad crossing 
			barrier.  It's in the vertical position, letting traffic 
			cross the tracks below.  And here comes the carriage toward 
			the tracks.

			Jim gets that determined look.  He's got to time it just 
			right.  He waits, then leaps off the roof, wrapping himself 
			around the tip of the barrier.  It starts to swing down --


			EXT.  BACK ALLEY - DAY

			With perfect timing, Jim arcs down toward the carriage 
			and WHAM! -- lands on the roof right behind the driver.  
			As the startled man turns, he gets booted in the jaw, and 
			flies off the carriage.

			Jim pulls the team to a stop, draws his revolver and leaps 
			to the ground.  But the carriage door slams open, knocking 
			his pistol off into a puddle and Bruno launches out of 
			the cab into Jim.  Over they go into the mud.

			Bruno pins Jim beneath him, sits up, and cocks a meaty 
			fist to smash Jim in the face.  But Jim jams two fingers 
			up Bruno's nostrils, yanks his face close and slugs him.  
			Bruno's head snaps back.  Jim yanks him in again.  Slugs 
			him again.  Bruno topples off.

			One thug, wielding a knife, dives out of the carriage.  
			Jim straight-legs him in the crotch and pivots him straight 
			up and over onto his back -- OOF!!

			Jim scrambles up.  Catches sight of Voltaire through the 
			rear window of the carriage drawing a pistol!  Without 
			hesitating, Jim throws a pounding left hook right through 
			the glass.  Voltaire is knocked across the inside of the 
			carriage, pinning the other thug beneath him.

			Jim yanks open the other door of the carriage.  Frightened 
			Dr. Pemberton flinches.  Jim does a startled take -- it's 
			DR. VIRGINIA PEMBERTON, a beautiful young woman.  Jim 
			glances around.  Nobody else it could be.

							JIM
					Dr. Pemberton?

							PEMBERTON
					Yes!

			But Bruno flies in, tackling Jim and pinning him in a 
			choke-hold against the fence.  Jim manages to GAG:

							JIM
					Would you please run, ma'am?

			She happily obeys, scrambling from the carriage and dashing 
			down the alley.

							VOLTAIRE
					Get her!

			The two thugs scramble up and dash after her.

			Still pinned to the fence, all Jim can do is spit in 
			Bruno's eye.  Bruno flinches and Jim knees him where it 
			hurts most.  The big guy staggers back.

			ANGLE - DR. PEMBERTON

			dashing down the alley.  The thugs are just about to grab 
			her when -- a silver-handled walking stick thrusts out, 
			tripping them.  Down they go.  Artemus steps from around 
			the corner, squares off with them, menacingly twirling 
			the walking stick.

							ARTEMUS
					Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking 
					this where it doesn't belong.
						(to Dr. Pemberton)
					Federal agents, ma'am.  We're 
					rescuing a kidnap victim...

							PEMBERTON
					Yes, me!

							ARTEMUS
					You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course.  
					How novel.

			The thugs jump to their feet, one whipping out his pistol.  
			WHAM!  A flash of silver and Artemus has knocked the gun 
			from his hand.  He waves a finger at the guy:

							ARTEMUS
					Never shoot an unarmed man.

			The other thug pulls a huge Bowie knife.  Artemus strikes 
			an en garde pose and goes a few parries with the guy before 
			deftly knocking the knife from his hand.

			Enraged, they both charge like bulls.  Wrong move -- WHAM! 
			WHAM!  The walking stick is a blur as Artemus hits both 
			dopes up side their heads.  As they whirl for another 
			attack, grabbing boards as clubs.

							ARTEMUS
					Tsk tsk...

			He collapses his walking stick like a telescope and pops 
			the silver handle off the end -- it's still connected by 
			a two foot-long cable.  Gripping the shortened stick, 
			Artemus swings the heavy silver handle like a Crusader 
			swings a deadly mace.

			Spinning it in a blinding blur, he wades into them, bashing 
			and bruising right and left until the bad guys have had 
			enough and go running down the alley.

			Artemus is about to give chase when Dr. Pemberton points 
			out:

							PEMBERTON
					Isn't your friend in a bit of 
					trouble?

			Artemus turns to look.


			ANGLE - JIM

			is surrounded by three very angry guys -- bloody-nosed 
			Bruno, outraged Voltaire, and the bruised carriage driver.

			The three men raise their "dukes," the bare-knuckles boxing 
			stance.  They're amused when Jim strikes a very different 
			pose -- a martial arts defensive position.

			Jim explodes in a blur of martial arts ferocity.  A right 
			leg back-sweep drops unsuspecting Bruno.

			A back-two-knuckle-punch further damages Voltaire's already 
			unhappy face.  A right-leg-side-kick doubles over the 
			carriage driver.  Let's just say these three hard cases 
			are totally outclassed -- and in a lot of pain.

			The driver gives up first, frantically leaping onto the 
			carriage, lashing the horses.  Voltaire and Bruno race 
			after it and scramble inside.

			ANGLE - ARTEMUS AND DR. PEMBERTON

			gazing off in amazement at Jim.

							PEMBERTON
					My, he's effective.  And he did it
					without a stick.

			Artemus does an insulted take.  Jim limps up to them, 
			breathing hard.

							JIM
					Gotta get the Doctor someplace 
					safe.

							PEMBERTON
					Who were they?  What do they want 
					with me?

							JIM
					We'll explain on the way.

			As they hurry off down the alley:

							ARTEMUS
					What was all that back there?

							JIM
					All what?

							ARTEMUS
						(mimes a martial arts move)
					All that jumping and kicking.

							JIM
					That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese 
					fighting... I was sort of caught 
					once with a lovely Chinese girl 
					out in San Francisco.  Her big 
					brothers were kind enough to teach 
					it to me
						(pause)
					I've got a book on it, if you're 
					interested.


			INT.  MIGUELITO'S MANSION - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

			Eyes closed in concentration, hands clasped in front of 
			him, Miguelito is SINGING a rousing patriotic anthem in a 
			fine tenor voice.  He's accompanied on the harpsichord by 
			the always mysterious Antoinette.

			A SERVANT hurries in with a telegram, and hesitates, 
			waiting for Miguelito to finish.

							MIGUELITO
						(singing)
					... From horizon to horizon, The 
					freedom we shall bring, Beneath 
					the one true flag we defend our 
					land, And make the mountains sing!

			He stops unhappily and crosses out some lyrics on his 
			sheet of music.

							MIGUELITO
					"Make the mountains sing?"  No, 
					no, cliche, cliche!.  "Like... an 
					eagle on the wing!"  Yes!  That's 
					it.  An eagle on the wing, don't 
					you think, my dear?

			He happily jots down the new lyrics, then notices the 
			servant.

							MIGUELITO
					A message?  Why didn't you tell 
					me?

			He grabs the telegram, reads it and looks up angrily.

							MIGUELITO
						(to Antoinette)
					They failed to get Dr. Pemberton!  
					Now she's under guard in the city 
					jail!  They're forcing me to become 
					boorishly heavy-handed.


			EXT.  OPELOUSAS CITY JAIL - ESTABLISH - NIGHT

			Gaslights cast a warm glow on the sturdy brick building.


			INT.  OPELOUSAS CITY JAIL - NIGHT

			Dr. Pemberton, Jim and Artemus sit around the pot-belly 
			stove.  A bored DEPUTY sits at a desk in background.

							PEMBERTON
					I only met him once, but that was 
					enough.  For such a little man he 
					had quite an oversized opinion of 
					himself.  He offered me the "rare 
					and unparalleled opportunity" to 
					develop a new steam engine for 
					him.  He claims to have some sort 
					of factory in Texas, I believe.  
					Said I could have the run of the 
					place.  He had all sorts of 
					specifications.  But when I 
					questioned him closely, it became 
					obvious he was just another 
					mercenary businessman.  Both he 
					and his partner had no real love 
					of steam.
						(wistful)
					It's sad.  So few men do.

							JIM
					Who was this partner of his?

							PEMBERTON
					A Southern gentlemen.  I don't 
					recall his name.  I suppose it's 
					unkind of me to say it, but he had 
					the most disconcerting glass eye.

							JIM
						(suddenly)
					A glass eye?  That's who it was!  
					One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise 
					known as General Garrison, 
					Confederate Third Army.  I saw him 
					at Dr. Loveless' party, but I 
					couldn't place him.  He used to 
					wear an eye-patch.

							ARTEMUS
					Garrison...?  Then the President 
					was right.  Except it's not a 
					foreign power, it's a bunch of die-
					hard Rebels trying to make the 
					South rise again.

							JIM
					And if they've got Dr. Loveless 
					building weapons like those flying 
					bombs... they just might do it.

			Suddenly from outside they hear distant SCREAMS then the 
			echo of GUNSHOTS.


			EXT.  OPELOUSAS CITY JAIL - NIGHT

			Artemus and Jim run out.  A riderless buckboard races 
			past.  At the end of the street they see SMOKE.  More 
			GUNSHOTS and SCREAMING.

			They dash toward the sounds, but slow down uncertainly as 
			they hear something else -- something downright DEMONIC, 
			a deep ominous RUMBLING.  Then an eerie SHRIEK as a cloud 
			of steam billows around the corner.  And out of the cloud 
			rolls something BIG.

			It's a steam-powered "tank" -- completely encased in steel, 
			and topped with a Monitor-like gun turret.  Electric lights 
			glaring, steam belching, driven by ten foot high spiked 
			steel wheels, the heavy metal beast CLANKS toward them!

							ARTEMUS
					My God!

			Gun barrels slide out of narrow ports, firing a VOLLEY at 
			Jim and Artemus.  They dive for cover behind a stone wall 
			and come up with six-guns blazing.

			From inside the jailhouse behind them, deputies open fire 
			as well.

			But the bullets only RICOCHET off the machine's armor.

							ARTEMUS
					Could I just point out, this is a 
					perfect example of the criminal 
					mind exploiting modern invention.

							JIM
						(glares at Artemus)
					I'm going to hit you.

			Now the cannon in the turret OPENS FIRE!  And it's no 
			ordinary single-shot cannon.  It's automatic.  And it 
			fires with a weird HISSING SOUND: FOOSH!  FOOSH!  FOOSH!

			BLAM!  BLAM!  Powerful explosive rounds start shattering 
			the wall behind which Jim and Artemus are hiding.

							JIM
					Never seen a gun fire so fast!

							ARTEMUS
					It's a repeating steam cannon!

			Three more exploding rounds chew up more of the wall.  
			Jim and Artemus dash along the wall as it's blasted to 
			bits right behind them.

							ARTEMUS
					Pretty good one, too...

			Now the "steam tank" veers off, flattening a wagon and 
			crushing the boardwalk as it heads for the jailhouse!

			Deputies dive out of the windows in panic.


			INT.  OPELOUSAS CITY JAIL - NIGHT

			Dr. Pemberton and one loyal DEPUTY stumble backward from 
			the windows, terrified, as the steam tank SMASHES right 
			through the wall!  The hapless deputy disappears SCREAMING 
			beneath it as it rumbles into the room, debris cascading 
			off its sloping sides.

			Dazed Dr. Pemberton is half-buried in the plaster and 
			wreckage.  A hatch opens in the belly of the beast.  
			Voltaire drops out, grabs the doctor and hauls her inside.  
			The hatch slams shut.


			EXT.  OPELOUSAS CITY JAIL - NIGHT

			Jim and Artemus watch in amazement as the metal monster 
			reverses out of the gaping hole in the building


			EXT.  OPELOUSAS - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

			The steam tank rolls brazenly right back through town.  
			Astonished ONLOOKERS have no idea what to make of it.  
			Dogs bark.  Horses bolt.  Women scream.

			It moves at only the pace of a quick walk.  It's easy for 
			Jim, Artemus and the deputies to overtake it -- but so 
			what?  There's not a damn thing they can do to stop it.

			Artemus grabs a thick beam from some stacked lumber and 
			jams it through the spokes of the massive rear wheel, but 
			the beam is instantly ground to toothpicks.

			Jim runs ahead to a blacksmith's.  He dashes out with a 
			heavy chain.  He swiftly loops it around two iron lamp 
			posts, stretching it across the street in the path of the 
			steam tank.  He waits expectantly as Artemus jogs up.

							JIM
						(re the massive chain)
					That oughta hold'em.  Be ready 
					when they come out!

			The tank rolls forward, plowing into the chain -- and 
			effortlessly rips the lamp posts out like weeds.  Gas 
			EXPLODES from the severed posts -- WOOMP!  WOOMP!  Like 
			little oil well fires.

							ARTEMUS
						(sarcastic)
					I'm ready.  Just say "when."

			As they dash after it:

							JIM
					At least I tried something.

							ARTEMUS
					Hey, I tried the board.


			EXT.  OPELOUSAS - EDGE OF TOWN - NIGHT

			The steam tank rolls relentlessly out of town.  Jim and 
			Artemus jog along at a safe distance behind it.

							ARTEMUS
					Damn it, this is ridiculous.

							JIM
					At least the thing's not that fast.  
					We just follow it.  Whenever it 
					stops, we're there, waiting.

							ARTEMUS
					That's right... That's good.

			But the steam tank now swerves off the road and heads 
			toward --

			ANGLE - RAILROAD TRACKS

			It tips and sways as it CLANKS up onto the tracks.  But 
			then it suddenly turns to align itself with the rails.

			Now a set of railroad driver wheels lowers down from the 
			undercarriage of the tank!  CLINK!  CLANG!  The drivers 
			lock in place, lifting the road wheels a few inches off 
			the ground.

							JIM
					Oh no!

			The tank starts rolling down the tracks, picking up speed.  
			Jim charges after it.  He grabs a sledgehammer from a 
			handcart beside the tracks and -- bounds right up onto 
			the tank.

			Gun barrels poke out of slits and FIRE, but he slams them 
			back inside like those pop-up gophers at an arcade.  Then 
			he starts pounding wildly on the top hatch cover.

			Artemus calls after him:

							ARTEMUS
					Jim, for Godsake!  We'll get the 
					train!  Nothing's faster than that!

			Smoke suddenly billows from two large tubes on either 
			side of the tank.  Jim COUGHS in the acrid fumes, but 
			keeps relentlessly pounding, smashing the hinges off the 
			top hatch.  Almost has it broken loose.

			The insides of the tubes glow red.  Artemus realizes:

							ARTEMUS
					My God.  Jim!  They're rockets!
					Get off!  GET OFF!

			Huge FLAMES EXPLODE from the tubes!  The tank blasts 
			forward, Jim is thrown off, and the machine rockets down 
			the tracks like a ten ton road-runner.

			Artemus rushes to dazed Jim, lying flat on his back 
			surrounded by glowing sparks, hair singed, clothes 
			smoldering.

							ARTEMUS
					Jim, are you all right?

							JIM
					No, I'm not all right.  They got 
					away.  And we can't even follow 
					them.  They can get off the tracks 
					anywhere they want.

							ARTEMUS
					Which is why we're heading to 
					Houston, Texas.
						(off Jim's inquiring look)
					Home of the Loveless Steam Engine 
					Works.


			INT.  THE WANDERER - PARLOUR CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

			Artemus bandages Jim's burns during:

							ARTEMUS
					If you don't mind my asking, were 
					you always the way you are?

							JIM
					What way is that?

							ARTEMUS
					So... spontaneous.  All that leaping 
					off buildings and Chinese fighting 
					and whatnot.

							JIM
					"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most 
					people say something like "hare-
					brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."

							ARTEMUS
					Well... that, too.

							JIM
					Nothing much to it really.  When I 
					was younger I got into a pretty 
					bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I 
					saw them coming.  But I didn't act 
					fast enough.  Second-guessed myself.  
					And it cost me... cost me dearly.

			Jim falls silent.  Artemus waits, but finally:

							ARTEMUS
					So... what happened?

							JIM
					Those kids, they took my wagon.  
					Never got it back.

							ARTEMUS
						(playing catch-up)
					Uh... how long ago was this?

							JIM
					I was six.  And ever since, my 
					policy is: Act first and worry 
					later.

			Artemus lets this sink in.

							ARTEMUS
					I see... Well, the world's lucky 
					they didn't, you know, shoot your 
					mother or something.


			EXT.  STEAM WORKS - WALL - NIGHT

			CAMERA MOVES along the high wall surrounding the Loveless 
			Steam Engine Works.  We hear Jim GRUNTING and STRAINING 
			on the other side as CAMERA MOVES UP.  Jim's sweaty face 
			finally appears over the top.

							JIM
					Don't see any guards.

			Artemus' voice comes from out of sight below.

							ARTEMUS
					Neither do I.

			Jim wonders how Artemus can see.  Then notices the top of 
			a thin periscope peeking up over the wall beside him.

			Down below, Artemus leans casually against the wall, gazing 
			through the eyepiece in the bottom of his walking stick 
			which he has telescoped up.

							JIM
					You might have mentioned you had 
					that.

							ARTEMUS
					I thought all you needed were your 
					fists and your gun.

			He SNAPS the periscope shut.


			EXT.  STEAM WORKS - YARD - NIGHT

			The guys drop down from the wall and dash across the yard.  
			They reach the cover of a discarded steam boiler, and 
			study the foreboding factory.

							ARTEMUS
					Strange... you'd think he'd have 
					this place better guarded.

							JIM
					I find most criminals slip up 
					somewhere...

			Then they hear it -- the ragged, heavy BREATHING of 
			something headed their way.  They look around to see --

			THEIR P.O.V. -- A PACK OF ROTTWEILERS

			gallops toward them, locked-in on the scent of fresh meat!

			BACK TO SCENE

							JIM
					...But not all of them.

			They dash for the factory.

			As they run, Artemus rips off the second button on his 
			vest and tosses it back in the path of the pursuing 
			canines.

			POOF!  A cloud of sleeping gas erupts.  The first dog 
			races through it, takes a few more steps and -- SPLAT!

			Artemus rips off and tosses a few more.  The rest of the 
			dogs drop.  Artemus and Jim reach the building, glancing 
			back at the neat line of dozing dogs.

							ARTEMUS
					They're so precious when they're 
					asleep.

							JIM
					You really enjoy yourself, don't 
					you?

			Artemus just smiles as they move quickly to peer in through 
			grimy windows.

			ANGLE - THEIR P.O.V. - INSIDE STEAM WORKS

			The large dimly-lit space reverberates with the rhythmic 
			POUNDING of a big steam engine running an overhead pulley 
			system -- a maze of pulleys and leather belts which in 
			turn power all the factory machinery.

			Miguelito stands with Bruno and Voltaire admiring a large 
			steel casting as it's crated up by several FACTORY WORKERS.  
			Hard to say what the casting is part of.


			EXT.  STEAM WORKS - YARD - NIGHT

			Jim and Artemus move along the windows toward an open 
			loading dock door when:

							VOICES
					Get them!  Stop them!  Who let 
					them in...?!

			Jim and Artemus take cover and whip out their sidearms.  
			But the shouting's about someone else.

			HOOFBEATS approach.  Three mounted riders are galloping 
			from the main gate to the loading dock door.  It's General 
			Garrison and two of his LIEUTENANTS, chased by a couple 
			of shouting GUARDS.

			Miguelito greets them at the door, flanked by Bruno and 
			Voltaire.  He calls off the guards:

							MIGUELITO
					Leave them!  Leave them!  These 
					are friends!
						(to Garrison)
					General, my apologies.  I'm sure 
					you understand the importance of 
					security.

			ANGLE - JIM AND ARTEMUS

			hiding only a few feet away.

							JIM
						(whispers)
					That's him!  "One-Eyed Jack" 
					Garrison.  Perfect.  Two birds 
					with one stone.

			ANGLE - MIGUELITO AND THE OTHERS

			Garrison glances angrily into the factory.

							GARRISON
					My weapons were to be delivered 
					three weeks ago, as you well know.  
					Instead, I have five thousand loyal 
					men ready to march north and hardly 
					a decent rifle among them!

			Miguelito maintains an air of innocence.

							MIGUELITO
					But delays are inevitable in an 
					undertaking of this size.  Surely...

			The General angrily thrusts out several pieces of paper.

							GARRISON
					I won't hear it, sir!  I have here 
					documents from this very factory 
					showing our weapons were never 
					even built!
						(glancing around)
					And I don't need two eyes to see 
					it's true.  Do you dare deny it, 
					little man?!

			Only Miguelito's eyes betray any reaction to the insult.  
			He remains totally pleasant.

							MIGUELITO
					And you want to know what I spent 
					all your money on.  A fair 
					question... with a simple answer.  
					I bought a little something for 
					myself.
						(turning his back)
					Now please don't move because we 
					really must shoot you.

			The bodyguards pull their revolvers and mercilessly OPEN 
			FIRE.  Miguelito winces at the sound, and again as the 
			three bodies THUD to the ground.  Without turning around:

							MIGUELITO
					Dispose of them... quickly.

			He scurries off, squeamishly shielding his eyes.

							MIGUELITO
					Oh, I just hate killing people I 
					know.

			Bruno and Voltaire drag the bodies inside.

			ANGLE - JIM AND ARTEMUS

			These are two confused guys.

							ARTEMUS
					Can you fill me in here?

							JIM
					Sure.  We have no idea what's going 
					on.

							ARTEMUS
					Thank you.

							JIM
					Come on, let's at least see if we 
					can find Dr. Pemberton.

			AS JIM STARTS OFF:

							ARTEMUS
					You go ahead.  I'll stick with 
					Loveless.

			They sneak off in different directions.


			INT.  STEAM WORKS - NIGHT

			Miguelito heads for a big work table, impatiently clapping 
			his hands to assemble people.  Half a dozen ASSISTANTS 
			gather round him as he unfurls a map.

			CAMERA TILTS UP TO FIND:


			ANGLE - ARTEMUS

			now sneaking along a catwalk among the HUMMING belt-drives.  
			He can get near the table but not close enough to hear 
			over the POUNDING STEAM ENGINE.  But this doesn't stop 
			him.

			He starts pulling mysterious machine components from his 
			pockets, boots, and inside his coat.


			EXT.  STEAM WORKS - RAILROAD SPUR - NIGHT

			Moving along, checking windows, Jim rounds a corner.

			A train waits on a siding, its freight cars being hurriedly 
			loaded by more WORKERS.  At the end is a private rail car 
			opulent enough for your average Emperor.  A SHAPELY 
			SILHOUETTE is back-lit behind a window shade.


			INT.  STEAM WORKS - CATWALK - NIGHT

			Artemus has assembled a small wind-up machine from his 
			various concealed parts.  He carefully rolls a pre-cut 
			piece of paper into a small cone and slides its narrow 
			end into a metal ring with a diaphragm stretched across 
			it.

			He fits this into place on the machine, then adds the 
			final part -- a foil recording cylinder (the size and 
			shape of a toilet paper tube).  He winds the handcrank.

			Next he pulls out his cable-firing derringer.  He needs a 
			clear shot at a wooden column beyond the table.  To get 
			it he has to lean way out from the catwalk, propping 
			himself against one of the (unmoving) drive-belts.

			He takes careful aim, timing it just right with the steam 
			engine's rhythmic POUNDING.  Just as it POUNDS, he FIRES.  
			The gunshot's drowned out by the noise.

			Bull's-eye.  The dart sticks in the column, its cable 
			stretching back to the derringer.  Artemus hooks his 
			cylinder recorder onto it, switches it on, and lets the 
			thing slide down the cable until it's dangling in the 
			shadows above the hanging lamp directly over the table.  
			He hauls up on his end of the cable and ties it off.

			He grins smugly.  But that's when the drive-belt he's 
			leaning against starts MOVING.  He's yanked off the 
			catwalk, clinging to the racing belt.  In seconds he'll 
			be pulled into the big idler wheel at the end of the line.

			He's got no choice.  He drops down, grabbing hold of the 
			lower part of the belt.  Instantly he's hauled off in the 
			opposite direction zooming along above the oblivious 
			minions below.

			There's hope.  The drive-belt carries him over a row of 
			unmanned machinery.  No one's around.  He lets go and 
			plummets to the floor in a heap.  Relieved, he shakily 
			gets to his feet.  A door opens behind him.  He turns 
			just in time to catch sight of Bruno and the incoming 
			fist that knocks him unconscious.


			EXT.  STEAM WORKS - RAILROAD SPUR - NIGHT

			Sneaking along, Jim rolls deftly under the train to avoid 
			the busy workers.  He pops up at the rear door of 
			Miguelito's private rail car.  Soft MUSIC plays from 
			within.


			INT.  MIGUELITO'S PRIVATE CAR - PARLOUR - NIGHT

			Jim slips in quietly.  Nobody there.  He spots Miguelito's 
			humidor, opens it, and pockets a few Cuban cigars.  Not 
			too shabby.  The music is coming from the next room.  He 
			moves to the door.  Tests the doorknob.  It's unlocked.  
			Peeks in.

			ANGLE - JIM'S P.O.V. - CASSANDRA

			sits at her vanity, brushing her hair, wearing an alluring 
			red dressing gown, provocatively dishabille, an ornate 
			music box TINKLING beside her.


			INT.  MIGUELITO'S PRIVATE CAR - BEDROOM - DAY

			Cassandra GASPS as Jim bursts in behind her.

							JIM
					Keep quiet if you know what's good 
					for you.

			She manages a smile and looks him up and down hungrily.

							CASSANDRA
					Well, Mr. Tyler, speaking of what's 
					good for me...

			She stands.  Jim can't help but notice her dressing gown 
			is barely doing its job -- or maybe doing it too well.

							JIM
					I'm not Mr. Tyler and you're no 
					social secretary.  Where's Dr.
					Pemberton?

			She turns back to the vanity, "pouting."

							CASSANDRA
					That strait-laced little prude?  
					Can't you forget about her?  A 
					woman like that couldn't begin to 
					satisfy a man like you.

			She selects a bright red lipstick and smooths it on slowly 
			and sensuously.  But Jim's not putting up with this.  He 
			grabs her wrist.  The lipstick goes flying.

							JIM
						(low and mean)
					Where is she?

			She glares at him, pulling away.

							CASSANDRA
					She's perfectly safe.

							JIM
					Really?  Like General Garrison or 
					didn't you hear all that shooting?

			That rattles her a little.

							CASSANDRA
					The General...?  Well, Dr. Loveless 
					is a very... purposeful man.
						(softening)
					But you certainly have nothing to 
					fear... from me.

			She leans closer, her enticing red silhouette shimmering 
			through the dressing gown.  Then we HEAR a CLICK from 
			below frame.  Cassandra steps back, smiling.

							CASSANDRA
					Where have I heard that before?

			She glances down.  But this time it's Jim's pistol pointed 
			at her.

							CASSANDRA
					My.  It's gotten longer.

							JIM
					You bring the best out in a man.

							CASSANDRA
					I try.
						(suddenly desperate)
					Please, if you promise to protect 
					me, I'll testify against him.
					I'll give you an ironclad case.

			She steps even closer, pressing herself against the gun 
			barrel, turning her face up to him, bringing her lips 
			closer and closer.

							CASSANDRA
					And, as you already know, I can 
					give you much more than that.

			Jim's not about to trust her, but he is, after all, Jim.  
			He pulls her body to him, pinning her arms behind her, 
			and gives her the kind of kiss that gives foreplay a good 
			name.  Then he smiles:

							JIM
					Not a bad deal.

			She smiles back.  But it's an eerie smile on those freshly-
			lipsticked lips.

							CASSANDRA
					For me.

			Jim stares at her warily.  Then he realizes -- he's getting 
			woozy.

							JIM
					What...?  How the hell...?

			He makes a desperate lunge for the door, but in two steps 
			he drops, unconscious.  And she rushes back to the vanity 
			and starts wiping off the potent red lipstick.  She's a 
			little dazed herself.  Is it from the lipstick -- or him.

												DISSOLVE TO:


			INT.  STEAM WORKS - MACHINE SHOP - DAWN

			CLOSE ON Jim as he blearily awakens.  He's tightly bound 
			hand and foot.  He looks around.  He's in a large dingy 
			basement -- Miguelito's workshop.  It's filled with all 
			manner of Frankensteinian equipment and inventions.

			He rolls over, and finds himself face to face with General 
			Garrison, dead eyes staring at him.  Jim wriggles away, 
			only to find himself staring into the faces of the other 
			two dead men.  Jim twists away again, struggling into a 
			sitting position.  Finally he sees:

							JIM
					Artemus!

			His partner is tied to a chair.  Piled nearby are Artemus' 
			jacket, vest, belt and sleeve-gun.  Artemus smiles weakly:

							ARTEMUS
					I was afraid you were dead.
						(noticing something)
					What's that all over your lips?

			Jim thinks.  Then remembers, embarrassed.  He lies:

							JIM
					Blood.

			From off-screen, Miguelito LAUGHS sarcastically:

							MIGUELITO (O.S.)
					Blood!?  Such vanity!

			Out of the shadows steps Miguelito proudly twirling 
			Artemus' walking stick.  He's followed by Cassandra, now 
			in a stunning red evening gown, and Bruno who stares coldly 
			at Jim.  His face is still colorfully bruised after his 
			lambasting from Jim, and he hasn't forgotten.

			Miguelito strides over to Artemus, toying with the walking 
			stick, switching it into its mace mode.

							MIGUELITO
					I like a good concealed weapon.  
					Such a thoughtful gift.  Thank 
					you.

			He turns to Bruno.

							MIGUELITO
					Any ideas?

							BRUNO
					Thought we'd run'em through this.

			Bruno indicates a big, strange looking machine.  
			Miguelito's eyes go wide.

							MIGUELITO
					Good God, Bruno!  How grotesque!
						(smiles)
					And yet brilliant.... Let's do it!

			Miguelito whacks the machine's lever with the walking 
			stick.  Steam belches from it.  Leather drive belts churn 
			to life.  Big pulleys whirl.  A conveyor belt jolts 
			forward, leading up into a massive hopper.  We can't see 
			inside, but from within the hopper we can hear the ominous 
			metallic CLANGING and GNASHING of its inner workings.  
			Miguelito SHOUTS over the ROAR of the machine.

							MIGUELITO
					One of my many inventions.  A 
					watermelon juicer.
						(defensive)
					Yes!  I admit the public did not 
					share my enthusiasm for the juice 
					of the watermelon.  But what do 
					they know?!

			Bruno grabs the General's body and heaves it uncere-
			moniously onto the conveyor belt.  Swiftly, the body is 
			carried up toward the hopper.  At the last moment, 
			Miguelito notices a fine fountain pen in the General's 
			pocket and snatches it up for himself.

			Then he hurries over to Cassandra, almost hiding behind 
			her, horrified and yet fascinated.  Cassandra just watches, 
			eerily unfazed.

			The body disappears into the hopper.  We can't see 
			anything, but we hear awful MUNCHING and CRUNCHING.  A 
			spout tips down into a barrel and begins filling it.

			Jim and Artemus watch grimly.  Bruno likes it.  He shuts 
			down the machine and steps over to peer into the barrel.

			Then slams a lid down on it with satisfaction.

							BRUNO
					Won't be drinking this batch!

							MIGUELITO
					Bruno, please!

			This whole demonstration makes Jim and Artemus decidedly 
			uneasy.

							JIM
					Why don't we just cut this routine 
					short?  Whatever you do to us, 
					we're not going to talk.

							MIGUELITO
						(genuinely confused)
					Talk?  About what...?
						(then he gets it)
					Oh!  About who you are and all 
					that?

			He laughs and turns to Cassandra, matter-of-factly:

							MIGUELITO
					Mr. West and Mr. Gordon are refusing 
					to tell us that they're U.S. 
					Marshals.  What are we to do?

			He pauses to savor the moment.

							MIGUELITO
					I love when I get to do that...!
						(smugly)
					You see, I have informants at every 
					level of government...
						(laughs)
					Ironically, they weren't able to 
					tell me a thing.  But fortunately, 
					Mr. West, Bruno finally remembered 
					you.  It seems you arrested his 
					brother three years ago.  He's 
					quite an asset to me.

			He strides to the door, then turns.

							MIGUELITO
					I'm sorry this is all so graphic.
						(casually)
					Just try to relax and think of 
					something else.

			He marches out.  Cassandra starts to follow, but notices 
			Jim staring icily at her.  She pauses to explain:

							CASSANDRA
					You see, unlike most employers, 
					Dr. Loveless is actually willing 
					to give a woman power, power over 
					men and machines.  What more could 
					a girl ask for.

			She exits.  Bruno drags the other two bodies to the 
			watermelon press, and heaves them up onto the conveyor 
			belt.  He turns to Jim, rubbing the bruises on his face:

							BRUNO
					I'm putting you in like this, feet 
					first.  Alive.

			He turns back to the machine to restart it.  It RUMBLES 
			to life.

			While Bruno's back is turned, Artemus gets Jim's attention 
			by blinking one eye then the other.  He's sending Morse 
			Code.  Jim stares, trying to follow it.

			Even though Bruno keeps glancing at them, he has no idea 
			they're communicating.

			Artemus keeps blinking.

					SUBTITLE: "Push my left heel."

			Jim doesn't quite catch it all.  He frowns.

					SUBTITLE: "Huh?"

			Artemus frantically re-sends:

					SUBTITLE: "Push my left heel.  On side."

			Jim gets it and peers at Artemus' boot, tied tightly to 
			the chair leg.  He glances at Bruno, still busy with the 
			machine.  Jim extends his leg and firmly presses the toe 
			of his boot against the side of Artemus' boot heel.

			SPROING -- a razor sharp knife blade pops out of Artemus' 
			toe and locks into place.  Jim loves it.  He wriggles 
			around to block Bruno's view of the boot and starts cutting 
			the ropes on his wrists.

			The watermelon press finishes its dirty work.  Bruno rolls 
			an empty barrel under the spout, then turns and lumbers 
			toward Jim.  He grabs the ropes around Jim's ankles.  But 
			Jim's hands are free.  He wallops Bruno with a roundhouse 
			punch that sends the big man staggering.

			Jim goes to work on his ankle ropes.  Bruno ROARS and 
			comes charging back at him.  Jim rolls to one side and 
			Bruno piles into helpless Artemus -- they both go over 
			backward in the chair.

			Bruno and Artemus end up face to face.  Artemus bites his 
			nose.  Bruno screams and slugs Artemus.

			Jim, his ankles still tied, somehow springs to his feet 
			and starts hopping toward the pile of Artemus' weapons.

			Bruno turns and charges at Jim.  This will be easy.  But 
			he quickly finds himself lost in a flurry of martial arts 
			punches as Jim pogos around to keep his balance.  Bruno 
			retreats and grabs a length of steam pipe.  He circles 
			Jim warily.

			Artemus can see that even Jim isn't going to last long.  
			Still tied to the fallen chair, Artemus wriggles wildly, 
			scooting himself closer to the churning machine.

			Jim sees the opportunity.  Dodging the swinging pipe, he 
			maneuvers Bruno so that his back is to the machine.  Then 
			Jim does the simplest possible thing -- he feints at Bruno, 
			causing him to flinch and step back.  He trips over Artemus 
			and -- crashes onto the conveyor belt!

			Swiftly hauled up, he clings desperately to the lip of 
			the hopper for a moment, but loses his grip and goes in 
			SCREAMING.

			Jim and Artemus wince at the SLOSHING, MUSHING and 
			CRUSHING.  Then Jim shuts down the machine.

							JIM
						(re Bruno)
					Liquidated that asset.


			EXT.  STEAM WORKS - RAILROAD SPUR - DAWN

			Jim and Artemus charge out of the building -- Miguelito's 
			train is gone.

							JIM
					Damn!  We go through all that and 
					does he even wait for us?

			He turns to see his partner dashing back into the factory.


			INT.  STEAM WORKS - DAWN

			Artemus leaps up onto the work table and reaches up above 
			the hanging lamp.  Jim walks over, leans against the table, 
			wondering what the hell he's up to.

							JIM
					Having fun?  Because we really 
					gotta catch this guy...

			Artemus unhooks the recorder from the cable and sets it 
			onto the table.  He starts winding its crank.  Jim sure 
			looks confused.

							ARTEMUS
						(proudly)
					Know what this is?

							JIM
					Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.

							ARTEMUS
					A cylinder recorder.  My own design.

			Jim's about to say something.  Artemus holds his finger 
			to his lips for silence and resets the needle.  He pushes 
			a lever and the cylinder spins.  We hear SCRATCHY STATIC 
			and then, miraculously -- a VOICE.

							MIGUELITO (V.O.)
					... And do give me some room, 
					Voltaire.  You're breathing on my 
					head!  I hate it when you breath 
					on my head!

							JIM
					Dr. Loveless?

			Artemus nods.  Jim is amazed.

							MIGUELITO (V.O.)
					Now you're standing in my light.  
					How many times must I tell you?!  
					Very well, gentlemen, what is our 
					report on Dr. Pemberton?  Is she 
					cooperating?

							ASSISTANT (V.O.)
					They've persuaded her.

							MIGUELITO (V.O.)
					Good, good.  Now, everyone, take a 
					look at this...

			Then SILENCE for precious seconds.  The needle has almost 
			reached the end of the spinning cylinder.  Artemus gazes 
			at it impatiently.

							JIM
					This is good.

							ARTEMUS
					Shhh!
						(to recorder)
					Come on.  Tell us something!

							MIGUELITO (V.O.)
					That is precisely where we will 
					find little Willard.  And, 
					unfortunately, Willard will have 
					to be exterminated if we are ever 
					to be taken seriously.  We must 
					move quickly.  Get everything in 
					order.  And, Voltaire, be a good 
					boy and find me one of those Western 
					hats...
						(on second thought)
					No, no, one of those attractive 
					pith helmets.  It's damnably hot 
					out there, isn't it?
						(pause)
					Oh, we are so close.  So very close 
					to the grand culmination of my 
					dream.  The entire world will 
					tremble when they see...

			But the recording cylinder runs out.

							ARTEMUS
					Oh, damn!  That's it.

							JIM
					It's better than nothing.

							ARTEMUS
					It is?

							JIM
					He's going to put on a pith helmet 
					and kill some guy named Willard.


			INT.  THE WANDERER - PARLOUR CAR - DAY

			The TELEGRAPH CLICKS AWAY.  FIND Jim and Artemus eagerly 
			decoding the message.  Then, simultaneously, they look 
			crushed.  Artemus drops onto the sofa as Jim flops into a 
			chair.

							JIM
					No record of him.

							ARTEMUS
					You'd think if Loveless is going 
					to kill him he could at least be a 
					prominent citizen.

			Artemus looks out the window as we HEAR a train CLANGING 
			and CHUFFING to a stop on a parallel track.

							ARTEMUS
					What's this?

							JIM
					Sounds like a train.
						(glancing over)
					Looks like a train.

							ARTEMUS
					Yes.  And a much nicer one than 
					ours.

			The door flies open and TWO BODYGUARDS and TWO AIDES march 
			in.  Jim leaps up:

							JIM
					Who the hell are you?  Ever hear 
					of knocking?  You think you can 
					just barge in here like that...?

			The men step aside for -- President Grant who strides in.  
			Jim keeps on talking, but a different tune:

							JIM
					... well, of course you can.  Mr. 
					President, what a surprise.  What 
					brings you here?

							GRANT
					On my way to Denver...

							AIDE
					Albuquerque is next, sir.

							GRANT
					Whatever.  My whistle-stop tour of 
					the Southwest.  One godforsaken 
					cowtown after another.
						(sees Artemus)
					You must be Gordon.  Speak French, 
					huh?  Hope it helps.

			Grant doesn't pause, reaching out to the aide who hands 
			him a telegram.

							GRANT
					Got a message from some crackpot 
					named Dr. Miguelito Loveless.  
					Ever hear of him?  Wants the U.S. 
					to give him half the Southwest.  
					Claims it's his.  If we don't sign 
					his cockeyed treaty, he's 
					threatening to destroy an entire 
					town every day until we do.

			Jim and Artemus are stunned.

							JIM
					Where'd he say he was going to do 
					this?

							GRANT
					He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm 
					taking you off that other case 
					until you've nabbed this lunatic.  
					Good luck.
						(takes in the parlour car)
					Nice train.  But mine's nicer.

			Grant hands the speechless guys the telegram and instantly 
			marches out, followed by his entourage.

			Jim and Artemus take a moment to collect themselves, then 
			brighten as they realize:

							ARTEMUS
					Willard...

							JIM
					It's not a guy...

							ARTEMUS
					It's a town!

			They race to the bookshelf, pull down atlases and start 
			flipping through them.

							ARTEMUS
					Got to be somewhere that's hot.  
					He said it was "damnably hot."

							JIM
						(scanning the index)
					That rules out Willard, Vermont; 
					Willard, Minnesota...
						(brightening)
					Willard, New Mexico?

			Jim flips to the right page --

			ANGLE - ATLAS - MAP OF NEW MEXICO TERRITORY

			MOVE IN on the map, finding the tiny town of Willard.


			EXT.  THE WEST - DAY - THE WANDERER

			churns across the majestic western landscape we've been 
			waiting for!


			EXT.  THE WEST - NIGHT - THE WANDERER

			is a tiny speck streaking through the desert darkness.


			INT.  THE WANDERER - PARLOUR CAR - NIGHT

			Artemus lounges, smoking a cigar, his face hidden behind 
			a book: "A Guide To The Ancient Fighting Skills Of The 
			Oriental Races."

			Jim, on the other hand, paces the room, itching for action.

							JIM
					Damn, I wish this thing would go 
					faster.

							ARTEMUS
					Relax.  We're almost there.

							JIM
					We oughta get a couple of those 
					rockets.  Voom!  We're there before 
					we left!

			As Artemus lowers the book he's reading:

							ARTEMUS
					I'll work on it.

			Jim stares -- Artemus is in another disguise with a full 
			beard and bulbous nose.

							JIM
					What is that?

							ARTEMUS
					This?
						(fingers the nose)
					I'm testing a new spirit gum, to 
					see how it holds.

							JIM
					And people are actually fooled by 
					that?

							ARTEMUS
						(offended)
					My disguises have helped me solve 
					many a difficult case.  I spent 
					three years on the stage, you know.
						(standing and taking off 
						his make-up)
					Remind me sometime to regale you 
					with my Lear.

			The men get down to business, strapping on their guns.  
			Artemus hands Jim the infamous belt-buckle-derringer.

							JIM
					Not again.

							ARTEMUS
					I adjusted it.

			Jim reluctantly straps it on, takes a fighting stance, 
			and slaps the buckle.  Nothing happens.  He tries a few 
			more times.  Still no gun pops out.

							JIM
					So the idea is if a guy punches 
					me, he really hurts his hand?

							ARTEMUS
						(testy)
					You said it popped out too easily.  
					Nothing's ever good enough for 
					you, is it?

			The train BRAKES SQUEAL and we hear Doyle over the speaking 
			tube:

							DOYLE (V.O.)
					Willard, New Mexico... I... I think.


			EXT.  WILLARD - THE WANDERER - PARLOUR CAR - NIGHT

			Jim and Artemus step out and freeze.  Smoke blows past 
			them.  Doyle hurries to join them and they all silently 
			stare.  PAN TO REVEAL --

			The town has been utterly destroyed.  It's Hiroshima.  
			Buildings are shattered rubble.  Blackened timbers claw 
			up at the night sky.  Embers smolder everywhere.

			A twisted rifle lies in the dust.  A pair of boots juts 
			from under a smashed wagon.  A woman's ragged dress 
			flutters on a splintered beam.  There's not a soul around.

			Stunned Jim and Artemus stare hopelessly at the horrifying 
			scene.

							JIM
						(grim)
					When we find him, he is mine.

							ARTEMUS
					Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.

			Jim spots something.  Points off.

			ANGLE - THEIR P.O.V. - A LONE FIGURE

			on a nearby hilltop, silhouetted against a rising moon.


			EXT.  HILLTOP - NIGHT

			The figure is a Native American, an ACOMA BRAVE.  He's 
			utterly confused and stunned by what he's seen.  Jim and 
			Artemus quietly approach.

							ARTEMUS
					Hope he knows some English...

			But Jim holds up a hand, silencing Artemus, and sits beside 
			the man.  Jim uses sign language.  The entire scene plays 
			in SILENCE.  We see SUBTITLES for the following:

							JIM
						(signs)
					Did you see the thing that did 
					this?

			The man nods.

							JIM
						(signs)
					It was big?

							ACOMA BRAVE
						(signs)
					Very big.  Made of iron.

							JIM
						(signs)
					A lot of steam and noise?  With 
					big guns?

			The Indian nods.

							JIM
						(signs)
					Where is it now?  Where did it go?

			The man points off to some distant mountains.

							ACOMA BRAVE
						(signs)
					It lives there, in the Ghost 
					Mountains, where no living man 
					goes.

							JIM
					Figures.

							ARTEMUS
					What?  What figures?  What did he 
					see?


			EXT.  DESERT HILLS - NIGHT

			Jim and Artemus, now on horseback, ride along an old desert 
			trail in the moonlight..

							ARTEMUS
						(derisive)
					Ghost mountains...  No self 
					respecting ghost would live out 
					here.

			Jim's been eyeing the ground.

							JIM
					Awful lot of fresh wagon tracks 
					for a place "no living man goes."


			EXT.  NEAR THE MOUNTAINS - DAY

			Jim and Artemus still follow the tracks.

							ARTEMUS
					What if these tracks are just 
					leading us to an Indian village or 
					some old coot's mining claim?

							JIM
					Not likely.  There must be tracks 
					of twenty different wagons.  Freight 
					wagons, carriages, buckboards...

			Jim suddenly wheels his horse and stops.

							JIM
					Look at that.

			TILT DOWN TO SEE all the wagon tracks end abruptly along 
			a straight line.  Beyond the line is completely untouched 
			ground.

							ARTEMUS
					Well, that's something different.

			Jim follows the tracks back from the straight line, noting 
			that they all make a short detour to pass close to a lone 
			Joshua tree.

							JIM
					And they all make this little turn 
					here, to pass right by this Joshua 
					tree.

			Jim rides over to examine the tree.  He whacks it with 
			his pistol butt.  We hear an incongruous metallic CLANK!  
			Jim and Artemus exchange a look.

			Jim eyes a branch that extends over the trail -- gives it 
			a tentative pull.  It swings like a lever.  MACHINERY 
			RUMBLES underground.

			Artemus' horse rears as a rectangle of desert floor thirty-
			feet long LIFTS STRAIGHT UP!

			It's an underground elevator, its roof disguised as desert.  
			Where the wagon tracks have all stopped is the point where 
			wagons ride onto the elevator.

			Artemus turns graciously to Jim:

							ARTEMUS
					Excellent detective work, sir.
						(re the tunnel)
					You should have the honor of going 
					first.

							JIM
						(sarcastic)
					Oh, thank you.

							ARTEMUS
					My pleasure.

			Jim rides onto the platform.  Artemus follows.  He spots 
			another lever on the elevator wall and gives it a kick.  
			The elevator RUMBLES and starts to descend.


			INT.  TUNNEL - NIGHT

			Jim and Artemus are lowered into a long tunnel and start 
			riding cautiously toward dim light at the other end.


			INT.  TUNNEL - OTHER END - NIGHT

			Reaching the end of the tunnel, they find themselves 
			looking down on:


			EXT.  MIGUELITO'S LAIR - ESTABLISH - NIGHT

			In a hidden valley, surrounded on all sides by forbidding 
			mesas, sits a complex of buildings.  It's a self-contained 
			manufacturing center for God knows what.  Freight wagons 
			RUMBLE to and fro.  Steam shovels and traction engines 
			labor.  Electric lights cast an eerie glow on everything.

							ARTEMUS
					It looks like a factory.  And all
					lit with electrical lights!

			The dismount and lead their horses into a stand of trees, 
			during:

							JIM
					Let's split up.  It'll double our 
					chances of finding Dr. Pemberton.

			Artemus nods and they sneak off down the wagon road into 
			the valley.


			EXT.  MIGUELITO'S LAIR - WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

			A giant warehouse dominates the place.  Steam rolls out 
			its windows.  A deep RUMBLING comes from within.

			Out in front, in the glare of the lights, the steam tank 
			is being serviced by a crew of WORKERS.  It's even more 
			menacing than before -- fitted with a new turret featuring 
			a bigger steam cannon, a motorized Gatling gun, and twin 
			ROCKET LAUNCHERS!

			ANGLE - JIM

			in the shadows, stares at the machine with foreboding.  
			Now he hears HARPSICHORD MUSIC.  He looks off.

			ANGLE - JIM'S P.O.V. - MIGUELITO'S FACTORY OFFICE

			Atop a three story factory building sits Miguelito's 
			office, its elegant windows and lavish curtains out of 
			place in this rough-hewn environment.  The music's coming 
			from there.  This must be the place.

			But between him and his goal are a couple of armed GUARDS.


			EXT.  MIGUELITO'S FACTORY OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

			A big freight wagon rolls past between the GUARDS and the 
			outside stairway up to the office.  Unseen by them, Jim 
			is clinging to the offside of the wagon.  He hops off and 
			sprints up the stairs.


			INT.  MIGUELITO'S FACTORY OFFICE - NIGHT

			In a sumptuous, heavily decorated room, Miguelito holds 
			court behind a vast desk.  Antoinette plays dreamily on 
			her harpsichord while Cassandra and Voltaire listen.

			Just as Miguelito launches into the first few bars of his 
			anthem, the office door swings open.  Jim steps boldly 
			in, locking it from the inside.

			Everyone is dumbstruck for a moment.  Then Voltaire lunges 
			for him, but Jim's six-gun instantly appears, leveled at 
			the big man's face.

							JIM
					You're not that big.

							MIGUELITO
					Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's 
					just the sort of coward who would 
					shoot an unarmed giant.

			Voltaire backs off, glowering.  But Miguelito keeps his 
			cool, turning back to Jim.

							MIGUELITO
					Why, Mr. West.  I am impressed.
						(suddenly noticing)
					Ooh, a rhyme!

			Antoinette strikes a little "Ta Da" chord and smiles.

							MIGUELITO
						(going on)
					Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that 
					doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.

							JIM
					He had a pressing engagement.

							MIGUELITO
						(scowls at Jim)
					Philistine.

			Jim now aims his gun at the little man.

							JIM
					You got that right.  Now get up.  
					We're walking out of here.

							MIGUELITO
						(flaring)
					Has it penetrated that adrenaline-
					addled skull that you are surrounded 
					by seventy-eight of my loyal 
					followers?  You are in my domain!

							JIM
					Has it penetrated yours that I'm 
					holding a gun on their leader?

			You're under arrest.  Now move!

							MIGUELITO
						(bellows)
					You have no authority here!  You 
					are out of your jurisdiction!

			Jim thinks the little guy has lost a few more marbles.

							JIM
					The U.S. is my jurisdiction.

							MIGUELITO
					Exactly!  You are on foreign soil.  
					You are a representative of the 
					occupying forces.  Or haven't you 
					checked a map lately?!

			He hits a switch.  A large wall map of the United States 
			unfurls like a movie screen.  But the southern half of 
			California and a chunk of Arizona and New Mexico are all 
			in one color and labeled "LOVELAND."

							MIGUELITO
					These lands were taken by force 
					from Mexico in the illegal War of 
					American Aggression.

							JIM
					That would be... the Mexican War?

							MIGUELITO
					Call it what you like.  The point 
					is, I was heir to that land, Mr. 
					West.  It belonged to my beloved 
					grandmother!  Now I intend to have 
					it back.  My own country!

			He gestures to a flag on the opposite wall.

							MIGUELITO
					You see, I have everything.  A 
					flag...  My own postage stamps...

			He points out colorful stamps in a glass display case.  
			Then he digs in his jacket pocket.  Jim warily cocks his 
			pistol.

							MIGUELITO
					Oh relax!

			Miguelito slowly pulls out paper money, tossing the bills 
			on the desk in front of Jim.  They bear Miguelito's 
			portrait.

							MIGUELITO
					I've even printed my own currency.

							JIM
						(reading from a bill)
					"Emperor Miguelito...?"

							MIGUELITO
					The first.

							JIM
					Well, your highness, what makes 
					you think we'll ever sign a treaty 
					with you?

							MIGUELITO
					Because I am holding all the western 
					territories hostage, Mr. West!  A 
					town a day will disappear!  Willard 
					was merely a test run, a stroll in 
					the park.  Next, I level all of 
					Albuquerque!
						(off Jim's reaction)
					Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday 
					I learned what you undoubtedly 
					already know: your own President 
					will be there.  What an added bonus!  
					The gods are shining on me!  After 
					tomorrow every American citizen 
					will rise up and demand I be given 
					back my humble little empire!

							JIM
						(looking to the others)
					So, I'm the only one here who can 
					tell the difference between an 
					Emperor and a murderer?

			Miguelito glowers.

							MIGUELITO
					The definition of what I am, Mr. 
					West, depends simply on... whether 
					or not I win.  And guess what?  
					I'm going to win!

			With that he suddenly presses one of a row of brass buttons 
			on the edge of his desk.  A trap door opens!!

			But not under Jim.  It opens a couple of feet away.  Jim 
			smiles.  Miguelito is abashed.

							MIGUELITO
					Oh poo!  Don't you just hate it?  
					I mean, people are simply never 
					standing where they're supposed to 
					be!

			He sighs -- then wildly punches several more buttons.  
			Trap doors open all over the floor.  Jim agilely leaps 
			from spot to spot.  But he can't avoid the inevitable and 
			finally plunges from view.

			As the last trap door snaps shut, Miguelito strides over 
			smugly; then suddenly shouts at the floor:

							MIGUELITO
					You think I'm stupid?!
						(to the others)
					If he did, I bet he doesn't think 
					so now!  At least I hope he doesn't.  
					He'd better not!


			INT.  JAIL CELL - NIGHT

			We're in a dungeon-like room set up as a laboratory.  
			CAMERA PANS to a wall.  In a moment, the wall BANGS open -- 
			and Jim rockets out of a chute, skidding on his back 
			headfirst across the room.  The wall SLAMS shut.

			Jim slides right under a woman's flowing skirt!

							JIM (O.S.)
					Dr. Pemberton, I presume.

			He pulls his head out and finds a startled Dr. Pemberton 
			staring down at him.

							PEMBERTON
					Why... Mr. West!

			Jim quickly gets to his feet.  The room is full of 
			scientific equipment -- a combo lab-prison.

			Dr. Pemberton looks like she's been through a lot, face 
			dirty, clothes torn.

							JIM
					Are you all right?

							PEMBERTON
						(sighs)
					For the moment.  But I fear not 
					for long.  I'm of no use to him 
					now.

			Jim tries the bars on the window during:

							JIM
					You finished the work on his steam 
					engine?

			She nods sadly, her eyes misting:

							PEMBERTON
					They threatened to harm my father...
						(sudden anger)
					And it's my engine, stolen from my 
					own patents!  He put it in his big 
					war machine.  But of course he'd 
					installed the valves improperly.  
					It works perfectly now.

			Dr. Pemberton sinks down in a chair, hopelessly.

							PEMBERTON
					He... he's planning to kill us, 
					isn't he?

							JIM
					He's just full of plans that aren't 
					gonna work out.

			He looks around and grabs a small, thick-walled metal 
			cylinder among the lab equipment.  He examines it with 
			interest.

							JIM
					This is something.

							PEMBERTON
						(not following)
					It's a smelting retort.

			He unscrews the top of the cylinder, pours out the sandy

							JIM
					Now it's a bomb.

							PEMBERTON
					It is?

			He pulls a cartridge off his gun belt.

							JIM
					All how you look at things.

			He works the bullet out of the end of a cartridge and 
			dumps the gunpowder into the cylinder.  He hands her a 
			few cartridges, indicating she do the same.

							JIM
					Just have to get it hot enough, 
					and take cover.  Come on, help me 
					get the bullets out.


			EXT.  MIGUELITO'S FACTORY OFFICE - NIGHT

			From the top of the stairway outside his office, Miguelito 
			angrily berates a group of GUARDS assembled below.  (We 
			notice among them one particularly fierce guard -- a bushy-
			bearded, eye-patched roughneck.)

							MIGUELITO
					... Mr. West strolled right through 
					your defenses again!  I've had to 
					capture him again!  And Mr. Gordon 
					is undoubtedly lurking about again!  
					So find him and shoot him here!
						(points to his own forehead)
					With a big gun!


			INT.  JAIL CELL - NIGHT

			CLOSE ON the metal cylinder we saw Jim start to fill with 
			gunpowder.  It is now capped tight and wired to the bars 
			on the window.  A wad of FLAMING RAGS burns below it, 
			heating it up!

			PAN TO Jim and Dr. Pemberton hiding behind a barricade of 
			tables and equipment.


			EXT.  MIGUELITO'S FACTORY OFFICE - JAIL CELL - NIGHT

			BOOM!  Bars and bricks fly!


			INT.  MIGUELITO'S FACTORY OFFICE - NIGHT

			Miguelito, Cassandra, and Antoinette take cover as plaster 
			rains from the ceiling, shaken loose by the blast 
			downstairs.  Miguelito slaps on his new pith helmet:

							MIGUELITO
					Call it intuition.  Something tells 
					me Mr. West is still with us!
						(to Cassandra)
					Come, my dear!  Destiny calls!

			As Miguelito and Cassandra rush out, he calls back:

							MIGUELITO
					Mozart, Antoinette!  Mozart!

			She starts gamely playing the harpsichord.


			EXT.  MIGUELITO'S FACTORY OFFICE - JAIL CELL - NIGHT

			Jim, with Dr. Pemberton in tow, leaps out through the 
			smoke and dust.  They dash around the building --

			Only to find their escape blocked by FOUR GUARDS converging 
			ahead of them, their Winchesters aimed.  A tense standoff.  
			Jim's thinking about drawing when -- CLICK -- a Colt 
			Peacemaker is suddenly held to his head.

			WIDEN TO SEE it's the fierce, eye-patched, bearded guard.

			He barks at the other guards:

							GUARD
					What the hell's a matter with you 
					yella-bellies?  Orders is to shoot 
					Gordon.  Goes for them, too!
						(to Jim and Pemberton)
					Git movin'!

			He shoves his prisoners, marching them off behind a steam 
			shovel.  Almost immediately we hear TWO GUNSHOTS.

			ANGLE - BEHIND THE STEAM SHOVEL

			CLOSE ON Jim waiting for the bullet.  He looks over, 
			baffled.  The guard is holding the smoking pistol pointed 
			in the air.  He speaks:

							ARTEMUS
					Go ahead, make fun of this disguise.

			And Artemus pulls off his disguise!  Dr. Pemberton is 
			stunned.  Jim is very impressed.

							JIM
					No, this one is much better.

			Using the steam shovel as cover, the three hurry off into 
			the darkness.

													CUT TO:


			EXT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

			Jim, Artemus and Dr. Pemberton sneak along in the shadows, 
			staying low behind stacks of supplies.

							JIM
					Artemus, you ready for this?  His 
					next target is Albuquerque.

							ARTEMUS
					What?  President Grant is...!

							JIM
					I know!  I know!

							ARTEMUS
					I don't have to tell you what that 
					would do to our careers!

							JIM
					We've got to stop him right here, 
					now!  With that armored steam engine 
					of his it'll be a slaughter.

							ARTEMUS
					I'd love to stop him, but have you 
					noticed the hundred armed men?

							JIM
					There's only seventy-eight.

							ARTEMUS
						(sarcastic)
					Oh, well, then let's kick some 
					ass!

			Just then they hear a familiar nasty BUZZING.  It's a 
			SCREECHING boomerang bomb!

			Jim and Artemus realize what that must mean.  They spin 
			to Dr. Pemberton.  Then look at each other -- no time for 
			propriety.  They grab her blouse and yank it up.  She 
			SHRIEKS.  But there it is -- a metal belt just like 
			Professor Morton wore -- the deadly homing belt!

			They throw the poor woman to the ground and dive for cover 
			just as the thing streaks overhead, missing her by inches!

							ARTEMUS
					You didn't tell us you had this 
					on!

							PEMBERTON
						(gazing at the bomb)
					My Lord, he was telling the truth!

			The bomb loops high and dives on its final deadly attack.

			Miguelito's guards come running toward the action, but 
			they scramble back and take cover as the BUZZING bomb 
			whirls overhead.

			Jim draws his six-gun.  He coolly tracks the bomb and 
			FIRES.  BOOM!  Mid-air FIREBALL.  But they hear more 
			BUZZING.  Another bomb.  They look off to see --

			ANGLE - VOLTAIRE

			high up on a catwalk, loading a second flying bomb into a 
			weird cross-bow like launcher.  TWANG!  The thing streaks 
			toward Dr. Pemberton!

			BLAM!  Jim nails this one, too.  Voltaire snarls.

			Artemus pulls his lapel lock-pick and goes to work on the 
			belt lock.

			ANGLE - VOLTAIRE

			He loads two bombs at once!

			ANGLE - THE GROUP

			BLAM!  BLAM!  Jim blows both bombs out of the air!

							JIM
					Hurry up, Artemus!  I'm running 
					out of bullets!

			Two more boomerang bombs BUZZ angrily toward them.  BLAM!  
			Jim gets one.  But then -- CLICK!  Gun's empty.

			The second bomb keeps coming!

			Another CLICK!  But it's Artemus snapping the belt's lock 
			open!  He jumps up, whirling like a discus thrower and 
			heaves the belt in a high arc.

			The flying bomb does a screaming 180 to follow the belt!

			ANGLE - HORRIFIED VOLTAIRE

			sees the belt sailing toward him followed by the flying 
			bomb!  Oops.  It lands right below him.  He barely has 
			time to SCREAM before he's blown sky-high!

			ANGLE - THE GROUP

			Jim lifts Dr. Pemberton to her feet.

							JIM
					Are you all right?

			She nods uncertainly.  But meanwhile Miguelito's guards 
			and WORKERS are rallying.  TWO WORKERS rush out of hiding, 
			brandishing heavy hand tools as they rush Jim and Artemus.  
			Jim squares off to deal with them, but before he can make 
			a move, he's amazed to see Artemus instantly dispatch 
			them -- with a knockout double-split kick!

							ARTEMUS
						(shrugs)
					It was in your book.

							JIM
						(impressed)
					Well, hell, maybe we do have a 
					chance.

			But now a nasty sounding STEAM WHISTLE BLARES.

			ANGLE - THE STEAM TANK

			comes RUMBLING toward them from the warehouse.  It opens 
			FIRE with its motorized Gatling gun!

			BACK TO SCENE

			Jim, Artemus and Dr. Pemberton dive for cover!  BULLETS 
			RICOCHET all around them.  They scramble along on their 
			bellies behind stacked supplies.  Jim gets an idea, looking 
			at the buttons on Artemus' vest.

							JIM
					Are those just button buttons or...?

							ARTEMUS
					Of course not.

			Jim rips one off.

							JIM
					Stay down!

			And he runs!

							ARTEMUS
					Jim?!

			ANGLE - JIM

			scurries along behind the row of supplies, staying hidden 
			as he does an end-run around the approaching tank.

			Jim charges into the open, bee-lining for the tank.  He 
			grabs onto the massive rear wheel and rides it up.  As he 
			comes opposite the turret he lobs the button in through 
			one of the gunports!

			POOF!  Sleep gas surges out from inside the tank.

			Gagging and choking, the TANKMEN throw open the hatches, 
			collapsing unconscious as they tumble out.

			The machine keeps driving blindly forward.  Jim scrambles 
			up on top, takes a deep breath, and dives inside.


			INT.  STEAM TANK - MOVING

			Holding his breath, Jim yanks levers madly, trying to get 
			anything to do anything.  The turret spins.  Okay, got 
			that down.  The Gatling gun FIRES.  That's good.  More of 
			that.


			EXT.  STEAM TANK - MOVING

			Jim spins the turret in a circle, firing the Gatling as 
			he goes.  Miguelito's men run frantically in all 
			directions, diving for cover.

			ANGLE - ARTEMUS

			is also FIRING at the disorganized guards.

			The steam tank rolls up, offering a shield.  Jim pops up, 
			taking a much needed gasp of air as the last of the sleep 
			gas dissipates.  Artemus and Dr. Pemberton climb up into 
			the tank.

							ARTEMUS
					My hat is off to you, sir.

							JIM
					Thank you.

			They slam the hatch and they're off!


			INT.  STEAM TANK - MOVING

			Jim takes the steering controls.  Dr. Pemberton squeezes 
			in behind him.

							JIM
					I've got the driving part figured 
					out.  Artemus, you... figure out 
					the cannon part.

			Artemus eyes the gleaming controls for the exotic steam 
			cannon, having no idea what to do.

							ARTEMUS
					Right...


			EXT.  STEAM TANK - MOVING

			The steam tank gathers steam.  Frantic guards dive out of 
			the way.  Some FIRE wildly at the thing, but of course, 
			it does no good.

			As Jim struggles to steer, the tank careens drunkenly 
			around the compound, smashing into things while its Gatling 
			gun BLAZES and steam cannon HISSES.  Basically it's a 
			rout.  Miguelito's panicked men are running everywhere.

			ANGLE - MIGUELITO AND CASSANDRA

			come dashing through the turmoil, headed for the warehouse.


			INT.  STEAM TANK - MOVING

			Jim spots them and veers toward them.


			EXT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

			Miguelito and Cassandra disappear inside.  The steam tank 
			rolls up and stops.  Jim pops up out of the tank's hatch.

							JIM
					It's all over Loveless!  You might 
					as well come out!


			INT.  STEAM TANK

			Jim drops back down to his controls, ready for action.  
			Dr. Pemberton seems concerned:

							PEMBERTON
					You seem so confident, Mr. West.
					Do you really think we have any 
					chance in this little machine?

			Jim and Artemus turn slowly to stare at her worriedly.

							JIM
					I beg your pardon?

							PEMBERTON
						(realizing)
					You don't know what he's built?!  
					Surely you don't think he kidnapped 
					all those geniuses to have them 
					make something as rudimentary as 
					this.

			Jim and Artemus glance at each other.  Well, yeah, we 
			sort of did.  Outside Miguelito's men are LAUGHING 
			derisively.

			Before Dr. Pemberton can explain, they hear a GIGANTIC 
			RUSH OF STEAM!  With the eerie LAUGHTER echoing all around 
			them, Jim and Artemus peer out.


			EXT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

			Huge clouds of steam boil out of the warehouse.  Unseen 
			massive metal parts GROAN and CREAK.  The walls of the 
			building shudder.  The ground shakes.

			The roof of the building is shoved upward -- splintering, 
			cracking -- at last falling away to reveal the top of a 
			monstrous, fantastic war machine.

			We can see only the top "deck."  A hundred feet long, 
			black, brooding, massively constructed of riveted steel.

			At the forward end, a raised bridge oversees all.  It is 
			protected by unusual see-through armor -- curtains of 
			thick, tightly woven chain-mail which undulate weirdly as 
			the machine moves.  Through them we can just make out 
			Cassandra and gleeful Miguelito at the controls.

			The machine lurches forward, SMASHING through the wall of 
			the building.  We finally see the rest of it.

			It doesn't have wheels.

			It doesn't have treads.

			It has legs.  The thirty foot tall behemoth stands on six 
			immense, multi-jointed, piston-powered legs.

			This is THE TARANTULA.

			Its huge, bulbous body, three decks high, is suspended in 
			the center of the radiating legs.  The top deck is open.  
			The center deck contains the engine room and gearing.  
			The lower deck bristles with turret-mounted Gatling guns 
			and cannons.

			The body is surrounded by a bewildering "exoskeleton" -- 
			a cage of criss-crossing riveted girders and beams.  Narrow 
			catwalks run helter-skelter through the complex.

			It's intensely Jules Verne.  Everywhere things are moving -- 
			giant gears, whirling flywheels, gleaming pistons.  Steam 
			HISSES from dozens of vents.

			On the ground, the remainder of Miguelito's men come out 
			of hiding, CHEERING wildly, throwing their hats skyward.

			ANGLE - THE STEAM TANK

			Jim, Artemus, and Dr. Pemberton gaze up at the thing in 
			absolute dumbstruck wonder.

							ARTEMUS
					God in heaven, what is that?!

							JIM
					That's... that's the criminal mind 
					about to stomp our sorry butts!

							PEMBERTON
						(terrified)
					He calls it the Tarantula.

							ARTEMUS
					But it only has six legs.

							JIM
					Shut up.

			ANGLE - THE TARANTULA

			It turns toward them, giant CLANKING legs working in smooth 
			choreography -- the eerie, high-stepping gait of, well, 
			of a tarantula.  Each huge foot kicks up a cloud of dust 
			as it SLAMS down.

			The Tarantula's vast shadow falls across the hopelessly 
			minuscule steam tank.

			Jim, Artemus and Dr. Pemberton shrink down into the tank, 
			slamming the hatch.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - NIGHT

			The bridge is jammed with exotic controls: ratcheted 
			levers, steam valves, brass-rimmed gauges.  Cassandra 
			consults dials and spins valve-wheels as Miguelito works 
			the walking control levers.  Prominent in front of him is 
			a big red-painted lever, the Master Speed Control.

			The rest of the top deck is a maze of exposed machinery, 
			pumping, throbbing, and spinning -- OSHA was not consulted.

			And the view is spectacular -- a commanding 360 degrees 
			through the chain-mail armor curtains.

			Miguelito smiles down at the puny steam tank.

							MIGUELITO
					Aww!  You took my little steam gun 
					carriage!  I guess I'll just have 
					to get along without it!


			EXT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

			The Steam Tank jerks into reverse FIRING everything she 
			has -- Gatlings, cannon, rockets.

			ROUNDS EXPLODE against the superstructure of the Tarantula, 
			but don't leave a scratch!


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - NIGHT

			A cannonball from the steam tank strikes the chain mail 
			curtain.  The curtain bulges inward, but stops the shell 
			a foot from Miguelito's head, then springs back, flinging 
			the shell away to explode harmlessly in the air.

							MIGUELITO
						(exultant)
					It works!  Did you see that?

			Cassandra flashes him a heady grin.  He gets a new idea:

							MIGUELITO
					Watch this!  Oh, watch this!


			EXT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

			The Tarantula raises one of its six legs, swinging it out 
			over the steam tank.  The tank backs up desperately but 
			not fast enough.

			SQUASH.  The tank is half-accordioned.  As the massive 
			steel foot rises, the tank's sprung belly hatch pops open.  
			Jim, Artemus, and Dr. Pemberton scramble out.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - NIGHT

			Miguelito revels as only he can:

							MIGUELITO
					Crushed you like a bug!  Feeling a 
					bit Lilliputian, Mr. Tall-in-the-
					Saddle, Mr. Fit and Handsome?!


			EXT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

			The Tarantula marches off with a jaunty step, climbing 
			effortlessly up the steep hillside.

			Miguelito's remaining men CHEER wildly as the great machine 
			clears the hilltop.


			EXT.  THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

			Jim leads the way as they race back to where they left 
			their horses.

							JIM
					Come on!  We'll beat that thing to 
					Albuquerque!  Let's get to the 
					Wanderer!

			As Artemus hauls Dr. Pemberton along:

							PEMBERTON
					He's not giving up?

							ARTEMUS
					Well, see, he had this little wagon 
					when he was a kid...


			EXT.  DESERT - DAWN

			As the sun rises, we see the Wanderer waiting at a siding 
			in the distance.

			ANGLE - DOYLE

			bides his time using his long-necked oil can to fill the 
			oil-cups on the engine's side-rods.  He looks up to see 
			Jim, Artemus and Dr. Pemberton GALLOPING toward him on 
			their two horses.

							JIM
					Albuquerque, Mr. Doyle!

													CUT TO:


			EXT.  DESERT - DAY

			The Wanderer bullets along the rails at full throttle!


			EXT.  DESERT - MESA - DAY

			We hear a foreboding SOUND -- steam locomotive plus 
			elephant stampede.  From behind the mesa treks Miguelito's 
			fantastic machine, weird six-legged stride giving it a 
			bizarre gait.  Jets of steam ROAR from its vents, keeping 
			syncopated time to its SEISMIC footfalls.

			As the machine lumbers past we can hear SINGING:

							MIGUELITO (V.O.)
					... Like an eagle on the wing!
					Oh, Loveland, mighty Loveland...!


			EXT.  ALBUQUERQUE - ESTABLISH - DAY

			The young Western town clings to the green-belt ribbon of 
			the Rio Grande.


			EXT.  ALBUQUERQUE - CENTRAL AVENUE - DAY

			The celebration of the Presidential visit is in full swing.  
			Banners adorn Central Avenue.  An exuberant CROWD has 
			gathered, men and ladies in their finest.  A BAND plays a 
			rousing march.  A company of SOLDIERS stands guard.

			At the East end of town --

			ANGLE - A HYDROGEN OBSERVATION BALLOON

			sways majestically on its tethers, hung with colorful 
			bunting.  SOLDIERS manning it offer free rides to the 
			public.  A wagon holds the complex of hydrogen generating 
			equipment fed to the balloon through big canvas tubes.

			ANGLE - A BANDSTAND

			President Grant and smiling local DIGNITARIES preside 
			over the festivities.  The GOVERNOR steps to the lectern 
			and signals the BANDLEADER, who brings the march to a 
			close with several big BASS DRUM HITS.

							GOVERNOR
					Ladies and gentlemen of the great 
					territory of New Mexico...

			Under his speech, deep BASS THUMPS continue.  THUD.  THUD.  
			THUD.  The bandleader glares at the BASS DRUMMER, who 
			shrugs helplessly: "I ain't doing it!"

							GOVERNOR
					... it is with great honor I present 
					to you the President of the United 
					States, Ulysses S. Grant!

			The crowd CHEERS wildly.  Grant takes the stand.  But 
			before he speaks, he becomes aware of the eerie THUDDING, 
			growing louder and louder.

			More and more people hear it, looking around, falling 
			SILENT.  The ominous sound permeates the atmosphere.  
			Where's it coming from?  What could it be?

			A CRY goes up.  Hands point.  Heads turn.

			ANGLE - A DISTANT BLUFF

			Dust boils from behind it.

			The Tarantula marches slowly up into view.  It pauses on 
			the hilltop surveying the town like a monstrous predator.

			ANGLE - TOWNSFOLK

			Stunned.  Fascinated.  The sight is so astounding they 
			have no idea how to react.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - DAY

			Miguelito and Cassandra gaze at the distant crowd.

							MIGUELITO
					I could get used to this, looking 
					down on people.

							CASSANDRA
					They don't even realize they should 
					be frightened.

							MIGUELITO
					Well, let's help them with that.  
					Take the legs.

			Cassandra takes over the walking levers.  Miguelito moves 
			to a new set of controls.  He stomps a treadle, and an 
			ornate glass disk rises out of the floor, stopping in 
			front of his face.  It is etched with concentric circles 
			and range numbers -- a 19th century heads-up aiming 
			display.  He squints through it, then shouts into a 
			speaking tube:

							MIGUELITO
					Forward guns ready!


			EXT.  TARANTULA - GUNNERY DECK - DAY

			At the front of the machine, steam cannon barrels slide 
			out of ports in the armored lower deck.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - DAY

							MIGUELITO
					"Look on my works, ye mighty, and 
					despair!"

			Miguelito merrily yanks the fire controls!


			EXT.  ALBUQUERQUE - CENTRAL AVENUE - DAY

			The first rounds go wide and high, BLASTING a water tower; 
			throwing up geysers in the Rio Grande.  But the townsfolk 
			get the point.

			Bedlam!  Screams!  Utter chaos!

			The next rounds are more accurate -- explosions march 
			down the street toward the bandstand.  Grant and the 
			dignitaries dive unceremoniously off as the bandstand is 
			shattered.

			Another blast shears a flagpole and the American flag 
			flying over the courthouse topples in the dust.

			Civilians run everywhere.  Riderless horses buck wildly.  
			Soldiers are stunned, paralyzed.

			PRESIDENT GRANT

			rises from the dust, glaring off at the monstrous machine.  
			The old war veteran hears the call to battle.  He bellows 
			at the soldiers:

							GRANT
					Soldier, pick up your rifle!  You, 
					get those horses under control!  
					Man the field pieces!  Get the 
					women and children under cover!


			EXT.  THE WANDERER - LOCOMOTIVE - DAY

			The train thunders along, everybody now in the cab.  Dr. 
			Pemberton leans way out, face sooty, hair flying, shouting 
			to Doyle:

							PEMBERTON
						(re the locomotive)
					The cylinders are perfectly 
					balanced.  You're getting no back-
					lash even at this speed!

							DOYLE
					Dear me, woman, you do know your 
					engines!

			Doyle gazes at her.  Fascinating woman.

			Jim and Artemus point ahead simultaneously:

							JIM
					There it is!


			EXT.  TARANTULA - DAY

			Miguelito's walking war weapon marches along ahead of 
			them, bearing down on Albuquerque.

			CANNON and small-arms fire ECHO from the city as Grant 
			and the soldiers mount a hopeless defense.  Puny explosions 
			PUFF around the advancing machine like so much harmless 
			flak.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - DAY

			Ignoring the EXPLOSIONS and RICOCHETS, Miguelito hums his 
			National Anthem as he spins from the fire controls to an 
			elaborate pedestal-mounted pair of field glasses.

							MIGUELITO
						(to Cassandra)
					So, my dear, what would you like 
					to be?  Princess?  Duchess?  
					Countess...?

			He peers through the glasses at the fleeing citizens.

							MIGUELITO
					Yes, run, run.  Cower.  Hide.  
					Cringe!  Prostrate yourselves 
					before...
						(suddenly)
					Wait!  There he is!  It's Grant!  
					Commander-and-Chief of the occupying 
					forces!  Stop, stop!  I need to 
					aim carefully!

			Cassandra heaves back on the red Master Speed Control 
			lever, bringing the Tarantula to a swaying stop.  Miguelito 
			springs to his aiming display glass.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - GUNNERY DECK - DAY

			Again the menacing steam cannons slide out into firing 
			position.

			But CAMERA BOOMS DOWN along the powerful legs, continuing 
			down, down to REVEAL --

			The Tarantula is standing right on the railroad tracks!


			EXT.  THE WANDERER - DAY

			Jim, Artemus and Doyle see this.  Too good to be true.

			Jim looks at Doyle.  Doyle knows what he's thinking.

							DOYLE
						(with a mad grin)
					Would you be thinking... ramming 
					speed, sir?

							JIM
					I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?

			Doyle nods.  Artemus turns to Dr. Pemberton:

							ARTEMUS
					Time for you to get off, Ma'am.

							PEMBERTON
					Like hell!  I'll see it through!
					Ram the bastard!

			With an admiring double-take at this spirited woman, Doyle 
			spits a stream of tobacco and throws the throttle wide.  
			The Wanderer SHOOTS FORWARD!


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - DAY

			Miguelito sights through his aiming glass.

							MIGUELITO
					Adios, Mr. President!

			But Cassandra glimpses something to one side.

							CASSANDRA
					Miguelito!!

			She dives for the leg control levers, yanking them.


			EXT.  RAILROAD TRACKS - DAY

			The Wanderer is seconds from colliding with the Tarantula 
			when the big machine leans crazily sideways.  The two 
			legs on the tracks lift quickly up.  It balances like a 
			dog taking a pee.

			The Wanderer BLASTS past underneath, so close that the 
			locomotive's smokestack is ripped off as it clips a huge 
			steel foot.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - DAY

			The bridge yaws way over as Cassandra fights to keep the 
			machine's balance.  Miguelito tumbles ungracefully across 
			the floor and plows headfirst into a chain-mail curtain.  
			He scrambles up, composes himself, and peers out.

							MIGUELITO
					It's West and Gordon!  Again!  I 
					would never have given them their 
					own train!


			EXT.  THE WANDERER - DAY

			Doyle hits the brakes.  The train SCREECHES to a stop at 
			the edge of town.

							DOYLE
					Shall I reverse her, sir?

							PEMBERTON
					Yes!  Let's do it again!

			But Artemus is looking back.

							ARTEMUS
					No... I'm afraid it's time to 
					abandon ship.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - DAY

			The agile machine is twisting around, bringing the forward 
			steam guns to bear on the Wanderer.

			The cannons open FIRE!


			EXT.  THE WANDERER - DAY

			The EXPLODING SHELLS literally chew up the train, blowing 
			apart the parlour car, the sleeping car, the tender.

			Doyle grabs Dr. Pemberton.  They dive out one side.  Jim 
			and Artemus dive out the other just as --

			BLAAAM!  The beautiful locomotive takes a direct hit and 
			is blown sky-high in a massive steam and TNT blast!

			ANGLE - JIM AND ARTEMUS

			scramble to their feet, staring off angrily at their 
			trashed ride.

							ARTEMUS
					My God!  He's so excessive!

							JIM
					Where have you been?

			A HELLISH NOISE interrupts them.  The Tarantula's gunners 
			have opened up with MOTORIZED GATLING GUNS.  At an 
			unthinkable 3800 shots a minute, they cut a terrifying 
			swathe toward the duo.  It looks like the ground itself 
			is boiling.  Jim and Artemus run like hell and dive into 
			an arroyo.

			After the bulletstorm ROARS over them, they peek up.

			THE TARANTULA

			pivots back on course, marching onward.

			ANGLE - JIM

			looks around desperately.  If there's a way to fight that 
			thing, he'd love to come up with it now.

			ANGLE - JIM'S P.O.V. -- THE OBSERVATION BALLOON

			sways serenely in the distance.

			BACK TO SCENE

			Jim stares at it, an idea hatching.

							JIM
					Artemus, come on!

			He charges for the balloon!  Baffled Artemus gives chase.

							ARTEMUS
					I'm with you, Jim!  Just tell me 
					what I'm doing!


			EXT.  ALBUQUERQUE - CENTRAL AVENUE - CHURCH - DAY

			Having nowhere else to run, the townsfolk have taken refuge 
			inside a church at the end of the street.

			Grant and the few soldiers who aren't dead or wounded man 
			field-guns behind a hastily thrown-together barricade in 
			front of the a church.

							GRANT
					Stand your ground.  We'll fire at 
					point blank range!

			A SERGEANT points off.

							SERGEANT
					Who the hell is that?

			It's Jim and Artemus, heading pell-mell for --


			EXT.  OBSERVATION BALLOON - DAY

			They reach the balloon.  Jim grabs a line and ties the 
			balloon to the wagon carrying the hydrogen generating 
			equipment.

							JIM
					Pull the balloon right in front of 
					him!  We'll board the damn thing!

							ARTEMUS
					Oh, I see, an easy plan!

			Artemus leaps into the wagon, grabs the reins and charges 
			away, towing the balloon behind while Jim clambers up 
			into the basket.

			The wagon races along, Artemus towing the balloon right 
			into the path of the oncoming Tarantula.  Jim shouts from 
			the balloon:

							JIM
					All right, Artemus!  Get up here!

			Artemus reins in the horses and leaps into the back of 
			the wagon to untie the balloon.

			But a withering burst of Gatling fire tears up the wagon, 
			literally cutting it in half.  It collapses.  Artemus 
			falls with it.  The balloon's rope rips free.

			Bullets ZINGING around him, Artemus rolls for cover.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - DAY

			Miguelito gapes as this madman in a balloon soars up 
			directly in front of him.  He hops up and down BELLOWING:

							MIGUELITO
					Will you just stop?!
						(into speaking tubes)
					Fire!  Fire!  Don't you see him?


			INT.  TARANTULA - GUNNERY DECK - DAY

			The Gatling gunners try to swivel their guns up for a 
			shot at Jim, but the barrels just hit the top of the gun 
			ports.  No one ever thought they'd have to shoot up.


			EXT.  THE TARANTULA

			marches down Central Avenue.  Miguelito swerves to one 
			side, trying to avoid passing beneath Jim.

			The gargantuan machine SMASHES THROUGH a saloon as though 
			the building were a house of cards.


			EXT.  OBSERVATION BALLOON - DAY

			Seeing the Tarantula avoiding him, Jim swiftly uncoils a 
			rope, forming a lasso.  He's only got one shot and he 
			knows it.  As the monster keeps veering away, he lets fly 
			with a cowboy YELL -- and snags it!

			WHOOSH, the balloon is instantly taken into tow, hauled 
			behind at a crazy angle -- the world's biggest kite.

			Without hesitation, Jim climbs out of the basket and starts 
			down the taut rope, hand over hand.  He reaches the criss-
			crossing "exoskeleton" girders on the very stern and 
			gingerly begins to climb down.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - DAY

			Miguelito brings the Tarantula to a lurching stop.  The 
			chain-mail curtains WHOOSH aside.  He and Cassandra rush 
			out.  They can see the balloon flying above the stern, 
			but Jim has disappeared.

							MIGUELITO
					Find West!  Find him!  Get him 
					off!  You know, kill him... if 
					that's humanly possible!

			Murder in her eyes, Cassandra pulls a big-bore derringer 
			from her garter and moves off aft.  The deck starts 
			undulating as Miguelito fires up the Tarantula again.

			Down below, Miguelito's gunners open up on Grant and his 
			men with the turret-mounted Gatlings.


			EXT.  ALBUQUERQUE - CENTRAL AVENUE - ARTEMUS

			sees the Tarantula start to move, lifting its legs out of 
			the rubble of the saloon.  If he's going to act, he'd 
			better act now.

							ARTEMUS
						(psyching himself up)
					Oh, all right!  Act first and worry 
					later!

			He lunges for the massive foot and grabs on.

			He's carried high in the air as the foot is raised to 
			clear the wrecked building.  The foot starts back down.  
			He braces for the shock, clinging to the riveted cross-
			members of the "ankle."  WHOOM!  The foot slams down, but 
			he hangs on.

			The leg stays still for a moment while the other legs do 
			their thing.  In this pause Artemus scrambles partway up.  
			Avoiding thrusting pistons, he can only climb during the 
			pauses, but he's getting there.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - DAY

			Jim finally drops down onto the deck.  It's a nightmare 
			maze of air intakes, reciprocating gears and pumping 
			pistons that protrude through it from the engine deck 
			below.  Jim eases along a narrow catwalk, avoiding the 
			gyrating machinery.

			He ducks as a big counter-weight swings across the catwalk.  
			The move saves his life as POW, a shot strikes the bulkhead 
			where he was.  He pops up, gun drawn, but hesitates for a 
			second when he sees it's Cassandra who fired.  In that 
			moment, the counterweight swings back, knocking Jim's 
			pistol right out of his hand.  It skids across the deck 
			and drops into a narrow grating.  Jim tries to reach it, 
			but his arm is too big to fit through.

			He jumps up as Cassandra advances on him, moving around 
			an immense reciprocating gear protruding up through the 
			deck.  Jim backs up, punching the derringer belt buckle a 
			couple of times.  No good.

							CASSANDRA
					I had hoped I wouldn't be the one 
					who had to do this, Mr. West.  I 
					usually don't mind killing a man.  
					But in your case I find myself 
					strangely conflicted.

			Jim fixes her with a deadly look.

							JIM
					You know, I really hate being toyed 
					with before someone shoots me.

							CASSANDRA
						(with a shrug)
					Fine, I'll stop.

			She FIRES!  The shot hits Jim in the stomach -- right in 
			the derringer belt buckle!  SPANG!  The derringer flips 
			out and FIRES.

			Cassandra is hit squarely.  Pure shock and surprise on 
			her face, she sags sideways toward the ROARING gears.  
			She weakly grabs onto a cross member.  Eyes wide with 
			terror, she holds herself suspended above the gears, but 
			her fingers are slipping.

			Jim lunges to catch her, but is too late.  With a horrid 
			SHRIEK Cassandra pitches forward.

													CUT TO:


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - DAY

			Cassandra's distant SCREAM is lost in the machine noise.  
			The Tarantula lurches uncertainly as one of the levers 
			jams momentarily.  Miguelito wiggles it, then taps a 
			pressure gauge.  Seems to be all right now.  He looks 
			behind him nervously, then grabs a brass speaking tube:

							MIGUELITO
					Cassandra?


			EXT.  TARANTULA - ENGINE DECK - DAY

			Artemus has climbed up to the "knee" of the leg.  Here it 
			makes a sharp bend back down to pass through the wall of 
			the middle deck.  When the leg moves back, there is a gap 
			in the wall just big enough to slide through.  When the 
			leg steps forward the gap closes.

			Timing it just right, Artemus slides down the leg and 
			through the gap!


			INT.  TARANTULA - ENGINE DECK - DAY

			Artemus drops onto a precarious walkway in the heart of 
			the Tarantula, a bewildering M.C. Escher chamber of 
			whirling gears, spinning fly-wheels, hissing pistons, 
			massive CLANKING drive chains.

			He's spotted by a UNIFORMED CREWMAN across the chamber.  
			They both pull six guns and rapid fire!  But the 
			oscillating machinery between them blocks all twelve 
			shots, bullets RICOCHETING everywhere.  Artemus and the 
			crewman blink at each other, unhurt, unbelieving.

			Then the crewman charges.  They go at it HAND TO HAND, at 
			every moment in danger of falling into the works.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - DAY

			Jim works his way cautiously toward the bridge.

			Miguelito's VOICE comes over the speaking tubes:

							MIGUELITO (O.S.)
					Cassandra, answer me!


			INT.  TARANTULA - ENGINE DECK - DAY

			The powerful crewman has pinned Artemus against a railing, 
			choking him.  Beside them is a big whirling flywheel.  
			Artemus spots the man's long key chain hooked to his belt.  
			He lets go of the man's arms for an instant and flicks 
			the keychain over into the spokes of the flywheel.

			In a flash the startled crewman is yanked sideways and 
			instantly sucked into the machinery.  Artemus stands and 
			dusts himself off.  Problem solved.

			Then a door flies open.  Five ANGRY CREWMEN burst in -- 
			coal-stokers armed with wrenches, shovels, and what-have-
			you.  They advance menacingly.  Artemus gulps.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - DAY

							MIGUELITO
					Cassandra?  Cassandra!  Engine 
					deck!  Send someone up here to 
					help me!

			A VOICE comes back over the speaking tube:

							VOICE (O.S.)
					As soon as possible, sir!  We have 
					an intruder on board.

							MIGUELITO
					I know that, you idiot!  That's 
					why I want help!


			EXT.  CENTRAL AVENUE - CHURCH - DAY

			The Tarantula ambles slowly down the street, smashing 
			awnings, stomping boardwalks, shearing off signs, coming 
			closer and closer to the church.

			Grant and his soldiers fire futilely at it, ducking the 
			withering Gatling return fire.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - DAY

			Miguelito glowers as he deliberately steers the machine 
			left and right, smashing whatever catches his eye.

			Suddenly he's scooped up and tossed aside.  It's Jim who's 
			sneaked onto the bridge.  He triumphantly steps forward 
			and shoves the Master Speed Control, shutting down the 
			Tarantula.  He turns to Miguelito:

							JIM
					For an Emperor you're one bad 
					driver.

			But Miguelito has grabbed Artemus' walking stick and comes 
			at him like a wildman!  Jim backpedals, trying to fend 
			off the blows, but finally he has no choice.  He spin-
			kicks the guy right out onto the deck.

			The little man slides across the top deck, slamming into 
			a bulkhead.  The walking stick goes skittering away down 
			an access hatch.  Now defenseless, he leaps up and runs 
			off.  Jim runs after him.


			INT.  TARANTULA - ENGINE DECK - DAY

			Artemus has been backed up to a wall by the five stokers.  
			They're about to do him in when, TING, TANG, CLINK, 
			something comes tumbling down from above.  It lands right 
			in Artemus' hand.  He can't imagine how it's possible, 
			but it's his walking stick.

							ARTEMUS
					Deus ex machina!

			The tables are instantly turned.  Artemus snaps it open 
			into mace mode and attacks with a vengeance, a wild-ass 
			one-man tornado.

			He forces the stunned stokers out through a hatchway, and 
			SLAMS the metal door, locking them out.

			He spins and expertly assesses the complex of machinery 
			all around him.

							ARTEMUS
					Let's see... that goes there... so 
					that must do that... so that has 
					to be connected to...  Ah hah!

			He grabs a big wrench and begins unbolting one of the 
			long connecting rods.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - DAY

			Jim searches for Miguelito in the maze of top deck 
			machinery.  He spots him lying face-down on a grating.

							JIM
					It's all over, little guy.

			But Miguelito suddenly rolls over, pulling his arm out 
			from the grating, having found Jim's own six-gun which he 
			aims at him!

							MIGUELITO
					Look what I found!

			Startled Jim raises his hands, backing up.

							JIM
					Easy now.

							MIGUELITO
					Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds 
					should I take it easy!?


			INT.  TARANTULA - ENGINE DECK - DAY

			Artemus is merrily disconnecting connecting rods, tossing 
			them out a nearby porthole.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - DAY

			Jim is backed up against the control console, totally 
			cornered.  His eyes dart around as Miguelito takes very 
			deliberate aim.

							MIGUELITO
					I will say this, Mr. West, I have 
					never had to kill someone so many 
					times!

			Jim suddenly shoves the Master Speed Control full forward.  
			The deck tilts wildly as the Tarantula lunges ahead.  
			Miguelito's SHOT goes wild and the little Emperor tumbles 
			backward away from the bridge again.

			Jim hangs on, marveling at the power of the machine.

							JIM
					Man, I gotta get me one of these!


			EXT.  TARANTULA - DAY

			The huge machine rears up like an arachno-stallion and 
			then plunges down the street, CLANKING, HISSING -- 
			ACCELERATING.


			INT.  TARANTULA - ENGINE DECK - DAY

			Artemus hangs on as the room pitches and rolls, doggedly 
			working to unbolt one last connecting rod.  Got it!


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - DAY

			Miguelito skids helplessly across the rocking deck and -- 
			disappears HOWLING down an air intake!


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - DAY

			In the gyrating bridge Jim fights to keep his balance, 
			struggling back to the Master Control.  He yanks it back 
			with grand finality -- and nothing happens.  The maniacal 
			mechanical menace keeps going!  He frantically works the 
			lever back and forth.  No good.

							JIM
					Hey!  Stop!

			Just beside the bridge, Artemus comes up out of a hatch, 
			proudly holding up the last connecting rod.

							ARTEMUS
					Jim!  I did it!  I've uncoupled 
					all the connecting rods!  There's 
					no way they can control this thing 
					now!

			He triumphantly flings this last rod overboard.  Jim stares 
			at him, aghast.  Artemus looks around:

							ARTEMUS
					Why is it going so fast?

			The Tarantula keeps accelerating.


			EXT.  CENTRAL AVENUE - CHURCH - DAY

			Grant and the soldiers eye the Tarantula THUNDERING toward 
			them -- a steel tidal wave.

							SOLDIER
					It ain't stoppin'...  IT AIN'T 
					STOPPIN'!

							GRANT
					Get everyone out of the church!  
					Get them out!  MOVE!

			The Tarantula is fifty yards from the front steps.  
			Panicked townsfolk spill out the doors, tumble out the 
			windows.

			ANGLE - REAR OF THE CHURCH

			President Grant climbs out a window carrying one last 
			person, a LAUGHING TWO YEAR-OLD.

			Grant barely manages to dive out of the way as --

			ANGLE - WIDE

			The Tarantula PLOWS THROUGH THE CHURCH.  The building 
			EXPLODES into toothpicks.

			PAN with the monster machine as it pounds onward out into 
			the desert, literally starting to gallop, huge feet 
			throwing up truckloads of earth with every SMASHING IMPACT.


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - DAY

			Jim and Artemus argue as they spin knobs, crank cranks, 
			and try anything to slow down the galloping beast.

							ARTEMUS
					The machine was stopped!  It seemed 
					like a perfect time to disable it!  
					Why'd you have to throw it into 
					full throttle?!

							JIM
					He was going to shoot me!  Do you 
					mind?!

							ARTEMUS
					All right, all right... It'll be 
					okay.  I mean, eventually it'll 
					just run out of steam.

							JIM
						(pointing ahead)
					In the next two minutes?

			Artemus looks -- and goes pale.


			EXT.  HIGH AND WIDE - DEEP CANYON - DAY

			The Tarantula's headed straight for it!


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - BRIDGE - DAY

			Jim and Artemus stare at impending doom.  Then Jim gets 
			an idea.  He looks back to see the Tarantula is still 
			towing the observation balloon.

							JIM
					Come on!


			EXT.  TARANTULA - TOP DECK - STERN - DAY

			Jim and Artemus race to the rope holding the balloon.

			Jim frantically tries to untie it.

							ARTEMUS
					Here!

			Artemus kicks the heel of his boot -- out pops the knife 
			blade.  It's a ridiculously awkward task, madly sawing on 
			the thick rope with his toe, but it's their only hope.  
			Strand by strand it gives way.

			Jim glances ahead -- that cliff is coming up fast!

			Suddenly, right beside them, a hatch slams open.

			Miguelito pops out, still brandishing Jim's gun.

							MIGUELITO
					Now you die!

			Totally deadpan, Jim and Artemus simply point ahead.  
			Miguelito turns and sees the onrushing cliff.  He instantly 
			drops the gun and gestures desperately to the rope:

							MIGUELITO
					Hurry!  Cut it!  Do it, you idiot!  
					Do you want to die?!

							ARTEMUS
					Can you muzzle him or something?!

			The rope starts to pop and unravel.

							JIM
					There it goes!  Hang on!

			Jim grabs the rope.


			EXT.  DEEP CANYON - DAY

			The monster machine plummets over the edge, legs flailing, 
			dragging the balloon behind it!


			EXT.  ALBUQUERQUE - DAY

			Dr. Pemberton and Doyle are horrified at the sight.  Are 
			Jim and Artemus goners?


			EXT.  TARANTULA IN FREEFALL - DAY

			The three men are weightless with the flailing Tarantula.  
			Jim still clings to the rope.

			And it finally SNAPS.  Jim just manages to catch Artemus 
			by the wrist.  Artemus just manages to snag Miguelito by 
			the ankle and all three of them whip skyward!

			Up they sail, hanging beneath the ascending balloon, 
			Miguelito dangling upside-down.  He covers his eyes as --

			ANGLE - CANYON FLOOR

			The magnificent Tarantula slams into the rocks like the 
			asteroid that killed the dinosaurs!  It shatters into a 
			million fragments, EXPLODING in a volcano of steam!

			ANGLE - JIM, ARTEMUS AND MIGUELITO

			drift along, staring down at the devastation.  Finally:

							MIGUELITO
					I don't suppose you have any idea 
					what that thing cost, do you?


			EXT.  ALBUQUERQUE - DAY

			Doyle and Dr. Pemberton are horrified as a huge fire-ball 
			rises out of the canyon.  How could anyone have survived?


			EXT.  DEEP CANYON - DAY

			Then the balloon rises gracefully into view, Jim, Artemus, 
			and Miguelito dangling beneath.


			EXT.  ALBUQUERQUE - DAY

			Doyle and Dr. Pemberton are overjoyed to see them among 
			the living.  TILT UP TO SEE:

			The balloon drifting slowly down toward the amazed, 
			grateful, CHEERING townsfolk.  And we HEAR:

							MIGUELITO
					I remind you all you're dealing 
					with a genius!  Already I am 
					analyzing my mistakes!  I was 
					thinking too small!  Next time I 
					won't settle for just the Southwest!  
					Oh no!  Next time...

												DISSOLVE TO:


			EXT.  ALBUQUERQUE TRAIN STATION - DAY

			Artemus walks slowly toward the station, clearly dejected, 
			reading a letter over and over.

			A lonely STEAM WHISTLE sounds in the distance.  He looks 
			off.  A train is coming.

			But as the locomotive draws near, he realizes -- it's an 
			exact copy of the Wanderer.  Except the engine is Number 
			5, the number the show's fans know (and they thought we 
			had it wrong all this time).  Artemus is stunned.

			As the train steams in, he's further astonished to see 
			Doyle leaning out of the cab with a big grin.

							DOYLE
					A good mornin' to you, sir.  Have 
					you met my new fireman?

			Artemus does yet another take as he sees Doyle's new 
			"Fireman" -- beaming Dr. Pemberton!

			Now Jim comes hurrying along, dressed in his Western 
			finest, carrying his saddlebags.

							JIM
					Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand 
					spanking new.  She's a beauty, 
					huh?  Let's get rolling.

							ARTEMUS
					What is this?  A whole new train?

							JIM
					Well, sure.  Didn't you get your 
					orders?

			Artemus glumly holds out the letter.

							ARTEMUS
					Yes... yes I did.  I'm to take the 
					three-thirty train to Baltimore.  
					I've been assigned a desk job in 
					the exciting mail fraud division.

			Jim studies the letter, shocked.  He hands it back to 
			Artemus.

							JIM
					Oh... am I embarrassed.  The 
					President made my assignment 
					permanent.  New train, two weeks 
					vacation and everything.  I just 
					assumed... I mean... I'd never 
					have asked you to meet me here if 
					I'd known.

			Artemus tries to shrug it off.

							ARTEMUS
					Jim, Jim... forget it.  Obviously 
					your work impressed everyone.  
					Certainly impressed me.
						(after a pause)
					You're kind of unpredictable but 
					you are the best partner I've ever 
					had.

			He gives Jim a heartfelt handshake.

							JIM
					Damn, Artemus, I'm going to miss 
					you... and your gadgets, and your 
					disguises... your smartass 
					sarcasm...

			Artemus smiles weakly.  Doyle TOOTS the WHISTLE.

							DOYLE
					All aboard, sir!  Got a schedule 
					to keep.

			Jim and Artemus part awkwardly, avoiding each others eyes.

							JIM
					Well, we'll stay in touch... you 
					know.

							ARTEMUS
					I'm sure we will.

			Jim boards the parlour car and the Wanderer begins to 
			CHUG slowly away.

			A YOUNG BOY scurries up to Artemus, thrusting out an 
			envelope.

							YOUNG BOY
					Mr. Gordon, this is for you.  
					Envelope number two.

							ARTEMUS
					Number two...?

							YOUNG BOY
					That's right.  Envelope number one 
					I am to give you at ten a.m. this 
					morning, which I did.  Envelope 
					number two I am to give you the 
					second that there train starts 
					moving, which I'm doing.  Mr. West
					paid me five whole dollars.

							ARTEMUS
					He what...?

			Artemus snatches the envelope, rips it open - and scans 
			his real orders.  He whirls to see Jim waving "innocently" 
			from the train.  Artemus charges after him.

							ARTEMUS
					You inconsiderate reprobate!  It 
					was my assignment in the first 
					place!  You were lucky I even let 
					you tag along!

			Jim is cracking up as he urges him on.  Artemus sprints 
			madly down the tracks and finally overtakes the train.  
			Jim extends a hand to pull him aboard and we watch the 
			Wanderer steam magnificently off into the new

							WILD WILD WEST.

												  FADE OUT
