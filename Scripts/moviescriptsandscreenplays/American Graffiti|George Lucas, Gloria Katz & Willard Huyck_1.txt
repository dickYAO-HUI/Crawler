Mel's drive-in



















































 




















he script appears here exactly as it did when in was first written by George Lucas, Gloria Katz, and Willard Huyck, and for that reason may vary slightly from the actual movie.  It has been divided into twenty-five different sections for your browsing convenience, all taken from the collector's edition DVD.  Because of these divisions, the screenplay shouldn't take as much time to load.    Have fun! 1) Main Titles -- You Can't Stay 17 Forever 2) Mel's Drive-In -- Dating Other People? 3) The Superfine Machine -- Cruisin'  4) A Goddess in a T-Bird -- Judy's Sister 5) Toad on the Road -- At the Hop  6) Talking in the Toilet -- Joe College Strikes Out  7) Strollin' -- Not the Competitive Type 8) Drivin' is a Serious Business -- Looking for Milner 9) Just Like Connie Stevens -- The Last Dance 10) Waiting for a Double Chubby-Chuck -- Who's That Blonde? 11) Back on the Street -- Baby-Sitting 12) The Liquor Store --  The Graveyard 13) Take a Ride with the Pharoahs -- Listenin' to Wolfman 14) The Special Prize -- A Perfect Night 15) The Right Boy -- The End of a Perfect Night 16) The Goat Killer? -- The Big Challenge 17) A Chance to be a Pharaoh -- It's Never Too Late 18) Gotta Find that Blonde -- Falfa's New Girlfriend 19) Like a Ring, or Something -- Early in the Morning 20) Sicker than a Dog -- Just Like the Lone Ranger 21) Where's Laurie? -- A Pretty Good Time 22) The Wolfman -- Paradise Road 23) The Big Race -- Number One 24) Good Night, Sweetheart -- It's Time to Go 25) Epilogue: End Titles
