          FADE IN:

          EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - AERIAL SHOT - DAY

          It sits like a jewel off in the distance -- all glittering 
          and white.  The deep blue of the Potomac stands out against 
          the monuments as the sound of a HELICOPTER plays O.s..

          EXT. WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS - DAY

          The most famous helicopter in the world lumbers toward the 
          most famous house.  Scores of reporters are camped out on the 
          lawn while the huge machine descends like a hurricane...

          CLOSER - HELICOPTER

          It touches down as the Marine Corps color guard snaps to 
          attention.  The hatch POPS open and a staircase emerges...

          FULL SHOT - DOORWAY

          After a moment, PRESIDENT WILLIAM HARRISON MITCHELL appears,  
          accompanied by his wife ELLEN and loyal dog Cupcakes.  They 
          smile from the landing and wave to the world -- a postcard of 
          themselves.

          TRACKING SHOT - FIRST FAMILY

          "HAIL TO THE CHIEF" RINGS OUT across the grounds.   For- 
          midably handsome Bill Mitchell is fit and in his early forties.   
          His wife Ellen, still in her early thirties, is considered a 
          classical beauty with a wide "friendly" smile that in certain 
          photographs seems just on the edge of wistful.  The dog frolics 
          around them as they wave to the press and smile for the world.  
          Ozzie and Harriet for the Nineties with a bow to FDR and some 
          Camelot thrown in.

          MOVING WITH them...

          They stride arm in arm beneath the portico that leads to the 
          West Wing.  The band is still playing as they head under the 
          archway, disappearing from public view.    Then, instantly,  
          as a handler rushes up and grabs the dog,  the smiles vanish.  
          Bill lets go of Ellen and Ellen lets go of Bill.   He turns 
          to his right and she turns to her left.  Off they go in their 
          separate directions.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY

          The President strides down the long marble hallway flanked by 
          his two senior advisors, BOB ALEXANDER,  the White House Chief 
          of Staff and ALAN REED,  the White House Media Advisor.

                                MITCHELL
                    Is everybody in there?

                                BOB
                    They're waiting for you.  And they're 
                    very nervous.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT. WHITE HOUSE - ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY

          It is the seat of power.  There is a dark oak conference table 
          with a crystal chandelier above it.   Alan Reed is reading 
          from a notebook full of polling data while the President glares 
          at a group of congressional leaders.  Bob glares at them,  
          too, while they cower behind their water glasses.

                                REED
                         (reading from his 
                         notebook)
                    I wish I had better news... Our                      
                    compassion index is off seven                        
                    points from the last sample and                       
                    that's down eighteen on the year.  The 
                    `Cares About People Like Me' numbers 
                    are really in the toilet.  We're off 
                    twenty points from March and that was 
                    right after we raised interest rates...

                                MITCHELL
                    Dammit...
                         (beat)
                    I told them no mayo.
                         (looking up)
                    See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner 
                    thing, but I really don't want to do 
                    that...

          A couple of the legislators flinch,  still staring straight 
          ahead.

                                MITCHELL
                         (circling)
                    Do you know why I don't want to do it?

          They all look over at him for a moment.   Mitchell leans out 
          over the table like some great, predatory beast.

                                MITCHELL
                         (strangled whisper)
                    ... Because it's got homeless 
                    shelters... and Head Start centers ... 
                    and... and...

                                BOB
                         (whispering)
                    Hot lunches.

          The President looks back at him for an instant then turns 
          back toward the table.

                                MITCHELL
                         (building)
                    ... And hot lunches for little
                         (thundering suddenly)
                    And if I kill it... I'll look like a 
                    prick.

          They all flinch slightly.

                                MITCHELL
                    And I don't want to look like a prick!
                         (beat)
                    I want YOU to look like pricks!!!

          DIFFERENT ANGLE

                                SPEAKER
                    Sir, we tried to kill it twice...

                                MITCHELL
                         (whisper again)
                    I don't think so, Howard.  If you had 
                    killed it -- it would be dead.
                         (looking him in the eye)
                    When I kill something - - it always 
                    dies.  Doesn't it, flob?

                                BOB
                         (steely)
                    Always dead.   

                                MAJ. LEADER
                    Mr. President, with all the work your 
                    wife has done with the homeless...

          The President turns and stares daggers at him.   The man starts 
          to flumph as Mitchell cuts him off.

                                MITCHELL
                    Norman, I don't want you to do this  
                    cause you're forced to...
                         (beat)
                    I want you to do this because you want 
                    to.  I want you to do it because you 
                    think it's the right thing to do.  I 
                    want you to do it because you're acting 
                    in the best interests of our country...

          They stare back at him stupefied.

                                BOB
                         (upbeat)
                    Well -- I think that's it.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - LATER

          He moves down the corridor toward the Oval Office with Bob 
          and Reed at his side.

          A long line of secretaries flanks the entrance.

                                BOB
                    ... You've got that radio address to 
                    go over and the American Bar Association 
                    at the Monroe tomorrow night...

          The President pauses at one of the desks and fixes a stare.at 
          one of the secretaries,  (RANDI).  She looks up from behind a 
          pdir of clear-pane glasses,  and blushes at him effectively.

                                MITCHELL
                         (smiling at Randi)
                    The Monroe?

                                REED
                    Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...

          Randi smiles back at him.

                                MITCHELL
                         (whispering to Reed)
                    Did you get someone to double for me 
                    there, out front?

                                REED
                    We're working on it.

                                MITCHELL
                         (still under his breath)
                    Try to find someone who looks like me 
                    this time.  That last guy was a joke.

                                REED
                    We're doing our best, sir.

          He nods and winks at Randi again before heading inside the 
          Oval Office.   The President starts humming "Hail to the Chief" 
          quietly to himself...

                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT. DURENBURGER'S CHRYSLER PLYMOUTH - DAY

                        Red, white and blue flags fly above the used 
          cars to announce Durenberger's grand opening.  A SCRATCHY 
          RENDITION of "HAIL TO THE CHIEF" PLAYS from a makeshift P.A. 
          SYSTEM and a little stage has been erected in front of the 
          cars.  DURENBURGER himself stands alone at the mike.

                                DURENBURGER
                    This is a real special moment here at 
                    Durenburger's Chrysler Plymouth...  
                    Ladies an' gentlemen, I wantcha to 
                    give a real warm welcome to...

                    The President of the United

                                WIDER
                    A dead-ringer for the President appears, 
                    perched on the back of a four hundred 
                    pound pig.   He is DAVE KOVIC, our 
                    hero.   Dave enters from "stage right" 
                    wearing an Uncle Sam hat and waving 
                    triumphantly to the crowd.   A teenage 
                    *boy pulls the pig forward by a rope.

          DIFFERENT ANGLE

          He makes the victory sign with both hands and dismounts the 
          PIG who lets out a SNORT.   Dave bounds up to the small 
          platform where he is greeted warmly by Durenburger.  Dave 
          hands him a small stack of 3x5 filing cards while "HAIL TO 
          THE CHIEF" CONCLUDES its final strains.   Dave salutes the 
          crowd.

                                DAVE
                         (doing a decent Bill 
                         Mitchell)
                    Thank you, Don.  Thank you for that 
                    warm introduction.
                         (pause)
                    You know it's wonderful to be here 
                    today amongst so many smiling faces.

          REVERSE ANGLE - CROWD

          Eight to ten people stand stonefaced amongst the Plymouth               
          Horizons.

          ON DAVE

                                DAVE
                    And, Don, let me assure you from one 
                    chief executive to another, that there 
                    fl no Chrysler Plymouth like 
                    Durenburger's Chrysler Plymouth.

          A few employees applaud.   Dave nudges Durenburger who takes 
          out one of the cards.

                                DURENBURGER
                         (reading/monotone)
                    Thank you, Mr. President.  It certainly 
                    is nice of you to be with us here today 
                    considering your busy schedule and 
                    all.

                                DAVE
                    Well, Don -- it's true that I have a 
                    busy schedule.  But I've got a feeling 
                    that when folks find out about your 
                    five hundred dollar cash rebate on all   
                    `93 LeBaron and LeBaron convertibles 
                    you're gonna be even busier than I am.

          Dave looks toward the crowd for another reaction but nothing 
          comes back.   An eight-year-old GIRL tugs at the bottom of 
          ther MOTHER's dress.

                                GIRL
                    Mommy, is that the President?

                                MOTHER
                         (shaking her head)
                    I sure hope not.

                                ANGLE - DAVE
                    He leans closer to Durenburger 
                    continuing with the routine.

                                DAVE
                    You know, Don, it's not easy being 
                    President.  Why just the other day, I 
                    was riding on Air Force One...

          The PIG lets out a HUGE SNORT causing everyone to jump with a 
          start.   A six-year-old KID starts to CRY while Dave glances 
          down toward the front row.

                                ANGLE-DAVE
                    He stops the routine and squints out 
                    toward the crowd while the WAILING 
                    CONTINUES.  His parents try to comfort 
                    the BOY but it doesn't do any good.

                                DAVE
                    Hey, hey... What's the matter...

          DIFFERENT ANGLE - DAVE

          He dismounts the stage and stumbles on one of the steps.

          Dave puts on the glasses that he normally wears and squats 
          face to face with the six-year-old.

                                DAVE
                         (gently)
                    Hi...
                         (beat)
                    What's your name?

          The child doesn't respond at first.   Dave moves a little 
          closer to the boy.

                                DAVE
                    Don't you have a name?

                                CHILD (KID)
                         (sniffling)
                    ... Sam.

                                DAVE

                    Hi, Sam... You want a riddle?

          The Kid thinks for a second then nods.   He wipes some stuff 
          off his nose.

                                DAVE
                    Okay.  What can run all day without 
                    getting tired?

          The Kid ponders it for a moment.

                                DAVE
                         (leaning closer)
                    Well come on, Sam.   It's not your 
                    jar...

          Dave touches the Kid's ear as his eyes suddenly light up.

                                SAM (KID)
                    My nose?

                                DAVE
                    Right.  !!!

          Dave reaches up and "magically" produces a quarter from the 
          side of the child's nose.  He beams with delight as Dave hands 
          him the coin.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT. BALTINORE STREET - DAY

          Dave hurries down the busy sidewalk clutching a beat-un 
          briefcase and his Uncle Sam hat.  In civilian clothes, with 
          his tousled hair, no one even notices that he looks like the 
          President.  Dave ducks into a small storefront office with a 
          simple sign above it:

          "KOVIC TEMPS"

          "Like we've been there forever"

          INT. DAVE'S OFFICE

          The place is small and cluttered and very well lived in.

          Dave's secretary and ex-wife, ALICE, is kissing her boyfriend 
          JERRY goodbye.

                                JERRY
                    Six-thirty?

                                ALICE
                    Perfect.

                                JERRY
                    Great, I'll see you then.

          He blows her another kiss and turns to the door just as Dave 
          bounds into the room.

                                JERRY
                    Hi, Dave.

                                DAVE
                         (buoyant)
                    Hi, .....

          He hangs up his coat and turns to Alice as Jerry leaves the 
          room.

                                DAVE
                         (hanging up his coat)
                    It went great, Alice.   I killed em 
                    down there.

                                ALICE
                    Yeah?  Why don't you see what you *)                         
                    can do in here.

                                DIFFERENT ANGLE
                    Dave turns around to see three women 
                    stacked up in his waiting area.

                                DAVE
                         (renewed energy)
                    No problem.   What `ve we got?

                                ALICE
                         (rattling it off)
                    Mabel says it's too far on the bus.  
                    Jennifer's boss tried to hit on her 
                    again and Lola's been crying in your 
                    office for an hour.

          Dave sticks his head inside his office where a Hispanic WOMAN 
          of about fifty is crying into a tiny lace handkerchief.

                    else.

          ANGLE - OUTER OFFICE

          He darts back out.

                                DAVE
                    I'll get her something right now.
                         (beat)
                    Alice... Have you seen my checkbook?

                    E -- X...

          He nods earnestly accepting it for what must be the hundredth 
          time.  Alice sighs and motions toward his desk.

                                ALICE
                    Bottom drawer next to your baseball

                    Thanks.  You're the best.

          INT. ACCOUNTANCY OFFICE OF "MURRAY BLUM,  CPA" - DAY

          Dave's best friend MURRAY stands in front of Dave and Lola.  
          In the b.g. sit four or five women without much to do in 
          particular.

                                MURRAY
                    Dave, I can't hire anybody else.

          He turns toward his desk.  Dave follows him down the aisle.

                                ("CONFIDENTIALLY")
                    This woman's amazing, Murray.  She

          She starts to whimper all over again while Dave looks 
          plaintively at Murray.

                                DAVE
                    Short-term thing.   Straight temp job.

          Murray looks at him and sighs.

                         (beat)
                    I'll see what I can do.

          Dave flashes him a big smile and breathes a sigh of relief.

                    So you want to go swimming?

          He sets down his keys, crosses to the kitchen.  Dave yanks 
          open the fridge, pulls out a beer, pops open the top, hits a 
          twenty foot hook shot with the bottle cap, then crosses to 
          the living room...

          He looks across the room and suddenly freezes.

          DAVE'S POV

          Three large men are seated on his living room couch.

          The black one in the middle (DUANE STEVENSEN) speaks first.

                                DUANE
                    Mr. Kovic?

          BACK TO SCENE

          Dave freezes and shakes his head.

                                DUANE
                    I'm Duane Stavensen with the United 
                    States Secret Service.

          Dave's eyes go a little wider.

                                DUANE
                    We're with the federal government.

          He reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a gleaming silver 
          badge.  Dave looks at it.   Terrified.

                                DAVE
                    Oh my God...  I thought it was a 
                    legitimate deduction, I swear to God.   
                    See... I need a piano for my work

                    No.

          Dave's stopped and just stares at him.  Duane leans forward 
          on the couch.

                                DUANE
                    Your government needs your help.

          Police barricades ring the outside of the hotel.   There are 
          the standard number of flashing red lights and sharp shooters 
          stationed on all the balconies.   An assortment of various 
          demonstrators press up against the police line and a literal 
          army of press are staked out by the entrance.  It is the modern 
          equivalent of Napoleon's camp.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM

          Dave is sitting on the edge of the bed, getting his hair 
          trimmed by JOHNNY, the Presidential makeup man and traveling 
          barber.  He removes the apron and stands back to admire his 
          handiwork.

                                JOHNNY
                         (proudly; to himself)
                    Johnny, you did it again!

                                DAVE
                    You really cut his this short?

                                JOHNNY
                    It's a perfect match.

                    Hunh.   'Cause I always thought it 
                    came over the ears a little...

          At that moment the door swings open and Bob Alexander. the 
          Chief of Staff powers into the room.   He crosses over toward 
          the bed where Dave is sitting.

                                BOB
                    You understand what you'll be doing?

          Dave flashes him a smile to lighten the moment when Bob turns 
          and starts for the door...

                                DAVE
                         (beat)
                    Is this dangerous or anything?

                                BOB
                    No more than the usual.

                                DAVE
                    The usual...

          He turns and shuts the door behind him.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT

          It's the only time it has lived up to its name.    The living 
          room is huge and occupied by several Secret Servicemen.  Alan 
          Reed, the President's media advisor, stands just outside the 
          bathroom door with a clipboard in his hand.

                                REED
                         (into the bathroom)
                    We're all set,  sir.

                                MITCHELL (O.S.)
                         (from in the bathroom)
                    What about the intro?

                                REED
                    It'll be on the teleprompter with the 
                    rest of the speech.

                                MITCHELL (O.S.)
                    It better be.   Last time you had me 
                    introduce a dead guy.

          The sound of a TOILET FLUSHING comes from just beyond the 
          door.  The President emerges in a tuxedo,  zipping up his 
          fly.

                                MITCHELL
                    Who's this priest I'm thanking?

                                REED
                    Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at 
                    the inauguration.

                                MITCHELL
                    Oh yeah.
                         (beat; lowering his 
                         voice)
                    Did you take care of later on?

                                REED
                    All set.

                                MITCHELL
                         (beaming)
                    Fabulous.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT. BALTIMORE HILTON - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT

          Five hundred people have gathered at a thousand dollars a 
          plate.  Bill Mitchell stands at a dark blue podium with the 
          seal of the President in front.

                                MITCHELL
                    You know as I was coming in here tonight 
                    I ran into Jordan Blankfort who I hadn't 
                    seen for years...

                                 

          The President smiles down at Jordan while the CAMERA begins a 
          LONG,  SLOW DOLLY AROUND the back of the podium.

                                MITCHELL
                    And I couldn'thelp remembering back to 
                    the time when Jordan and I were in law 
                    school together.
                         (beat)
                    ... Now Jordan and I were pretty wild 
                    back then and like most college 
                    students, we liked to enjoy a few beers 
                    on occasion...

          The CAMERA CONTINUES its DOLLY REVEALING the clear glass panel 
          of the teleprompter.  AS the President continues with his 
          "spontaneous reminiscence," the words "LIKED TO ENJOY A FEW 
          BEERS ON OCCASION..." are clearly printed in front of him.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Dave stands alone,  trying to put on his tuxedo while he stares 
          at a television monitor.   He squints at himself for a second,  
          then lifts the arm of the tuxedo in a "Presidential" wave.  
          He immediately lowers it and tries it with the other one, 
          duplicating the President's movements exactly.   The door 
          opens behind him.

                                DUANE
                    Get readY.

          Dave turns and nods emphatically.    He glances back at the 
          TV monitor where President Mitchell is receiving a standing 
          ovation.

                                MITCHELL (V.0.)
                    God bless you... God bless America...

          Duane holds open the door to:

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

          Dave stares at the opulent room for a moment - - this is the 
          big time...

                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT. BALLROOM

          The audience has risen to its feet.  Bill Mitchell stands at 
          the podium waving out to the crowd like a conquering hero.  
          He turns and salutes a crimson-robed cleric who is standing 
          by his side.  The priest salutes the President and lifts his 
          arms like a prizefighter.  The applause is still going strong 
          as Mitchell leaves the stage.

          INT. HALLWAY

          MOVING WITH him.  They head away from the ballroom.   Bob 
          stands on one side and Reed on the other as they move down 
          the hallway in a phalanx of Secret Service.

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

          Dave is waiting nervously in the middle of the room.  Duane 
          stands poised by the side of the door.

          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR

          The Presidential entourage steps out of the elevator and moves' 
          rapidly down phe hall.  It looks like a solid wall of business 
          suits with three tuxedos in front.  They reach the door of 
          the suite together...

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

          The door to the suite swings suddenly open.   Three Secret 
          Service enter the room,  followed by the President a moment 
          later.   Dave snaps to attention with his arms at his sides 
          when the President looks up and suddenly stops:

                                MITCHELL
                         (beat)
                    Jesus Christ.

          PRESIDENT'S POV - REVERSE ANGLE

          Dave stands in front of him with slicked back hair and a crisp 
          new tuxedo.   It is a mirror image of the President himself.   
          Dave stands frozen for a moment then breaks into a nervous 
          smile...

                                WIDER ANGLE
                    The President stares at him carefully.

                                MITCHELL
                    You are a very handsome man.

                                DAVE
                         (nervous)
                    Thank you, Mr. President.

                                MITCHELL
                         (to Dave)
                    Just get rid of that grin.  You look 
                    like a schmuck.

          Dave immediately wipes off the smile as the President moves 
          past him and disappears into another room.

          ANGLE - DAVE

          He stares in wonder at the President's wake.    The rest of 
          the crowd moves out of the living room as Duane clears his 
          throat and motions to the door.    It's show time.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT. BALTIMORE HILTON - NIGHT

          A large crowd is anxious with anticipation.    A palpable 
          BUZZ fills the air as the photographers jockey near the front 
          for the best possible angle.

          INT. FOYER

          The entourage has grown to a Presidential level as Dave emerges 
          `from the elevator and heads toward the door.   He pauses for 
          a moment to catch his breath while the Secret Service race 
          ahead toward the entrance.

          EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE

          A large cheer erupts from the crowd as Dave appears at the 
          top of the steps.    There is a virtual explosion of shutters 
          and a bank of TV lights glares in his face.  Dave freezes for 
          a moment then remembers and lifts his arm in "The Presidential 
          Wave."    A louder cheer goes up from the crowd as Duane races 
          ahead to the limo beyond.

          CLOSER ON DAVE

          He starts to smile and heads down the steps as the crowd 
          presses up to the limit of the barricades.

          ANGLE - LIMOUSINE

          Duane stands at the open door when Dave stops again and waves 
          once more.   A LOUDER CHEER goes up this time.  The FANS keep 
          SCREAMING and Dave can no longer control him- self.  Suddenly 
          and without warning, he hops up on the running board of the 
          car.

                                DAVE
                         (waving to the crowd)
                    Hello America!  God Bless you!

          A huge CHEER goes up from the throng as he dismounts.  Duane 
          grabs him by the collar and pulls him into the limo...

                                DIFFERENT ANGLE
                    The car speeds away from the curb with 
                    the motorcade behind it.

          INT.  LIMO

          He turns around to see Duane,  sitting stone-faced across 
          from him.

                                DAVE
                         (clearly thrilled)
                    Sorry, I couldn't help it.  I just got 
                    carried away...
                         (finally letting it out)
                    ... I was really good though, hunh?

          Duane keeps staring at him.   Dave shakes his head.

                                DAVE
                         (cluing Duane in)
                    So I guess there must be something 
                    pretty important going on for the 
                    President to go through all of this...

          Duane just looks at him...

                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT

          A discarded tuxedo lies tossed across a chair along with a 
          woman's bra and pantyhose.

          The CAMERA PANS THROUGH DARKNESS SLOWLY TOWARD the bed while 
          the sound of a MAN and WOMAN MAKING LOVE plays O.S.

                                MAN (O.S.)
                    Oh...

                                WOMAN (0.S.)
                    Ah!

                                MAN (O.S.)
                    Oh...

                                WOMAN (0.S.)
                    Ah!

          Beat.

                                WOMAN (0.S.)
                    Ahhh!

          Silence.

                                WOMAN (0.S.)
                    Ahhhhh!

          Pause.

                                WOMAN (O.S.)
                    Bill?

          The CAMERA ARRIVES AT the bed as the torso of Randi,  the 
          Oval Office secretary, pops INTO FRAME.

                                RANDI (WOMAN)
                    Mr. President?

          Longer pause...

                                RANDI
                    (frightened)                                  
                    Oh; shit...

                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT. BALTIMORE HILTON - NIGHT

          A red and white ambulance sits parked at the service entrance 
          to the hotel with its red light flashing.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

          The President is loaded onto a gurney bed with an array of 
          tubes and catheters.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Bob and 
          Reed, Sitting in a corner, while the medical drama unfolds 
          before them.

                                REED
                         (softly)
                    It doesn't look very good.

          Bob looks up at him.

                                REED
                         (a little softer)
                    They say it hit both sides of his 
                    brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna 
                    be a vegetable.

                                BOB
                    I can't believe he'd do this.

                                REED
                    I know.

          Bob stares straight ahead clutching onto his drink.

                                BOB
                    Where's the girl?

                                REED
                    She's a little hysterical right now.  
                    We've got her upstairs in a laundry 
                    room.

                                BOB

                    Look... at some point we're going to 
                    have to call the Vice President...

          INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT                                  

          Dave sits in the back seat with Duane.   He has his small 
          canvas bag opened beside him on the seat.  He finishes getting 
          dressed in his own clothes.

                                DAVE
                         (jacked)
                    You know if you guys want to do 
                    something for his birthday,  I could 
                    come down to Washington.  I have some 
                    great birthday stuff...

          Duane smiles at him tightly.

                                DAVE
                    I do this thing with the first lady -- 
                    my friends love it -- it's the two of 
                    them going away to Club Med...

          Duane just looks at him when the TELEPHONE RINGS beside him.   
          He reaches next to him, picking it up.

                                DUANE
                    Yeah...

                                (PAUSE)
                    What?..  Are you sure?  What?

                                DAVE
                         (innocently)
                    What?

                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

          The famous building is lit up like a picture postcard while 
          Bob's voice plays 0.S...

                                BOB (V.0.)
                    It's a temporary solution.

          INT. WHITE HOUSE - SUBTERRANEAN HALLWAY - NIGHT

          A doctor and two nurses wheel a gurney in front of them while 
          Bob and Reed trail behind.

                                REED
                    Till what? 

                                BOB
                    TilT we figure something out.

                                REED
                    Bob, the guy had a stroke!

          Reed looks at him like he's nuts as they turn a corner in the 
          hallway.

                                BOB
                    Look, everything can be handled.  We'll 
                    just find a way to handle it.

                                REED
                         (stopping)
                    Like how?

                                BOB
                         (big smile)
                    Well, start by going on television                                                                               
                    and saying that he's had a mild 
                    stroke...

                                REED
                    Mild stroke?

                                BOB
                    Yes - - and that he ought to be up                   
                    and around sometime soon.

                                REED
                    Up and around?  Soon?

                                BOB
                    Soon.                                                

                                                                 CUT TO:

          RESUME - EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT      

          A lone black limousine heads down Connecticut Avenue toward 
          the mall.

                                DAVE (V.0.)
                    You know,  I think I've been real 
                    cooperative up until now but...

          It bears right on Pennsylvania Avenue, angling south.

                                DAVE
                    Just tell me where we're going.

          The car turns right into the driveway of the White House.

                                DAVE
                    Holy shit.

          INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

          Dave sits frozen in an armchair across from the President's 
          desk.  There are twenty-foot windows that lead out to the 
          Rose Garden and two huge flags on either side of the desk.    
          Alan Reed leans nonchalantly on one of the chairs.    Bob 
          stands nearby.

                                REED
                         (all schmooz)
                    Dave, my name is Alan Reed.  I'm the 
                    White House Communications Director.  
                    This is Bob Alexander, our Chief of 
                    Staff.
                         (smiling)
                    We met you earlier tonight at the hotel, 
                    remember?

          Dave nods, frozen in his chair.

                                REED
                    Can I get you something to drink?

          He shakes his head.

                                REED
                    You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or 
                    something?

                                DAVE
                         (still frozen)
                    Oh yeah... 1'm fine...

          Reed flashes him a smile and glances over at Bob.

                                REED
                         (moving toward him)
                    Now, Dave, something has come up and I 
                    think we need to talk about it...

                                DAVE
                         (blurting it out)
                    Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not 
                    to talk, but when I saw the crowd I 
                    just got excited...

                                REED
                    We're not upset with you, Dave.  We 
                    think you did a terrific job.
                         (to Bob)
                    Don't we?

                                BOB
                         (all tension)
                    Terrific.

          Reed smiles at Dave, who musters a little smile in return.

                                REED
                    In fact, we think you did such a good 
                    job, we'd like to extend things a little 
                    bit.

                                DAVE
                    Extend things?

                                REED
                         (nodding)
                    Extend them.
                         (beat)
                    C'mere for a second.

          He places a hand on Dave's shoulder and motions toward the 
          desk.  Dave hesitates,  then follows him over.

          DIFFERENT ANGLE

          Reed pulls out the President's chair and motions to it.

                                REED
                    Try it out.

          Dave looks down at the chair in wonder.

                                REED
                    Go ahead.

          Dave pauses for a moment then sinks down into the soft brown 
          leather.   He stares out in awe across the Oval Office.

                                DIFFERENT ANGLE
                    Reed looks over at Bob, who nods at 
                    him.    He takes a deep breath.

                                REED
                    Dave, something has happened to the 
                    President.

                                DAVE
                         (whirling)
                    Oh my God...

                                REED
                         (soothing him)
                    I know...  I know...
                         (pause)
                    It's difficult for all of us.  But 
                    sometimes we have to put our personal 
                    feelings aside and focus on the gQod 
                    of the country.

                                DAVE
                         (beat)
                    What happened?

                                REED
                    Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an 
                    `incident'  really...

                                BOB
                         (nodding)
                    A condition...

                                REED
                    Exactly. A condition.

          Dave nods but still doesn't understand.   Reed hesitates when 
          Bob glares at him again.

                                REED
                    It's actually kind of serious, Dave.  
                    I'm afraid the President's not in very 
                    good shape.

                                DAVE
                         (actually shaken)
                    Oh my gosh...

          He sits there,  stunned for a moment.

                                DAVE
                    Will he be alright?

                                REED
                    Oh, yeah... probably...

                                BOB
                    We think so.

                                REED
                    Yes.

                                DAVE
                         (beat)
                    Oh.

          Reed moves closer.

                                REED
                    Dave, we need our friends and even our 
                    enemies to feel safe and secure...  We 
                    need them to feel like they can go to 
                    bed at night knowing President Mitchell 
                    is fully in control... We need them to 
                    feel like he's sitting right here in 
                    this chair...

          Bob and Reed just stare at him.   Dave nods,  then suddenly 
          jumps out of the chair.

                                DAVE
                    Hey - - wait a second...

          He stares at them for a beat...

                                DAVE
                    What about the Vice President?

                                RTED
                         (panicked)
                    Vice Presidant?

                                BOB
                    Well... We didn't want to have to get 
                    into this but...
                         (deadly serious)
                    ... The Vice President is mentally 
                    unbalanced.

          Reed's eyes go wide.  Bob stares straight ahead.

                                DAVE
                         (stunned)
                    No.

                                REED
                         (catching on)
                    I'm afraid so.

                                DAVE
                    Really?   Crazy?

                                BOB
                    Certifiable.

          Dave looks at them amazed.  Bob moves closer to the desk.

                                BOB
                    How much do you usually get paid?

                                DAVE
                         (lost...)
                    Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's 
                    just like a barter thing...  Is this 
                    legal?

          Reed stops and looks at Bob for a moment.    He turns back to 
          Dave.

                                REED
                         (evenly)
                    Dave - - have you ever driven through 
                    a red light?

          Dave stares at him.

                                REED
                    You know, on an empty road where you 
                    know it's safe and nobody's around...

                                DAVE
                    I'm not sure... I might have.

                                REED
                    Well,  let's say your mother was in 
                    the car and you had to get her to a 
                    hospital.  You'd do it then for sure 
                    wouldn't you?

                                DAVE
                    Well... I gues I would... Yeah.

                                REED
                         (beat)
                    Now,  let's say the whole country.  
                    Was in that car.   The entire United 
                    States of America.

                                DAVE
                    In the car?

                                REED

                                DAVE
                    I see what you mean.

          Reed smiles at him and rests a gentle hand on his shoulder.

                                REED
                    Dave,  the country is sick.  And we're 
                    gonna get it to a hospital.

                    He stares at them for a moment then 
                    smiles slightly...

          INT. THIRD FLOOR RESIDENCE - NIGHT

          A pair of gilt-edged doors swing open to reveal a massive 
          bedroom beyond.   It is fifty-feet long and twenty-feet wide.  
          Brocaded draperies hang from the windows and a four-poster 
          bed stretches to the ceiling.

                                BOB
                    These are the living quarters.                        
                    The President's bedroom is on                         
                    this side and the First Lady's is over 
                    there.

                                WIDER
                    Dave walks forward in awe.

                                DAVE
                         (concerned)
                    First Lady...

                                BOB
                    Don't worry.  You won't even see her.

          Dave looks at him, puzzled.   Bob glances back.

                                BOB
                         (cluing him in)
                    They barely talk anymore.

                                DAVE
                    You're kidding?

                                BOB
                    It happens.  This is where you'll be 
                    sleeping.

          Bob flings open the door.   Dave enters the room and looks 
          around.

                                DAVE
                         (gawking)
                    Holy cow.

                                BOB
                    We'll be back for you first thing 
                    tomorrow and if you need me for 
                    anything, Duane will be right outside 
                    the door.

                                DAVE
                         (still stunned)
                    Oh... Okay.

                                CLOSEUP - DAVE

                    Although technically a stroke, spokesmen 
                    say the President's condition is far 
                    from serious and he ought to be up and 
                    around sometime soon.

          The CAMERA WIDENS OUT to reveal that the TV is in:

          INT. BOB'S OFFICE - DAWN

          The first rays of sunrise are breaking through the window.  
          Reed Sits on the couch holding a large rubber ice bag while 
          Bob paces across the rug.

                                REED
                    Do you know how many different kinds 
                    of laws we've broken?

                         (turning)
                    It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice-
                    President to Africa or something, dig 
                    up some dirt on him, force him to resign 
                    and get our `President' to nominate a 
                    new one.  The whole thing takes a few 
                    weeks tops.

                    You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you 
                    as Vice President.

                                BOB
                    I was a senator, you know.

                    President gets another stroke - - of 
                    course much more serious this time - - 
                    the newly appointed V.P. becomes the

                    What about containment, Alan?

          Reed heaves a sigh and looks at his notes.

                    Is that everybody?

                                REED
                    Duane's guys, but he's got them under 
                    control.

                                BOB
                    What about her.

                    She was giving that commencement speech

                         (evenly)
                    I told her his blood pressure went up 
                    after a little incident at  `the hotel.'  
                    She seems to hate him more than ever.

          Dave sits up on the examining table with his shirt off.  Bob, 
          Reed and three other vascular specialists watch attentively 
          while the President's personal physician puts a stethoscope 
          to his chest.

                         (lowering it)
                    Well, I must say, Mr. President, even 
                    for a man with a mild stroke you seem 
                    to have made a remarkable recovery.

                         (happy as a clam)
                    Thanks.  I'm feeling much better.

          Reed smiles like a proud father.

                    No signs of paralysis, no circulatory 
                    changes.  Your E.M.G. is completely 
                    normal and your blood pressure has 
                    even gone down.

                    A little weight lifting...
                    Some power talking...

          Bob shoots him a look.

                         (nodding with the other 
                         physicians)
                    Well, judging from these tests,  I 
                    don't see any reason why you couldn't 
                    start back to work within a couple of 
                    days.

          Dave looks at them and smiles.

          Dave moves through the outer office flanked by Bob and Reed.   
          He wears a blue Presidential jogging suit with a little gold 
          seal embroidered on the chest.  Dave approaches a line of 
          SECRETARIES standing behind their desks.

                                BOB
                         (under his breath)
                    Now, remember -- keep it simple.

                                DAVE
                    Don't worry.

          He bangs into the side of a credenza. Bob and Reed freeze as 
          Dave gathers himself then keeps going.

                    Oh, good morning, Mr. President.
                    I'm so relieved that you're alright.  
                    You really had me scared.

          Dave smiles and nods as she continues to clutch onto his hand.  
          Bob and Reed take him by the shoulders and move him inside...

          INT. OVAL OFFICE

          He is still staring at the doorway as they close the door to

                    Don't worry about it.

          Dave glances back toward the door.

                                REED
                    She's just a little emotional --
                    she feels kind of attached to the 
                    President.

          Dave nods as they deposit him in the President's chair.  Reed 
          slides the phone in front of him.

                                BOB
                    Okay, let's go over it again. You met

          Alice is sitting at her desk staring at a large rock on her

                                ALICE
                    No, that's fine... No, I think it's 
                    great.., Sure, I understand I will... 
                    Okay... 'Bye.

          She pauses for a moment then hits the first line all         
          over again,

                                ALICE
                    He's in love Thank God!

                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

          Sander Vanocur stands just outside the white House gates, 
          filing his nightly report.

                                SANDER VANOCUR
                    The President continued his 
                    convalescence, resting in the white 
                    House for the second straight day.  
                    His personal physician pronounced him 
                    in perfectly good health...

          FULL SHOT - PRESIDENT'S PHYSICIAN - (SOUND BITE)

                                PRESIDENT' S PHYSICIAN
                    I've examined him thoroughly and I 
                    must say, I don't think I've ever seen 
                    the President in better shape.

          INT. WHITE HOUSE BARBER

          Dave's initial rinse is replaced with a professional dye job.

          INT. DAVE'S ROOM

          Newly coiffed, Dave tries on a series of hand-tailored suits 
          hanging on a rack in the middle of his room.

          INT. BATHROOM

          Reed watches while Dave struggles vainly in the mirror with 
          his first set of contact lenses

                                SANDER VANOCUR (V.0.)
                    The President was able to attend to 
                    Some official business on Wednesday, 
                    and continues to be briefed on all 
                    areas of national concern...

          INT. OVAL OFFICE

          Reed stands in front of the desk Pointing to a large 
          organizational chart of government

                                       YOU

                 THE CONGRESS---------------------THE JUDICIARY.

                  HOUSE-----SENATE                SUPREME COURT

                     JOINT CHIEFS-----THE CABINET-----N.S.C.

          INT. CABINET ROOM

          He sits at the President's spot in the middle of the cabinet 
          table.  Propped up in all the other chairs, are Poster-sized 
          photographs of the various cabinet members.  Bob points to 
          one as Dave thinks for a moment, then guesses...

          INT. STATE DINING ROOM

          He stares in wonder at a full, formal place-setting.  There 
          are five forks, three knives and a countless number of spoons.  
          Dave looks at it all, baffled for a moment, while Reed guides 
          his hand toward the fish knife...

                                SANDER VANOCUR
                    So confident was the white House in 
                    the President's recovery, that they 
                    have just sent the Vice President on a 
                    twelve nation African goodwill tour... 
                    This is
                    Sander Vanocur at the white House.

          INT. WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

          Dave enters from the back of the room, flanked by Bob and 
          Reed on either side.  They make their way down the aisle toward 
          a large wooden podium with the "Seal of the President" on the 
          front.                                    

                                BOB
                    First thing we're gonna work on is the 
                    mannerisms.  Alan has put together 
                    sort of a training program

                                DAVE
                    Great.

          They lead him through the empty press chairs toward the front 
          of the room.   Reed climbs up the short Steps that lead to 
          the podium.

                                REED
                    Now some of this may feel a bit Strange 
                    at first.  You gotta remember that 
                    even a professional Politician has 
                    Some trouble getting used to...

                                DAVE
                         (stopping)
                    A teleprompter.

                                REED
                    What?

          Dave wanders forward staring in wonder at the clear glass 
          panels.

                                DAVE
                    The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?

                                REED
                    I don't think so.

                                DAVE
                         (disappointed)
                    Oh.

          He folds his arms in front of him turning to Bob and Reed.

                                REED
                         (beat)
                    As I was saying, no one expects you to 
                    be Bill Mitchell overnight.

          The important thing to remember is his general presence.

                                DAVE
                         (nodding)
                    Presence.

                                REED
                    Right.  Now whenever he stands at a 
                    Podium, the President always puts one 
                    hand in the pocket of his coat...

                                DAVE
                         (nodding)
                    At a press conference.

                                REED
                    What?

                                DAVE
                    That's at a press conference.
                    Otherwise he just puts `em right out 
                    there.

          They look at each other for a moment.

                                BOB
                    I'm not certain about...

                                DAVE
                    Oh, sure.  Remember the convention 
                    speech?

          Dave puts his hands on either side of the podium.

                                DAVE
                         (in a perfect Bill 
                         Mitchell)
                    'An America stronger than the one we 
                    were given.  An America prouder than 
                    the one we found.'
                         (turning to them)
                    He has 'em right there on the side.

          They stare at him in amazement.

                                REED
                         (first time he's heard 
                         the voice)
                    You know that's very good.

          ... while Dave turns to them with a smile.

                                DAVE
                    Oh, I loved that speech.

          Dave brings his hand to his forehead, scanning an imaginary 
          horizon.

                                REED
                    Thanks, I wrote it.

                                DAVE
                         (drippingly dramatic)
                    ... Somewhere there is a distant light, 
                    guiding us through this rocky shoal...'

                                REED
                    Dave...

                                DAVE
                         (clutching his "breast")
                    'America isn't in what we say here 
                    tonight -- it's in the faces and the 
                    smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'
                         (aside)
                    Hand on the heart...

                                BOB
                    Dave...

                                DAVE
                         (swept up in it)
                    It's in the little leaguer who may 
                    strike out but knows in his heart that 
                    at least swung...
                         (aside)
                    Hands to the side...

                                REED
                         (louder)
                    Dave!

                                DAVE
                         (not hearing them)
                    '... It's in the gentle kindness of 
                    the family kitchen as we gather together 
                    when the sun goes down...'

          He exhales deeply and lowers his head almost tearfully.  Bob 
          and Reed look at him stunned as he comes out of the reverie 
          and turns to face them.

                                DAVE
                         (upbeat)
                    So when do we start?

                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT. WHITE HOUSE - CLOSEUP - ANDREA MITCHELL -

          She continues with her report speaking directly INTO the   
          CAMERA:

                                ANDREA MITCHELL
                    Tom, virtually every reporter in 
                    Washington is camped out here awaiting 
                    the President's first appearance since 
                    his Stroke...

          WIDENING OUT:

          Andrea Mitchell stands camped on the White House lawn amidst 
          a small army of minicams, trucks and reporters.

          They all seemed focused on the Truman Balcony.

                                ANDREA MITCHELL
                    Even though some may find his recovery 
                    amazing, White House officials claim 
                    they never expected less from a man 
                    who always expects so much from himself.

          INT. YELLOW OVAL ROOM - DAY

          Dave stands, in his new blue suit, peeking out the window at 
          the circus below.

                                DAVE
                         (turning back)
                    I thought you said I wasn't going to 
                    see her.

                                REED
                    It's just five minutes.  She comes in.  
                    You wave to the press.
                    She leaves.

                                DAVE
                    Yeah, but the First Lady...
                    Couldn't we start with a cousin or 
                    something?

                                REED
                    She hardly ever sees him and it'll be 
                    so fast, she won't have a chance to 
                    tell.

                                BOB
                    Be a professional. If you can                      
                    convince her - - you can convince 
                    anybody.

                                DAVE
                         (reluctantly)
                    ... Alright.

                                BOB
                    Now when she comes in, we'll move you 
                    right out to the balcony.  All you 
                    have to say is  `thanks for doing this, 
                    Ellen.'

                                DAVE
                    `Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'

                                REED
                    Exactly.
                         (lowering his voice)
                    She doesn't always like this stuff and 
                    it might soften her up.

          Dave continues practicing "Thanks..."

                                BOB
                         (hitting the intercom)
                    We're ready.

          Bob rises from the couch and crosses to the doorway at the 
          far corner of the room.  Reed leads Dave to the large double 
          doors that open onto the balcony itself.

          CLOSEUP - DAVE

          He jiggles nervously for a moment.    Dave takes a large wad 
          of gum from his mouth and sticks it quickly under the mantel 
          piece...

                                WOMAN (O.S.)
                    Why can't you die from a stroke like 
                    everybody else?

          DAVE'S POV - DOOR

          He turns to see Ellen Mitchell, glaring at him from the 
          doorway.  Everyone in the room freezes.

          ANGLE - DAVE

          He is stunned by her beauty. Dave just stares at her as she 
          crosses the room.

                                ELLEN
                         (to Dave)
                    What are you staring at?

                                DAVE
                         (too stunned to talk)
                    Uh...

                                REED
                         (jumping in)
                    We're Gonna do it right out here.

          She Stops just before the window, then turns back to look 
          Dave in the eye.

                                ELLEN
                    Who was it, Bill? A Secretary?

          He has nothing to say and just stares at her.  Reed nudges 
          him a little.

                                DAVE
                    Thanks for doing this, Ellen.

                                ELLEN
                    Go tuck yourself, Bill.

                                BOB
                    Well, perhaps we can get started now.

          She moves directly onto the balcony, leaving Dave behind.  He 
          stands there dumbfounded, as Reed takes him by the arm, and 
          gently pushes him out after her.

          EXT. WHITE HOUSE - TRUMAN BALCONY - DAY

          Dave stumbles out and finds Ellen, already poised at the rail 
          waving to the crowd.

          CLOSER.

                                ELLEN
                         (in a whisper)
                    And you can tell those two pit vipers 
                    this is the last one of these I'll be 
                    doing for a while.

          She takes his hand, displaying it publicly.  Dave looks down 
          at his hand in hers.  The heat of her skin goes right to his 
          brain.

                                REED (O.S.)
                         (loud whisper)
                    Smile!

          Dave smiles.

                                REED (O.S.)
                         (louder whisper)
                    Wave!

          Dave waves.

                                REPORTER #1
                    How do you feel, Mr. President?

                                YELLOW ROOM
                    Bob and Reed are huddled beside the 
                    window.

                                REED
                         (stage whisper)
                    Fine.

                                DAVE
                    Fine.

                                REPORTER #2

                         (louder whisper)
                    You bet.

          BALCONY

                                DAVE
                    You bet.

                                ELLEN
                    I'm outta here.

          She drops his hand, turns and goes back through the door 
          leaving Dave alone on the balcony.  He stands there for a 
          moment, then turns and follows her inside.

          INT. YELLOW OVAL ROOM - DAY

          She is halfway across the room when Ellen suddenly stops and 
          does a one-eighty in the middle of the carpet.

                                ELLEN
                    Don't you have anything to say to me?

                                DAVE
                         (thinks)
                    Thanks for doing this, Ellen?

                                ELLEN
                    You don't change, do you, Bill?

          She turns and moves through the door, slamming it behind her.

                                DAVE
                         (stunned)
                    She hates me.

                                BOB & REED
                         (throwing their arms 
                         around each other)
                    Yes!!!

                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

          All the reporters have gone home and the only remnants are 
          scattered pieces of trash that blow across the lawn.

          INT. WRITE HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Duane sits poised in his chair, just outside Dave's door.  He 
          sleeps soundly, when the door opens a crack behind him.

                                DAVE
                         (softly)
                    Duane?

          His eyes bolt open as he turns around slowly.

                                DAVE
                    ... Can I get a bite? I'm kinda hungry.

          INT. WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN - WALK-IN REFRIGERATOR - NIGHT

          It is cavernous and huge -- the size of small garage.  Dave 
          moves delighted down the long row of food stuffs while Duane 
          shivers slightly behind him.

                                DAVE
                         (grinning)
                    You gotta try this.  It's my special 
                    sandwich.

          Dave loads up with food and smiles at Duane.

                                DAVE
                    Everybody loves this sandwich.

          emerges with a pile of food.  He lays it on the behind him.

                                (BEAT) DUANE
                    What's in it?

                                DAVE
                         (turning)
                    Oh,  that's a secret.

          Duane nods and averts his eyes as Dave begins to apply the 
          meat.

                                DAVE
                    So, how long have they been like that - - 
                    you know, him and the First Lady?

                                DUANE
                    I can't say.

                                DAVE
                    You mean you don't know or like -- you 
                    can't say.

                                DUANE
                         (same inflection)
                    I can't say.

                                DAVE
                    Oh.

          Dave pauses, then starts adding the lettuce.

                                DAVE
                    So you just protect the President the 
                    whole time?   That's your whole job?

                                DUANE
                    Yeah.

                                DAVE
                         (turning)
                    You got a gun?

                                DUANE
                    Of course.

          Dave glances around the kitchen and lowers his voice.

                                AVE
                    Can I See it?

                                DUANE
                    Well, it's really not policy to...

                                DAVE
                         (quickly)
                    I understand.

          Dave turns back to the sandwich while Duane looks at him for 
          a moment.  Duane rolls his eyes and unbuttons the front of 
          his coat revealing a fifteen round Beretta.

                                DAVE
                         (looking at the gun)
                    You ever use it?

                                DUANE
                    No.

                                DAVE
                    Huh.
                         (right back to the 
                         sandwich)
                    You know what I always wondered the 
                    way they say you guys'd take a bullet 
                    for the President.

                                DUANE
                    What about it?

                                DAVE
                    Well, is that really true? I mean, 
                    would you really get killed just to 
                    save his life.

                                DUANE
                    Certainly.

          Dave cuts the sandwich in half turning back to Duane.

                                DAVE
                    So that means, now you'd get killed 
                    for me too?

          Duane looks at him, stunned by the realization.  Dave smiles 
          and moves forward, extending the sandwich.

                                DAVE
                    Here.  Try this.

          DAVE - Rev. 8/7/92                                   46.

          Duane stares at it for a moment, then lifts the sandwich in a 
          daze.

                    What do you mean, he's clean?

          INT. DUKE1S RESTAURANT - DAY

          It's a Washington mecca for the power lunch.  Bob and Reed 
          Sit in a corner booth with a manilla folder between them.

                                REED
                         (agitated)
                    I mean I've checked everything.                      
                    Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went 
                    all the way back to his high school 
                    race for student body president.

                                BOB
                    No one gets to be Vice President by 
                    being that clean.

                                REED
                    The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared 
                    frequent flyer miles on his income tax 
                    return.

          Reed twists in his chair while Bob checks out the dossier.

                                BOB
                    What about the wife?

                                REED
                    Clean.

                                BOB
                    Check his kids.

                                REED
                    Clean.

                                BOB
                    Nobody's got clean kids.

                                REED
                    We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't 
                    work. 

                                BOB
                    If we find nothing, we get creative.   
                    Just make something up.  Instead of a 
                    couple weeks it'll be a couple of 
                    months.  The whole thing is under 
                    control.

                                REED
                         (leaning forward; tense 
                         whisper)
                    You think we can keep this thing going 
                    for a couple of months!

          At that moment, a DISTINGUISHED MAN moves up the table, 
          clapping a hand on Reed's shoulder.

                                DISTINGUISHED MAN
                         (strong Southern accent)
                    Bob... Alan... Your boy sure looks 
                    great.
                         (leaning closer)
                    I think he sounds even better'n he did 
                    before this stroke.

          He lets out a rich, throaty laugh, full of booze and 
          cigarettes.   Bob smiles at him.

                                BOB
                    Well,  thanks very much, Judge.  We'll 
                    tell him you sent your best.

                                DISTINGUISHED MAN
                    You take care, now.

                                BOB
                    Yeah, you,  too.

          The Man moves on as they look at one another...

                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT. GENERAL MOTORS ASSEMBLY PLANT (DEERBORNE MICHIGAN')

          - DAY The huge "GM" sign stands prominently in the f.g.  Below 
          it their motto reads:  "Mark of Excellence."                     

          INT. ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

          Dave is escorted through the plant by the GM PRESIDENT and a 
          large entourage.  Bob and Reed hover a couple of steps behind 
          as Dave listens to the tour.

                                GM PRESIDENT
                    Now this man is using a robotic 
                    mechanism for picking up the engine.  
                    The large arms that you                       
                    see duplicate all of his arm movements 
                    exactly, so it's as if he's lifting 
                    two thousand pounds.

          They pause in front of a large assembly area.'  One of the 
          workers stands at a machine with his arms stuck in two long 
          rubber sleeves.  Above him, a pair of mechanical arms hoists 
          an engine high into the air.

                                DAVE
                         (beat)
                    Can I try it?

                                GM PRESIDENT
                    Huh?  Uh, well...

                                BOB
                    Mr. President...

                                DAVE
                    I mean,  if it's a problem...

                                GM PRESIDENT
                    No, no.   It's really quite simple.  
                    Just come on over here.

          The GM Executive leads Dave toward the huge machine.  He smiles 
          as an army of cameras press in closer.

                                GM PRESIDENT
                    Now, you slip your hands into these 
                    sleeves here...

          Dave nods and does as he is told.    All at once the two 12-

          delight as the massive robot comes alive in his hands.  Dave 
          lifts his arms over his head and the huge claws point straight 
          toward the ceiling.  He sticks them out to the side and the 
          robot does the same.

                    I once caught a fish this big.

          Dave sticks his arms out to his sides and the huge claws 
          indicate a 40-foot fish.  A roar goes up from the crowd as a

                    I don't know about you, Mark, but
                    I don't think I've ever seen the 
                    President as relaxed or comfortable 
                    with himself as he is right now.

                                SHIELDS
                    Oh, I agree, David.  I don't know who 
                    gave him happy pills but this is a 
                    pretty unbelievable transformation.

                                GERGEN
                    Well, I think it's a kind of 'rebirth' 
                    really.   This is a man who's stared 
                    death in the face and it's obviously 
                    had a profound effect on him.

          urging the President to follow suit.   Dave hits the deck as 
          well, matching the superstar rep for rep.  The cameras explode

          can't help himself.  He starts across the terrace.

                                FOLLOWING DAVE
                    Dave reaches the open doorway and slides 
                    quickly against the wall.   Slowly, 
                    carefully he bends his head and peeks 
                    into the room.

          INT. ELLEN'S BEDROOM - DAVE1S POV

          She sits on her bed, surrounded by some work papers.  In the 
          warm light of the room, through the billowing curtains, Ellen's 
          skin seems to glow.   She stops reading for a moment and 
          brushes aside a loose strand of hair.

          EXT. BALUSTRADE - WIDER

          Dave stares at her, transfixed.   Suddenly, a light comes on 
          in a nearby room causing Dave to jump back with a start.   He 
          sneaks a final peek and hurries toward his room...

                                                                 CUT TO:

          He sits at his white marble Italian desk, talking on the phone 
          when Bob comes storming into the room.

          WIDER

          He bangs down a copy of the week's schedule, looking Reed in 
          the eye.

                                REED

          Bob looks at him stunned.

          PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE - AERIAL SHOT - DAY                80

          The long line of black limousines and police motorcycles makes 
          its way through downtown Washington.

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE

          Dave sits next to the First Lady in the back seat of the limo.  
          Both of them stare straight ahead.   Finally, after several 
          seconds of silence, Ellen turns to Dave.

                                ELLEN
                    Why are you doing this, Bill?

          He looks over at her, startled.

                                DAVE
                    What?

                                ELLEN
                         (irritated)
                    Since when do you care about the 
                    homeless?

          Dave thinks for a moment.

                                DAVE
                         (beat)
                    I care about the homeless.

                                ELLEN
                    Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up 
                    nights. 

          She turns away from him, twisting in the seat.  The bottom of 
          Ellen's skirt hikes up her thigh, exposing the top part of 
          her leg.  Dave looks down at it, drawn to the sight of naked 
          flesh.  Sensing something, Ellen glances back and catches him 
          looking.

                                CLOSER
                    Their eyes lock for a moment.  Dave 
                    smiles quickly and glances out the 
                    window.  Ellen looks down at her own 
                    leg a little puzzled.

          EXT. HELPING HAND SHELTER - DAY

          The sidewalk is teeming with press.  The shelter itself is 
          painted a bright shade of blue - - a cheery little island in 
          a sea of graffiti.  A small group of community leaders waits 
          by the front door while the Presidential limousine pulls up 
          to the curb.

          CLOSER

          The door pops open as Ellen and Dave step out.  He turns and 
          waves to the crowd while she stares straight ahead.  Reed 
          hurries up to them.

                                REED
                         (under his breath)
                    Okay, it's straight klick and smile 
                    but there's a great visual in the 
                    kitchen so make sure you stop at the 
                    soup.

          She shoots him a glare as they reach the top of the stairs.   
          Dave nods and they move forward to greet the community leaders.

          INT.  SHELTER

          He takes a couple of steps inside, then suddenly stops.  The 
          smile fades as his eyes go wide.

          DAVE'S POV

          It is more a nursery school than a homeless shelter.  Twenty 
          to thirty children, most of them black, stand formally 
          assembled in front of the President.

                                ELLEN
                         (good at this)
                    One of the things they're trying to do 
                    here at Helping Hand, is keep verbal 
                    skills alive.  The first thing that 
                    goes with these kids is their ability 
                    to communicate and they need to get to 
                    them before this happens.

          She glances over her shoulder.  Dave has wandered forward to 
          the edge of the large rubber mat.  Everyone stares, stunned, 
          as he looks at the kids for a moment, then sinks suddenly to 
          his knees.

                                DAVE
                         (quietly)
                    Hi there.

          ANGLE - PRESS CORPS

          The cameras surge forward to the side of the play area.  The 
          SHUTTERS FIRE WILDLY as Dave glances up at the cardboard cut-
          outs.

                                DAVE
                         (quietly)
                    You like cartoons?

          The kids don't respond.  They stare at the crush of reporters 
          and glancing TV lights.

                                DAVE
                         (turning toward the 
                         cameras)
                    Could you just stop that for a second.

          Everyone freezes.  The camera crews back up a step as Dave 
          turns back toward the kids.

                                DAVE
                         (softer)
                    You like Tweety Bird?

          A few of them nod.

          CLOSEUP - ELLEN

          She stares in disbelief as her husband sits cross-legged in 
          the middle of the mat.  He leans forward, into the children, 
          talking like a kindergarten teacher.

          ANGLE - PLAY AREA

                                DAVE
                    So, which one do you like?

          A FOUR-YEAR-OLD tugs gently at his sleeve.  He wears donated 
          overalls and a N.Y. Mets T-shirt.

                                KID (FOUR-YEAR-OLD)

                         (smiling)
                    Sylvester?

          The boy nods.

                                DAVE
                    But he's a cat.

          ANGLE - REED

          He beams from ear to ear as the photo-op materializes in front 
          of his eyes. Dave glances over at him, cupping his hand in a 
          whisper.

                                DAVE
                         (side of his mouth)
                    Gimme a quarter.

                                REED
                         (confused)

                    Quick.  Gimme a quarter.

          WIDER

          Reed fishes through his pockets and comes up with a coin.  He 
          moves to the mat, slipping it to Dave.

          ANGLE - DAVE

                    Okay - - what can run all day without 
                    getting tired.

          The kid looks at him, baffled.  Dave reaches out slowly and 
          taps the side of his nose.  DAVE

                                (GENTLY)
                    Well, it's not your ear.

          She watches in amazement as her husband reaches out and 
          "magically" produces a quarter from the side of the child's 
          nose.  Dave looks up at her with a smile, and their eyes lock 
          as a hundred shutters fire at once...

          INT. PRESIDENT'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Steam billows up in the shower while Dave scrubs shampoo into 
          his hair.  He massages it vigorously into his scalp while the 
          humming continues.

                    `Bum, bum da dum...'

          He rinses it out and reaches for the soap.   It's a small 
          soap on a rope" designed to look like the Presidential seal...

                    The door to the shower swings open as 
                    Ellen materializes.  No queen of England 
                    ever looked more regal than Ellen 
                    Mitchell in her cloud of steam.

                    How could you?

          Dave jumps with a start, then turns away from her quickly, 
          bashfully facing the tile.   He looks back at Ellen over his 
          shoulder.

                                DAVE
                    ... How could I what?

          strikes a "stoic" pose.

                         (trembling slightly)
                    ... You know, if you want to be the 
                    same old bastard, that's fine.  I can 
                    handle it.   But don't pull                            
                    this 'man of the people' bullshit and 
                    then do something like this.

                                DAVE
                         (frozen; feeling - very 
                         exposed)
                    I don't understand.

                                ELLEN
                         (exasperated)
                    That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- 
                    that would have given these kids 
                    homes...
                         (losing it a little)
                    ... When I think about that little 
                    spectacle you pulled with those muppets 
                    and that magic trick...

                                DAVE
                    What's wrong with a magic trick?

                                ELLEN
                    You made their funding disappear!

          Dave recoils a little.

                                DAVE
                    Look.  If there was some mistake...

                                ELLEN
                         (in a rage)
                    There's no mistake, Bill.   If you 
                    veto their funding, it's not a mistake. 
                    If you hurt someone intentionally, 
                    it's not a mistake.

          She turns and leaves through the steam disappearing as suddenly 
          as she came.  Dave hesitates for an instant, then starts right 
          after her.

          INT. HALLWAY

          Duane is seated at his regular post when Ellen comes stalking 
          out of Dave's suite. He looks up in amazement as Dave runs 
          out a moment later.   He's dripping wet and clutching a bath 
          towel around his waist.

                                DAVE
                         (turning to Duane)
                    Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need 
                    them immediately.

                                DUANE
                    But it's ten-thirty at night.

          Dave turns and gives him a "Presidential" glare.

                                DUANE
                         (backing off)
                    Yeah, sure. You got it.

          INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

          Dave is seated at his desk, hair still wet, dressed in the 
          Presidential jogging suit. The door bursts open.  It's Bob 
          and Reed.

                                BOB
                    What the hell is this?

                                DAVE
                    What the hell is this ?

          Bob and Reed cross over toward the desk as Dave slams down a 
          copy of rolled up newspaper.

                                BOB
                         (looking at it)
                    The Washington Post.

                                DAVE
                         (pounding his finger on 
                         the front page)
                    No...

          Bob glances at the paper then hands it to Reed.

                                REED
                         (looking at it; shrugging)
                    President vetoes works bill?

                                DAVE
                    We vetoed that?

                                BOB
                         (a slow boil)
                    No!...  WE didn't anything...

                                REED
                         (interceding)
                    Dave, these things get awfully 
                    complicated sometimes...

                                DAVE
                    That shelter was in this bill.

                                BOB
                         (losing it)
                    Alan

                                DAVE
                    Lots of shelters were in this bill.

                                BOB
                         (moving toward him))
                    Listen, you little...

                                REED
                         (cutting in)
                    Dave, the budget's a very complicated 
                    thing.  Even I don't understand it 
                    sometimes.  Now occasionally we have 
                    to make some cuts and...

                                DAVE
                    But we went there.  We saw those kids.

                                BOB
                    Yeah. And if you can find a way to cut 
                    THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS 
                    from the federal budget, then you can 
                    keep your lousy shelters, okay.

          Dave just looks at him for a moment.

          EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

          A small Ford Escort with a Thrifty rent-a-car sticker pulls 
          up to the East Gate of the White House.  It stops just short 
          of the guard station, then rolls forward a few feet and stops 
          again.

          ANGLE - MURRAY

          He leans out of the window, squinting into the sun.  Murray 
          holds a mangled map of Washington in his hand.

                                MURRAY
                         (terrified)
                    I'm here to see... the President?

          The guard looks at him without responding.

                                MURRAY
                    He asked me to come.

          The guard reaches for the phone and dials a few numbers.  
          Murray jiggles nervously in his seat.

          INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

          He sits in the exact same chair that Dave occupied on his 
          arrival.  Murray stares across the Oval Office with a terrified 
          look on his face.

                                MURRAY
                         (urgent whisper)
                    I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in 
                    a lot of trouble for something like 
                    this.

                                DAVE
                    It's fine.

                                MURRAY
                    They could put you in jail.

                                DAVE
                    Why would they do that.  They hired 
                    me.

          Murray just stares at him.

                                DAVE
                    It's kind of a national emergency thing.   
                    I can't really talk about it...
                         (confidentially)
                    Paying me big money too.   C'mere.

          He leads Murray from the chair to the other side of the desk.  
          Dave reaches down opening the bottom drawer.

                                DAVE
                    See.

          INSERT - DESK DRAWER

          It is full of money.   Neat little stacks of hundred dollar 
          bills.

                                ANGLE - MURRAY
                    He looks at it wide-eyed,  frozen by 
                    what he sees.

                                MURRAY
                         (whispering; indicating 
                         the walls)
                    Are we being taped?

                                DAVE
                    I don't think so

                                MURRAY
                    This is undeclared income.

                                DAVE
                    And who's gonna find out?

                                MURRAY
                    The government

                                DAVE
                    I am the government.

          Murray turns and looks at his best friend, speechless.   He 
          stares at Dave for a couple of seconds when a strange look of 
          wonder crosses his face.

                                DAVE
                    I know -- kind of wild, huh?
                         (beat)
                    Let's get to work.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

          A light is burning in the second floor residence.

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL DINING ROOM - LATER

          It is a large oak-lined room in the private residence.

          Dave and Murray sit on either side of a huge dining table 
          with papers strewn all around them.   In front of Murray sits 
          a large,  leather bound volume of the federal budget.

                                MURRAY
                    I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going 
                    over this a bunch of times and a lot 
                    of this stuff just doesn't add up.
                         (beat)
                    Who does these books?

                                DAVE
                    I'm not sure.

                                MURRAY
                    I just think they make this stuff a 
                    lot more complicated than it has to 
                    be.

                                DAVE
                    I'm not surprised.

                    Can we save anywhere?

                                MURRAY
                    Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making 
                    some choices.

                                DAVE

                    You know -- priorities.
                         (thinking)
                    Remember when you couldn't get your 
                    car fixed `cause you wanted to get

                         (hopefully)
                    You could buy it on payments.

                         (thumping the budget)
                    Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 
                    400 billion dollar deficit.

                                DAVE
                    So what do we do?

                    Well, there's lots of places where I 
                    think you can save, but I'm not the

                    It's alright.  I know what you mean.  
                    Let's start at the top.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

          It is jammed to capacity.

          The CABINET SECRETARIES are seated around the table while the 
          White House staff lines the walls.   Three television crews 
          are poised in the far corner of the room.

          ANGLE - DOORWAY

          Reed enters and crosses to Dave's regular spot at the cabinet 
          table.   He places a stack of 3 x 5 filing cards next to his 
          water glass and retreats to his seat along the wall.

          INT. HALLWAY

          Bob moves down the corridor with a little spring in his step.  
          He is actually whistling a cheery tune as he carries the 
          morning edition of the Washington Post.
