THE DEATH ARTIST (1995)

(REMAKE OF CORMAN'S CLASSIC "BUCKET OF BLOOD")


INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

The cavernous CLUB is packed with a cross section of ARTISTS, POETS, 
ACTORS, MODELS, ROCKERS, GRUNGERS, PUNKS, ADDICTS, and other 
assorted characters, standing at the bar and seated at tables - 
bizarre PAINTINGS and SCULPTURES adorn the walls -

CLOSE on a BOOM BOX on a stage - the tape rolls, and soon strange 
industrial music begins to blare from the box -

MAXWELL, an eccentric - looking man with a goatee and various 
PIERCINGS on his face, stands on the stage in front of a microphone 
- an abstract PORTRAIT hangs on the wall behind him -

				MAXWELL
		I will talk to you of art, for
		there is nothing else to talk
		about, for there is nothing
		else...life is nothing but
		homeless traveler on the RTD
		of art...

We pull back to see PATRONS sitting at tables amid various 
sculptures, paintings, and displays of questionable artistic promise 
-

				MAXWELL
		Burn gas on the freeways, and whip your
		sour cream of circumstance...flip at
		your channels and plod at your monitors...

Soon we see WALTER PAISLEY, a meek, unassuming bus boy, work his way 
around the tables, taking empty drinks, emptying ashtrays, all the 
time listening to the performer on
stage -

				MAXWELL
		Creation is, all else is not...
		what is not creation is meatless
		sausage, and rice cake, let it
		all crumble to feed the artist -

Walter passes a table where an upscale ART DEALER with a ponytail 
interrupts his prospective client to answer his
cellular phone -

				MAXWELL
		The artist is, all others are not, a
		canvas is a canvas or a painting, a
		rock is a rock or a statue, a sound
		is a sound or it is music, a preacher
		is a preacher or an artist -
Walter passes ART, seated with two attractive women - he rolls 
himself a cigarette, nodding in approval to Maxwell -

				MAXWELL
		Where are John Joe Jake Jim Jerk,
		dead dead dead, they were not born
		before they were born, they were not
		born, where are Leonardo, Mozart,
		Shakespeare, alive alive alive, they
		were born -

Walter continues to bus the room - he pauses to stop and listen to 
Maxwell - he then looks over a MAN'S shoulder - he is sketching - 
Walter observes the SKETCH -

POV It is a fairly good sketch of the room -

LEONARD, the artsy manager of the club, notices Walter pausing to 
listen -

				MAXWELL
		Bring on the multitudes and the
		multitude of fishes - feed them
		that you will be satisfied,
		nourish the artist, stretch their
		skin upon an easel, crush their
		bones into a paste, so that he may
		mold them, let them die, and by
		their miserable death become the
		clay in his hands, that he might
		form an ashtray or an ark - that he
		might take you in his magic hands
		and wring from your marrow wonder -
		all that is comes through the eye
		of the artist -

Walter moves on - sees an attractive woman, CARLA, who opens a 
MANILA ENVELOPE and removes some HEAD SHOTS of herself -

				MAXWELL
		The rest are blind fish, swimming
		in the cave of aloneness- swim on you
		mortal and muddling maddened souls -
		and dream, of one bright and sunny
		island - some artist will bait a hook,
		and let you bite upon it, bite hard, and
		die -

Walter looks at Carla's picture -


				MAXWELL
		In his stomach, you will feed
		creation!

Maxwell turns off the tape, and the audience applauds -

Carla then looks up to see Walter looking at her picture - he 
awkwardly smiles at her and she smiles back -

Leonard then approaches Walter -

				LEONARD
		Walter, what are you doing?

				WALTER
		I was just looking at Carla's
		picture.

				LEONARD
		Well that's not what I pay you for,
		now is it?

				WALTER
		Well I was uh, just looking...

				LEONARD
		Well do some looking around the room.
		I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...

Walter slinks away - Leonard gets close to Carla, very close, all 
the time admiring her head shot -

				LEONARD
		Ah, your new head shot...
			(Beat)
		I like it, very much...

				CARLA
		Do you have to be so cold to him?

Leonard smiles, and strokes Carla's hair -

Walter watches this, the turns and walks away -

At the entrance of the club stands LOU, a man in a designer suit, no 
tie - he scans the room as Walter passes him -

				LOU
		How ya doin'?

				WALTER
		Uh, hi.

Walter slinks away, and Lou looks around some more -

Art sees Lou -

Lou subtly gestures to Art and heads into the club -

Art gets up, addressing the two girls -

				ART
		I'm out of here.

Art and Lou head toward the MEN'S ROOM -

INT MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Art and Lou check the stalls to see the room is empty -

				ART
		Alright we're clear.

				LOU
		Anything new?

				ART
		Not really.  One girl who fit the
		descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette,
		didn't see much changing hands.

				LOU
		Is the manager cooperating?

				ART
		Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said
		he'd call us if he sees anything.
		That's about it for tonight.

				LOU
		Alright I got you, man.  It's my
		turn for freak patrol.

				ART
		You know it.
			(Beat)
		I'm out of here.

Art heads out, and Lou checks himself in the mirror -

INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

Maxwell sits at a table with Carla, MAYOLIA, a skinny yet buxom 
woman, and CHARLIE, a long-haired hanger-on - Maxwell is looking at 
Carla's head shot -

				CARLA
		So, do you like it?



				MAXWELL
			(bored)
		It's perfectly adequate, as far
		as those type of things go...

Walter approaches, with a tray of glasses in his hand -

				MAXWELL
			(changing subject)
		I don't think anyone gets what
		I said, their blank faces staring,
		mute, unfeeling -

				WALTER
		I liked it very much Mr. Brock.
		I liked it very much.

				MAXWELL
			(condescending)
		Well I'm overjoyed.

				WALTER
		"Let them die, and by their miserable
		death become the clay in his hands,
		that he might form an ashtray or an
		ark -"

Carla looks at Walter -

				CARLA
		That's word for word.

				MAXWELL
		Is it?  I've forgotten.

				MAYOLIA
		You mean you don't remember your
		own poem?

				MAXWELL
		I refuse to say anything twice -
		repetition is death!

				CHARLIE
		What do you mean?

				MAXWELL
		When you repeat something, you
		are reliving a moment, wasting
		it, looking at a shed skin - I
		only want new impression, new
		sensations -


				WALTER
		I thought you believed that life
		is a homeless traveler riding on
		the RTD of -

				MAXWELL
			(interrupting)
		I know that - I know that! I also
		believe in burning the creative
		candle, you understand, down to
		the end - to be uncreative you
		might as well be dead...a walking
		machine, toiling in a factory!

				WALTER
		I worked in one of them.  Back in
		Alaska.
			(smiles meekly)

The people at the table look at Walter, then laugh
cynically -

In the background, Leonard glares at Walter -

				CARLA
		Walter, Leonard's looking at you
		again.

Walter grabs up a cup and saucer off the table, almost spilling the 
contents before heading off -

				CHARLIE
		That guy's a class-A cracker.

				MAXWELL
		Walter's got a clear mind.  Probably
		something will enter it, feel lonely,
		and leave again...

Everyone at the table laughs weakly -

At another table two eccentrically dressed ARTISTS, CUFF and LINK, 
talk to an upscale older couple - Cuff has a series of MATTED 
PHOTOGRAPHS in his hand -

				OLDER MAN
		I've heard you can find some
		cutting edge pieces here if you
		keep an eye out -

				OLDER WOMAN
		I'd like to find something for
		our den, something unusual -

				CUFF
		Well maybe these works might
		interest you -

Cuff shows the woman the photographs - she reacts to them with 
disdain -

POV they are pictures of various ROAD KILLS - squirrels, skunks, 
possums -

				CUFF
		It's our road kill series.  I take
		the pictures.

				LINK
			(proudly)
		I do the research.

The woman hands back the photographs -

				OLDER WOMAN
		Not quite what I was looking for.

				OLDER MAN
		Yes, we're interested in something
		with some investment potential -

				CUFF
		Hey, this is no supermarket,
		there are no aisles, it's all
		in the attitude -

Walter approaches -

				LINK
		Yeah that's a dead soul way to
		look at it -

				OLDER WOMAN
		Nonsense.  We have developed many
		a rapport with struggling artists -
		we're very supportive -

				WALTER
		"All that is comes through the eye
		of the artist - the rest are blind
		fish, swimming in the cave of
		aloneness."

The four people stare at Walter -

				OLDER WOMAN
		That's very deep, and coming from a
		bus boy too -
				WALTER
		"Feed them that you will be satisfied -
		the artist is, all others are not -"

				OLDER MAN
		Where have I heard that before?

				OLDER WOMAN
		Are you a poet also?

				WALTER
		Uh...no.  No I'm not.

				OLDER MAN
		What do you do?

				WALTER
		Well, uh, I'm...working, I've
		been working on something, it's
		not ready yet.

				CUFF
		What is it, a crying clown?

				WALTER
		Huh?!

				LINK
		Walter must have bought himself
		some crayons.

Leonard approaches, looking exasperated -

				CUFF
		Get out of here, man.  We're
		negotiating a deal.

				WALTER
		I am working on something!  I'm
		going to show you soon!

				LEONARD
		Walter!

Leonard gets close to him -

				LEONARD
			(under his breath)
		You're starting to try my
		patience!

Walter sheepishly heads off - the two artists laugh -

The older woman looks at Leonard -
				OLDER WOMAN
		Is he, uh?...

				LEONARD
		About to be out of a job.

Walter returns to Maxwell's table, where Carla, Mayolia, and Charlie 
are still sitting - he gestures to some empty glasses -

				WALTER
		Are you done with these?

				MAXWELL
		Yes, get rid of them...

In the split second when no one is looking, Walter snatches up one 
of Carla's head shots, keeping it under his tray, as he cleans up 
the empty glasses -

									DISSOLVE TO
EXT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

Walter passes an alley where a group of THUGS hastily strips down a 
car parked on the street -

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Walter walks the streets alone - soon he stops and looks ahead -

There is a PARKED CAR with the windows open - A COUPLE is making out 
in the front seat -

Walter smiles meekly -

Soon the man in the car, a mean-looking character spots Walter - the 
two stop making out and the man stares at Walter -

				MAN
		What are you looking at?  You want
		to get shot?

Walter's smile fades, and he stuffs his hands in his pockets, and 
heads down the street, alone, inadvertently bumping into some 
GARBAGE CANS -

EXT COURTYARD APARTMENTS - NIGHT

Walter unlocks a creaky iron gate covered with dead ivy -



EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

As Walter heads in, he runs into MRS. SWICKER, the
landlady -

				WALTER
		Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.

				MRS. SWICKER
		Hello Walter.  I want to tell
		you the super fixed the leaky
		pipes and sealed up that hole in
		your wall.

				WALTER
		Oh, OK.

				MRS. SWICKER
		Walter you look awful pale!
		What did you have to eat today?

				WALTER
		I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.

				MRS. SWICKER
		If you were my son...why don't you
		let me fix you a nice hot bowl of
		soup, it won't take but a minute.

				WALTER
		Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself
		something.  Besides, I got something
		important to do...

Walter goes to unlock his door -

				MRS. SWICKER
		Oh by the way did you happen to
		see Frankie out here, by any
		chance?

Walter thinks for a second -

				WALTER
		Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.

				MRS. SWICKER
		What's got into that cat?  Well if
		you do see him, tell him I've got
		a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh
		halibut for him -

				WALTER
		T-tell him that?

				MRS. SWICKER
		If you see him.

				WALTER
		OK Mrs. Swicker.

Mrs. Swicker heads off -

				MRS. SWICKER
		Good night Walter...

				WALTER
		Good night, Mrs. Swicker -

Walter opens his door and heads in -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Walter closes the door and turns on a LIGHT hanging over a kitchen 
TABLE - a CLOTH covers an object roughly the size of a bowling ball 
on the table -

He removes Carla's head shot, tucked inside his shirt, and places it 
on the table after looking at it for a beat -

Walter heads over to the STOVE, stopping to notice a freshly 
plastered area on the wall, a bag of PLASTER still on the ground -

Walter opens himself up a can of BEANS - he looks around and finds 
an old, dented metal POT, pouring the beans into the pot -

He throws the empty can in the direction of an overflowing GARBAGE 
CAN, lights the stove and puts the pot on the
burner -

Walter then takes a seat at the table - he lifts the
cloth, revealing a mound of CLAY -

A cat meows in the distance as Walter looks at Carla's picture, 
appreciating her beauty -

				WALTER
		Now I have my muse...

Walter then turns and begins to mold the clay -

									DISSOLVE TO
INT WALTER'S ROOM

A half-hour later.  Walter has attempted to sculpt a bust - he looks 
at Carla's picture, then back at his sculpture -

Walter's POV it is a badly sculpted HEAD, that not only looks 
nothing like Carla but has a hard time passing for anything human -

Walter looks at it, knowing that much work is needed on his creation 
-

He grabs a blob of fresh clay from an adjacent pile and begins to 
form a nose - the cat meows again - Walter looks around -

				WALTER
		Frankie?

Walter continues enthusiastically sculpting the blob of
clay -

				WALTER
		A canvas is a canvas or a painting.
		A rock is a rock or a statue...a
		sound is a sound or is music...

Walter looks at the sculpture -

Walter then attaches the nose - smoothing it on -

It looks RIDICULOUS, something out of grammar school art class - 
he's having difficulty forming anything that resembles a nose -

				WALTER
		Come on...you're supposed to be
		a nose...

The malformed face stares dumbly back at him as he fights to shape 
the nose -

The cat meows again - Walter is getting increasingly frustrated - he 
backs up to look at the head -


PAN the photograph of Carla, over to the sculpture - one of the ears 
falls off -

Walter squints at the head, failing to convince himself it's looking 
better - frustrated, Walter yanks the nose off and grabs a little 
more clay -

				WALTER
		Why can't I make a nose!

On the stove, the beans begin to boil -

Walter shapes the clay and sticks the nose back on, his tongue 
sticking out of his mouth as he fumbles with it -

The nose has changed shape and juts perpendicularly off the head, 
resembling Pinocchio -

Walter begins to sculpt with increasing fury -

He grabs up more clay, starts mushing the face -

Soon the object begins to lose resemblance to anything close to a 
human head, or anything for that matter -

Walter stands up and backs up, looking at the sculpture - getting 
angry he begins to mush the sculpture -

				WALTER
		No no no no -

The cat meows again, louder - Walter looks around, irritated - he 
begins to SQUASH the sculpture -

Finally losing his patience Walter kicks back the chair, grabs the 
clay head and HURLS it across the room -

The clay hits the wall with a dull THUD, stays there for a beat, 
then falls to the ground -

Walter pushes back his hair with his hand - the cat meows -

The beans begin to OVERFLOW on the stove -
Walter runs toward the stove, smacking his head on the overhead 
light -

The light swings back and forth as Walter rushes over to the pot, 
grabbing it hastily off the stove before SHRIEKING in pain and 
dropping the pot into the sink, splattering beans in all directions 
-

Walter clutches his hand in pain as the light swings, the cat 
meowing louder -

Walter begins to look around furiously -

				WALTER
		Frankie shut up!

Walter then focuses his frustrated mind toward the direction of the 
patched up wall -

Walter gets closer -

He hears the meowing coming from inside the wall -

				WALTER
		Frankie?

Walter puts his ear to the wall - he hears SCRATCHING
noises -

Walter turns away from the wall -

				WALTER
		I don't believe this!
			(yelling at the wall)
		How did you get stuck in the wall!

The meowing persists -

				WALTER
		Alright alright - calm down,
		I'll get you out -

Walter looks around, goes toward a drawer by the sink, and produces 
a long, narrow CARVING KNIFE - he heads back to the wall -

				WALTER
		Hang tight Frankie, ol' Walter's
		gonna get you out...

Walter then feels the wall as if he does this type of thing 
professionally - when the determines the proper area of entry he 
carefully aims the knife and - WHAM! -

SCREECH!  Frankie makes a comical screech of pain which ends 
abruptly -

Walter FREEZES - his eyes wide open with panic - he stands back -

The wall is silent -

				WALTER
		Frankie?

There is no response -

				WALTER
		Frankie how're ya doin' in there?

There is no response -

Walter begins to BEAT the wall, until the thin material begins to 
give way -

He RIPS a big chunk of the wall off, confirming the worst -

The knife IMPALED Frankie into a wooden stud in the wall - the cat 
is no more -

Walter pulls and tugs at the knife until it is freed from the wall - 
he gingerly cradles Frankie, still impaled by the knife -

				WALTER
		What have I done?

Walter walks over to the kitchen table -

				WALTER
		Oh Frankie I'm so sorry...

He lowers the cat down -

				WALTER
		Poor Mrs. Swicker...
			(Beat)
		She had a nice fat piece of
		ocean-fresh halibut for you...

Walter walks backward toward the kitchen, looking forlornly at the 
cat -

He reaches for another can of beans, but his eyes focus on the clay 
head on the floor -

Walter picks up what used to be a head and sits back down at the 
kitchen table -

He looks at Carla looking back at him from the picture - he then 
stares blankly ahead -

				WALTER
		Repetition is death, Frankie...
									DISSOLVE TO

EXT LOS ANGELES - DAWN

Silhouetted buildings in the early light -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - DAWN

Still dressed, Walter tosses and turns on his bed -

				MAXWELL(V.O.)
		Nourish the artist, stretch their
		skin upon an easel, crush their
		bones into a paste, so that he may
		mold them, let them die, and by
		their miserable death become the
		clay in his hands, that he might
				MAXWELL (cont.)
		form an ashtray or an ark - that he
		might take you in his magic hands
		and wring from your marrow wonder -
		all that is comes through the eye
		of the artist -

Walter bolts upright, waking from his dream -

				WALTER
			(beat, then almost
			 imperceptibly)
		Where are the John Joe Jake Jim...
		Jerk...

Walter gets up out of bed - he heads toward the kitchen table -

He looks at a now stiff Frankie -

				MAXWELL(V.O.)
		Dead...dead...dead...

Walter stares at Frankie for a beat and turns off the overhead lamp 
- he then looks up, as if getting an idea -

He looks over at the floor -

Sees the BAG OF PLASTER -

EXT STREET - DAY

Walter's feet are visible as he walks down the street - as we pan 
up, we see Walter cradling a PACKAGE wrapped in brown paper and 
string -

EXT JABBERJAW - DAY

Leonard stands very close to Carla, who is wearing tight, red velvet 
bell-bottoms - she flips through several canvases of SCRIBBLE 
PAINTINGS she has brought over -

				CARLA
		I'm trying to find a style of
		my own.  Do you really like them?

				LEONARD
		Oh yes...very nice...very, very
		nice...

Walter then approaches with his package -

Carla sees him - so does Leonard -

				CARLA
		Hi Walter...

				LEONARD
		What are you doing here so early?

				WALTER
		Well I brought something, I wanted
		to show you.

				LEONARD
		What is it, your laundry?

				WALTER
		Huh?

				CARLA
		Don't worry about him...what have
		you got?

				WALTER
			(enthusiastically)
		A thing I made.

Walter lowers it to the ground and undoes the string - he then opens 
the paper and reveals what he brought -

It is FRANKIE, encased in plaster along with the knife -

Walter grins like a simpleton at his creation, but Carla is 
impressed -

				CARLA
		Wow...
			(Beat)
		Wow...

Carla picks up the statue -

				CARLA
		Leonard...look at this...

Leonard puffs on his cigarette -

				LEONARD
		Where'd ya buy that?

				WALTER
		I didn't buy it I made it.

Leonard takes another puff -



				LEONARD
			(incredulous)
		You...made that?

				WALTER
		I said I did, didn't I!

				CARLA
		I've never seen anything like this,
		maybe Segal, but nothing with such...
		dichotomy...
			(Beat)
		It's very good, Walter -

				WALTER
		Honest?

				LEONARD
		Well, what's it called?

Walter looks up at Leonard -

				WALTER
		Dead Cat!

				LEONARD
			(Beat)
		Dead Cat?

				WALTER
		Yeah.

				LEONARD
		Well it sure looks dead enough.

Walter stands up -

				WALTER
		You want to buy it, put it in the
		club?

				LEONARD
		You want me to buy Dead Cat?
			(laughs)
		It'll scare people away.

				CARLA
		Don't you feel it?

Leonard and Walter look at Carla -

				LEONARD AND WALTER
			(simultaneously)
		Feel what?

				CARLA
		Don't you feel what it's giving
		off?  It's...presence...
		come take a closer look...

Leonard gets closer -

				CARLA
		Look at the detail, it's so alive,
		and yet...so dead...

Carla turns the statue's face toward Leonard -

				CARLA
		Look at the expression on its face...

Walter puffs his cigarette and stares at Walter -

				LEONARD
		Well...why did you put a knife in
		it?

				WALTER
		I didn't mean to.

				LEONARD
		Got carried away, huh?

Leonard inspects the statue -

				LEONARD
		Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll
		put it in the corner of the alcove.
		If it sells, we'll split it fifty-
		fifty.  How's that?

				WALTER
		Sure!
			(Beat, then to Carla)
		So I guess that means I'm an
		artist after all.

				CARLA
			(smiles politely)
		Maybe so...

				LEONARD
		I wouldn't give up your day job.

				WALTER
		All that is comes through the
		eye of the artist...

				LEONARD
		Alright get a grip on yourself
		Now since you're here why don't
		you start early, the kitchen
		needs cleaning.

				WALTER
		Sure!

Walter heads off then turns and faces Leonard and Carla -

				WALTER
		You really like it?

				CARLA
		Of course...it's wonderful.

				LEONARD
		I can barely contain myself.
		Now chop chop!

Walter heads into the back -

INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

The scene is happening, strange music plays in the background -

Art walks into the club - Walter passes him -


				WALTER
		Did you see my cat?

				ART
		Why, is he lost?

				WALTER
		No, I uh...

Walter walks away -

In the alcove sits Dead Cat -  a young man wearing a beret and 
leather jacket inspects the work - he seems zonked out on some 
chemical - Walter approaches him -

				WALTER
		You like my cat?

				YOUNG MAN
		Yeah...it's like out there,
		you understand what I'm saying?


				WALTER
		Sure.  You want to buy it?

				YOUNG MAN
		No man, I don't have the funds
		to be buying various pieces of
		artwork, you understand what I'm
		saying?

Leonard approaches -

				WALTER
		Sure.

The young man heads off - Walter faces Leonard -

				WALTER
		People seem to like my cat.

				LEONARD
		Enough already about it - get to
		work!

Walter heads off  - Leonard lights a cigarette and looks at the 
sculpture -

Walter busses a table -

				CHARLIE(O.S.)
		Hey Walter, come here!

Walter heads over to a table - seated are Maxwell, Carla, Charlie, 
and another attractive blonde woman - Maxwell appears clearly 
intoxicated -

				CHARLIE
		Congrats, Walter.

				CARLA
		Walter everyone's talking about
		it.

Maxwell turns and focuses on Walter -

				MAXWELL
		I saw your...cat.

				WALTER
		Did you like it Mister Brock?

				MAXWELL
		Call me...Maxwell.


				CHARLIE
		How'd ya do it Walter?

				WALTER
		Oh, I just got some plaster,
		and fixed it up.

				CHARLIE
		Papier mache?

				WALTER
		Uh, no.  Plaster.

Charlie laughs - Maxwell stares at Walter, then staggers to his feet 
- looks at the room -

				MAXWELL
		Attention everyone!  Everybody!

Some people pay attention -

				MAXWELL
			(drunkenly)
		As you pass through these yellow
		portals I am sure you noticed
		on your right a small plaster
		figure, and assumed this
		transfixed effigy to be the work
		of a master sculptor.  Indeed,
		so it is.  And that bright, new
		creator is in our midst.  He's
		none other than Walter Paisley,
		our very own bus boy, whose
		undiscovered hands of genius have
		been carrying away your empty
		cups of frustration!

People look at Walter, who sheepishly accepts the praise -

				MAXWELL
		Remember him.  His is the silent
		voice of creation.  Within the
		dark rich soil of humility, he
		blossoms as the hope of our
		nearly sterile times.

Charlie and Carla clap -

				MAXWELL
			(to Walter)
		Bring me a gimlet.

Maxwell sits back down -

Walter passes a table where Cuff, Link and Mayolia are sitting -

Cuff stops him -

				CUFF
		Hey congrats on the cat Walter.
		I wonder where you got the idea
		of dead animals.

				WALTER
		Huh ?

				LINK
		Yeah, can you say plagiarism?

				CUFF
		Not only that, he copied us!

				MAYOLIA
		Oh nonsense!  Your works hit the
		viewer over the head.  They're
		so...obvious.

Mayolia then looks up at Walter -

				MAYOLIA
		I get it Walter.  I get it.

				WALTER
		What do you get?

				MAYOLIA
		Your work, the layers of
		irony.

Just then several people approach Walter and begin asking him 
questions -

Art watches the commotion -

Leonard also watches the commotion with a completely dumbfounded 
expression on his face -

Art dealers talk to Walter, as well as artists -

Just then Lou walks in, stands next to Art -

				LOU
		What the hell's going on?

				ART
		Everyone wants to meet the
		bus boy.

				LOU
		What did he do?

				ART
		He made a cat.

Lou looks at Art, who returns the stare -

				ART
		Outta plaster.

Lou walks in -

				LOU
		See you later -

				ART
		Righto.

Art leaves - Leonard looks at Walter -

Walter uncomfortably enjoys the attention -

Just then the old couple chimes in - the older man looks around -

				OLDER MAN
		Where's my mocha latte double
		grande!

Leonard drops his cigarette and crushes it with his foot -
He heads over to Walter and escorts him away from the
people - Walter accepts someone's BUSINESS CARD -

Leonard takes him aside -

				WALTER
		Did you hear that Mr. De Santis?
		Everyone's really crazy about
		Dead Cat.

				LEONARD
		Yes they are, aren't they?  Look,
		why don't you take the rest of the
		night off, you look tired.

				WALTER
		Well I don't know -





				LEONARD
		No, it's Ok...you came in early.
			(Beat)
		Besides, you're creating an incident.
		When people are applauding they don't
		order anything.

				WALTER
		Well...
	
				LEONARD
		Look, go home and...work on something.
		Make another cat.

				WALTER
		I don't have another cat!

				LEONARD
		Well make a dog, make a parakeet!
		I'm sure you'll think of something.

				WALTER
		A parakeet?

Leonard begins to lose his patience - he yanks the tray out of 
Walter's hand -

				LEONARD
		Go home.

				WALTER
		OK...good night Mr. De Santis!

				LEONARD
		Good night Walter.
				
				MAYOLIA(O.S.)
		Wait - Walter!

Walter begins to head out the door but is stopped by
Mayolia - Walter turns around and faces her - she gets
close -

				WALTER
		Hello Mayolia.

				MAYOLIA
		Walter, you did something to me
		with your work tonight.

				WALTER
		With Dead Cat?


				MAYOLIA
		With Dead Cat.  Like a breath
		of fresh air.  I could just -
		babble on about it for hours.

				WALTER
		Really?

Mayolia gives him "that" look -

				MAYOLIA
		Yeah.  I really could.  I'm not
		just saying that.

Mayolia gets closer making her heaving cleavage more accessible to 
Walter's eyes -

				MAYOLIA
		It's like...you've turned on.

				WALTER
		T-turned on?

				MAYOLIA
		A hot light bulb is burning inside
		of you.
			(Beat)
		I want to be warmed by it.

				WALTER
		That's really nice of you
		Mayolia.

				MAYOLIA
		Let me into your world Walter...
		let me into that white hot
		inspired world.

				WALTER
		I can't.  I gotta go home.

Mayolia presses herself against Walter, who awkwardly
reacts -
				MAYOLIA
		Well, I'll go home with you.

				WALTER
		Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs.
		Swicker would start asking questions.
		She's my landlady.

Art sits at a table, watching the encounter -


				MAYOLIA(O.S.)
		Isn't there anything I can do
		for you?

Mayolia reaches out and touches Walter -

				WALTER
		I don't think so Mayolia.

				MAYOLIA
		I want to be part of it, I want
		to inspire you, I want to do -
		something!

				WALTER
		You don't have to do anything!

				MAYOLIA
			(Beat)
		Then let me give you something
		then...

Walter watches, perplexed, as Mayolia reaches into her cleavage -

Lou watches the transaction carefully -

Mayolia takes out a CAMEO NECKLACE, takes it off her neck -

				MAYOLIA
		Maybe this will give you some
		inspiration, change your
		perception of reality...

Mayolia looks around, and hands the necklace to Walter -

				MAYOLIA
		I want you to have it.  There's
		a little something for you in
		here...

				WALTER
		Gee.  Thanks.

				MAYOLIA
		Let it inspire you.  Maybe it
		will let you think of me.

She wraps Walter's hand around the necklace -

				MAYOLIA
		If you have to go, go.

Walter backs out -
				MAYOLIA
		Go and don't look back.

Walter leaves -

Lou waits for a beat, then gets up -

EXT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

Walter leaves the club, passing some incoming people -

When he leaves, Lou exits the club -

He heads over to the payphone and picks up the receiver, about to 
make a call -

Suddenly, he changes his mind - he hangs the receiver up, and 
decides instead to follow Walter -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Walter closes the door and turns on the overhead lamp -
He looks at the medallion Mayolia gave him and places it on the 
table - he then picks it up again, inspects it -

He notices the medallion has a clasp -

EXT WALTER'S WINDOW - NIGHT

Lou is outside, watching Walter -

He then checks his .45 HANDGUN and stuff it back in his shoulder 
holster under his jacket -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Walter notices the medallion has a clasp - he pops it open and 
notices a twisted-off corner of a PLASTIC BAG containing a white 
powder inside - he opens the bag and smells the powder, no knowing 
what it is - he dabs his finger in it and puts it on his tongue, 
GRIMACING at the taste of the substance - he puts the open medallion 
down on the kitchen table -

EXT WALTER'S WINDOW - NIGHT

Lou heads off -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Walter heads over to the dresser, looks at himself in the mirror-


				WALTER
		Why yes, that is one of my pieces...
		it's one, in a series...

Walter then picks up the picture of Carla, looks at it for a beat -

				WALTER
		And I love you too Carla...

Walter sighs, then heads over to his cabinets, opens them
up -

A box of PANCAKE MIX is the only item -

Walter takes out the box and grabs a round, sharp-edged GRIDDLE out 
of the lower cabinets -

Soon the door knocks - Walter walks over to the door carrying the 
griddle -

He opens the door - Lou is standing there -

				LOU
		Hello, Walter.

				WALTER
		Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you
		down at the Jabberjaw plenty.

				LOU
		Yes, you have.
			(Beat)
		Can I come in?

				WALTER
		Uh, sure.

Walter closes the door behind him -

				WALTER
		I was going to make some pancakes,
		you can have some if you like.

				LOU
		Hm.

 				WALTER
		Did you see my cat?

				LOU
		Yeah I did.

Lou heads over to the table, sees the medallion -

				LOU
		I also saw the girl give you this.

				WALTER
		Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's
		a nice girl.
			(Beat)
		She's kind of strange, though.

Walter watches Lou take a dab of the white powdery contents and put 
it on his tongue -

				LOU
		You like chasing the dragon, Walter?

				WALTER
		Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?
			(Beat)
		You sure you don't want a pancake?

				LOU
		You can cut the crap.

Lou WHIPS out his BADGE -

Walter looks at the badge, then at Lou -

				LOU
		Police officer.

				WALTER
		You're like an undercover guy!
		
				LOU
		You're in some deep shit pal, whether
		you know it or not.

				WALTER
		Huh?!!!

				LOU
		Possession of narcotics isn't something
		we take lightly, you understand?

Lou takes a few steps closer and Walter takes a few steps back -







				LOU
		But I got a feeling you're gonna
		cooperate with me.  Yessir, I
		think you and me are gonna be real
		good friends.
			(Beat)
		Why don't you tell me about your
		connection.

				WALTER
		C-connection?

				LOU
		I'm not looking to pinch you!  I
		don't care about you, or the girl.
			(Beat)
		But you want to save your ass, you
		better start telling me what I want
		to hear.  Now!

				WALTER
		Telling you what?

				LOU
		Who's the head honcho!  Who's
		providing the smack connection!

				WALTER
		Smack?

				LOU
			(rolls his eyes)
		Goddammit, where are you from,
		Mars?

				WALTER
		Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with
		it!

				LOU
		Haven't you ever heard of smack!
		Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!

				WALTER
			(enthusiastically)
		Is that what that is?  I never
		seen any before.  I always thought
		that stuff was expensive!

				LOU
		Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.



				WALTER
		Wasn't that nice of Mayolia to
		give me some expensive smack.

Walter heads over to the stove - Lou stops him, turns him around -
				LOU
			(angry)
		Who do think you're dealing with,
		huh?  I'm willing to cut you a
		break, chief!

				WALTER
			(totally confused)
		You are?

				LOU
		Good ol' mild mannered Walter!
		Give it up.  It doesn't fly with
		me.

Lou steps up to Walter who cringes behind his griddle -

				WALTER
		I- don't know what you're talking
		about!

				LOU
		You're coming downtown with me,
		Walter.  You're gonna come clean
		with me, you're gonna name names
		or I swear to God I'll see to it
		personally you rot in a cell upstate!
		Are we understanding each other?

				WALTER
			(panicked)
		Wait a minute!  What'd I do?

				LOU
		I got you cold, pal.  Make
		it easy for yourself, use your
		head.

				WALTER
		I didn't do nothing wrong!  That
		was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her
		for it.  I don't know about any -

				LOU
		Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've
		heard this song and dance before,
		save your breath, you're coming with
		me!
Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -

				WALTER
		Wait a minute - I told you I didn't
		do nothing wrong!

				LOU	
		Don't give me a hard time Walter! You
		don't want to get me mad!  You're
		coming with me!

				WALTER
		I ain't going no place with you!

Lou then grabs his .45 from behind him and aims it at
Walter -

				LOU
		Turn around!

Walter panics and begins to FREAK OUT-

				WALTER
		You're gonna shoot me!

				LOU
		Turn around!

Lou lunges for Walter's arm to turn him around but he staggers back 
-

				LOU
		What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!

				WALTER
		NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T
		WANT TO GET SHOT!

				LOU
		Relax!


				WALTER
		YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!

				LOU
		Walter shut up and relax!

				WALTER
		NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T
		SHOOT -

Lou SPRINGS for Walter -

WHAMMM! Walter SINKS the griddle into Lou's skull -  Lou grunts and 
crashes to the floor -

Walter cringes back in terror - as he steps back we see the BLOODY 
EDGE of the griddle -

Walter staggers back, witnessing what he has done -

Soon there is a KNOCKING on his door -

				MRS. SWICKER(O.S.)
		Walter!

At first Walter is too shocked to hear the knocking, but soon he 
does, and a horrible realization forms in his mind -

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

Mrs. Swicker knocks on the door, listening intently -

				MRS. SWICKER
		Walter!

She knocks again -

				MRS. SWICKER
		Walter are you alright?  I thought
		I heard some shouting a minute ago!

Mrs. Swicker waits for a beat - soon she hears BANGING and CLANGING 
through the door -

				MRS. SWICKER
		Walter!

The banging and clanging continues -

Mrs. Swicker knocks again - the banging reaches comical proportions 
-

				MRS. SWICKER
		Walter open this door -
The clanging continues - Mrs. swicker jiggles the door handle - the 
door opens -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Mrs. Swicker walks in and Walter hides the bloody griddle in the 
nick of time, staggering back -

				MRS. SWICKER
		What's all the noise in here!

				WALTER
		Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?

Mrs. Swicker closes the door behind her -

				MRS. SWICKER
		Don't tell me I didn't hear a
		racket!  I'm an older woman and
		I don't need to be upset and
		disturbed in this manner!

				WALTER
		I was just straightening up the
		place.

				MRS. SWICKER
		Straightening up indeed!  Are you
		sure you're not alone?

				WALTER
		I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker,
		you know that.

Mrs. Swicker begins to snoop around the place -

				MRS. SWICKER
		Walter have you been talking to
		yourself again?

				WALTER
			(wringing his hands)
		Well yes I guess I have been Mrs.
		Swicker.  Somebody's got to.

Mrs. swicker continues to snoop around - she then turns and looks at 
Walter -

				MRS. SWICKER
			(exasperated)
		Walter, you know what you need is
		a girl!

Mrs. Swicker continues to inspect the place, with Walter following 
close behind her -

				MRS. SWICKER
		She doesn't have to be pretty...
		just as long as she takes good care
		of you...
		
				WALTER
		Uh, I can take real good care of
		myself, Mrs. Swicker!

Mrs. Swicker continues to look around the cluttered room -

				MRS. SWICKER
		Yeah I can see that! Look at
		this place!

At that moment Lou's BLOODY ARM drops into view in the background, 
having been stuffed in a crawl space above the sink -

				MRS. SWICKER
		It's terrible!  Why don't you
		ever clean it up!

Walter notices the arm as Mrs. Swicker directs her attention in the 
opposite direction, grabbing a sheet -

				MRS. SWICKER
		And when did you change these sheets
		last!  It looks like they're alive!

Walter panics, and gently leads Mrs. Swicker to the door -

				WALTER
		Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some
		friends later, and I have to take
		a shower!

				MRS. SWICKER
		Well why don't you clean up this
		dump!

Mrs. Swicker resists as Walter opens the door and pushes her out -

				WALTER
		I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!

				MRS. SWICKER
		What's the matter with you!

Walter shoves her out the door and closes it behind him -

Pressing his back against the door he looks ahead -

Blood begins to trickle down Lou's arm -

Walter approaches the bloody arm, caught in a total panic -

Blood begins to drop on the floor -

Walter looks around frantically, and finds a big metal POT -

He places it under the dripping blood, lowering it to the ground -

He then steps back, listening to the rhythmic trickle of blood 
hitting the pot -

Walter staggers back, grabbing a sponge -

He heads over to a PUDDLE of smeared blood on the floor -

He gets on his knees and begins to wipe up the blood -

				WALTER
			(crying)
		I didn't mean to hurt you, sir...
		if you had shot me, you'd be
		mopping up my blood now...

Walter continues to mop up the stain -

				WALTER
		I couldn't help it if I got scared.
		I didn't mean it!

Walter stops to listen to the trickling blood - something dawns on 
him -

				WALTER
		It's crazy...it's crazy...
			(Beat)
		I didn't think I had it in me...
		How'd ya do it, Walter...

Walter gets up, faces Lou's off camera corpse and addresses it -
				WALTER
		He said go home and make something
		Walter!  Make another cat...

Walter looks down at the pot filling with blood -


				WALTER
		But I told him I didn't have
		another cat...

Walter then gets an idea, and looks up toward Lou's body -

Walter's expression changes, from one of panic to one of new 
inspiration -

EXT PAYPHONE - DAY

Art is on the phone -
				ART
		No, nobody seems to know where
		he went...
			(Beat)
		why don't you put an A.P.B. out
		and I'll check on it from here...
			(Beat)
		Right...Ok, bye.

Art hangs up the phone -
									DISSOLVE TO
INT JABBERJAW - DAY

Leonard enters and closes the door - he begins lifting shades and 
getting the place ready to open -

He heads over to the alcove, something catches his eye -

It is the Dead Cat sculpture -

Leonard stops to look at it, laughing faintly to himself - he then 
picks it up and inspects it, shaking his head -

He puts it back, positioning it just so - as he turns his back the 
cat leans forward and crashes to the ground -

Leonard turns around and sees what happened - he picks it up and 
examines it -

There is a FRACTURE in the plaster - Leonard runs his finger over it 
-

CLOSE on Leonard's face he notices something -

As Leonard traces his finger over the fracture, he discovers some 
CAT HAIRS protruding from the sculpture -

Taken aback by the discovery, Leonard puts the sculpture
down -

He then pokes it, almost as if he expects a response -
Leonard slowly breaks into a knowing smile -
									DISSOLVE TO
EXT STREETS - NIGHT

A MONTAGE of police PATROL CARS driving down various
streets -
				RADIO OPERATOR(V.O.)
		...officer Louis LaRue...age 29,
		five foot eleven, Caucasian, black
		hair, last seen wearing jeans and
		a dark jacket...

									DISSOLVE TO
INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

The joint is jumping as the audience listens to a MUSICIAN  playing 
assorted GARBAGE from the scrap yard -

Several PATRONS examine the Dead Cat sculpture -

Cuff and Link sit at a table noticing the commotion wit contempt -

				CUFF
		Look at that, man.  Big deal.

				LINK
		I know.

				CUFF
		I mean it's like, you know, I do
		my art because that's what I am,
		you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not
		like a banker, you know.  Like I
		create.

				LINK
		I know, man.

				CUFF
		But it bugs me when someone rips off
		our ideas, our concepts, and people
		freak out about it, you know, and
		tell us ours stinks!

				LINK	
		I know, man.

				CUFF
		I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm
		just gonna go right on creating
		'cause it comes from here -
			(pounds chest)
		you know?

				LINK
		I know, man.

Just then Art enters the club -

Cuff and Link see him come in - Walter busses an adjacent table -

				CUFF
		And, man who is this dude?  He's
		like always casing the joint.

A shady - looking couple behind Cuff and Link notice Art  also, and 
decide to hastily leave -

				LINK
		I wonder what his deal is.

				CUFF
		I think he's looking for you, man...
		it's all finally catching up with you!

Link sees Walter -

				LINK
		No I think they're looking for Walter,
		'cause he's wanted for stealing -

Walter leaves with the tray pretending not to have heard the comment 
- he nevertheless CRASHES into a Leonard, spilling the contents of 
the tray -

				CUFF
		Jeez, take it easy Walter!

Walter crouches and picks up the items -

Leonard looks down at him with disdain - Walter then stands
up -

				WALTER
		Sorry about that Mr. De Santis!

Leonard says nothing for a beat -

				LEONARD
		That's alright Walter...

Leonard then gestures to a table -

				LEONARD
		Put the tray down...have a seat.

The comment takes Walter by surprise -
				WALTER
		H-have a seat?

				LEONARD
		Have a seat -

Cuff and Link watch as Walter sits down -

				WALTER
		I thought I'm not supposed to
		sit with the customers...

				LEONARD
		Now why shouldn't you, Walter?
		Things are different now...

				WALTER
		They are?

Leonard sits down, facing him - he lights a cigarette -

				LEONARD
		Of course they are, Walter.

Carla then makes her way toward their table -

				LEONARD
		You've arrived.  You've been
		recognized.  You're a talent,
		a creative force to be reckoned
		with.

				CARLA
		Leonard, what are you doing?

Leonard and Walter notice Carla -

				WALTER
		Hiya Carla.

				LEONARD
		What am I doing?  I'm just telling
		Walter the truth.

Carla sits down and listens -

				LEONARD
		A man came in here and wanted to
		pay me fifty dollars for the cat.
		In fact, he took it home to show
		to his wife, in case you're wondering
		where it was.

Carla looks at Walter -

				LEONARD
		You know what that proves?

				WALTER
		What, Mr. De Santis?






				LEONARD
		It proves I've underestimated
		Walter's ability.  His work has
		hit a nerve in the collective
		zeitgeist of the art community.				
		It has enormous realism - you can
		hardly tell it from the real
		thing!

				LINK
		Sounds like he's busting your
		chops, Walter.

				CARLA
		Are you trying to be funny?

				LEONARD
		I'm totally serious!

Leonard gets close to Walter - puts his hand on his
shoulder -

				LEONARD
		The question is what are you going
		to make next, Walter?  Did you
		make that dog yet, or that parakeet?
			(beat)
		How about making something out of
		the cockroaches in your room?

				WALTER
		I-I already got a new one!

				CARLA
		Great!  What is it?

				WALTER
		It's a...full length life-size
		figure!

				CARLA
		What's it called?

				WALTER
			(Beat)
		Murdered man.

Leonard takes his hand off Walter's shoulder -

				LEONARD
		Murdered...man?...

				CARLA
		When do we get to see it?
				WALTER
		Well...any time, I guess.

				LINK
			(sarcastically)
		Man that's a trippy name, kinda
		like the Warhol mayhem series...

				CUFF
		I saw a statue once called The Third
		Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.

				LINK
		Now what kind of statue was that?

				CUFF
		I don't know it was made out of
		driftwood and dipped in sulfuric
		acid.  It was out there...

				LEONARD
		Well...why murdered man?

				WALTER
		I don't know, it just happened,
		I guess.
			(Beat)
		I didn't mean to.

				LEONARD
		You didn't mean to what?

				WALTER
		Well, I mean it could have been
		something else, but it just
		worked out that way.

				CARLA
		It's called spontaneity, Leonard.
		Get with the program.

				WALTER
		Yeah it was all just an accident.

Leonard has suddenly become pale - he gets up -

				CARLA
		Are you alright?

				LEONARD
		Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.

				LINK
		You don't look so hot...
				CUFF
		You must have had some of the
		food -

Cuff drops a chunk of whole wheat bread onto his plate -

Leonard composes himself -

				LEONARD
		Excuse me...

Leonard heads off -

				CARLA
		I think he really is sick...

				LINK
		So who isn't around here?

Leonard heads over to the other end of the club -

A PLUMP MAN enters the club, looking around -

He spots Leonard, and makes his way toward him -

Leonard takes a deep breath - the plump man approaches -

				PLUMP MAN
		I tried to contact you by phone
		but I couldn't...

				LEONARD
		Excuse me I have to make a call...

Leonard picks up the phone and dials a number -

				PLUMP MAN
		I want that cat.  I'll pay you one
		thousand dollars - cash.

				LEONARD
			(on the phone)
		I'm trying to reach Lieutenant
		Beldere...

				PLUMP MAN
		What offers have you got for it?
		I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a
		wealthy man and I don't mind
		paying for something I want.

				LEONARD
		I can't talk right now.

				PLUMP MAN
		What do you want for it?  Two thousand?
		Three thousand?

				LEONARD
		No...look I'm busy...

				PLUMP MAN
		Listen to me...I don't want to
		lose this piece -

				LEONARD
			(on the phone)
		I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!

				PLUMP MAN
		Listen to me, listen to me...I've
		been collecting art pieces all over
		the world for years and let me tell
		you something.  This newcomer
		Walter Paisley has it, whatever it
		is, the X factor, that indefinable
		quality that separates the greats from
		the hacks, and I want that cat in
		my hands.  Are you listening to me?

				LEONARD
		Can't you see I'm busy here?

The plump man reaches inside his jacket -

				PLUMP MAN
		Alright you want to play hard...
		to insure I get that cat I'll give
		you five thousand dollars - cash,
		right here, right now...

The plump man pulls an envelope out of his jacket - this gets 
Leonard's attention -

				PLUMP		
		Two thousand for the cat, and
		a first look at the kid's next
		stuff.

Leonard looks at the plump man -

				VOICE ON PHONE(V.O.)
		Lieutenant Beldere.

Leonard hangs up and faces the plump man -



				LEONARD
		Someone has the cat just now but
		I'll have him back in a few days.
			(Beat)
		And you can have it for five thousand
		dollars.

The plump man breaks into a smile, pats Leonard on the arm and 
shakes his hand -

				PLUMP MAN
		Alright...thank you sir, I
		consider it a bargain.
	
The plump man gives Leonard his card, and heads out -

				PLUMP MAN
		Call me when you're ready...
		good night.

Leonard watches him leave - Leonard takes a deep breath as carla 
approaches him -

				CARLA
		Are you feeling better Leonard?

Leonard looks at her -

				LEONARD
		Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.

				CARLA
		Listen, I'm going over to Walter's
		after the place closes.  I want to
		get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you
		want to come along?

Leonard looks at her for a beat, then nods -

Onstage, the industrial musician finishes up his song, and the crowd 
applauds -
									DISSOLVE TO
INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

The door opens and Walter walks in, followed by Carla and Leonard -

Walter turns on the overhead lamp - Int the center of the room is a 
TALL OBJECT covered by a sheet -
Leonard closes the door behind him -

Carla looks at the object -


				CARLA
		Look at the size of it!

				WALTER
		It's not really that big I got
		it on kind of a stand...

				CARLA
		Let's see it.

				WALTER
		Uh, well, I'm a little nervous,
		I never did a person before.

				CARLA
		You can do anything you want if
		you set your mind to it.

Leonard leans back against the door and swallows -

				LEONARD
		It's hot in here...

				WALTER
		You want me to open a window or
		something?

				CARLA
		Come on Walter, take off the
		sheet.

Walter obliges, pulling down the sheet to reveal his creation -

It is LOU, standing upright and looking down at the three spectators 
- his skull is CLEAVED right down the middle from the top of his 
head to the bridge of his nose -

Leonard and Carla stare in dumbstruck silence -

Walter looks at their expressions, clutching the sheet -

				WALTER
		Don't you like it?

Carla continues to stare for a beat -

				CARLA
		Like it?
			(Beat)
		It's a masterpiece.  I've never
		seen anything like it before...
		and I hope I never see anything
		like it again.
Walter smiles and looks at his creation -

				WALTER
		Me too.

				LEONARD
		I have to sit down.

Carla walks around the statue -

				CARLA
		Take it in...in it's eloquence...
		modern man in all his...self
		pity...

Leonard drops down onto a hardwood chair -

				CARLA
		How did you ever find it all
		in yourself, Walter?

				WALTER
		It wasn't easy.

Carla looks back at Leonard, who has an ashen look on his
face -
				CARLA
		What's the matter with you?

				LEONARD
		Nothing...nothing at all.

				CARLA
		I've never seen anyone so...
		squeamish.
			(Beat)
		Well, what's your opinion,
		Leonard?

				LEONARD
		Don't ask.

				CARLA
		Oh come on!  Even you can see
		its value.

The head stares back at the two -

				CARLA
		Do you think you or I could have
		conceived of such a thing, much
		less have executed it?

Leonard says nothing -

				CARLA
		Well then admit it, it's a work
		of genius.

				LEONARD
		I admit it.

Walter heads over to Leonard -

				WALTER
		We can bring it down to the
		Jabberjaw.

Leonard gets up -

				LEONARD
		No.  Why don't you cover it up
		Walter...

				CARLA
		Why not?

				LEONARD
		Why don't you cover it up, Walter!

Walter throws the sheet back over the sculpture -

				CARLA
		What's wrong with you, why do
		you want to hide it?

				LEONARD
		Well, I've been thinking...
			(Beat)
		I didn't realize how much...talent
		Walter actually had.  It would be
		wrong for us to show them one at
		a time.
			(Beat)
		Dead wrong.

				CARLA
		You're right.  We should build a
		collection first.

Leonard backs up, looking at the two of them -

				LEONARD
		That's it...that's the idea!
		Maybe when it's big enough we
		can have a show!

Walter rushes over to Leonard -

				WALTER
		A show?!  Like this Sunday?

				LEONARD
		N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you
		take years and years...

Leonard looks at the sculpture, composing himself -

				LEONARD
		It will take years to make that
		many statues.
			(Beat)
		But your work would be featured.

				CARLA
		That's the idea, Walter.  It's the
		only way to gain recognition. All
		the big art critics and art dealers
		would be there, it would be an
		event.

				LEONARD
		Yeah then you could unload - sell
		this stuff for a lot more.

				WALTER
		A show..how soon can we go?

				LEONARD
		These things take time Walter...
		but for now you've got to break
		out of this one...avenue you're
		on...

Leonard heads over to Carla -

				LEONARD
		Carla and I will guide you, help
		develop and evolve your work...maybe
		lead you toward something more abstract...

				CARLA
		Abstract?  With his talent for realism?

				LEONARD
		You see the direction his realism
		takes! It's unhealthy!

				WALTER
		Look you said I was a genius!  If
		I'm a genius I don't want to be a
		bus boy anymore!
				LEONARD
		Well maybe you have a point there,
		you shouldn't keep working at the
		Jabberjaw.  Look...

Leonard digs into his pocket and peels off TWO HUNDRED
FIFTY DOLLARS -

				LEONARD
		Now look - Dead Cat's money in
		the bank, I'm sure that man's going
		to buy it, so here's your half
		in advance - twenty five dollars.

Leonard hands the money to an ecstatic Walter -

				LEONARD
		And if you need more, I've got it,
		don't worry.
			(Beat)
		I have faith in you Walter.

Walter heads over to Carla holding up the money and smiling like a 
simpleton -

				WALTER
		Gee..twenty five dollars for
		something I made!

				CARLA
		Now you're a professional!

Leonard heads over to the door and opens it -

				LEONARD
		Let's go!

Carla gives a look of attraction to Walter and heads toward the door 
-

				CARLA
		Good night, Walter.  And keep
		up the good work.

Walter smiles at her as Leonard gently takes her arm -

				LEONARD
		But don't burn yourself out, Walter.
		You've got all the time in the
		world.
			(Beat)
		Let's go!

Leonard pulls Carla into the courtyard -

Walter heads over to the door -

				WALTER
		Good night.

Walter closes the door and gazes at the money again - he is truly 
thrilled, and begins to JUMP around the room, HOOTING and HOLLERING 
-

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

Mrs. Swicker walks by Walter's door, overhearing him carrying on -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Mrs. Swicker opens the door watching Walter jumping around -
				
				MRS. SWICKER
		What's going on!

Walter SPINS around and stops jumping - he runs over to Mrs. Swicker 
holding the money -

				WALTER
		I'm an artist Mrs. Swicker!  A
		professional artist!

Walter YANKS the sheet off the statue -

Mrs. Swicker stares at the apparition, looking as if she's about to 
lose her lunch -

She gently back up into the hall -

				MRS. SWICKER
		Good night...

Mrs. Swicker closes the door abruptly -

Walter turns around, and gleefully continues to stare at the money -
									DISSOLVE TO

INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

Another busy night at the club - a DJ spins a hybrid assortment of 
records resulting in a most irritating sound -

Leonard sits close to Carla, smoking, as she nurses a glass of wine 
-

Art arrives again, looking around the room -

He passes Maxwell, who sits at a table with Mayolia, Charlie, and an 
attractive blond girl - once again, Maxwell is somewhat intoxicated 
-

				MAXWELL
		One of the greatest advantages
		to modern poetry is the overload
		of sensations from which to draw,
		everywhere in our minute lives,
		our TV's and our information
		traffic jam!  The goal is to
		filter those sensations to
		articulate our awareness!  And				
		I'm proud to say my poetry is
		understood only by that small
		minority which is...aware!

				ATTRACTIVE GIRL
		Aware of what?

				MAYOLIA
		Not of anything stupid!  Just
		aware!

Art passes Cuff and Link, sitting at a table smoking cigarettes -

				CUFF
		There's that weird dude again.

				LINK
		Man if this place doesn't cool
		out I'm gonna hang out somewhere
		else...

The singer continues to sing his song - Link then sees something -

				LINK		
		Get a load of this -

Then Walter walks through the front door - his look has changed 
considerably - he's dressed like an eccentric artist, wearing 
unusual clothes, and looking somewhat ridiculous - he strides into 
the club -

People notice him and greet him as he nods to various
people -

A couple points, and talks about him -

He passes Leonard and Carla - Leonard does a double-take -

				CARLA
		Hi Walter.

				WALTER
		Carla...

Walter sits down at a table next to Leonard and Carla - a waiter 
approaches -

				WALTER
		I'll have a Taft's-Sorrel mineral
		water, a piece of papaya cheese
		cake, and, and a grande cappuccino.

Walter lights up a small CIGAR, looking at Carla
confidently - a piece of TOBACCO gets stuck on his lip, which he has 
to spit off -

Maxwell approaches Walter's table and extends his hand -

				MAXWELL
		Walter.

Walter shakes his hand -

				WALTER
		Maxwell.

				MAXWELL
		I see the rewards of achievement
		have come your way.

Maxwell sits down -

				WALTER
		Well I am starting to have some
		success now, with my pieces...

Cuff and Link witness the encounter -

				CUFF
		Man look at that get up !

				LINK		
		Looks like that cat paid
		off in spades.

				CUFF
		Let's check out the scene.

Cuff gets up -

				LINK		
		I'm with you.

Leonard stands and addresses Maxwell and Walter -

				LEONARD
		I was just suggesting to Walter
		that he experiment with more
		abstract themes.

Maxwell looks at Leonard with contempt -

				MAXWELL
		Why do you suggest anything to
		Walter?  Are you the spokesman
		for society coming to poke
		your stifling finger in his
		eye!

Cuff and Link show up -

				CUFF
		And a hearty good evening to ya!

Cuff and link sit down, flanking Maxwell, who shifts and looks at 
the two of them - Leonard sits back down with
Carla -

				MAXWELL
		Oh now who invited these two, down
		from the clouds?

				WOMAN'S VOICE(O.S.)
		Maxwell!

Maxwell turns -

We see the shrill voice belongs to ALICE, a well-developed blonde in 
a tight sweater, who makes her way toward the table -

				MAXWELL
		Clear the table and bring me
		a bowl, I may be sick!

Alice approaches the table -

				CUFF
		It's Alice Ziobro, here to
		spread a little cheer -

Alice looks at Maxwell -

				ALICE
		Do you like my haircut?

				MAXWELL
		It's enchanting.

Alice takes a seat near Cuff and Link -

				CARLA
		Where have you been, Alice?

				ALICE
			(smugly)
		I was up in Seattle working on a
		video.

				LINK
		Oh yeah?  For who?

				ALICE
		Petroleum Function.

				LINK
		No way!

				ALICE
		Yeah it's for their new CD.

Alice then turns her attention to Walter -

				ALICE
			(disdainfully)
		Don't you work here?

				WALTER
		Not anymore!

				MAXWELL
		That's right, Walter has sold
		his first sculpture.

Alice is unimpressed by the news -

				ALICE
		Oh.  Really.

Cuff gets close to Alice -

				CUFF
		This guy's a clown and he ripped
		off our concepts.

				ALICE
		Oh yeah?



				CUFF
		Now he's trying to act cool about
		it.
			(Beat)
		Someone needs to pop his bubble.

				ALICE
		What are you thinking?		

Cuff whispers to Alice, and the two of them start laughing -

				MAXWELL
		And what project looms on the
		horizon, Walter?

				WALTER
		Uh, I don't know.

Alice faces Walter -

				ALICE
		I do life modeling, you know.

Walter looks at Alice -

				ALICE
		Would you like to do me?

				WALTER
		I just might.

				ALICE
		I'd be glad to help.
			(Beat)
		For $50 an hour.

Cuff and Link crack up -

				LEONARD
		Never mind that.  Walter's going
		to try something abstract.

				MAXWELL
		There you go again!  I may take my
		business to the Snake Pit!

				CARLA
		As a matter of fact I was going to
		suggest to Walter that he try a
		female figure.  It would be a
		departure from the mayhem/death
		theme.  You really should, Walter.

Carla looks at him -
				CARLA
		If you like, I'll be your model,
		for free.

Walter looks at her -
				
				WALTER
		I couldn't.  Not you.

Leonard gets closer to Carla -

				LEONARD
			(suggestively)
		Would you pose for me for free?

				CARLA
		Well, it all depends, Leonard...

Walter sees this and is FLUSHED WITH JEALOUSY -

				CUFF
		Man if you want to be a legit
		artist you have to do nudes,
		nudes, nudes...

				LINK
		Right.  Ain't no body of
		work complete without some...
		nudes -

This is about all Maxwell can take - Cuff cackles like a buffoon -

				MAXWELL
		Get these Philistines out of here!

				ALICE
		Oh let's change the subject I'm
		sick of hearing about sculpture!
		No one knows how to do that anymore,
		especially the bus boy from the
		Jabberjaw...

				WALTER
		Who do you think you're talking
		about!!

Alice laughs condescendingly -

				ALICE
		Look at you!  Who do think you
		are.  You're just a poser trying,
		and failing, to fit into the scene!

				MAXWELL
		Strong words...
			(under his breath)
		...for such a simple mind.

				ALICE
		I think this bit about him being
		this discovered sculptor is a
		bunch of baloney and a cry for
		help.		

				WALTER
		That's not true I am a sculptor!

				ALICE
		Oh yeah?

Alice picks up a piece of CAKE -

				ALICE
		Prove it!  Make something out
		of this!

Walter SMUSHES the cake onto Alice's palm -

				WALTER
		There!  Flat Cake!

Maxwell BELLOWS with laughter - Alice wipes off her hand -

				ALICE
		If you were an artist you could
		have created something!

				WALTER
		I'm going home!

Walter gets up and leaves -

Carla turns and raises her glass to Alice, smiling -

				CARLA
		Alice?
			(smile fades)
		You're a bitch.

Dejected, Walter makes his way out of the club, storming past 
Mayolia -

Mayolia watches Walter leave -

									DISSOLVE TO


EXT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

Alice makes her way out the door - heads down the steps and walks 
off -

Then out of the shadows we see Walter, who has been waiting for her 
to leave -

When the coast is clear, he begins to follow her...

EXT BUNGALOW - NIGHT

Alice enters the courtyard - she walks over to the front door of her 
bungalow, enters, and closes the door behind
her -

Just then Walter stealthily enters the courtyard -

He approaches Alice's door, waits a beat, then gently
knocks -

Alice opens the door and looks at Walter -

				ALICE
		What are you doing here?

				WALTER
		I wanted to apologize for
		being nasty to you this evening.

Alice is unimpressed -

				ALICE
		So you apologized!  Good night!

Alice SLAMS the door right in Walter's face -

Walter takes a few steps back - he clenches his jaw then BANGS on 
the door -

Alice RIPS the door open -

				ALICE
		Listen schmuck, why don't you
		get out of here and let me go
		to bed!

				WALTER
		I didn't finish talking to you!

				ALICE
		Well I'm done talking to you, what
		do I have to do, draw you a diagram!

				WALTER
		I decided to make a female figure
		after all!
			(Beat)
		I want you to pose for it.

Alice looks him up and down for a beat, changing her tone -

				ALICE
			(sarcastic)
		Well I'm touched.
			(beat)
		You're serious, aren't you?

				WALTER
		Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?

				ALICE
		Yeah.

Alice laughs, and stares at Walter for a beat -

				ALICE
		Well, if you've got the money, I
		don't mind posing.
			(Beat)
		When do you want to start work?

Walter looks up at her sheepishly -

				WALTER
		Tonight.

				ALICE
		What, right now?

				WALTER
		Uh-huh.

Alice looks him up and down again -

				ALICE
		Hold on...I'll get my coat.

									DISSOLVE TO
EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

Walter and Alice head over to his front door -

				ALICE
		It's kind of dark -

				WALTER
		Shh!

Alice shuts up and the two of them quietly head into him room, 
closing the door -

Just then Mrs. Swicker opens her door down the hall, poking her head 
out -

INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Alice begins to undress -

				ALICE
		You could use a little more
		heat in this place -

Walter drags a big bag of PLASTER out of a closet - he drags it to a 
new addition in the room, a large TROUGH -

				WALTER
		It's bad for the clay. You'll
		get used to it...

Walter then props up a chair -

				ALICE
		I'm almost ready - 		

				WALTER
		Sit in this chair, and I'll pose
		you.

Walter heads over to the lump of clay on the table -

Alice sits down, back to camera, totally nude -

				ALICE
		Do you like what you see?

Walter does a double take, and swallows hard at the voluptuous 
figure before him -

				WALTER
		Yes.
			(Beat)
		Just stay like that.

Walter nervously kneads the clay -

				ALICE
		That doesn't look like very
		much clay.

				WALTER
		Oh it's enough...

				ALICE
		Are you nervous, Walter?

				WALTER
		N-no...

Alice sexily shifts in her seat -

				ALICE
		Not even a little bit?

				WALTER
		I already told you I'm not.

				ALICE
		When's the last time you had a
		totally nude girl in your room...

				WALTER
			(swallows)
		Um...

				ALICE
		Without a stitch of clothing on,
		sitting and facing you...

Walter fumbles with the clay -

				ALICE
		A girl with a body like mine?				

				WALTER
		You're breaking my concentration!

Alice laughs -

				ALICE
		Walter can I ask you something?

				WALTER
		What!

				ALICE
		Are you a virgin?

Walter stands up -

				WALTER
		For cryin' out loud what does
		that have to do with anything!



				ALICE
		It's just an innocent question.
			(Beat)
		Besides I just wanted to clarify
		your intentions.

				WALTER
		Whaddya mean?

				ALICE
		Well I just wanted to make sure
		you know, fully and completely,
		that you're never gonna get any
		from me, at least in this lifetime.

This comment stings Walter - he clenches his jaw, and gets up -

				WALTER
		Look -
			(Beat)
		This pose is all wrong!

				ALICE
		I'll pose any way you want.

Walter then grabs up a SCARF, and approaches Alice -

Walter then hands the scarf to Alice -

				WALTER
		I want you to put this around
		your neck...

Alice takes the scarf and places it around her neck -

				WALTER
		Just like that...that's right.

Walter then steps behind Alice, grabbing the ends of the scarf 
gently -

Then suddenly Walter PULLS the ends hard, choking Alice -

Alice clutches the scarf and struggles, panicking and gasping for 
air -

Walter tugs at the scarf with all his might -

Alice kicks and tries to free herself, to no avail -

Walter continues to strangle her, clenching his jaws -


INT CARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carla, Maxwell, Cuff, Link, and another girl sit around the living 
room - Carla hands Maxwell a plate -

Maxwell inspects the plate -

				CARLA
		Here you go, enjoy.
		
				MAXWELL
		I hope this was made with egg
		whites!

				CARLA
		It was.

				MAXWELL
		What's this sauce!  I'm lactose
		intolerant.

				CARLA
		Don't worry it's a non-dairy
		sauce made from soy milk.

				MAXWELL
		Hm.

Maxwell takes a bite - someone knocks at the door and Cuff goes to 
answer it -

Cuff answers the door -

				CUFF
		Hey it's mister perjury!		

In walks Walter, who notices everyone there -

				WALTER
		Hi.

				MAXWELL
		Good morning Walter!


Walter approaches Carla, a little dejected he wasn't
invited -

				WALTER
		Hi Carla.
			(Beat)
		What's going on?


				CARLA
		These guys came by to help me
		try out some of my new organic
		recipes.
			
				WALTER
		Oh...

				MAXWELL
		Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar
		and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked
		yeast.  Join us?

				WALTER
		No thanks.  Sounds good though.

				MAXWELL
		Suit yourself.

				CARLA
		What's up, Walter?

				WALTER
		I came over to see you.
			(Beat)
		I brought something...I
		wanted to show you.

				CARLA
		Oh yeah?

				WALTER
		Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?

Maxwell puts down his plate -

				CARLA
		Is it murdered man?

				WALTER
		Better!

Carla gets up -

				CARLA
		Come on!

Maxwell claps his hands twice, not getting up -

				MAXWELL
		All hands!

Cuff and Link follow Carla -
									DISSOLVE TO
INT CARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Walter, Cuff, and Link carry an OBJECT covered by a sheet - Maxwell 
watches -

				LINK
		Man this is heavy!

				CUFF
		Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?

				MAXWELL
		Put it in the middle of the room!

				CARLA
		When did you make this, Walter?

				WALTER
		Uh, last night.  It doesn't take me
		very long.

The men put the object down, out of breath -

				CUFF
		Well let's see it, man!

Walter undoes a string and lifts off the sheet to reveal -

ALICE, naked and seated in a chair, clutching at a scarf around her 
throat -

Everyone stares at it in awe -

				CARLA
		Walter...I can't believe it.

				MAXWELL
		I'm honored to know this man.

				WALTER
		So you think it's nice?

				LINK
		Man, she's beautiful.


				WALTER
			(to Carla)
		You think she's better than Murdered
		Man?

				CARLA
		Well I can't say that Walter!  She's
		incomparable.  They're both great.

				MAXWELL
		I'm...moved.  I'm moved to write
		about this!
			(Beat)
		Tonight, at the Jabberjaw, I will
		recite a new poem, and we'll
		celebrate in your honor!

Maxwell puts his hand on Walter' shoulder -

Carla then kisses Walter, a peck on the lips - Walter is 
flabbergasted -

INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

A LOUD BAND wraps up a song, and the singer CRASHES into the drum 
set - people applaud -

Walter sits in a big wooden chair with a paper CROWN on his head and 
a paper STAR on his lapel, looking a little tipsy - in one hand is a 
GOBLET, in the other a PLUNGER -

Art and a new UNDERCOVER COP stand at the entrance of the club -

				ART
		Alright, let's split up and keep
		a low profile.  You hear anything,
		you let me know.

The undercover cop nods, and heads off -

				ART
		I'm going to get to the bottom
		of this...

Carla approaches Walter with a bottle of CHAMPAGNE -

				CARLA
		More champagne, your majesty?

				WALTER
		Here here...

Carla pours some into the goblet -

				CARLA
		Where where...

				WALTER
		There there...

The goblet overflows -

				WALTER
		That's good...

Carla sits down next to Walter on the edge of the stage - Walter 
leans over to her with a drunken smile on his face -

				WALTER
		May I please have another little
		kiss?

				CARLA
		Walter!  Jeez!

				WALTER
			(smile fades)
		Sorry...

Carla laughs - Walter smiles again and Carla puts her head against 
his arm -

Leonard surveys the crowd from another part of the room -

Maxwell then heads to the stage where Walter is sitting and raises 
his hands -

Scattered applause erupts -

				MAXWELL
		Order!  Order!

The crowd quiets down as Maxwell puts his hand on Walter's shoulder 
-

				MAXWELL
		Walter...
			(booming voice)
		The bird that flies now pays
		later through the nose of
		ambidextrous apathy -

Walter strains to understand -

				MAXWELL
		Necrophiles may dance upon the
		placemats in an orgy of
		togetherness -

Walter looks around the room as Maxwell gathers steam -





				MAXWELL
		The highway of life cuts sharply
		through the shady ghettos and the
		ivy-covered tombs, and laughter
		rains from every capsule in the
		star-spangled firmament -

Cuff, Link, and Mayolia listen from an adjacent table -

				MAXWELL(O.S.)
		And in the deep freeze it is the
		children's hour -

Maxwell punches holes in the air with his finger -

				MAXWELL
		And no one knows that Duncan is
		murdered and no one knows that
		Walter Paisley is born -

Maxwell slaps his hand on Walter's shoulder, spilling some of 
Walter's champagne - Walter smiles and looks at Maxwell through his 
drunken haze -

				MAXWELL
			(getting louder)
		Duncan knows...Tuesday sunrise
		knows...alley cats and garbage cans
		and satellite dishes, and you and I,
		and the nude descending the staircase,
		and all such things with souls, we
		shall hear that Walter Paisley is born!

Walter looks at Maxwell with a half-smile, completely lost -

				MAXWELL
			(loud)
		Ring rubber bells!  Beat cotton
		gongs!  Strike silken cymbals!  Play
		leather flutes -

Leonard listens with a blank expression on his face -

Art slouches at a table and looks at Maxwell like he's a jerk - he 
shifts, unable to take much more of this -

				MAXWELL(O.S.)
		The cats and cans and you and I
		and all such things with souls,
		we shall hear that Walter Paisley
		is born!

Maxwell raises his clenched fists -

				MAXWELL
		And the soul become flesh - Walter
		Paisley is born!

Maxwell stands back - people applaud, and Maxwell bows his head and 
leaves the stage -

Cuff claps enthusiastically - Link slouches behind him, half-
clapping - Mayolia seems too moved to clap -

				CUFF
		That was cool, man, that was cool.

				MAYOLIA
		That was the greatest rap I ever
		heard!

				CUFF
		It sent me.

Cuff then turns to Link -

				CUFF
		What did he say?

				LINK		
		Didn't you hear him?

				CUFF
		No man I'm on my own plane.

Walter sits onstage by himself, still holding his plunger -

Maxwell sits down at a table with Charlie and two attractive girls -

				CHARLIE
		Maxwell that was magnificent.

Maxwell slugs back the rest of his champagne -

				1ST PRETTY GIRL
		You're really...eloquent.

Maxwell clunks the glass on the table -

				MAXWELL
		Walter deserves every word of it!

				1ST PRETTY GIRL
		Makes me so glad I'm aware.

Maxwell puts his hand over the girl's hand -

Carla approaches Walter, who reels a bit in the chair - he has a sad 
look on his face -

				WALTER
		Did you hear what he said?

				CARLA
		Yes Walter.

				WALTER
		All about me...

Carla nods and smiles -

				WALTER
		It's true, isn't it?

				CARLA
		Every word...

Walter slowly smiles -

Walter polishes off the dregs of a bottle of champagne as Leonard 
watches him -

				LEONARD
		You better hold off on the

				WALTER
		Yeah, why?

				LEONARD
		You might talk too much.

				WALTER
		Yeah and what would I say?

				MAXWELL(O.S.)
		Are you two grinders ignoring us?

Walter staggers over toward Maxwell, who is sitting with Carla, 
Charlie, and the two attractive girls -

				WALTER
		Oh not me Maxwell, I wouldn't
		ignore you.

He puts his hand on Maxwell's shoulder -

				WALTER
		I know what it is to be ignored.

				CARLA
		Tell us what you're going to

				WALTER

Walter takes his crown off -

The group listens to Walter -

				WALTER
		An' everyone will say Walter let

Walter staggers down the street -

Walter removes the star from his lapel and continues to stagger down 
the street -

				WALTER
		Ring rubber bells, beat cotton
		gongs, strike silken cymbals...

Walter turns the corner -

				WALTER
		Tell us what you're gonna do

Walter bounces against a wall -

				WALTER
			(loud)
		I'm gonna make big statues and
		little statues, movie stars and
		poets, and people who sell things
		on television, and the mayor, and
		some rock singers...

Walter stops walking and leans his hand against the wall -

				WALTER

		What are you gonna do next, Walter?

Walter all of a sudden gets a sad look on his face -

				WALTER
		What am I gonna do next...
		what am I gonna do next...

Walter looks like he's about to cry -

				WALTER
		I gotta do something before they
		forget me...I know what it's like
		to be ignored...

Walter thinks, then heads off, down the alley -

EXT LUMBER YARD  - NIGHT

CLOSE on a table saw - a CARPENTER pulls the saw over a piece of 
wood, then turns it off -

He picks up the wood and inspects the cut - he then turns around, 
only to be startled by Walter -

				CARPENTER

		Life is nothing but a homeless
		guy on th' bus of art...
		
				CARPENTER
		Huh?

Walter gets RIGHT in the carpenter's face -

				WALTER
			(slurred)
		What is not creation is rice
		cakes...let them all crumble
		to feed the creator...

The carpenter stares at him for a beat, trying to avoid Walter's 
boozy breath -

				CARPENTER
		Beat it, ya drunk, or I'll call
		the cops!

The carpenter turns the saw back on -

Walter SPINS the man around by his shoulder -

				WALTER
			(loud, slurred)
		All else is rice cakes!

The carpenter SHOVES Walter hard - he lands on his ass -

				CARPENTER
		Get out of here, you god - damn
		freak or I'll split your head
		with a two-by-four!

Walter staggers to his feet and takes a few steps back - the 
carpenter gives him a wary look for a beat and then continues sawing 
-

Walter then POUNCES on the man, choking him -

The carpenter tries to fight back but Walter is possessed with a 
psychotic strength -

Walter begins to gain the upper hand forcing the man's neck closer 
and closer to the sawblade -

The carpenter sees the blade, and struggles with all his might to 
get free -


				CARPENTER
		No...no!

Walter forces the man's face down on the metal -

				CARPENTER
		Stop...no...NOOOOOO!


The saw makes a CUTTING noise -

				CARPENTER
		Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
									FADE OUT
									FADE IN

EXT JABBERJAW - DAY

Leonard gets a PAPER out of a VENDING MACHINE -

He reads the headline - "HEADLESS MAN FOUND IN LUMBERYARD"

Leonard reads it for a beat -

Walter then approaches, carrying a box -

				WALTER
		Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning,
		isn't it?

				LEONARD
		It was.

Leonard lowers the paper - his face drops -

				LEONARD
		What do you have in the box?

				WALTER
		Just wait till you see this!

Walter opens the box and removes the contents -

It is the HEAD of the carpenter - Walter shoves the sculpture in 
Leonard's face -

Leonard drops the paper and staggers back -

				WALTER
		Whatsamatter Leonard?

				LEONARD
			(Beat)
		You made...a bust...
				WALTER
			(gleefully)
		Yeah isn't it wonderful?

Leonard takes a few steps back -

				WALTER
		Whatsamatter Leonard?

				LEONARD
		Put it down, Walter.

Walter's smile fades, and he puts the head down - Leonard addresses 
him -

				LEONARD
		Walter...Walter listen carefully.
			(Beat)
		I don't want you to make any
		more statues.  Do you understand?
		No more statues.

				WALTER
			(hurt)
		Well Why not?  I gotta make statues
		Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they
		want me to make them.
			(Beat)
		I can't go back to being a busboy!

				LEONARD
		Maxwell!  He's behind all this with
		all his stupid blowhard poetry!
			(Beat)
		Listen, you've got to stop right
		away!  I'm beginning to feel
		responsible!

				WALTER
		Well, w-what did you do?

				LEONARD
		Never mind...

Leonard puts his arm around Walter -

				LEONARD
		Walter...I decided to have that
		show for you, right away.

Walter walks with Leonard -



				LEONARD
		When Carla comes by I'll talk to
		her.  She'll make up some nice
		invitations.  We'll have them
		printed up.

				WALTER
		Yeah?

				LEONARD
		Well invite the critics, and the
		art collectors...we'll tell them...

									DISSOLVE TO

INT CARLA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

INSERT INVITATION - a fancy invitation to the Jabberjaw to showcase 
the work of Walter Paisley -

Mayolia fixes up the back of Carla's dress - Cuff and Link slouch in 
chairs, and Maxwell fumbles with his tie, dressed formally -

				MAYOLIA
		Well I don't see why we can't
		go!

				MAXWELL
		Mister Leonard De Santis is afraid
		to have you come.  You who buy
		his coffee, his potables, his food.
		You are the heart and soul and meat
		of the Jabberjaw.
			(Beat)
		And he slighted you!

				CUFF
		Did you get an invitation?

				MAXWELL
		I did not!  But I'm going anyway.
		Not to drink his champagne but
		to see Walter's triumph.

Just then Walter walks through the front door, dressed to the nines 
-

				MAXWELL
		After that we go no more!

				WALTER
		Hiya Maxwell.

Maxwell pats Walter's arm -

				MAXWELL
		I won't say good luck, Walter.

				WALTER
		Why not?

				MAXWELL
		It would imply you could not
		succeed on your ability alone!

Maxwell dramatically exits -

Walter watches him, then heads over to Carla, and smiles -

				CARLA
		You look so handsome.

Walter looks down at his outfit -

				WALTER
		I do?

Walter then looks at Carla -

				WALTER
		So do you.

Cuff and Link crack up at his comment -

				WALTER
		I mean, you look so pretty.
		
				CARLA
		Thank you.

				WALTER
		Are you ready?

				CARLA
		Ready?  We've got plenty of time.

				WALTER
		I know.  But I wanted to talk to
		you.

Carla looks at Walter for a beat -

				CARLA
		Ok...

Carla grabs her coat and bag -

				CARLA
		We can go now if you like.

Walter and carla head out -

				CARLA
			(to the others)
		Goodbye.

				WALTER
		Bye!

				LINK
			(dryly)
		Break a leg.

Walter and Carla head out, closing the door behind them -

				CUFF
		Man, why do you suppose Walter
		wants to get her alone?
			(Beat)
		You suppose he could be physically
		attracted to her?

				LINK	
		No man, he ain't the type.  He
		don't get enough vitamin E.

				CUFF
		Maxwell gave him a bottle of
		wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started
		taking it.

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Walter and Carla walk down the street - Walter says
nothing -

				CARLA
		Nice night out...

				WALTER
		Hm...

The two say nothing for a beat -

				CARLA
		Well...what did you want to
		talk to me about?

				WALTER
		Well...w-what kind of people do
		you like, Carla?

				CARLA
		Oh, I don't know.  Smart people.
		Creative people I guess.

				WALTER
		You think I'm creative?

				CARLA
		Of course I do!

				WALTER
		That means you like me!

Carla looks at Walter -

				CARLA
		I like you very much, Walter.

				WALTER
		I thought you did on account of
		you kissed me the other night!

Carla sees where this is going and doesn't like it - the two stop 
walking -

				CARLA
		Well that was for your sculpture
		of the girl.  Your nude in the
		chair.

				WALTER
		Carla -

Walter tries to arrange his thoughts -

				WALTER
		I, uh, I've been alone for a
		long time, and I know you've
		been alone because you never
		seem to go out with anybody -

Walter looks nervously at his hands -

				WALTER
		 - even though Leonard's always
		asking you to go out with him and
		I - just -

				CARLA
		What are you trying to say?

Walter gestures for Carla to sit down at a nearby bench -they sit 
down -

Walter swallows appearing very nervous -

				WALTER
		Carla...
			(Beat)
		I don't want to make statues
		anymore!
				CARLA
		You don't?

				WALTER
		No.
			(Beat)
		I want to get married.
			(Beat)
		To you.

Carla senses trouble -

				CARLA
		Uh...
			(Beat)
		...how long have you been thinking
		about this, Walter?

				WALTER
		Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever
		since you first came to the club.

Carla looks down at the ground -

				WALTER
		You were the only one who was
		ever nice to me!
			(Beat)
		I didn't know you loved me
		until you kissed me.

Carla suddenly feels very awkward - she takes a deep breath and 
prepares for the rejection -

				CARLA
		Walter, I really do like you.
		And I did kiss you.  But...
		that was because of your work.

Walter listens intently to every word -

				CARLA
		There's more to being in love
		than just that.

Carla gives a sympathetic look to Walter - Walter doesn't react for 
a beat, as if putting two and two together -

				WALTER
		You mean...you don't love me?
		
Carla looks down at the ground -

				CARLA
		I'm afraid that's what I mean.

Walter begins to get very upset -

				WALTER
		But you gotta love me!
			(Beat)
		Why do you think I made that
		statue of Alice?!

				CARLA
		Walter, I'm sorry...
			
				WALTER
		You just can't be sorry! I wanna -
		I wanna marry you!

Carla looks around -

				CARLA
		Now calm down Walter!
			(Beat)
		Now, let's go in there, and
		when the show's over, maybe we
		can talk about it.

				WALTER
		No! I want to talk about it now!

				CARLA
		Walter...
			(Beat)
		I don't want to hurt your feelings
		but there is no way we're ever going
		to get...together.  You know what I
		mean?

				WALTER
		Why not?!

				CARLA
		Because...
			(Beat)
		We're just friends.  That's all.
		Just friends.
				WALTER
		I get it.  I see the whole thing
		now. No one knows if Walter Paisley
		is born!

				CARLA
		Jeez, what is your problem all of a
		sudden?

				WALTER
		Oh sure, let's string along poor
		Walter, see how far it will take us!

Carla gets up -

				CARLA
		You're starting to freak me out,
		Walter.  I'll see you there.

Carla heads off - Walter watches her leave -

				WALTER
		You have to love me, Carla...

									DISSOLVE TO
INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

The hoi polloi of the art community mingle at the private party -

On display are Walter's creations - Dead Cat, Murdered Man, 
Strangled Girl and his bust of the carpenter's head -

People talk about the works in muted voices, as if they are
serious works of art -

Art, the undercover cop, is also there, eyeing the room -

Maxwell takes an hors d'oeurve off a passing tray, and nods to 
someone offscreen -

Walter sits alone, dejected - a waitress presents him with a tray of 
champagne glasses -

Walter looks up at the tray -

				WALTER
		No thanks.

The waitress walks away -

The plump man talks to an ART CRITIC -


				CRITIC
		We have many artists about but
		no craftsmen.

The critic gestures to the voluptuous figure of Strangled Girl -
				CRITIC
		This man knows his anatomy.

				PLUMP MAN
		I'd give five thousand for
		this.

				CRITIC
		After you've read my review it will
		probably cost you ten thousand.

The critic and the plump man laugh -

Maxwell swaggers over to Walter, putting his empty glass of 
champagne on a passing tray and grabbing up another -

He puts his hand on Walter's shoulder -

				MAXWELL
		So what's the problem?

Leonard watches them from across the room -

				MAXWELL
		Why on Earth should you be so
		depressed?  Have you heard some
		of the things they've been saying?
		You can make fifty thousand
		on these pieces alone!

				WALTER
		I thought you didn't respect money!

				MAXWELL
		I don't!  But fifty thou?  That's
		not money, that's manna!

Walter gets up -

				WALTER
		Leave me alone.

Walter sees Carla -

He gets up and heads over to her -

Carla glares back at him  - Walter looks at her with a strange gaze 
in his eyes -

				WALTER
		I'm sorry about what I said before.

				CARLA
			(softening)
		Forget it.

				WALTER
		I've been thinking...
			(Beat)
		Carla, would you do one favor
		for me?

				CARLA
		Just about anything, Walter.

				WALTER
		Would you let me make...a statue
		of you?
		
Carla smiles -

				CARLA
		Would you really like to?  That
		would make me very happy.

				WALTER
		Ok...tonight.  I'll make a
		statue of you tonight, OK?

Carla smiles and nods - then her smile fades -

Leonard takes a sip of champagne and notices something across the 
room -

Cuff and Link have crashed the party - they head over and take a 
look at Murdered Man -

Leonard puts his glass down and heads over to them -
			
Cuff takes his cigarette and jams it in the mouth of Murdered Man - 
Leonard approaches -

				LINK
		Man, we've come to make the scene.

				LEONARD
		You weren't invited.  Now get out
		of here.

				CUFF
		I guess we're not good enough to get
		a private show.
				LEONARD
		That's right!  And we're not open for
		business!  This is an art exhibit!  No
		bums!

Leonard pushes them out the door as Cuff grabs his cigarette back -
				LINK		
		Man, you're the worst.

				LEONARD
		Yeah right right - goodbye!

				CUFF
		That's alright, we got a pressing
		engagement!

				LINK
		Yeah, right outside the door!

Leonard closes the door behind them -

Carla is looking at the collection - she inspects Dead Cat, the 
carpenter's head -

She then approaches Strangled Girl - She smiles, drinking in the 
sculpture -

Then she sees something that troubles her -

				CARLA
		Uh - oh.

She looks closely at one of the hands - a FRACTURE has formed on one 
of her fingers -

Carla gently goes to touch it when the piece CRACKS OFF -

Carla picks up the piece and goes to put it back -

She sees a HUMAN FINGER protruding from the sculpture -

Carla stands back, in shock -

She looks around the room - soon shock turns to horror -

She makes a bee-line for the front door but is stopped by Walter -

				WALTER
		Where are you going Carla?
		Whatsamatter?

Carla is mute with terror for a beat, but manages to get out the 
words -

				CARLA
		Walter...there's...
				
				WALTER
		What?

				CARLA
		There's...a body inside that statue!

Walter smiles innocently -

				WALTER
		Well, that's Alice.

Carla is speechless -

				WALTER
		It's alright, Carla.
			(Beat)
		Maxwell said it's alright.

Walter takes a few steps closer -

				WALTER
		Let them become clay in his hands
		so that he might mold them.

Carla is clearly frightened -

				CARLA
		Walter...stay away from me!

				WALTER
		Don't you see Carla?  I made them
		immortal.

Walter takes a few steps closer -

				WALTER
		Don't you see?  I can do the
		same for you!

Carla waits for a second, then SHOVES Walter out of the way, fleeing 
out the door -

Walter looks around to see if anyone is looking -

Nobody is -

He takes this opportunity to BOLT out the door in pursuit of Carla -
EXT STREET - NIGHT

Carla runs down the street as fast as she can -

Walter follows, in hot pursuit -

INT JABBERJAW - NIGHT

The critic stands in front of Strangled Girl - Art approaches from 
behind -

The critic has noticed the EXPOSED finger -

				CRITIC
		Well I'll be.  Look at this!

A WOMAN approaches -

				CRITIC
		There's another work...inside this
		work.

				WOMAN
		My Heavens!  It looks...like a real
		finger.

				CRITIC
		It's unparalleled...reality cased in
		layers...concealed in a shield of
		whiteness, blankness...

Art scrutinizes the finger - several other people begin to approach, 
admiring the discovery -

				ART
		Yeah...that's reality alright -

Art does not like what he sees -

Art heads over to murdered man -

He inspects the hand - sees a RING shape on one of the fingers -

A horrible realization forms in Art's mind - he grabs a BUTTER KNIFE 
off a table and begins to chip away at the
hand -

Maxwell sees this, begins to stumble over to it -

				MAXWELL
		Precisely what are you doing!

Art breaks the plaster off the fingers - he inspects the ring on 
Lou's finger -

				ART
		Lou...Lou!
			(Beat)
		Get back!

Everyone spins around as Art grabs a chair - SWINGS IT at Murdered 
Man -

There is a loud CRASH as Leonard watches Art hit the sculpture - the 
whole crowd then SCREAMS - the jig is up -

Carla ducks down an alley and crouches behind a dumpster surrounded 
by some garbage cans -

He lunges after her, but Carla throws some garbage cans in front of 
him and runs away -

Walter throws the cans aside and continues to chase her -

EXT LUMBER YARD - NIGHT

Carla runs into the yard and hides behind a large stack of wood -

Walter then approaches, looks around, then suddenly -

Walter looks around -

Carla hides, but inadvertently KNOCKS OVER a piece of wood -

Walter hears it rattle across the ground - he runs toward the noise 
-

Carla grabs a bookshelf-sized PLANK as Walter approaches -

Walter freezes for a beat, a manic expression on his face -

				CARLA
		Get back Walter...

Walter starts to approach -

				CARLA
		Get back Walter!

Walter lunges and WHAM!  Carla slams the plank over Walter's head - 
he hits the ground -

Carla runs off in the direction she came from -

Walter staggers to his feet, clutching his head - he looks around, 
not knowing which direction Carla went - he runs in the opposite 
direction -

Walter runs down the street, stopping to catch his breath - he then 
continues to run down the street -

He begins to frantically barricade his door -

Walter frantically mixes the plaster in the trough -

He looks back at the relentless banging at his door, and mixes the 
plaster with increased fury -

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

By this time a whole crowd of people have assembled at Walter's door 
- Art, Maxwell, and Leonard alternately kick and bash the door - the 
door begins to give -

		Harder!

They continue to bash the door until finally -


INT WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

CRASSHHHH!!! The door bursts open and Art, Maxwell, Leonard Carla, 
Cuff, Link and the critic all stumble in, pushing aside any 
obstacles -

Everyone begins to pour in but as they look ahead, there is a 
collective gasp -

They are looking at Walter, HANGING from a NOOSE, and covered in 
dripping plaster -

The crowd gathers around Walter in stunned silence -

Carla looks remorsefully at Walter -

				CARLA
		Oh no...Walter...

				CRITIC
		Unbelievable...this will command
		a small fortune.

				MAXWELL
		I suppose he would have called it
		Hanging Man...

		...his greatest work.

PULL BACK to reveal the room of spectators, looking at Walter's 
final creation -
