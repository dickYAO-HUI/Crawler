					ANDREWS

Thank you gentleman.. This is rumour  control.  Here are 
the facts.  As some of you know, a 337 model EEV crash 
landed here at 0600 on the morning  watch.  There was one 
survivor. Two dead and a droid that was hopelessly smashed 
beyond repair.  
The survivor is a woman.

What brother means to say is ... We
view the resence of any outsider,
woman, as a violation of the harmony, a potential 
break in the spiritual unity.

		ANDREWS
We are well aware of your feelings in this matter.  
You will be pleased to know that I have requested a 
rescue team - Hopefully, they will be here inside of a week 
and evacuate her A.S.A.P.
  (to Clemens)
What's her medical status?

All eyes turn to Clemens.
					CLEMENS
She doesn't seem too badly damaged.  She is unconscious.  
Difficult at the moment to make a specific diagnosis.

			ANDREWS
		Will she live?

Clemens considers the question.

					CLEMENS
Yes.  I should think so. -

Pursing his lips.  Andrews glances back at Dillon.

					ANDREWS
				Look, none of us here is naive.
				    (pause)
It's in everybodyπs best interests if the woman doesnπt come out of
the Infirmary until the rescue team arrives.  And certainly not without 
an escort.  Right?  So we should all stick to our set routines and not 
get unduly agitated.  Correct?  All right.  Thank you, gentlemen.

Ripley lies still on a cot.
Clemens at her side.
There's an IV pack taped to her arm.

Clemens checks her vital signs...
On a table beside the cot, he finds a syringe with clear liquid... 
Prepares to give her an injection.
Ripley's eyes snap open.

				RIPLEY
				       What's that?

Clemens is surprised, but tries not let it show -- expels air from the 
hypo.

					CLEMENS
A light cocktail of my own mix.  Sort of an eye opener.

			RIPLEY
Are you a doctor?

			CLEMENS
I've only got a 3-C rating.  But I'm the
best you're going to find around here
ä I really ought to shave your head.

Startled, Ripley sits bolt upright on the cot, pulling the sheet around 
her:
			
					CLEMENS
Lice.  Big problem here, I'm afraid.  When your hand is 
steadier you can attend to your private parts yourself.

Pause.

					CLEMENS
My name is Clemens.  I'm the Medical Officer here ...

			RIPLEY
Here?

			CLEMENS
Fury 161.  One of Weyland-Yutani's backwater work prisons.  
Do you mind?  This is just sort of a stabilizer ...

He lifts her arm -- gives her the injection.

	CLEMENS
	You crash landed in an EEV. Evidently separated from your 
	mothership before you hit our atmosphere.  I've no idea how 
	long you were in hypersleep - coming down the way you did 
	can be a jolt to your. system.

I'm gonna be sick for two weeks if I
decompressed too fast.

				CLEMENS
	Yes.  Quite nauseous.

			RIPLEY
	What about the others?

			CLEMENS
	    I'm afraid they didn't make it.
This sinks in.
					RIPLEY
What?
	
		CLEMENS
They didn't survive.

		RIPLEY
I have to get to the ship.

		CLEMENS
You're in no condition for that.

She stands.
Buck naked.	
					RIPLEY
	You want to get me some clothes, or should I go like this?
	
			CLEMENS
	Given the nature of our indigenous population, I would suggest 
clothes.

He turns and opens a closet.

					CLEMENS
	None of them has seen a woman in years.  Neither have I for that 
matter.

A now fully-clothed Ripley is being led along the corridor by Clemens.

					CLEMENS
This used to be a thousand convict facility, but its been reduced 
all the way down to a twenty five man custodial staff.  They keep 
the place on pilot light ≠

Pilot light for what?

	Prisoners WILLIAM, ARTHUR, VINCENT, CHRISTOPHER and ED have 
lowered the EEV

							CLEMENS
				Toxic dump.  The prisoners used to make lead 
sheets to seal off the shafts

						RIPLEY
				Any women here?

						CLEMENS
Sorry Lieutenant Ripley.  This is a double Y chromosome facility.  
Strictly male.

			RIPLEY
How come you know my name?

		CLEMENS 
It's stenciled on the back of your shorts.  We also found your dog 
tags.

Great.

Ripley takes a deep breath and crawls into:

 Everything is smashed, wrecked...
 In the very cramped quarters, Ripley finds a place to kneel.  
 Clemens follows her inside.
						RIPLEY
    				   Where are the bodies?

						CLEMENS
We have a morgue.  We've put them there until the investigative team 
arrives, probably in a week's time.

			RIPLEY
	There was an android...

			CLEMENS
Disconnected.  There were pieces of him all over the place.  Whatπs 
left was 
thrown in the trash.  The Corporal was impaled by a support beam 
straight 
through the chest He never knew what hit him.

			RIPLEY

					CLEMENS
She drowned in her cryotube.  I don't think she was 
conscious when it happened...I'm sorry.
She struggles for control.
Impossible
Her eyes fill with tears.
Eyes brimming,  Ripley spots the remains of Newt's cryotube.  
Faceplate is broken.
Probably happened in the crash.
Thereπs a strange discoloration on the metal below the faceplate.  
She leans forward, running her fingers over it...

				CLEMENS
			What is it?

RIPLEY
			Where is she?

					CLEMENS
				I told you.  The morgue.

					RIPLEY
			I want to see what's left of her body.

					CLEMENS
	What do you mean, what's left?  The body's intact.

			RIPLEY
	It is?  I want to see it.

Any particular  reason you're so insistent?

		RIPLEY
	I have to make sure how she died.

		CLEMENS
I hate to be repetitious about a sensitive subject, 
but itπs quite clear that she drowned.

Clemens stops at the foot of the stairs
					CLEMENS
				Was she your daughter?

					RIPLEY
				No ... She wasn't my daughter.

They both look down at the body.
					RIPLEY
				Give me a moment.

Clemens steps away ...
Ripley begins to examine Newt's corpse.
After a couple of moments Clemens returns
					CLEMENS
				O.K.?

					RIPLEY
				No. We need an autopsy.

					CLEMENS
				You're joking.

					RIPLEY
				No way.  We have to make sure how she died.
					CLEMENS
				I told you she drowned.

Clemens begins to slide the body back.  Ripley stops him.

					RIPLEY
				I'm not so sure - I want you to cut her open.

CLEMENS 
Listen to me, I think you're disorientated --
half your system's still in cryo-sleep.

Ripley doesn't want to hear this.
					RIPLEY
Look, I have a very good reason for
asking this and I want you to do it --

			CLEMENS
		Would you care to share this reason?

			RIPLEY
	Possible contagion.

			CLEMENS
	What kind?

She stares at him.

32A  	AUTOPSY - TIME CUT 							32A

Clemens now masked and gowned begins to incise Newt's chest.  It's a 
long time since he's lone this, and he's not altogether sure why he's-
doing it now ...
He cuts through her rib-cage.
CLEMENS
We have nothing unusual.  Everything in place.  No 
sign of disease.  No sign of any contagion.-Lungs 
flooded with fluid - ergo, she drowned.

Makes a final cross-lateral incision.

					CLEMENS
				Still nothing.  Satisfied?
She turns away.
					CLEMENS
Now, since Iπm not entirely stupid, do you want to tell
me what you're really looking for?

From above a door smashes open -- Andrews and Aaron come clattering 
down the stairs.

					ANDREWS
				Mr. Clemens.

					CLEMENS
Superintendent.  I don't believe you've
met Lieutenant Ripley.

					ANDREWS
				What's going on, Mr. Clemens?

					CLEMENS
First, Lieutenant Ripley is feeling much better.  
I'm happy to say.  Second, in the interests of public 
health, I'm conducting an autopsy.

					ANDREWS
				Without my authority?

					CLEMENS
There didn't seem to be time, but it's all turned out all right, 
the body shows no signs of contagion.

					ANDREWS
				Good.  But it might be helpful of Lt. Ripley 
didnπt parade
				around in front of the prisoners, as I am told 
she did in the
				last hour.  It might also be helpful if you 
kept me informed
				as to any change in her physical status.  Or 
would that be
				asking too much?

					RIPLEY
				We have to cremate the bodies.

					ANDREWS
Nonsense.  We'll keep the bodies on ice
until a rescue team arrives.

					AARON
				(to Andrews)
				Cremate -- that's a good one, sir.

					RIPLEY
		There is the public health issue.

Looks at Clemens.
					CLEMENS
				Lt. Ripley feels that there's the possibility 
of a 
				communicable infection.

					ANDREWS
I thought you said there was no sign of disease.

					CLEMENS
It would appear that the child drowned, though without the 
proper laboratory tests its Impossible to be absolutely certain - 
but I think it would be unwise to tolerate even the possibility 
of an unwanted virus.  An outbreak of cholera would look very 
bad on your report, wouldn't it?

An unhappy Andrews turns to Ripley.
ANDREWS
We have twenty-five prisoners in this facility.  All double 
Y chromos, all thieves, rapists, murderers, forgers, child molesters
 ... all scum.  But scum that have taken on religion. I, for one, 
don't think that makes them any less dangerous.  So I try not to 
offend their convictions.  I don't want to disturb the order.  I don't 
want ripples in the water.  And I don't want a woman walking around 
giving them ideas.

			RIPLEY
Yes.  Obviously for my own personal safety.

			ANDREWS
	Exactly.

The two lock eyes -- then Andrews turns back to Clemens.

They manage to get the dead beast out onto the floor --
Wrap chains around the animalπs back legs and begin to winch it over 
head.


					FRANK
No problem.  Never had any problem with  the ladies.  
Iπd say ågood day, my dear, how's it going, anything I could
do to be of service! - then Iπd give her the look, you know, 
up down...give her a wink, nasty smile, she'd get the picture.

Right.  And she'd say 'kiss my ass you horny old fucker.'

I'd be happy to kiss her ass.  Be happy to kiss her anywhere 
she wants.

Yeah, but treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen - right, Frank?

Treat the queens like whores, the whores like queens.

reeling from the heat, the two prisoners reach their breaking point.
Hurling the two canvas bags into the pit, they beat a hasty retreat.

weeping freely, Ripley watches what used to be Newt and Hicks disappear 
into the inferno.
Impulsively she takes Clemens' arm for support.
He gives it freely.

	explodes from the ox's thorax.
	Rockets out of the carcass and tumbles to the floor.

	This thing has four legs, Alien head and drooling mouth.

An enormous fan with razor sharp blades is going full bore...

Stopping, Murphy spots something in the dark of the air-duct.  
Kneeling, he checks it out.
Looks like a reptileπs skin.
Holding his broom, he stretches it out.
Approximately the size of a small deer... 
Weird.
He starts singing again ...

a-way and not have to face the facts.  It's not ea-sy fac-ing 
up when your  whole world is black.

He hears something in the darkness to his left.
Stopping, he sees a recessed storage area built into the wall of the 
air-duct...
A gurgling sound is coming from inside.
Curious, Murphy moves closer.
Stopping before the recessed area, Murphy peers inside.

Above a seal on the wall in bold letters, she reads:

Wiping sweat from her eyes, she breaks the seal on the container.
A modular black box appears from beneath the seal.
She pries open a plate off the black surface and presses a button.  
She can see pulses on a meter in the box's face.
Flight recorder still operational.
Shutting it off, she puts it on the floor beside her.  She studies the

Deep within the unexplored vastness of the complex.
It's black as night.
Illuminated by the light of his torch --
Golic eyeballs a sign on the wall in front of him.
Behind him, Rains lights a candle.
Kneeling he places it in a row that seems to crawl away forever into 
the dark.
The flickering light reveals a hallway.
A very long hallway.
The sign on the wall above Golic reads:

TOXIC WASTE DISPOSAL
THIS SPACE HERMETICALLY SEALED
Boggs glances back at Rains   
Kneeling, he studies a map at his feet.
When he speaks, his voice echoes and re-echoes off the concrete walls.

BOGGS
				How many?

RAINS

This makes a hundred and eighty-six.

Golic shoves some food in his mouth and chews, noisily.  He steps over 
to an abandoned cigarette machine.  Kicks !he lock off with a bang -- 
begins loading packs of  cigarettes into his duffel ... 
Irritated, Boggs turns on him.

Boggs doesn't get an answer.  He, glances sideways at Rains.
Rains is scratching himself furiously
Stares fixedly down the row of flickering candles.  
Golic following his line of sight.
Something very bizarre is happening .

Every few seconds, one of the candles goes out.

					BOGGS
				What the shit is doing that?

					GOLIC
				You're not supposed to swear.

					BOGGS
Shut up.  It's okay to say shit.  It's not against God.

			RAINS
What the hell is going on with the candles?

The three prisoners hold their torches- high in the air.  
Try to see what's going on.
No deal.
Whatever's snuffing out the candles is too far away to be illuminated 
by the torches.

					BOGGS
Must be a wind from one of the ventshafts -- backwash from the closest 
circulating unit.  If all the candles go out, how're we going to know 
where 
we are?

Golic hands Rains his torch.
Rains moves down the line of candles.
His companions receding in the distance.
His footsteps echo inside the hallway.
Behind him, he hears Boggs:

					BOGGS
				Watch your step.

The words echo and reverberate within the enclosed space.
Moving forward, Rains starts to sweat.
Ahead, another candle goes out.
Golic and Boggs are a long ways behind him, now.
Only three more candles to go.
Beyond, there's nothing but a black hole.
Stopping at the last flickering candle, he raises his torch high in the 
air.
There's nothing there.
Relieved, he starts to relax.
Then he realizes there's a massive glob of blackness off to his right.
It's not reflecting the light from his torch.
*	And it's moving.									
				*

THE ALIEN

rises up, directly in front of Rains.
Now a fully mature creature.
It moves with the speed of a big cat...
In one blurred motion, it is upon him.
Tears open his chest -- leaves a gapping hole in his abdomen.  
The last thing Rains hears is his own scream.

INT.  DARK PASSAGEWAY - GOLIC - BOGGS

Three hundred yards behind, they'd hear Rains' agonized cry and watch 
the torch flicker out.
Suddenly panicking, Boggs grabs the torch and takes off in the opposite 
direction.
Golic charges after him.
	Rounding corners, charging through the blackness...
A  maze of ink-black passageways.
Footsteps reverberate.
Finally catching Boggs, Golic takes back the torch.
Both men are exhausted, completely lost.
Out of breath, unable to speak...
Trying to collect himself, Golic stares around.
Ahead, he see candles flickering in the dark.

Boggs starts to get sick.
He never finishes.
Glancing up on the ceiling, Golic sees

THE ALIEN

crawling across the ceiling like a spider.
At the speed of thought, it leans down and rips off Boggs' head.  
Blood flies everywhere, spattering Golic in the face.
His tunic drenched...
Paralyzed with fear, Golic watches the Alien hurls Boggs' helpless body 
against the wall.
*	Still hanging from the ceiling, it stops what it's doing and 
turns to Golic.- 						*
Screaming like a banshee, torch in hand, he runs away into the echoing

Alone, Ripley studies the remains of Bishop.
Thereπs a battery pack in his left shoulder.
She checks the connections.
A spark sizzles.
Using a cable, she connects a terminal in Bishop's smashed thorax to 
the black flight recorder.
Instantly, Bishop's one eye blinks.
A garbled sound comes out of the small speaker at the back of his 
mouth.
Shoving her hand into his throat, she gives him an adjustment.
Bishopπs voice suddenly becomes audible.

What remains of his forehead wrinkles in concentration.

What happened on the Sulaco?  Why were the cryo-rubes ejected?

Seconds pass.
Then, the sound of the female voice heard aboard the Sulaco just prior

goes into the computer and gets sent back to the network.

Let me see if I have this correct, Lieutenant.  It's an

it arrived on your spaceship.  It kills on sight and is 
generally unpleasant.  And, of course, you expect me to

residency, I did a 36-hour stretch in an E.R., went out, got more
than slightly drunk, then got called back to duty after a boiler
had blown on a fuel stationed.  Thirty patients.  Eleven of them 
died when I prescribed the wrong dosage of pain killer.  I got 
seven years in prison and my licensed reduced to a 3-C.  While 
in prison I kicked my habit.  And here I am.

led by Aaron

		Wait. They're here to help.

	Ripley looks at Aaron's simple, trusting face. He steps aside.
	The others move in behind him.  A hand raised to stop them.
	Another wave of nausea overcomes Ripley. Unsure of herself, as -
	From the shadows, steps Bishop II. Our first sight -- same as the

stops them
