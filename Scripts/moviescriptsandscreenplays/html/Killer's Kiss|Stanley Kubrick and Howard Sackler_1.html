DAVY (V.O)<br>
It's crazy how you can get yourself in a mess sometimes and not even be able to think about it with any sense. And yet not being able to think about anything else. You get so youre no good for anything or anybody. Maybe it begins by taking life too serious. Anyway, I think that's the way it began for me. Just before my fight with Rodriguez three days ago.<p>
