<p>                    a.k.a. Indiana Jones and the Monkey King</p>
<p>                   a.k.a. Indiana Jones and the Garden of Life</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                               A Screenplay by </p>
<p>                               Chris Columbus</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                                                                        FIRST DRAFT</p>
<p>                                                                        2/10/95</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>        UNDERWATER - CLOSE-UP: A brightly colored FLY, attached to a dangling,</p>
<p>        fishing line. A large SALMON swims to the fly. The salmon EXAMINES the</p>
<p>        fly, deciding whether or not to bite.</p>

<p>        CAMERA PANS UPWARD, tracking the line and moving OUT OF THE WATER. We</p>
<p>        PASS the crooked boards of a small ROWBOAT and continue to PAN UPWARD.</p>
<p>        A MAN reclines in the boat. NAPPING. His hands gently grip a WOODEN</p>
<p>        FISHING POLE. He is handsomely dressed in SPORTSMAN'S trousers and a</p>
<p>        blazer. His green, tweed fishing hat is lowered OVER HIS FACE. Its</p>
<p>        brim is filled with various types of TACKLE and BAIT.</p>

<p>        It is DUSK. A warm, SUMMER evening. The boat rests on a calm lake,</p>
<p>        surrounded by MOORS. Thick night FOG has begun to settle over the</p>
<p>        entire area.</p>

<p>        TITLE: SCOTLAND. 1937.</p>

<p>        Suddenly, the man's fishing line becomes TAUT. The wooden pole</p>
<p>        BUCKLES. The man STIRS. He SITS UP, moving the hat from his face.</p>
<p>        CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, into a CLOSE UP of the man. It is INDIANA</p>
<p>        JONES. His face ANXIOUS... HOPEFUL... Indy begins to REEL in his</p>
<p>        catch.</p>

<p>        A VOICE interrupts. In the DISTANCE.</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN (O.S.)</p>
<p>                        Doctor Jones!... Doctor Jones !...</p>

<p>        Indy TURNS to the direction of the sound, still STRUGGLING with the</p>
<p>        line.</p>

<p>        INDIANA'S POV</p>

<p>        Countless ORANGE FLAMES sparkle across the moors. The TORCHES are</p>
<p>        being carried by several members of a small village. The VILLAGERS are</p>
<p>        gathered behind a group of SIX POLICEMEN. The policemen are headed by</p>
<p>        INSPECTOR ANGUS MACGOWAN, a plump, balding fellow, with a veiny,</p>
<p>        bulbous nose, beady green eyes and a thick, curled red moustache.</p>
<p>        MacGowan SHOUTS to Indy.</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                        We need your assistance!</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (struggling with the</p>
<p>                                fishing line)</p>
<p>                        C'mon, Mac... It's the first bite</p>
<p>                        I've had all week...</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                        Please... It's very importantl...</p>

<p>        Indiana STRUGGLES a bit longer with the line. But his conscience</p>
<p>        prevails and Indy DROPS the fishing pole. With a GRUMBLE, he ROWS back</p>
<p>        to shore.</p>

<p>        THE MOORS - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER</p>

<p>        NIGHT has fallen. It is very DARK. A RELUCTANT Indiana has joined the</p>
<p>        Inspector and the other Policemen. They LEAD the townspeople along the</p>
<p>        foggy moors. Slowly, carefully, the villagers SEARCH... CREEPING...</p>
<p>        their faces tense, many unable to hide their FEAR. A summer wind sends</p>
<p>        an eeire HOWL whistling through the night air. Blue MOONLIGHT bathes</p>
<p>        the moors, creating stark, frightening shadows.</p>

<p>        An expression of ANGER and ANNOYANCE cover Indiana's face. He GRUMBLES</p>
<p>        to MacGowan.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Do you value our friendship, Mac?</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                        More than me' nightly pint.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Then this better not be some wild</p>
<p>                        goose chase...</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                        T'ain't wild geese we're after,</p>
<p>                        Doctor Jones. You got me' word on</p>
<p>                        that...</p>
<p>                                (sincere)</p>
<p>                        ...and a MacGowan's word is truer</p>
<p>                        than an angel's kiss!</p>

<p>        There is a sudden SCREAM! One of the villagers STUMBLES UPON</p>
<p>        something. Everyone GATHERS around the villager.</p>

<p>        A CORPSE lies before them. The body has a somewhat rubbery appearance,</p>
<p>        as if all of its bones had been BROKEN. The man's pale, greenish face</p>
<p>        is FROZEN in a hideous grimace. Indiana and MacGowan STARE in shock.</p>
<p>        The villagers WHISPER among themselves.</p>

<p>                                        YOUNG MAN</p>
<p>                        Scotty Ferguson.</p>

<p>                                        OLD WOMAN</p>
<p>                        He's the eighth.</p>

<p>                                        MAN</p>
<p>                        Just like the others...all his bones</p>
<p>                        busted...crushed...</p>

<p>                                        OLD MAN</p>
<p>                        Whatever's killin' people around</p>
<p>                        here ain't human.</p>

<p>                                        WOMAN</p>
<p>                                (pointing OFFSCREEN)</p>
<p>                        It's there! Again!</p>

<p>        The woman SHOOTS FORWARD. The police and the townspeople are right</p>
<p>        BEHIND her. A curious Indiana FOLLOWS.</p>

<p>        The woman stops in a CLEARING. She is POINTING ahead. The villagers</p>
<p>        SURROUND her. They STARE ahead, in the direction where the woman</p>
<p>        points. Nearly a mile in the distance, WE SEE</p>

<p>        AN ANCIENT SCOTTISH CASTLE.</p>

<p>        An enormous, 16th CENTURY stone structure. Tall, forboding towers,</p>
<p>        lined with menacing GARGOYLES, pierce the night sky. The castle</p>
<p>        appears DESERTED. Its interior is completely DARK, save for a small,</p>
<p>        flickering CANDLELIGHT. It burns from the castle's UPSTAIRS WINDOW.</p>

<p>        Indiana gives a QUESTIONING look to MacGowan. The Inpector points to</p>
<p>        the castle's upstairs window.</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                        That light...only burns after a</p>
<p>                        murder's been committed.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (nods, turning toward</p>
<p>                                the castle)</p>
<p>                        Let's go.</p>

<p>        The villagers STEP BACK. Eyes wide with FEAR. Murmers of 'Ain't goin'</p>
<p>        in there', 'Nor I', 'Got me a wife and kids', are heard from the</p>
<p>        TERRIFIED villagers. Indiana TURNS to MacGowan. Even the usually</p>
<p>        sturdy Inspector is TREMBLING. But MacGowan turns to his men, FORCING</p>
<p>        himself to be strong.</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                        Well... Ahmmmm...that is what we're</p>
<p>                        here for...eh, men?...ah...</p>
<p>                                (points to men)</p>
<p>                        Hennesey... Galbraith...</p>
<p>                        Bottomley... You're comin' with us.</p>

<p>        As each man is called, the color LEAVES his face. The chosen policemen</p>
<p>        RELUCTANTLY join the Inspector and Indiana, as they begin walking</p>
<p>        TOWARD the castle. The remaining villagers and policemen STAY BEHIND.</p>
<p>        WAITING. The elderly woman KISSES the crucifix that hangs from her</p>
<p>        neck. She STARES at the departing men.</p>

<p>                                        ELDERLY WOMAN</p>
<p>                        May God help them.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        THE CASTLE DOORS.</p>

<p>        Two enormous wooden doors, covered with intricate CARVINGS of demons,</p>
<p>        serpents and gargoyles, adorn the castle entrance. Indiana and the</p>
<p>        police STAND before the doors. Indy GLANCES to the upstairs window.</p>
<p>        The candle still FLICKERS.</p>

<p>        A long, wooden bar, carved into the shape of a SERPENT, is fastened</p>
<p>        through the metal door latches. It BLOCKS the castle entrance. Indy</p>
<p>        and the Policemen GRAB HOLD of the bar. It is extremely HEAVY. Using</p>
<p>        all of their strength, they manage to slide the bar OUT of the door</p>
<p>        latches. It hits the ground with a THUD, rolling down the castle</p>
<p>        stairs.</p>

<p>        Indiana CLUTCHES the rusty, metal door handles. He PULLS. HARD. The</p>
<p>        doors CREAK. GROAN. And slowly OPEN. A thick CLOUD OF DUST explodes</p>
<p>        from inside of the castle. It BLOWS OUT all of the torches.</p>

<p>        Behind the open doors, there is only TOTAL DARKNESS. Indiana ENTERS,</p>
<p>        holding the flashlight before him. The Policemen exchange FRIGHTENED</p>
<p>        glances. Inspector MacGowan SHOVES them through the open doors.</p>

<p>        INT. CASTLE</p>

<p>        Indy's flashlight BEAM glazes over the castle's interior. It is a</p>
<p>        STONE PALACE. FILLED with elaborate, antique furnishings, macabre</p>
<p>        sculptures and oil paintings. The place is bathed in DUST. Thick</p>
<p>        COBWEBS fill each corner. It is extremely COLD. The men's breaths are</p>
<p>        VISIBLE. Hennesey RUBS his folded arms.</p>

<p>                                        HENNESEY</p>
<p>                        It's deathly cold in 'ere. How could</p>
<p>                        a human bein' survive?...</p>

<p>        Hearing this, the other Policemen exchange TERRIFIED glances. Indiana</p>
<p>        shines his flashlight to a TWISTING, STONE STAIRCASE. The staircase</p>
<p>        spirals upward along a far wall, leading to the SECOND FLOOR. A FAINT</p>
<p>        GLIMMER of light emanates from the top of the stairs. Indiana moves</p>
<p>        FORWARD. The Policemen FOLLOW.</p>

<p>        Indiana ASCENDS the stairs. SLOWLY. SILENTLY. Toward the LIGHT.</p>
<p>        MacGowan and the others are directly BEHIND Indy. As he makes his way</p>
<p>        to the top, Indiana examines the bizarre OIL PAINTINGS that line the</p>
<p>        wall. There are various PORTRAITS and LANDSCAPES, depicting everything</p>
<p>        from MILITARY BATTLES to SUNDAY PICNICS. But the unsettling quality of</p>
<p>        the pictures, is that they each feature the same white haired, ELDERLY</p>
<p>        MAN. Indy COMMENTS to Mac.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        This guy's got one hell of an ego.</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                        Baron Seamus Seagrove III. Some say</p>
<p>                        'e walks the moors every midnight...</p>
<p>                        others claim e's been dead for</p>
<p>                        years...</p>

<p>        Indy arrives at the TOP OF THE STAIRS. His hand rests on a SCULPTURE</p>
<p>        that is part of the bannister. The sculpture is a bust of BARON</p>
<p>        SEAGROVE. Indiana makes his way to the first doorway, where the LIGHT</p>
<p>        emanates. The door is WIDE OPEN. A THICK COBWEB covers the entrance.</p>
<p>        Indy WIPES away the web, and ENTERS the room. The Policemen DRAW their</p>
<p>        pistols. They FOLLOW.</p>

<p>        INT. ROOM</p>

<p>        A BEDROOM. Deserted, except for a few pieces of elaborate, ancient</p>
<p>        FURNITURE and a large CANOPY BED. Everything in the room is CAKED with</p>
<p>        dust and cobwebs...save for the burning CANDLE. It RESTS on the</p>
<p>        windowsill, in a sparkling, sterling silver holder. It bathes the room</p>
<p>        in ORANGE LIGHT.</p>

<p>        Indiana walks TOWARD the candle. Arm outstreched, he prepares to LIFT</p>
<p>        it. The Policeman WATCH. SHIVERING. SILENT. Tightly gripping their</p>
<p>        PISTOLS. Indy's fingers are INCHES from the candlestick. SUDDENLY...</p>

<p>        There is a LOUD WHOOSH! The candle GOES OUT! Indiana DROPS his</p>
<p>        flashlight. There is TOTAL DARKNESS. We hear the distant, MANICAL</p>
<p>        LAUGH of a man. It ECHOES through the castle. Indy retrieves the</p>
<p>        flashlight, clicking it back ON. The candle has DISAPPEARED! The laugh</p>
<p>        has SOBSIDED.</p>

<p>        MacGowan LOOKS at his men. A TROOBLED look covers the Inspector's</p>
<p>        face. MacGowan's eyes DART about the room. Hennesy is GONE!</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                        Hennesey?... Hennesey?...</p>

<p>                                        GALBRAITH</p>
<p>                                (panic)</p>
<p>                        'E was standin' right 'ere! Just a</p>
<p>                        second ago... Standin' right beside</p>
<p>                        me!...</p>

<p>        THE SOOND OF A BELL! A thick, dull RINGING! In the DISTANCE! It sends</p>
<p>        a CHILL through the men. Indiana DARTS out of the room. FOLLOWING the</p>
<p>        sound. The Policemen are right BEHIND HIM.</p>

<p>        INT. CASTLE</p>

<p>        Indy and the Police HURRY down the stairs. The ringing bell CONTINUES.</p>
<p>        MacGowan is CALLING for Hennesey. Indy DASHES to a door along the far</p>
<p>        wall. He OPENS it. It leads into a DARK BASEMENT. The sound of the</p>
<p>        ringing bell echoes from INSIDE. Indiana ENTERS, motioning for the</p>
<p>        others to FOLLOW.</p>

<p>        INT. BASEMENT</p>

<p>        A decrepit, narrow, wooden STAIRWAY leads into the basement. Indy</p>
<p>        holds tightly to his FLASHLIGHT. The Policemen are CLUSTERED behind</p>
<p>        him, taking each step with extreme caution. The boards CREAK and GROAN</p>
<p>        with their every move.</p>

<p>        MacGowan LEANS to his side, calling for Hennesey. MacGowan's weight</p>
<p>        causes the rotted bannister to SNAP IN TWO! He LOSES his footing!</p>
<p>        FALLING off the side of the stairs! Indiana's arm SHOOTS OUT! GRABBING</p>
<p>        HOLD of MacGowan's collar. Indy PULLS MacGowan back to SAFETY.</p>
<p>        MacGowan CATCHES his breath. SHAKING.</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                        Thanks for catchin' me.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        I'd rather be catchin' trout.</p>

<p>        They CONTINUE down the stairs, arrivifig at the bottom. It is a large,</p>
<p>        MUSTY STONE BASEMENT. The slimy walls are covered with a GREEN MOSS.</p>
<p>        There are several DOORS along the basement wall. The sound of the</p>
<p>        ringing bell is much LOUDER down here.</p>

<p>        Indiana moves to the FIRST DOOR. He REACHES for the handle. The</p>
<p>        Policemen DRAW their pistols. Indy OPENS the door. A LARGE OBJECT</p>
<p>        SHOOTS OUT FROM INSIDE! Rolling TOWARD the men! The policemen FIRE</p>
<p>        their guns. SEVERAL SHOTS ring out. The object comes to a STOP. A DEEP</p>
<p>        RED LIQUID pours out onto the floor. Indy DIPS his finger into the</p>
<p>        liquid. He TASTES.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Interesting blood type...</p>

<p>        The Policemen STARE. WIDE EYED. Indy SMILES.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Cabernet sauvignon. 1897.</p>

<p>        Indy's flashlight beam shines ahead, ILLUMINATING the 'mysterious</p>
<p>        object', a WINE BARREL. And inside the room, is a deserted WINE</p>
<p>        CELLAR. Suddenly, a LOUD CREAK echoes through the basement. Galbraith</p>
<p>        CRIES OUT.</p>

<p>                                        GALBRAITH</p>
<p>                                (pointing OFF SCREEN)</p>
<p>                        Look!</p>

<p>        Everyone TURNS. A large STONE DOOR, built into the wall, slowly OPENS.</p>
<p>        Indy and the police stare in AMAZEMENT. The door STOPS. Wide OPEN. A</p>
<p>        FLICKERING LIGHT glimmers from inside. Indiana WALKS to the opening.</p>
<p>        He PEERS into the opening. The Police stay a FEW STEPS behind.</p>

<p>        BEHIND THE DOOR</p>

<p>        A FAMILY CRYPT. Stone COFFINS, with glass covered tops, line the crypt</p>
<p>        walls. Macabre, ghastly RELIGIOUS STATUES decorate the room. Countless</p>
<p>        DEATH MASKS cover the ceiling, all carved with that same frighteningly</p>
<p>        familiar face... BARON SEAGROVE!</p>

<p>        CAMERA DOLLIES to the far corner of the crypt. It STOPS on a CLOSE-UP</p>
<p>        of the CANDLESTICK! The EXACT candle from upstairs! Still BURNING! It</p>
<p>        rests on one of the coffin's GLASS TOPS.</p>

<p>        A TREMBLING MacGowan steps back, away from the crypt. Be BLURTS an</p>
<p>        order to his men.</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                        Galbraith... You come with me! We'll</p>
<p>                        search for Hennesey... Out here!</p>
<p>                        Bottomley... You go with Doctor</p>
<p>                        Jones...</p>
<p>                                (finger shaking, points</p>
<p>                                to inside of crypt)</p>
<p>                        In there.</p>

<p>        MacGowan and Galbraith nearly fall over each other as they SCRAMBLE</p>
<p>        away from the crypt. The two DASH OFF into another section of the</p>
<p>        basement. Indy SHAKES his head. He ENTERS the crypt. A reluctant and</p>
<p>        very frightened Bottomley FOLLOWS.</p>

<p>        INT. CRYPT</p>

<p>        Indy's flashlight beam dances across the glass COFFIN TOPS. Decayed</p>
<p>        CORPSES smile from inside, their hands tightly clutching crucifixes.</p>
<p>        Bottomley is HORRIFIED by the sights. Indiana continues AHEAD. He</p>
<p>        PASSES the burning candle, moving further into the darkness of the</p>
<p>        crypt. The shivering Bottomley stays directly BEHIND Indy. With their</p>
<p>        every step, the bell's ringing grows LOUDER... LOUDER...</p>

<p>        Indiana and Bottomley arrive in a circular CHAMBER, located at the far</p>
<p>        end of the crypt. Here, the ringing bell is nearly DEAFENING. The</p>
<p>        sound echoes from ABOVE. We are on the floor of the BELL TOWER.</p>
<p>        Indiana SHINES his flashlight UPWARD. The beam stops on a RINGING BELL</p>
<p>        that hangs SEVERAL FEET in the air. Inside of the bell, dangling by</p>
<p>        his feet, is the DEAD BODY of</p>

<p>        HENNESEY! He has REPLACED THE BELL CLAPPER! His body SWINGS back and</p>
<p>        forth. It SLAMS into the sides of the bell. Causing the DULL RINGING.</p>

<p>        Bottomley SCREAMS. Indiana GRABS Bottomley's arm.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Let's get outta' here.</p>

<p>        Indy and Bottomley TURN to the crypt door. It begins to CLOSE! The two</p>
<p>        men DASH FORWARD. The door CONTINUES to close. Indy and Bottomley are</p>
<p>        only INCHES away...when the door SLAMS SHUT! They PUSH and KICK at the</p>
<p>        door. NO GOOD. It WON'T BUDGE. A PANICKED Bottomley calls for help.</p>

<p>                                        BOTTOMLEY</p>
<p>                        Inspector MacGowan! Galbraith! Open</p>
<p>                        the door!</p>

<p>        Using his flashlight, Indy SCANS the door, looking for a CRACK,</p>
<p>        another way OUT. Indy NUDGES Bottomley.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (motioning to candle)</p>
<p>                        I need more light.</p>

<p>        Bottomley HURRIES to the candle. He REACHES OUT. There is a LOUD</p>
<p>        WHOOSH! The candle flame GOES OUT! Followed by TOTAL DARKNESS! Indy</p>
<p>        TURNS from the door.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Bottomley?...</p>

<p>        NO answer. Indy SHINES his flashlight toward the area. The candle is</p>
<p>        GONE. There is NO SIGN of Bottomley. Indiana takes a STEP FORWARD.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Bottomley?...</p>

<p>        AGAIN, no answer. Indy SWEEPS the flashlight beam across the room. It</p>
<p>        PASSES one of the coffins...then SHOOTS BACK! Indy is met with a</p>
<p>        SHOCKING SIGHT!</p>

<p>        BOTTOMLEY LIES INSIDE THE COFFIN! DEAD! His face twisted in a GHOULISH</p>
<p>        SMILE. All of his bones BROKEN. His hands are wrapped around a</p>
<p>        CRUCIFIX. Indy STARES in horror. There is a SOUND. FOOTSTEPS. There is</p>
<p>        SOMEONE ELSE in here. Indy's flashlight beam DARTS around the crypt.</p>
<p>        There is NO SIGN of anyone.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Who is it?... Who's there?...</p>

<p>        The same crazed LAUGH of a man echoes through the crypt. A CHILLED</p>
<p>        Indy TURNS BACK to the door. He is startled to find the crypt door</p>
<p>        COVERED WITH A THICK SHEET OF ICE!</p>

<p>        Indy REACHES OUT. He TOUCHES the sparkling, green ice. He SNAPS back</p>
<p>        his hand. His fingers are BURNT.</p>

<p>        INT. BASEMENT</p>

<p>        MacGowan and Galbraith are OUTSIDE of the crypt door. They PULL at the</p>
<p>        door's metal handles. Trying to OPEN IT. But the door WON'T MOVE.</p>
<p>        MacGowan CALLS through the door.</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                        Doctor Jones! Try to push!</p>

<p>        INT. CRYPT</p>

<p>        Indy ANSWERS, taking a STEP BACK.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Can't! There's some kinda' hot ice</p>
<p>                        coverin' the...</p>

<p>        Indiana suddenly FALLS! The floor has DISAPPEARED FROM BENEATH HIM!</p>

<p>        Indy manages to GRAB HOLD of a stone coffin. His fingers tightly GRIP</p>
<p>        the coffin's edge. Indiana LOOKS DOWN. Beneath him, is a SEVERAL</p>
<p>        HUNDRED FOOT DROP INTO TOTAL DARKNESS!</p>

<p>        Indy tries to PULL HIMSELF UP. The coffin's ancient stone begins to</p>
<p>        CRUMBLE. Large chunks and pieces FALL from Indy's grasp. He is LOSING</p>
<p>        HIS GRIP.</p>

<p>        Seconds before he plummets into the abyss, Indiana REACHES inside of</p>
<p>        the coffin. He clutches onto a CORPSE'S ARM! Using the arm, Indy</p>
<p>        SWINGS DOWNWARD.</p>

<p>        INT. ABYSS</p>

<p>        At the precise moment, Indiana RELEASES the dead arm. He LANDS on a</p>
<p>        ROCKY LEDGE. Located only a few feet BELOW the open crypt floor. Indy</p>
<p>        STANDS on the ledge. SAFE. He SMILES. RELIEVED. Suddenly, the ledge</p>
<p>        SNAPS!</p>

<p>        Indiana FALLS! His body DROPS hundreds of feet into the blackness. A</p>
<p>        MOMENT passes. Then... WE HEAR A SPLASH!</p>

<p>        BOTTOM OF THE HOLE!</p>

<p>        A POOL OF WATER! Surrounded by rocky, cavernous WALLS. Indiana's hat</p>
<p>        FLOATS on the water's surface. Indy POPS OUT of the water, bobbing up</p>
<p>        beside the hat. Indy REACHES for the hat. Suddenly, a FISH flaps out</p>
<p>        of the water. The fish GOBBLES UP one of the hat's live baits and</p>
<p>        disappears back underwater. Indy SMIRKS.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        NOW they bite!</p>

<p>        Indy attempts to PULL himself out of the water. There is a LOUD SOUND.</p>
<p>        Grinding METAL. Rattling CHAINS. Indy's eyes DART to his side.</p>

<p>        TWO HORIZONTAL METAL GATES EJECT FROM THE CAVERN WALLS! They SHOOT</p>
<p>        across the water! Like LIGHTNING! They're headed TOWARD each other...</p>
<p>        and Indy's HEAD!</p>

<p>        Indy DIVES underwater. THE GATES SNAP SHUT! Less than an INCH above</p>
<p>        the water's surface! Indy ATTEMPTS to resurface. The closed gate STOPS</p>
<p>        HIM. He CLUTCHES the grating, trying to MOVE the gate. It's TOO</p>
<p>        STRONG! Indy STRUGGLES for air. NO GOOD. There isn't enough SPACE.</p>
<p>        He's going to DROWN!</p>

<p>        UNDERWATER</p>

<p>        In desperation, Indy SWIMS downward. Looking for an ALTERNATE ESCAPE.</p>
<p>        But there is NO BOTTOM in sight. Indy's eyes BULGE. His face loses</p>
<p>        COLOR. Only a few precious SECONDS OF LIFE remain...when suddenly, he</p>
<p>        SPOTS SOMETHING. A SMALL TUNNEL. Built into the CAVERN WALL. Indiana</p>
<p>        hurriedly SWIMS to the tunnel. He BOLTS inside.</p>

<p>        A WATER FOUNTAIN. A large, THREE TIERED stone structure. Instead of</p>
<p>        the familiar carvings of angels and beautiful maidens, this fountain</p>
<p>        is surrounded with water spewing DEMONS, GARGOYLES and hellish BEASTS.</p>
<p>        CAMERA DOLLIES TO A LARGE METAL DRAIN, located inside of the</p>
<p>        fountain's base. The drain cover begins to TURN. Suddenly FLIPPING</p>
<p>        OPEN! Indiana CRAWLS out of the opening. He GULPS at the air. COLOR</p>
<p>        returns to his face. LIFE returns to his body. Indy RISES to his feet.</p>
<p>        He finds himself STANDING in the fountain.</p>

<p>        INDY'S POV</p>

<p>        He is inside of a BANQUET ROOM. The sprawling room is beautifully</p>
<p>        DECORATED in Victorian dignity. The room is IMMACULATE. Not one SPECK</p>
<p>        of dust. Two Medieval SUITS OF ARMOR adorn one wall. A gargantuan</p>
<p>        crystal CHANDELIER hangs above a long, mahogany BANQUET TABLE.</p>

<p>        At the far end of the table, sits a shriveled, white haired ELDERLY</p>
<p>        MAN. It is BARON SEAMUS SEAGROVE III, the fellow whose likeness</p>
<p>        appeared in every piece of artwork. Baron Seagrove is CALMLY eating</p>
<p>        his dinner. A bloated ROASTED PIG rests on a silver platter before</p>
<p>        him. The same candle we saw burning in the upstairs room and the</p>
<p>        family crypt, now RESTS on the table. Directly BESIDE the Baron.</p>

<p>        Two powerful, muscular MASTIFFS are tied to Baron Seagrove's chair.</p>
<p>        Teeth BARED. Eyes AELAZE. The hounds FIGHT for a scrap of meat.</p>

<p>        Indiana stares in BEWILDERMENT at the new surroundings. He STEPS OUT</p>
<p>        of the fountain. Baron Seagrove seems UNAWARE of Indy's presense.</p>
<p>        Indiana WALKS TOWARD the Baron.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Excuse me, sir...? Hello...?</p>

<p>        Baron Seagrove DOES NOT look up from his plate. Indy moves CLOSER. He</p>
<p>        speaks LOUDER.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Canyou hear me?...</p>

<p>        CLOSE-UP: BENEATH THE TABLE</p>

<p>        Baron seagrove's hand nonchalantly UNTIES the Mastiff's bindings.</p>

<p>        INDIANA</p>

<p>        still WALKS toward the table. The Baron continues to IGNORE him. Indy</p>
<p>        is ANNOYED.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Listen, pal... There are two dead</p>
<p>                        Policemen upstairs and...</p>

<p>        The Mastiffs LEAP forward. COMING at Indiana. He tries to GET AWAY.</p>
<p>        TOO SLOW. The hounds are UPON HIM. TEARING. CLAWING. BITING. They DRAG</p>
<p>        Indy to the floor.</p>

<p>        Baron Seagrove continues to ENJOY his dinner, seemingly OBLIVIOUS to</p>
<p>        the scene before him.</p>

<p>        Indiana FIGHTS for his life. The VICIOUS dogs tear at his clothing and</p>
<p>        skin. Indy SPOTS something. On the wall ABOVE. Hanging amidst a</p>
<p>        display of stuffed animal heads, is a HUNTER'S TRUMPET. Indy STRUGGLES</p>
<p>        to his knees. Trying to REACH for the horn. But the dogs are still</p>
<p>        BITING. CLAWING. WEAKENING Indiana.</p>

<p>        Indy's fingers are INCHES from the horn. The Mastiffs' sharp claws RIP</p>
<p>        at his arm. But Indy manages to SNATCH the trumpet. He quickly moves</p>
<p>        the horn to his LIPS. He BLOWS. HARD. A HIGH, PIERCING NOTE fills the</p>
<p>        air. The dogs respond to the SOUND. They HALT. STOPPING their attack.</p>
<p>        For a MOMENT.</p>

<p>        Tattered and bruised, Indiana LEAPS to his feet. He DROPS the horn. He</p>
<p>        RUNS.</p>

<p>        The Mastiffs come to their SENSES. They DART after Indy. Mouths</p>
<p>        FOAMING.</p>

<p>        Baron Seagrove continues to DINE, still IGNORING the action.</p>

<p>        Indy runs to a VELVET CURTAIN. He GRABS HOLD of a long, thick rope</p>
<p>        that is attached to the curtain. Indiana TEARS the curtain from the</p>
<p>        wall. A large STAINED GLASS WINDOW is behind the curtain.</p>

<p>        The FIRST MASTIFF leaps at Indy. Indiana quickly DRAPES the curtain</p>
<p>        OVER the hound. Indy ties a large KNOT in the open curtain end. The</p>
<p>        dog is TRAPPED.</p>

<p>        Indy TURNS. The SECOND MASTIFF is only a FEW FEET AWAY. BARRELLING</p>
<p>        toward Indy. Indiana HOPS to the window ledge. He OPENS the window.</p>
<p>        The Mastiff LEAPS UPWARD! Indiana JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW! The dog</p>
<p>        FOLLOWS Indy, also JUMPING OUT OF THE WINDOW!</p>

<p>        EXT. WINDOW</p>

<p>        The Mastiff FALLS. Flying hundreds of feet into the ROCKY WATERS</p>
<p>        BELOW. The hound's vicious howl FADES. CAMERA PANS from the water and</p>
<p>        STOPS ON INDIANA JONES! Indy has OUTSMARTED the Mastiff. Be HANGS onto</p>
<p>        the swinging WINDOW FRAME. SAFE. He LEAPS back inside the room.</p>

<p>        INT. BANQUET ROOM</p>

<p>        Baron Seagrove pours himself a glass of WINE. A very ANGRY Indiana</p>
<p>        walks toward the Baron.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Chow time's over, mister. You better</p>
<p>                        start talkin'.</p>

<p>        The Baron still IGNORES Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        There's a lot of strange things</p>
<p>                        happening around here...</p>

<p>        A SUIT OF ARMOR, located a few feet behind Indy, suddenly TWITCHES.</p>
<p>        Its arm LOWERS. Its head slowly TURNS.</p>

<p>        Indiana still walks TOWARD the Baron, who is only concerned with</p>
<p>        spreading butter on his bread. Indy SHOUTS.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        ...and I want some answers! Do you</p>
<p>                        hear me?</p>
<p>                                (louder)</p>
<p>                        I want some answers! Now!</p>

<p>        There is a LOUD CREAK OF METAL. A huge, sharp BATTLE AXE SHOOTS INTO</p>
<p>        FRAME! SWINGING toward Indy's head! Indiana SPINS. The axe is only</p>
<p>        INCHES from his face. Indy LEAPS BACK. WHOOSH! The axe SLICES through</p>
<p>        the air. JUST MISSING Indy. The shaken Indiana is SHOCKED to see</p>

<p>        A GLISTENING, BLACK SUIT OF ARMOR! The black knight is nearly SEVEN</p>
<p>        FEET TALL! It has COME TO LIFE and is walking TOWARD Indy. The black</p>
<p>        knight is WILDLY swinging the battle axe. Indiana continues to STEP</p>
<p>        BACK... BACK... Unbeknownst to Indy, his steps are leading him toward</p>

<p>        ANOTHER SUIT OF ARMOR! Also over seven feet tall, this armor is made</p>
<p>        of a SILVERY, WHITE METAL! As Indy moves CLOSER, the WHITE KNIGHT</p>
<p>        OPENS ITS ARMS! When Indy is within reach, the white knight LOCKS its</p>
<p>        powerful arms around Indy's chest! Indiana TRIES to break free. NO</p>
<p>        GOOD. The white knight's grip is TOO TIGHT. Indy is TRAPPED!</p>

<p>        The black knight still COMES TOWARD Indiana. Its frenzied axe SWINGS</p>
<p>        back and forth. Indy still STRUGGLES with the white knight's bone</p>
<p>        crunching grip.</p>

<p>        The black knight is only a FEW FEET from Indy. Its deadly axe blade</p>
<p>        INCHES from Indy's face. Indiana MOVES FAST. He JERKS his body</p>
<p>        forward. This FLIPS the white knight off its feet! OVER Indy's head.</p>
<p>        The white knight FLIES INTO the black knight. CRASH! This sends both</p>
<p>        knights FALLING to the floor.</p>

<p>        Indiana SHOOTS to his feet. The two knights LEAP to their feet. They</p>
<p>        CHASE Indy. The black knight armed with his AXE, the white knight</p>
<p>        armed with a long, sharp SWORD!</p>

<p>        Baron Seagrove SPOONS another helping of boiled potatoes onto his</p>
<p>        plate.</p>

<p>        Indy snatches a SHIELD and SWORD from a nearby wall display. Ready to</p>
<p>        FIGHT. The knights are UPON HIM. Indiana battles BOTH knights. He</p>
<p>        DEFENDS the bludgeoning battle axe with his shield, and SWORDFIGHTS</p>
<p>        the other knight! THRASH! CLANG! The sound of HEAVY METAL fills the</p>
<p>        room!</p>

<p>        Indy's sword STRIKES the white knight's thick chest. The sword SNAPS</p>
<p>        IN TWO. In the confusion, Indy's shield is KNOCKED from his hand by</p>
<p>        the powerful battle axe. Indy is DEFENSLESS.</p>

<p>        The two metal giants RAISE their weapons. HIGH. AIMING for Indy's</p>
<p>        head. The two knights SWING! Indy DIVES to the floor! The knights</p>
<p>        CAN'T STOP their weapons in time... CRUNCH! They deliver a HARD BLOW</p>
<p>        to each other! The woozy knights WOBBLE and SPIN. In a momentary DAZE.</p>
<p>        Indiana JUMPS to his feet.</p>

<p>        The BLACK KNIGHT hisses. FURIOUS. He DASHES after Indiana. The WHITE</p>
<p>        KNIGHT is still REELING from the blow.</p>

<p>        Seeing the black knight in HOT PURSUIT, Indy searches for a WEAPON. He</p>
<p>        spots the curtain's long, thick ROPE. LYING on the floor.</p>

<p>        The black knight is nearly UPON Indy. AXE RAISED! Indiana GRABS the</p>
<p>        rope. He SPINS. FACING the knight. Indy SNAPS HIS WRIST! A LOUD CRACK!</p>
<p>        The rope SHOOTS FORWARD! Not unlike Indiana's familiar WHIP!</p>

<p>        The rope WRAPS itself around the black knight's neck. Indy JERKS the</p>
<p>        whip forward. HARD. This sends the knight FLYING THROUGH THE AIR! The</p>
<p>        knight crashes into the stone FOONTAIN! Several of the fountain's</p>
<p>        sculptures SHATTER into pieces. The dazed, dented black knight</p>
<p>        ATTEMPTS to stand...but LOSES his footing. The knight FALLS backward.</p>
<p>        Into the fountain's WIDE DRAIN OPENING! Its HEAVY ARMOR causes the</p>
<p>        knight to SINK. DISAPPEARING into the hole. Into the POOL OF WATER.</p>

<p>        Indy CATCHES HIS BREATH. The white knight's SWORD SWINGS INTO FRAME!</p>
<p>        SLICING through Indiana's jacket! Indy JUMPS BACK. The vicious white</p>
<p>        knight COMES toward him.</p>

<p>        Indiana TURNS to run. Finding himself at the BANQUET TABLE. Face to</p>
<p>        face with the ROASTED PIG. A few feet away, Baron Seagrove CONTINUES</p>
<p>        to dine. The white knight raises his sword ABOVE Indy. WHOOSH! The</p>
<p>        sword begins to swing DOWN! Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the deadly blows.</p>
<p>        Instead of carving Indiana, the knight's sword manages to SLICE</p>
<p>        perfect sections of the roasted pig. The satisfied Baron HELPS HIMSELF</p>
<p>        to a freshly carved slice of pork.</p>

<p>        Indiana LEAPS onto the table top. Trying to ESCAPE the living suit of</p>
<p>        armor. But the white knight CLIMBS up onto the table. FOLLOWING Indy.</p>

<p>        The sword slashing knight PURSUES Indy along the table top. Indy</p>
<p>        GLANCES upward. To the heavy CHANDELIER. Indy SMILES. A PLAN. He</p>
<p>        continues to STEP BACKWARD. Leading the knight DIRECTLY BELOW the</p>
<p>        chandelier.</p>

<p>        At the precise moment, Indy picks up a STERLING SILVER PLATE from the</p>
<p>        table top. Indy WHISKS the plate in the air. Toward the ROPE that</p>
<p>        holds the chandelier. The spinning plate SEVERS the rope. The</p>
<p>        chandelier FLIES DOWNWARDl! CRASHING ON TOP of the white knight! The</p>
<p>        knight lies BENEATH the chandelier. MOTIONLESS. The sword DROPS from</p>
<p>        its lifeless hand. Onto the TABLE TOP.</p>

<p>        Indy takes the knight's SWORD. Eyes on FIRE, sword OUTSTRETCHED,</p>
<p>        Indiana WALKS across the table top. HEADED for Baron Seagrove.</p>

<p>        The Baron prepares to take ANOTHER BITE of his food. THE SWORD SHOOTS</p>
<p>        INTO FRAME! The tip of the blade RESTS upon Baron Seagrove's rubbery</p>
<p>        throat. Indiana SNARLS.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Haven't you had enough?</p>

<p>        Baron Seagrove finally LOOKS at Indiana. The Baron LOWERS his fork.</p>
<p>        His face twists into an EERIE GRIN. He begins LAUGHING. It's the SAME</p>
<p>        MANIACAL LAUGH we heard earlier. Indy responds by BLOWING OUT the</p>
<p>        flame of the mysterious candle.</p>

<p>        The room's door BURSTS OPEN! INSPECTOR MACGOWAN and GALBRAITH dash</p>
<p>        inside. They HURRY to Baron Seagrove. Their PISTOLS aimed at him.</p>
<p>        Galbraith HANDCUFFS the Baron. MacGowan looks at the BRUISED, BLOODIED</p>
<p>        and TATTERED Indiana Jones.</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                        Now you can get back to your</p>
<p>                        fishing, Doctor Jones.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        No chance, Mac. My plane leaves in</p>
<p>                        the morning. Vacation's over. Gotta'</p>
<p>                        get back to school.</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                                (shakes his head)</p>
<p>                        'Tis a shame to go home empty</p>
<p>                        handed...</p>
<p>                                (smiles, an idea)</p>
<p>                        Tell ya' what, my friend... I fancy</p>
<p>                        me'self quite the fisherman...</p>
<p>                        Tomorrow, I'll go out and catch you</p>
<p>                        a real beauty, eh?...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (sarcastic smirk)</p>
<p>                        Right. Send it to me airmail.</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                                (incredulous)</p>
<p>                        Doctor Jones! A MacGowan's word is</p>
<p>                        truer than...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Yeah, yeah...an angel's kiss. I</p>
<p>                        know.</p>

<p>        They EXIT the room.</p>

<p>        EXT. CASTLE</p>

<p>        The villagers SURROUND the castle. Their BRIGHT TORCHES are raised</p>
<p>        high in the air. Baron Seagrove is LED out of the castle by Indiana</p>
<p>        and the Police. The crowd begins to WHISPER. ANXIOUS. EXCITED. As the</p>
<p>        Baron is led to the POLICE VEHICLE, he turns and LOOKS at Indy. The</p>
<p>        Baron speaks in a TREMBLING, RASPY voice. His eyes are WILD.</p>

<p>                                        BARON SEAGROVE</p>
<p>                        No...jail...can...hold...me.</p>

<p>        A CHILL rushes through Indiana. The Baron turns, CONTINUING to the</p>
<p>        Police wagon. One of the villagers SHOUTS.</p>

<p>                                        VILLAGER</p>
<p>                        'E's done it! Indiana Jones has</p>
<p>                        captured the killer!</p>

<p>        The crowd CHEERS. Indiana gives a HUMBLE NOD and WAVE. MacGowan SHAKES</p>
<p>        Indy's hand. Indy glances to the POLICE VEHICLE.</p>

<p>        INDY'S POV</p>

<p>        Baron Seagrove CLIMBS into the back compartment of the police vehicle.</p>
<p>        Galbraith CLOSES the vehicle doors. The Baron is still VISIBLE through</p>
<p>        the vehicle's windows. He LIGHTS a cigarette. It appears that the</p>
<p>        MATCH FLAME SHINES THROUGH THE BARON'S BODY! It's as if he were a</p>
<p>        GHOST!</p>

<p>        Indiana TURNS to the others. Eyes WIDE. SHOCKED. But it is obvious</p>
<p>        that NO ONE else has SEEN the apparition. MacGowan notices the PALE</p>
<p>        expression on Indy's face.</p>

<p>                                        MACGOWAN</p>
<p>                        What is it, man? You look as if</p>
<p>                        you've seen a screamin' banshee!</p>

<p>        Indy POINTS back to the police vehicle. But it has already DEPARTED.</p>
<p>        It drives over a far hill, DISAPPEARING INTO THE NIGHT. Indy SIGHS,</p>
<p>        turning back to MacGowan.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Ah... It was nothing, Mac. Nothing</p>
<p>                        at all.</p>

<p>        CAMERA DOLLIES INTO INDIANA'S TROUBLED, UNCERTAIN FACE. THE BARON'S</p>
<p>        LAUGH FILLS THE SOUND TRACK.</p>

<p>                                                                        SLOW DISSOLVE:</p>

<p>        EXT. MARSHALL UNIVERSITY - A FEW DAYS LATER</p>

<p>        Early AFTERNOON. A RAINY Spring day. Students RUN to the University</p>
<p>        doors, protecting themselves with textbooks.</p>

<p>        INT. INDIANA JONES' OFFICE</p>

<p>        Rain SPLATTERS the window of this cramped, CLUTTERED room. Crooked</p>
<p>        stacks of dog eared TEXTBOOKS and PAPERS nearly reach the ceiling. The</p>
<p>        spindly bookshelves are stuffed with various ARCHEOLOGICAL RELICS and</p>
<p>        INSTRUMENTS: animal and bird skeletons, fossils, primitive statues,</p>
<p>        etc. Sitting at a small wooden desk, amidst a mountain of TERM PAPERS,</p>
<p>        is INDIANA JONES. Indy is WEARING a brown three piece suit and</p>
<p>        circular, wire rimmed glasses. In one hand, he holds a STUDENT SEAT</p>
<p>        ASSIGNMENT CARD, as he hurriedly READS through the term papers. He</p>
<p>        furiously GRADES each paper.</p>

<p>        To make matters worse; the office is CROWDED WITH STUDENTS, with</p>
<p>        countless others POURING out into the hallway. All of the students are</p>
<p>        ANXIOUS to get inside. They are BADGERING, COMPLAINING and MOANING at</p>
<p>        Indy.</p>

<p>                                        TEDDY</p>
<p>                        Doctor Jones... I took your class</p>
<p>                        instead of all the others!... I</p>

<p>                        You promised. You said you'd have</p>
<p>                        'em graded by yesterday.</p>

<p>                        me here. You know how much they</p>
<p>                        shelled out for your class?</p>

<p>                        He doesn't care about us. He only</p>
<p>                        wants fame and fortune. We're just a</p>
<p>                        buncha' peons to him.</p>

<p>        Indiana continues to grade the papers, trying to IGNORE the verbal</p>
<p>        assault. BETSY TUFFET pushes her way to the front. Betsy is Indy's</p>
<p>        STUDENT ASSISTANT. She is 21 YEARS OLD, with thick, luxurious black</p>
<p>        hair, bright brown eyes and a small framed, athletic body. Betsy is a</p>
<p>        TOUGH. BRASH. A BROOKLYN kid. She moves CLOSE to Indy, her hair</p>
<p>        brushing his cheek. Indiana is very TENSE, continuously working on the</p>
<p>        term papers.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>

<p>                        Doctor Jones!</p>

<p>        She EXITS. Indy SIGHS. Again, the obnoxious student SHOUTS.</p>

<p>                                        VIRGIL</p>
<p>                        Didja' get the name? VIRGIL! Capital</p>

<p>        PROFESSOR THAD PRIESTLY enters, pushing Virgil aside. Priestly is a</p>
<p>        young, wisecracking, greasy haired AQUAINTANCE of Indy's. He SHOVES a</p>
<p>        photograph BENEATH Indy's nose.</p>

<p>                                        PRIESTLY</p>
<p>                        Moby Dick.</p>

<p>                        Huh?...</p>

<p>                                        PRIESTLY</p>
<p>                                (points to photo)</p>

<p>                        saw.</p>

<p>        Indiana GLANCES to the photo. It is a picture of Prof. Priestly</p>
<p>        dressed in fisherman's outfit, standing on a pier, holding a GIANT</p>
<p>        FISH. Indy STEAMS. Priestly gives him a MANLY SLAP to the back.</p>

<p>                                        PRIESTLY</p>
<p>                        What about you, Jonesey? You were</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Look, Priestly... I'm real busy...</p>

<p>        Indy is suddenly INTERRUPTED by a HARD SLAP to his face. He LOOKS UP.</p>
<p>        A beautiful, blonde student, REBECCA, stands over his desk. She</p>
<p>        SCREAMS. FURIOUS.</p>

<p>                                        REBECCA</p>
<p>                        Two-timing bastard!</p>

<p>        Indiana RUBS his jaw. STARTLED. Rebecca CONTINUES.</p>

<p>                                        REBECCA</p>
<p>                        How could you?!?... My own</p>
<p>                        Mother?!?... In my own bed?!?...</p>
<p>                                (slaps him again)</p>
<p>                        I've had it with you! It's over!</p>

<p>        Priestly HIDES his chuckle. Rebecca THROWS a shirt that obviously</p>
<p>        belongs to Indiana on the desk and STORMS out of the room. Indy shakes</p>
<p>        his head and CONTINUES working. The students are still HARASSING him.</p>
<p>        A LOUD VOICE ECHOES through the room.</p>

<p>                                        POSTMAN (O.S.)</p>
<p>                        Special Delivery! Dr. Indiana Jones!</p>

<p>        A burly POSTMAN stands in the doorway, holding a thick, enormous BROWN</p>
<p>        ENVELOPE. Indy MOTIONS to the postman. The Postman tries to MAKE his</p>
<p>        way through the crowd. Indiana goes back to his grading, but is</p>
<p>        suddenly INTERRUPTED BY A LOUD TAPPING NOISE. He LOOKS UP. DEAN CLAUDE</p>
<p>        COVENTRY, a stately, elderly gentleman, RAPS a steel ruler on</p>
<p>        Indiana's desk. The Dean is UPSET. Very SERIOUS.</p>

<p>                                        DEAN COVENTRY</p>
<p>                        Doctor Jones, I've had complaints</p>
<p>                        from several of the students --</p>

<p>        The Postman INTERRUPTS, dropping the heavy envelope onto Indy's desk.</p>
<p>        The Postman SHOVES a yellow paper in front of Indy.</p>

<p>                                        POSTMAN</p>
<p>                        Sign here.</p>

<p>        Indy SIGNS. Dean Coventry continues LECTURING.</p>

<p>                                        DEAN COVENTRY</p>
<p>                        They feel that you are ignoring</p>
<p>                        them, that you are distracted...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (gives Postman the</p>
<p>                                signed paper)</p>
<p>                        Me?... Distracted?...</p>

<p>                                        POSTMAN</p>
<p>                                (staring at Indy's</p>
<p>                                signature, puzzled)</p>
<p>                        What's this? "B+"? That's how you</p>
<p>                        sign your name?</p>

<p>        Indy GRABS the paper. He's signed a "B+" on the LINE where his name is</p>
<p>        supposed to appear. Indy CROSSES out the grade and signs his name.</p>
<p>        Professor Coventry still LECTURES Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        DEAN COVENTRY</p>
<p>                        Marshall University is not the place</p>
<p>                        for sloppy behavior...</p>

<p>        At that moment, Indy OPENS the envelope! A LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER POURS</p>
<p>        OUT! SATURATING the papers on the desk! This is followed by an</p>
<p>        ENORMOUS DEAD TROUT! It FLOPS onto Indy's desk. The students exchange</p>
<p>        STARTLED and NAUSEOUS glances. Indiana removes a water logged NOTE</p>
<p>        from the envelope. It reads, "A MACGOWAN'S WORD IS TRUER THAN AN</p>
<p>        ANGEL'S KISS". Indiana uses a TISSUE to WIPE some of the water from</p>
<p>        his desk. Dean Coventry SHAKES A FINGER at Indy.</p>

<p>                                        DEAN COVENTRY</p>
<p>                        I have one final warning for you,</p>
<p>                        Doctor Jones --</p>

<p>        THE PHONE RINGS! INTERRUPTING the Dean! Indiana quickly ANSWERS the</p>
<p>        phone. A FUMING Dean Coventry impatiently waits to finish his threat.</p>
<p>        Indiana SPEAKS into the receiver.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Yes... Oh, Hello, Marcus... Look,</p>
<p>                        can you hold on?...</p>
<p>                                (back to Dean)</p>
<p>                        You were saying, sir?</p>

<p>                                        DEAN COVENTRY</p>
<p>                        Either you begin concentrating on</p>
<p>                        your --</p>

<p>                                (interrupted by phone)</p>
<p>                        Yes, Marcus... I'm still here...</p>
<p>                        Just hold on!</p>
<p>                                (back to Dean)</p>
<p>                        I'm very sorry, sir...</p>

<p>                                        DEAN COVENTRY</p>
<p>                                (boiling)</p>
<p>                        -- concentrating on your teaching</p>
<p>                        duties or --</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (into phone)</p>
<p>                        Damn it, Marcus! I'm standing here</p>
<p>                        with Dean... What?.. Just how</p>
<p>                        important?...</p>
<p>                                (listening, impatient)</p>
<p>                        It is, huh?... Okay. Five minutes.</p>
<p>                        Yeah. I'll be right over. But this</p>
<p>                        better be important, Marcus!</p>

<p>        Indiana HANGS UP. He gives an EMBARASSED look to the furious, red</p>
<p>        faced Dean.</p>

<p>                                        DEAN COVENTRY</p>
<p>                        You are on probation, Jones! Ten</p>
<p>                        days! If there is no improvement,</p>
<p>                        you will be dismissed!</p>

<p>        The Dean STORMS OUT of the room. Indiana GATHERS the wet papers. He</p>
<p>        begins to EXIT the room, EXPLAINING to the students as he makes his</p>
<p>        way through the crowd.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        I promise...by tomorrow...I'll have</p>
<p>                        all of these graded...and DRIED!</p>

<p>        Indiana continues making APOLOGIES and EXCUSES. The obnoxious student</p>
<p>        again SHOUTS at him.</p>

<p>                                        VIRGIL</p>
<p>                        VIRGIL VEKTOR! Capital V... I...</p>
<p>                        R...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (hands him paper)</p>
<p>                        "F"!</p>

<p>        Virgil STARES at his paper, adorned with a large RED "F"! Indiana</p>
<p>        EXITS the room.</p>

<p>        INT. HISTORY MUSEUM - PREHISTORIC ROOM</p>

<p>        The large room is filled with skeletons, fossils and statues dating</p>
<p>        back to the DAWN OF MAN. Indiana, his arms cluttered with the soaking</p>
<p>        term papers, hurriedly enters the museum with MARCUS BRODY. Marcus is</p>
<p>        very ANXIOUS. EXCITED. He carries a l6MM METAL FILM CANNISTER beneath</p>
<p>        his arm. Indiana is very IMPATIENT. His eyes dart to a full sized</p>
<p>        skeleton of a TYRONOSAURUS REX.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        This better be important, Marcus...</p>
<p>                        or the museum will soon be</p>
<p>                        displaying my bones. My teaching</p>
<p>                        career is in danger of extinction.</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                                (smiles)</p>
<p>                        You will not be disappointed,</p>
<p>                        Indiana.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        CLOSE-UP: AN ANCIENT PAINTING. The watercolor features an upright,</p>
<p>        wrinkled face SUN WU KUNG, the STONE MONKEY KING. But the monkey is</p>
<p>        NOT made of stone. He appears to be HALF HUMAN... HALF MONKEY. His</p>
<p>        face is WISE. His coal black eyes are PENETRATING. He wears a LION</p>
<p>        SKIN ROBE, and holds a tall, GOLDEN HOOPED STAFF. Sun Wu Kung stands</p>
<p>        amidst a garden of luscious, ripe PEACE TREES. He is surrounded by a</p>
<p>        HEAVENLY GLOW, a bright ray of light that emanates from an opening in</p>
<p>        the CLOUDS.</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS (O.S.)</p>
<p>                        ...Look familiar?</p>

<p>        CAMERA PULLS BACK. We are inside of the museum BOARD ROOM. Marcus</p>
<p>        holds the tattered painting before Indiana, who sits at a desk, still</p>
<p>        feverishly GRADING the wet term papers. After he finishes each paper,</p>
<p>        Indy PINS it to a nearby bulletin board for drying. He GLANCES to the</p>
<p>        painting of Sun Wu Kung.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        "Sun wu Kung, The Stone Monkey</p>
<p>                        King". Big deal. That was ten years</p>
<p>                        ago, Marcus.</p>
<p>                                (going back to papers,</p>
<p>                                wanting to change</p>
<p>                                subject)</p>
<p>                        Geez! This Heller kid's got the</p>
<p>                        worst grammar.</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                        Ten years or fifty years. It will</p>
<p>                        always be in your blood.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (ignoring Marcus)</p>
<p>                        Don't believe this... He spells</p>
<p>                        "repeat" with two "E's".</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                        Think back, Indiana. Remember your</p>
<p>                        desire? Your passion?</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (still ignores Marcus)</p>
<p>                        Kid gets an "A" on content...a "D"</p>
<p>                        on form.</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                                (angry, slams his fist</p>
<p>                                on the desk)</p>
<p>                        Damn it, man! You can't bury those</p>
<p>                        feelings forever!</p>

<p>        Indiana finally LOOKS UP from the papers. He glances at Marcus, then</p>
<p>        LOOKS at the painting. CAMERA DOLLIES INTO Indiana's face. He becomes</p>
<p>        very SERIOUS. SOMBER. His eyes are EMPTY. Memories of FAILURE fill his</p>
<p>        head.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Two years. Nearly two years of my</p>
<p>                        life...looking for the remains of</p>
<p>                        that Monkey...a piece of his</p>
<p>                        legendary Golden Hooped Rod...or</p>
<p>                        some sign of the Lost City.</p>

<p>                        Rest of us nearly died from</p>
<p>                        starvation or one of the many</p>
<p>                        horrible deseases we discovered...</p>

<p>                                in a near whisper)</p>
<p>                        We still came back empty handed.</p>

<p>                        thirteen months in China!...another</p>

<p>                        There was no proof...archeological</p>
<p>                        or anthropological...to indicate</p>
<p>                        that Sun Wu-Kung ever visited</p>
<p>                        Africa...</p>

<p>                        Until now.</p>

<p>        Marcus TURNS OFF the room lights.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Hey... My papers...</p>

<p>        Marcus STARTS the projector. A BLACK AND WHITE image flickers on the</p>
<p>        far wall. We see a PYGMY, standing in what appears to be a grassy</p>
<p>        area. The pygmy's name is TYKI. He is ADORABLE. A little Over FOUR</p>
<p>        FEET TALL, his body is TAUT, MUSCULAR. His long black hair is SHAGGY,</p>
<p>        his eyes are WIDE and BRIGHT. Almost CHILDLIKE. His face is CUTE.</p>
<p>        IMPISH. Covered with a very INQUISITIVE expression. Tyki's energy is</p>
<p>        BOUNDLESS. He cannot stop MOVING. Standing BESIDE Tyki, is</p>

<p>        DR. CLARE CLARKE. 32 years old. A tall, strikingly BEAUTIFUL woman.</p>
<p>        She is COMMUNICATING with Tyki in sign language.</p>

<p>                        The woman is Dr. Clare Clarke. The</p>
<p>                        famous zoologist. She works in</p>
<p>                        Africa, studying animals in their</p>

<p>                        Very interesting, Marcus. Now if</p>
<p>                        you'll turn the lights back on --</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                                (continuing)</p>
<p>                        Three weeks ago, Dr. Clarke</p>
<p>                        discovered that cute little</p>
<p>                        fellow... "Tyki"...a pygmy of an</p>
<p>                        unusual race...unrelated to any</p>
<p>                        known African tribe...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (bored)</p>
<p>                        Marcus. The lights.</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                        Dr. Clarke believes that Tyki comes</p>
<p>                        from the Lost Civilization of Sun</p>
<p>                        Wu-Kung.</p>

<p>        Indiana PAUSES. He STANDS, walking closer to the flickering image.</p>
<p>        Suddenly INTERESTED.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        What?... But how did Miss --</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                        "Doctor".</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        "Doctor" Clake. How did she arrive</p>
<p>                        at such a preposterous hypothesis?</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                        The pygmy speaks in a language that</p>
<p>                        has no African origins...but bears a</p>
<p>                        strong resemblance to Chinese.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Means nothing. The rivers of Africa</p>
<p>                        have been plagued by various</p>
<p>                        Oriental Pirates and Scavengers</p>
<p>                        since the 16th Century.</p>
<p>                                (turns from screen)</p>
<p>                        Not much evidence, Marcus.</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                        There's more. The pygmy was found</p>
<p>                        wearing an ornamental peach stone</p>
<p>                        around his neck...believed to come</p>
<p>                        from Sun Wu-Kung's legendary Garden</p>
<p>                        Of Immortal Peaches.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (skeptical)</p>
<p>                        Marcus, there are countless</p>
<p>                        undiscovered African tribes...all</p>
<p>                        with various obscure beliefs and</p>
<p>                        practices...</p>
<p>                                (smirks)</p>
<p>                        One tribe may wear peach stones...</p>
<p>                        another may wear banana peels...</p>

<p>        Indiana WALKS back to his papers. Marcus PAUSES.</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                        There is one final bit of</p>
<p>                        evidence...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Enlighten me.</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                        The pygmy is over 200 years old.</p>

<p>        Indiana ADJUSTS his spectacles. He STARES at the black and white</p>
<p>        image. The cute pygmy appears to be in his MID-TWENTIES. He walks to</p>
<p>        the CAMERA, STARING into the lens. Tyki examines the camera with</p>
<p>        CURIOSITY.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        That's impossible.</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                        Dr. Clarke has done a considerable</p>
<p>                        amount of testing on the pygmy's</p>
<p>                        clothing...his sandals...everything</p>
<p>                        was over 200 years old.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (skeptical)</p>
<p>                        He's probably wearing his Great</p>
<p>                        Grandfather's stuff.</p>

<p>        CAMERA PANS BACK to the projected image. Tyki begins to UNSCREW the</p>
<p>        camera lens. The picture goes OUT OF FOCUS. The film RUNS OUT. Marcus</p>
<p>        TURNS OFF the projector and flips ON the overhead room lights. Indiana</p>
<p>        gives Marcus a PUZZLED look.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        What does all of this have to do</p>
<p>                        with me?</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                        Dr. Clarke wants to mount an</p>
<p>                        expedition to find the Lost City of</p>
<p>                        Sun Wu-Kung. She is quite familiar</p>
<p>                        with your reputation...she'd like</p>
<p>                        you to come along.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (gathering his papers)</p>
<p>                        No chance.</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                        There will be money involved... The</p>
<p>                        museum is willing to fund the</p>
<p>                        expedition...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Sorry, Marcus. I've burned this</p>
<p>                        bridge.</p>

<p>        Indiana TURNS and begins to WALK out of the room. Marcus CALLS him.</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                        Indiana...</p>

<p>        Indy TURNS. He WAVES the papers at Marcus.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Marcus. Please. I've got to finish</p>
<p>                        these...</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                        You've got to finish something much</p>
<p>                        more important. You crossed the</p>
<p>                        threshold over a decade ago...and</p>
<p>                        it's been tearing at your insides</p>
<p>                        ever since.</p>
<p>                                (passionate)</p>
<p>                        My friend, if there is even one iota</p>
<p>                        of truth in Dr. Clarke's findings...</p>
<p>                        then you can lift the veil of</p>
<p>                        mystery that has surrounded this</p>
<p>                        Chinese legend for Centuries. You</p>
<p>                        may uncover the secrets to a Lost</p>
<p>                        Civilization...and possibly, to</p>
<p>                        man's never ending search for</p>
<p>                        immortality.</p>

<p>        Indiana STARES at the painting of Sun Wu Kung.</p>

<p>                                        MARCUS</p>
<p>                        Indiana... Can you afford to pass up</p>
<p>                        the single most important adventure</p>
<p>                        of your life?</p>

<p>        Indiana has NO ANSWER for Marcus. Indy PICKS up the painting. A</p>
<p>        THRILLING expression slowly covers Indiana's face. His eyes GLIMMER.</p>
<p>        Filled with a long, lost EXCITEMENT. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS!</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        CLOSE UP: THE STACK OF TERM PAPERS</p>

<p>        The papers are slightly CRUMPLED. Still WET. A DROP OF WATER hits the</p>
<p>        papers. CAMERA PANS UPWARD. BETSY TUFFET, Indy's student assistant,</p>
<p>        sits at the desk, grading the papers. She is CRYING. Her falling TEARS</p>
<p>        soak the papers. We are INSIDE of Indiana's apartment. LATER that</p>
<p>        evening.</p>

<p>        INDIANA stands in the background. He is hurriedly PACKING his bags.</p>
<p>        His familiar GUN, HAT and WHIP lie on the bed, beside the suitcase.</p>
<p>        Indy NOTICES that Betsy is crying. He WALKS to Betsy. Indy puts his</p>
<p>        arm on Betsy's shoulder, attempting to COMFORT her. Betsy SNAPS at</p>
<p>        Indy.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        You can't do this to me!</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (shaking tears off the</p>
<p>                                papers)</p>
<p>                        C'mon, Betsy. Relax. You're gettin'</p>
<p>                        'em all wet again.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        You just can't go away...I mean...</p>
<p>                        Africa is so far away, and...well...</p>
<p>                                (heartfelt)</p>
<p>                        I love you, Indy.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Thought we agreed this was s'posed</p>
<p>                        to be casual...</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        You call what happened last night</p>
<p>                        "casual".</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        My dear...a momentary lapse into</p>
<p>                        passion does not a love affair make.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                                (very upset)</p>
<p>                        Momentary lapse! So that's all I am</p>
<p>                        to you!</p>

<p>        Betsy SHOOTS to her feet, walking OFF SCREEN.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Betsy... Wait...</p>

<p>        Indiana SIGHS. His eye CATCHES one of the termpapers. He begins to</p>
<p>        READ, making a few CORRECTIONS.</p>

<p>        We see Betsy's HAND removes Indiana's WHIP from the bed.</p>

<p>        Indiana continues to CORRECT the papers. Suddenly, there is a CREAKING</p>
<p>        NOISE. Indy TURNS. His face goes WHITE. He runs OFF SCREEN.</p>

<p>        One end of Indiana's WHIP is attached to an OVERHEAD LAMP. CAMERA PANS</p>
<p>        DOWN the whip. The other end has been formed into a NOOSE around</p>
<p>        Betsy's neck. Sbe stands on a wooden CHAIR. She KICKS AWAY the chair.</p>
<p>        Suddenly GAGGING. Indiana GRABS Betsy in midair. He TAKES the noose</p>
<p>        from her neck and PLACES Betsy on the floor.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (angry)</p>
<p>                        Whatsa' matter with you!... Tryin'</p>
<p>                        to ruin my whip!...</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        If I can't have you... I don't want</p>
<p>                        to live.</p>

<p>        Indiana TOSSES the whip into his suitcase. He pulls up the chair and</p>
<p>        forces Betsy to be SEATED. He pours her a tall glass of BOURBON.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Drink this. You'll feel better.</p>

<p>        Indiana WALKS to his suitcase, continuing to pack. His BACK is to</p>
<p>        Betsy. She raises the GLASS to her lips. She PAUSES, reading a MESSAGE</p>
<p>        on the Bourbon bottle. It reads: DANGER! CONTENTS FLAMMABLE! Betsy</p>
<p>        BEAMS. An IDEA. She LIFTS the bottle over her head and begins to DOUSE</p>
<p>        her body with the liquid.</p>

<p>        Indiana is BUSY folding his clothing. Suddenly, we hear the FLICK OF A</p>
<p>        MATCHSTICK! Indy TURNS. He sees the bourbon covered Betsy preparing to</p>
<p>        LIGHT HER BODY ON FIRE! Indy DASHES forward. He BLOWS OUT the match,</p>
<p>        moments before it SPARKS Betsy's clothing. Indy SHAKES Betsy by the</p>
<p>        shoulders.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        C'mon, Betsy... Get a hold of</p>
<p>                        yourself. You're young. There are a</p>
<p>                        lot of other guys...</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Not like you.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (succumbing to his ego)</p>
<p>                        That's true...</p>
<p>                                (realizing his mistake)</p>
<p>                        But that's no reason to stop living!</p>
<p>                        Besides, I'm too old for you. By the</p>
<p>                        time you're seventy five, I'll be...</p>
<p>                                (calculates, the thought</p>
<p>                                of it makes him grimace)</p>
<p>                        Yeccchhh! I'll be disgusting.</p>

<p>        Indiana TURNS and finishes his packing. Betsy SIGHS. She notices an</p>
<p>        enormous, STONE AFRICAN URN. The 150 POUND antique sits atop a section</p>
<p>        of BOOKSHELVES.</p>

<p>        Meanwhile, Indiana makes certain that his gun is PACKED. He places the</p>
<p>        familiar HAT on his head and begins to CLOSE the suitcase.</p>

<p>        CLOSE UP: THE AFRICAN URN. It is WOBBLING. SHAKING. Moving CLOSER and</p>
<p>        CLOSER to the edge of the bookshelves. CAMERA PANS TO THE FLOOR. Betsy</p>
<p>        LIES here. Directly BELOW the trembling urn. Betsy SHAKES the</p>
<p>        bookshelves, causing the urn to TILT and SHIVER. The urn is nearly</p>
<p>        HALFWAY OFF of the edge. If it falls...the urn will CRUSH Betsy's</p>
<p>        head.</p>

<p>        Indiana STRUGGLES with closing his tightly packed suitcase.</p>

<p>        The urn FALLS! HEADED STRAIGHT for Betsy! Indiana SUDDENLY GRABS the</p>
<p>        urn. In MIDAIR. Inches before it STRIKES Betsy. Indiana RESTS the urn</p>
<p>        on the floor. He HELPS Betsy to her feet. Betsy WRAPS her arms tightly</p>
<p>        around Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Don't leave me, Indy!</p>

<p>        Indiana PICKS UP his suitcase and tries to WALK to the door. But</p>
<p>        Betsy's arms are still TIGHTLY WRAPPED around him. Finally, Indy</p>
<p>        STOPS. His eyes BURN through Betsy.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (cruel)</p>
<p>                        Look... You're just a flighty kid.</p>
<p>                        Twenty minutes after I walk out this</p>
<p>                        door, you'll have a date with the</p>
<p>                        college Romeo. Two hours from now,</p>
<p>                        you'll be madly in love with him. By</p>
<p>                        tomorrow, you'll forget I ever</p>
<p>                        existed.</p>

<p>        Hurt, Betsy REMOVES her arms from Indiana. He gives her a QUICK KISS</p>
<p>        to the cheek and hurriedly EXITS. Betsy GLARES at the closed door. A</p>
<p>        TOUGH, ANGRY expression covers her face.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Never underestimate the</p>
<p>                        determination of a Brooklyn girl,</p>
<p>                        Doctor Jones. Never.</p>

<p>                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:</p>

<p>        LONG SHOT - AN OCEAN LINER</p>

<p>        The SILHOUETTE of the ship sails across the water. A beautiful ORANGE</p>
<p>        SKY fills the background.</p>

<p>        INDIANA JONES</p>

<p>        stands aboard the ship's DECK. It is a typical, 30's LUXURY Ocean</p>
<p>        liner, filled with vacationing TOURISTS. Indiana STARES into the</p>
<p>        sunrise. His face is a study in CONCENTRATION and INTENSITY. He</p>
<p>        anxiously AWAITS his adventure.</p>

<p>                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:</p>

<p>        MAP OF THE WORLD</p>

<p>        A MOVING RED LINE traces Indiana's journey across the ocean, toward</p>
<p>        AFRICA. The red line comes to a stop at MOZAMBIQUE.</p>

<p>        EXT. CENTRAL MOZAMBIQUE - BEIRA - A HOT, SUNNY AFTERNOON</p>

<p>        Chief PORT on the coast. Gateway to the ZAMBESI RIVER. SUPPLY SHIPS,</p>
<p>        SAILBOATS and RAFTS line the marina. The docks are crowded with</p>
<p>        various MERCHANTS and SAILORS, unloading their goods. Small SHOPS and</p>
<p>        RESTAURANTS clutter the waterfront. Behind them are rows of one story,</p>
<p>        low square HOMES. Tall, healthy PALM TREES surround the Area.</p>

<p>        An OCEAN LINER has anchored along the shore. Several PASSENGERS exit</p>
<p>        from the ship. INDIANA steps onto the ocean liner's exit ramp. He is</p>
<p>        UNSHAVEN, wearing his traditional LEATHER JACKET and HAT. Indy LOOKS</p>
<p>        AROUND, expecting to MEET someone.</p>

<p>        INDY'S POV - THE DOCK</p>

<p>        There is a a LOUD CAR HORN. Crowds of pedestrians LEAP out of the way.</p>
<p>        A rusted, yellow MODEL-T barrels along the rickety dock. The word</p>
<p>        "TAXI" is crudely painted on the car's trembling doors. The car's</p>
<p>        tires are WOBBLING. LOOSE. Thick, black SMOKE pours from the cracked</p>
<p>        EXHAUST PIPE. The ancient car RATTLES and GRINDS.</p>

<p>        Upon seeing the car, Indiana SMILES.</p>

<p>        At the foot of the ocean liner's ramp, the car SCREECHES TO A STOP!</p>

<p>        SCRAGGY BRIER</p>

<p>        Indiana's friend and guide, JUMPS out of the taxi. Scraggy is a rough,</p>
<p>        unkempt AFRICAN MAN. An elderly fellow, with the ENERGY and VITALITY</p>
<p>        of a youth. His snow white hair and beard are WILD. SPIKED. He wears</p>
<p>        TATTERED, DIRTY clothes that are many sizes too large for his SKINNY</p>
<p>        body. Homemade CROCODILE SANDALS flop on his feet.</p>

<p>        Scraggy suddenly breaks into a WILD GRIN. He SPOTS Indiana. Scraggy</p>
<p>        SHOOTS up the exit ramp, running through the crowd of people. Scraggy</p>
<p>        stops a FEW FEET in front of Indiana. Scraggy WAVES his arms before</p>
<p>        him, as if he were BLESSING Indiana. Following this, Scraggy LEAPS</p>
<p>        into Indy's arms. Indiana CRADLES Scraggy like a child. Speaking with</p>
<p>        a Portugese accent, Scraggy EXCLAIMS...</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Indy! At last we are reunited!</p>
<p>                                (looks to sky)</p>
<p>                        Oh, Keechingo, God Of Friendship...I</p>
<p>                        thank you for granting my wish!</p>

<p>        Indy RESTS Scraggy back onto the ramp. Scraggy MOVES to assist Indiana</p>
<p>        with his luggage. Before picking it up, Scraggy RAISES his arms over</p>
<p>        the baggage. Again, he BLESSES the suitcases. Scraggy then PICKS UP</p>
<p>        the bags. Indy CHUCKLES.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        I see you haven't changed, Scraggy.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Mahootmek, God Of Goodness, say...</p>
<p>                        "Before body make contact with</p>
<p>                        foreign object...one must cast out</p>
<p>                        bad spirits, or -- "</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        " -- or bad spirits will enter your</p>
<p>                        body!"</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Yes! You have excellent memory,</p>
<p>                        Indy.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        I should! Last time we saw each</p>
<p>                        other...you made me wear the same</p>
<p>                        clothes for 3 weeks straight.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Never separate body from clothes, or</p>
<p>                        bad spirits will hide in pockets!</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        In other words... If people never</p>
<p>                        changed clothes...there would be no</p>
<p>                        evil in the world.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Exactly!</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (chuckles, puts his arm</p>
<p>                                around Scraggy)</p>
<p>                        I missed all a' your crazy</p>
<p>                        philosophies, Scraggy.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        They not so crazy, Indy.</p>
<p>                                (serious, eyes wide with</p>
<p>                                fear)</p>
<p>                        These days... There is much evil in</p>
<p>                        the air. I feel it. Everywhere.</p>

<p>        Indy and Scraggy CONTINUE to walk down the ramp, moving OFF SCREEN.</p>
<p>        CAMERA PANS TO A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM. CAMERA STOPS, as the SCREEN IS</p>
<p>        FILLED WITH A LARGE, BLAZING RED SWASTIKA! CAMERA PANS UPWARD. We see</p>
<p>        that this is the SLEEVE OF A GERMAN SOLDIER. CAMERA STOPS on the face</p>
<p>        of</p>

<p>        SGT. HELMUT GUTTERBUHG</p>

<p>        A thin, skeletal NAZI. He resembles the ANGEL OF DEATH. Gutterbuhg's</p>
<p>        face is NARROW and SUNKEN. His deep set eyes are a frightening LIGHT</p>
<p>        BLUE. His complexion is PALE. EMOTIONLESS. His hair is BLONDE.</p>
<p>        STRINGY. His right arm appears RIGID. It rests STIFFLY at his side.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg FOLLOWS Indy and Scraggy through the crowd. The Nazi</p>
<p>        REMOVES something from his pocket. It is a tiny, MECHANICAL ITEM. It</p>
<p>        resembles a COCKROACH. We see that it is a mini RADIO TRANSMITTER.</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg WHISPERS into it.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUHG</p>
<p>                                (German, English</p>
<p>                                subtitles)</p>
<p>                        Are we making contact?</p>

<p>        The mechanical roach's eyes BLINK RED. Gutterbuhg gives a CHILLING</p>
<p>        SMILE.</p>

<p>        Meanwhile, Indiana and Scraggy ARRIVE at the Taxi. Scraggy begins to</p>
<p>        SECURE Indy's baggage to the roof. Indy OPENS the rear door of the</p>
<p>        cab. He begins to CLIMB into the back seat. He is met with a SWIFT</p>
<p>        KICK TO THE STOMACH! He FALLS to the ground. The wind KNOCKED out of</p>
<p>        him. Scraggy RUNS to the open door, scolding the person INSIDE.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Dr. Clarke! Why you kick Dr.</p>
<p>                        Jones?...</p>

<p>        DR. CLARE CLARKE</p>

<p>        STEPS OUT of the shadows of the car. We RECOGNIZE her from Marcus'</p>
<p>        film, but she is even MORE BEAUTIFUL in person. She is the SAME AGE as</p>
<p>        Indy. Her hair is BRIGHT RED. She removes her glasses, revealing</p>
<p>        sparkling GREEN EYES. She is very PRIM. Very PROPER. But extremely</p>
<p>        INTELLIGENT and QUICK WITTED. She is dressed in KHAKI SLACKS and</p>
<p>        SHIRT. She speaks in a slight BRITISH ACCENT. She hurriedly ASSISTS</p>
<p>        Indiana to his feet.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Dr. Jones! Forgive me.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        No sweat.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Thought I was being attacked by a</p>
<p>                        degenerate sailor.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        No. Just a degenerate archeologist.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Your appearance is deceiving.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Likewise.</p>

<p>        They exchange a handshake and a SMILE. Immediately ATTRACTED to each</p>
<p>        other.</p>

<p>                                        PORTER (O.S.)</p>
<p>                        Indiana Jones! Calling passenger</p>
<p>                        Indiana Jones!</p>

<p>        Indiana TURNS. A ship PORTER walks through the crowd, pushing a LARGE</p>
<p>        BARREL on a dolly. Indy WAVES to the Porter. The Porter STOPS in front</p>
<p>        of him.</p>

<p>                                        PORTER</p>
<p>                        You left this aboard ship.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (puzzled)</p>
<p>                        There must be some mistake... I</p>
<p>                        didn't --</p>

<p>        The Porter POINTS to a section of the barrel that reads: DELIVER TO:</p>
<p>        DR. INDIANA JONES.</p>

<p>                                        PORTER</p>
<p>                        That's you, ain't it?</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Well, yeah...but...</p>

<p>        The Porter DROPS the barrel in front of Indiana and hurriedly WALKS</p>
<p>        back to the ship.</p>

<p>        SGT. GUTTERBUHG continues to SPY on Indiana. The Nazi HIDES a few feet</p>
<p>        away. In a DARK alleyway.</p>

<p>        A puzzled Indiana begins to OPEN the barrel. Scraggy SHOUTS a warning.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Indy! Remember Mahootmek, God Of</p>
<p>                        Goodness! "Before body make contact</p>
<p>                        with foreign object -- "</p>

<p>        Indiana IGNORES Scraggy and begins to PRY OPEN the barrel.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        "...you must cast out bad spirits!"</p>

<p>        Indiana still IGNORES Scraggy. He STRUGGLES with the barrel top,</p>
<p>        FLIRTING with Clare.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        May I call you "Clare"?</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Please.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Well, Clare... We've obviously got a</p>
<p>                        lot of notes to compare... Let's get</p>
<p>                        started tonight...over dinner.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        I'd like that very much.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Friend of mine owns a Cafe... He'll</p>
<p>                        get us a nice quiet table. No</p>
<p>                        disturbances. Just the two of us --</p>

<p>        At that moment, the barrel lid FLIES OFF! The inside if FILLED with</p>
<p>        old, brown BANANA PEELS. Suddenly, BETSY'S HEAD POKES THROUGH the</p>
<p>        peels! Indiana is SHOCKED. Scraggy SIGHS.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        I warn you, Indy! You must always</p>
<p>                        cast out bad spirits!</p>

<p>        A dirty, unkempt Betsy LEAPS OUT OF THE BARREL! She THROWS her arms</p>
<p>        around Indy.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        My precious!</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                                (puzzled, to Indy)</p>
<p>                        Your daughter?</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        My assistant.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        His girlfriend.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                                (revolted)</p>
<p>                        A child!</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (to Clare)</p>
<p>                        It's nothing. Really.</p>
<p>                                (to Betsy)</p>
<p>                        What the hell are you doing here'?</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Proving my love for you.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        How terribly sordid.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (to Clare)</p>
<p>                        Puppy love. Schoolgirl crush. She'll</p>
<p>                        get over it.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Never. This proves that nothing can</p>
<p>                        come between us. Not an ocean. Not</p>
<p>                        two separate Continents.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Think I'm going to be ill.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (puzzled, to Betsy)</p>
<p>                        How...I mean... How could you stay</p>
<p>                        alive?</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Hey... I'm from Brooklyn.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        But we'ye been sailing for three</p>
<p>                        weeks!</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Stowed away in the banana barrel.</p>
<p>                        Ate my way to the bottom.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                                (nauseous)</p>
<p>                        Charming.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                                (pointing to Clare)</p>
<p>                        Hey, Indy... Who's the babe?</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Your intellectual and emotional</p>
<p>                        superior.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Yeah...well you're gettin' on my</p>
<p>                        nerves, Miss... Miss...</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                                (extends her hand)</p>
<p>                        "Doctor" Clare Clarke.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                                (reluctantly shaking</p>
<p>                                Clare's hand)</p>
<p>                        Betsy Tuffet...</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        As in curds and whey?</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                                (getting tough)</p>
<p>                        Listen, sister... You better stay</p>
<p>                        away from Indy...</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        My dear, he has no interest in me.</p>
<p>                        I've already celebrated my tenth</p>
<p>                        Birthday.</p>

<p>        Indiana SHOOTS Clare an angry glance. Indy removes a wad of BILLS from</p>
<p>        his pocket. He GIVES them to Betsy.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Look, Betsy... Why don't you get</p>
<p>                        back on the boat... This time, as a</p>
<p>                        passenger.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Too late, Indy.</p>

<p>        Scraggy points toward the OCEAN LINER. The boat is SEVERAL FEET from</p>
<p>        shore. It SAILS back out to sea. Indiana STEAMS.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        When's the next one out?</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Two weeks.</p>

<p>        Indiana GRUMBLES. An amused Dr. Clarke gets back into the car. Indy</p>
<p>        SHOVES Betsy inside. He is FURIOUS.</p>

<p>        Before Indiana gets into the car, GUTTERBUHG steps out from the</p>
<p>        alleyway. He TOSSES the tiny mechanical COCKROACH at Indiana. The</p>
<p>        roach ATTACHES itself to Indy's TROUSER LEG. The tiny transmittor is</p>
<p>        very LIGHT. Indiana can feel NOTHING. He gets INTO the car. Scraggy</p>
<p>        BLESSES the Taxi and gets into the driver's seat.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg WATCHES as the battered Model-T DRIVES OFF. The NAZI turns,</p>
<p>        walking in an opposite direction. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Gutterbuhg, as he</p>
<p>        enters a SEEDY WATERFRONT HOTEL.</p>

<p>        INT. HOTEL</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg walks through the DIMLY LIT lobby, filled with dusty, tacky</p>
<p>        African furnishings. He turns a corner, into a NARROW, decrepid</p>
<p>        hallway. He STOPS at the last DOORWAY. Room 113. He OPENS the door</p>
<p>        with a key and ENTERS.</p>

<p>        INT. ROOM</p>

<p>        A SMALL, MUSTY Hotel room. It is furnished with a SINGLE BED, A SOFA,</p>
<p>        TWO CHAIRS and A FIRE PLACE. Two BIZARRE AFRICAN STATUES adorn the</p>
<p>        fireplace mantle. Gutterbuhg carefully LOCKS the room door. He walks</p>
<p>        to the FIREPLACE. He TILTS one of the African statues forward. There</p>
<p>        is a mechanical, CREAKING SOUND. Suddenly, the SOFA BEGINS TO MOVE. It</p>
<p>        SLIDES a few feet, revealing an OPENING BENEATH THE FLOOR. A STAIRCASE</p>
<p>        leads into the opening. Gutterbuhg DESCENDS the stairs.</p>

<p>        INT. OPENING</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg enters a LARGE, BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM. We are inside of A</p>
<p>        SECRET NAZI HEADQUARTERS. The room is filled with various</p>
<p>        COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT and RADIO TRANSMITTERS. SEVERAL NAZI SOLDIERS</p>
<p>        are seated before the equipment, monitoring various radio signals. An</p>
<p>        enormous GLASS PANEL covers one wall. THROUGH THE PANEL WE SEE</p>

<p>        TWO SPEEDBOATS. LONG. SLEEK. HIGH POWERED. MAHOGANY HULLED. Both</p>
<p>        speedboats are adorned with a SWASTIKA. They FLOAT in water, in an</p>
<p>        UNDERGROUND, MAN-MADE CHAMBER. Directly BESIDE the speedboats, parked</p>
<p>        on a STONE INCLINE, are</p>

<p>        TWO AUTOMOBILES. The cars are enormous, beautiful "WOODIES". Equipped</p>
<p>        with a RUNNING BOARD and WOOD PANELLED SIDES. The cars GLISTEN. BRAND</p>
<p>        NEW.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg turns to KLAUS, a hulking Nazi who stands in the corner.</p>
<p>        Pointing to Klaus' FEET, Gutterbuhg SHOUTS an order to Klaus. CAMERA</p>
<p>        PANS to Klaus' feet. The Nazi's BOOT IS UNTIED. A LONG STRING dangles</p>
<p>        on the floor. The embarassed Klaus KNEELS and sloppily RE-TIES his</p>
<p>        shoe.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg turns to a Nazi who sits at a RADIO RECEIVER. The Nazi</p>
<p>        wears HEADPHONES, LISTENING for a transmission. THE LONG, FRIGHTENING</p>
<p>        SHADOW OF A MAN overcomes Gutterbuhg. He TURNS. FEAR covers</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg's face. The shadow RAISES its arm. HEIL HITLER! Gutterbuhg</p>
<p>        also RAISES his right arm. But a BIZARRE, MECHANICAL SQUEAK, is caused</p>
<p>        by the movement of his arm.</p>

<p>        LIEUTENANT WERNER VON MEPEISTO</p>

<p>        stands BEFORE Gutterbuhg. Mephisto is a NAZI nightmare. His face is</p>
<p>        THICK and BULLISH. His bulging eyes are a reddish BROWN, giving him</p>
<p>        the appearance of a DEMON from hell. He has NO FACIAL HAIR. NO</p>
<p>        eyebrows. NO eyelashes. Completely BALD. His body is THICK. MUSCULAR.</p>
<p>        He is over SIX FEET TALL. He GLARES down at Gutterbuhg.</p>

<p>                                        MEPHISTO</p>
<p>                                (German, English</p>
<p>                                subtitles)</p>
<p>                        Were you successful?</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg gives a TIMID NOD. With trembling fingers, he reaches over</p>
<p>        and TURNS UP THE VOLUME of the radio transmission. The voices of</p>
<p>        Indiana, Betsy, Clare and Scraggy echo through a TINNY SPEAKER.</p>
<p>        Mephisto manages a pleased GRUNT.</p>

<p>                                        MEPHISTO</p>
<p>                                (German, English</p>
<p>                                subtitles)</p>
<p>                        Keep a record of everything that is</p>
<p>                        said.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg NUDGES the officer before him. The officer hurriedly begins</p>
<p>        to SCRAWL a manuscript of the radio transmission. Mephisto NODS.</p>

<p>                                        MEPHISTO</p>
<p>                                (German, English</p>
<p>                                subtitles)</p>
<p>                        Ever since our battle for the Lost</p>
<p>                        Ark... The feuhrer has been very</p>
<p>                        interested in the adventures of</p>
<p>                        Indiana Jones. Very interested.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        EXT. ZOOLOGICAL COMPOUND</p>

<p>        A miniature ZOO. The PEACEFUL compound is surrounded with small man</p>
<p>        made lakes and palm trees. There are countless METAL CAGES, filled</p>
<p>        with various ANIMALS. The TIGERS, LIONS, GORILLAS and other violent</p>
<p>        creatures, are kept BEHIND BARS. But the LLAMAS, GIRAFFES, DEER and</p>
<p>        various tame animals are FREE to roam the compound grounds.</p>

<p>        Indiana ENTERS with Clare, Betsy and Scraggy. The persistant Betsy is</p>
<p>        ANNOYING Indy. She attempts to SNUGGLE closer to him. Indiana PUSHES</p>
<p>        her away. Betsy TRIES to hold his hand. Indy SHAKES her loose. Scraggy</p>
<p>        WATCHES all of this, GIGGLING to himself.</p>

<p>        We hear SINGING. A high, pitched BEAUTIFUL VOICE. Clare walks to the</p>
<p>        far end of the compound, toward the SINGING. The others FOLLOW. Betsy</p>
<p>        walks by BONZO, A LARGE CHIMPANZEE. As Betsy PASSES, the chimp catches</p>
<p>        a FAMILIAR SMELL. Bonzo begins to FOLLOW Betsy.</p>

<p>        Clare OPENS the door of a large metal cage. Here, the singing is</p>
<p>        LOUDER. Clare ENTERS the cage. Indiana FOLLOWS. Scraggy BLESSES the</p>
<p>        cage, then enters. Betsy MOVES to go inside, but Bonzo's LARGE HAIRY</p>
<p>        HAND REACHES OUT and GRABS BETSY! PULLING the girl OFF SCREEN!</p>

<p>        INT. CAGE</p>

<p>        Filled with hand made wooden and bamboo FURNITURE. TYKI, the adorable</p>
<p>        PYGMY from Marcus' film, is INSIDE. Tyki is dressed only in a BELTED,</p>
<p>        leather loin cloth and SANDALS. He is perched on the floor, working on</p>
<p>        a large TAPESTRY. The tapestry depicts a colorful picture of CLOUDS.</p>
<p>        The buildings of a LARGE CITY are REFLECTED on the clouds. Tyki</p>
<p>        pleasantly SINGS as he does his work.</p>

<p>        Upon hearing the cage door OPEN, Tyki LOOKS UP. He SEES Clare. A</p>
<p>        JOYOUS SMILE covers his face. The pygmy RUNS to Clare, giving her a</p>
<p>        huge HUG and a KISS. Clare INTRODUCES Tyki to the others.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Tyki... This is Doctor Jones...</p>

<p>        Tyki EXTENDS his right hand. He SHAKES Indiana's hand. Indiana is</p>
<p>        CHARMED by the civilized display of friendship. Indy SMILES at Clare.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        He's a real gentleman.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                                (shrugs)</p>
<p>                        Just basic manners. What it takes</p>
<p>                        most men a lifetime to learn...</p>
<p>                        Tyki's accomplished in two weeks.</p>
<p>                                (introduces Scraggy)</p>
<p>                        This is our guide, Scraggy Brier...</p>
<p>                        and Miss Bets--</p>

<p>        Clare pauses, noticing that Betsy is MISSING. Clare suddenly breaks</p>
<p>        into a LAUGH! She points OFF SCREEN. Everyone TURNS.</p>

<p>        EXT. COMPOOND</p>

<p>        Bonzo is being extremely AFFECTIONATE toward Betsy. The chimpanzee</p>
<p>        PULLS and GRABS at Betsy. It is all VERY SIMILIAR to what Betsy has</p>
<p>        been doing to Indiana. Betsy WRESTLES with Bonzo, CALLING Indy for</p>
<p>        help.</p>

<p>        INT. CAGE</p>

<p>        Everyone CHUCKLES at Betsy's dillemma.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        It appears that Bonzo is attracted</p>
<p>                        to Miss Tuffet's Derfume... Eau De</p>
<p>                        Banana Peel.</p>

<p>        Tyki has gone back to his ARTWORK. A FASCINATED Indiana looks over the</p>
<p>        pygmy's shoulder.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Where did you find him?...</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        About ten miles from here. We were</p>
<p>                        on a photographic expedition...in</p>
<p>                        the thick of the jungle... I heard</p>
<p>                        sounds. Whimpering. Moaning. I took</p>
<p>                        a few steps, and found Tyki. He was</p>
<p>                        lying in a shallow swamp...semi</p>
<p>                        conscious...a high fever...nearly</p>
<p>                        dead from exhaustion. He had</p>
<p>                        obviously been travelling on foot</p>
<p>                        for many days, over countless</p>
<p>                        miles... So I brought him back to</p>
<p>                        the compound...nursed him back to</p>
<p>                        health...</p>

<p>        Indiana STARES at the pygmy. A skeptical look COVERS his face.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Clare, I hate to quibble with your</p>
<p>                        anthropological abilities...</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Quibble.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        ...but if this little fellow is over</p>
<p>                        200 years old... I mean... What</p>
<p>                        accounts for his youthful</p>
<p>                        appearance?...his vitality?...</p>

<p>        Clare OPENS a door at the rear of the cage. It LEADS into another</p>
<p>        room, directly behind the CAGE. Clare and Indiana ENTER. Scraggy STAYS</p>
<p>        behind. He EXCHANGES a friendly smile with Tyki. Meanwhile, in the</p>
<p>        BACKGROUND, we see BETSY and the CHIMPANZEE. They ROLL BY on the</p>
<p>        ground. Still WRESTLING.</p>

<p>        CLOSE UP: PEACE STONE.</p>

<p>        A FRUIT FLY crawls along the peach pit's surface.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE (O.S.)</p>
<p>                        Tyki was wearing this when I found</p>
<p>                        him.</p>

<p>        CAMERA PULLS BACK. We are in a SMALL, STERILE ROOM. The peach stone</p>
<p>        rests on a TABLE. Indiana and Clare STAND over the stone. Indy PICKS</p>
<p>        UP the stone, examining it. An annoying FRUIT FLY buzzes around Indy's</p>
<p>        head. CAMERA PANS DOWN to Indiana's trouser leg. The RADIO TRANSMITTOR</p>
<p>        is still attached to his pants. The tiny bug's eyes BLINK. RED.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        SGT. GUTTERBUHG.</p>

<p>        He stands inside of Nazi Headquarters, huddled over the RADIO. The</p>
<p>        VOICES of Indiana and Clare echo over the speaker. Gutterbuhg</p>
<p>        FURIOUSLY transcribes the conversation.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE (O.S.)</p>
<p>                        Dr. Jones, you are obviously</p>
<p>                        familiar with the legend of Sun Wu-</p>
<p>                        King's Garden of Immortal Peaches?...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA (O.S.)</p>
<p>                        A bite from the fruit of that peach</p>
<p>                        tree would give a person eternal</p>
<p>                        life...make them forever young...</p>

<p>        The vicious Gutterbuhg SMILES. CAMERA PANS to his notebook. Gutterbuhg</p>
<p>        underlines the words "FOREVER YOUNG".</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT BACK TO:</p>

<p>        INDIANA</p>

<p>        STUDYING the peach pit. The fruit fly continues to BUZZ around</p>
<p>        Indiana's head.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        There's nothing unusual about this</p>
<p>                        ...nothing to indicate that it's</p>
<p>                        from Sun Wu Kung's garden...</p>

<p>        The fruit fly LANDS on Indiana's neck. Indy SMACKS the fly! KILLING</p>
<p>        it! A SHOCKED Clare RUNS to Indiana. She GRABS his hand and GENTLY</p>
<p>        removes what remains of the fruit fly. She GLARES at Indiana. FURIOUS.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        This fruit fly had a normal life-</p>
<p>                        span of TWENTY FOUR HOURS.</p>
<p>                                (frustrated sigh)</p>
<p>                        As an experiment...the fly was put</p>
<p>                        in this room...alone...with only the</p>
<p>                        peach stone to sustain its</p>
<p>                        existence. The fly stayed alive for</p>
<p>                        THREE WEEKS.</p>
<p>                                (looks at dead fly)</p>
<p>                        Until now.</p>

<p>        She FLICKS the'fly against the wall. Indy gives an EMBARASSED SHRUG.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Sorry.</p>

<p>        Indiana and Clare are suddenly INTERRUPTED by the sound of Scraggy and</p>
<p>        Tyki's LAUGHTER. This is followed by the two of them having a</p>
<p>        DISCUSSION! In Tyki's FOREIGN TONGUE! Clare and Indy exchange a</p>
<p>        SHOCKED GLANCE and DASH out of the room.</p>

<p>        INT. CAGE</p>

<p>        Scraggy and Tyki are having a CONVERSATION. Clare POINTS to Scraggy,</p>
<p>        giving a PUZZLED LOOK to Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        He understands him?</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (nods)</p>
<p>                        Scraggy knows hundreds of</p>
<p>                        languages... He's the best guide in</p>
<p>                        Africa.</p>
<p>                                (turns to Scraggy)</p>
<p>                        Ask Tyki where he came from.</p>

<p>        Scraggy NODS and ASKS Tyki. Tyki ANSWERS and POINTS to the painting of</p>
<p>        the clouds. Scraggy TRANSLATES.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        He say... "I come from 'Land Of City</p>
<p>                        On Clouds'".</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (puzzled)</p>
<p>                        Huh?... What the hell's that s'posed</p>
<p>                        to mean?</p>
<p>                                (to Scraggy)</p>
<p>                        Can he take us there?</p>

<p>        Scraggy ASKS Tyki. Tyki ANSWERS. He and Scraggy LAUGH hysterically.</p>
<p>        Scraggy LOOKS at Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        He say if he could... He would go</p>
<p>                        back!</p>

<p>        Tyki OFFERS some more information to Scraggy. Scraggy TRANSLATES.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        He say "Pai Cho" may help you.</p>

<p>        Indiana's eyes WIDEN. STARTLED. AMAZED. Clare LOOKS at Indy. PUZZLED.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        "Pai Cho"?</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        The Sacres Proverbs and Writings of</p>
<p>                        Sun Wu Kung.</p>
<p>                                (anxious, looking at</p>
<p>                                Scraggy)</p>
<p>                        His disciples always carry the Pai</p>
<p>                        Cho with them...</p>

<p>        Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The pygmy NODS and REMOVES his belt. We see that</p>
<p>        the thick belt actually unravels into a CLOTH SCROLL. Tyki KISSES the</p>
<p>        scroll and GIVES it to Scraggy. Scraggy nervously OPENS the scroll. It</p>
<p>        is filled with countless ANCIENT CHINESE WRITINGS and PROVERBS.</p>
<p>        Indiana STARES over Scraggy's shoulder.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Can you translate it?...</p>

<p>        Scraggy NODS. Indiana's eyes ANXIOUSLY scan the document. He is</p>
<p>        BREATHLESS. EXCITED. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS.</p>

<p>        Suddenly, BETSY AND THE CHIMPANZEE FALL INTO FRAME! ON TOP OF THE</p>
<p>        SCROLL! Bonzo STRADDLES Betsy, trying to move his lips TOWARD hers!</p>
<p>        She is SCREAMING!</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Get...him...off...of...me...!</p>

<p>        Bonzo moves its lips to Betsy and gives her a BIG KISS! SMACK! Betsy</p>
<p>        GRIMACES. Finally, Clare begins to make BIZARRE MONKEY HAND MOTIONS</p>
<p>        and SOUNDS. Bonzo TURNS. He UNDERSTANDS Clare. She continues to</p>
<p>        COMMUNICATE with the chimp, until Bonzo turns and RUNS out of the</p>
<p>        cage! Indiana and Scraggy exchange an IMPRESSED GLANCE. Betsy WIPES</p>
<p>        the kiss from her lips.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        CLOSE UP: A FLASHING NEON SIGN.</p>

<p>        It reads: "DASHIELL'S AMERICAN BAR". It adorns the front of a stylish,</p>
<p>        Mozambique NIGHTCLUB.</p>

<p>        INT. DASHIELL'S BAR</p>

<p>        DIMLY lit. SMOKY. Filled with cloth covered TABLES and ornamental,</p>
<p>        AFRICAN furnishings. A 9 piece JAZZ BAND plays SWING TUNES. A few</p>
<p>        couples SWAY on the dance floor. The place is swarming with NAZIS.</p>
<p>        Many are SEATED at the bar. Others are scattered at various TABLES</p>
<p>        throughout the restaurant. Some stand in CORNERS. Lurking in the</p>
<p>        SHADOWS. They are all looking in one direction, watching one man...</p>
<p>        INDIANA JONES.</p>

<p>        Indy sits with Scraggy, Clare and Betsy, at a table near the REAR of</p>
<p>        the restaurant. They are eating DINNER. But Indy, Scraggy and Clare</p>
<p>        are more interested in the Stone Monkey SCROLLS. A very NERVOUS</p>
<p>        Scraggy TRANSLATES. Indiana, wearing his spectacles, takes pages and</p>
<p>        pages of NOTES. Searching for a CLUE. An INTERESTED Clare reads over</p>
<p>        Indiana's shoulder. Betsy tries to become INCLUDED in the discussion.</p>
<p>        But everyone IGNORES her. Scraggy continues to TRANSLATE.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                                (shakes her head)</p>
<p>                        The Bondogea. The Kyebe Kyebe. The</p>
<p>                        Dungumaro.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Huh?</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        African Tribal dances.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Never heard of 'em.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Of course not. They're beyond the</p>
<p>                        spectrum of your microscopic world.</p>

<p>        Insulted, Betsy GOBBLES down her glass of wine and TURNS back to</p>
<p>        Indiana, who is still deeply CONCENTRATING on the scrolls.</p>

<p>        UNDER THE TABLE</p>

<p>        Betsy's FOOT reaches across the floor. It RESTS on Indy's leg. Betsy</p>
<p>        begins to RUB against Indiana's trouser leg. The red eyed MECHANICAL</p>
<p>        BUG is still attached to Indiana's trousers.</p>

<p>        INDIANA</p>

<p>        GLARES at Betsy. Clare REACHES for her cup of coffee. She NOTICES that</p>
<p>        the coffee cup trembles SLIGHTLY. Clare GLANCES beneath the table, and</p>
<p>        sees Betsy RUBBING Indy's leg. Clare is DISGUSTED.</p>

<p>        ABOVE the table, Clare shoots a scowl of DISAPPROVAL at Indy. A</p>
<p>        FLUSTERED Indy tries to explain...but is suddenly INTERRUPTED by a</p>
<p>        hand on his shoulder. It is DASHIELL, the suave, HANDSOME owner of the</p>
<p>        restaurant. Dashiell gives a CaARMING SMILE to everyone at the table.</p>

<p>                                        DASHIELL</p>
<p>                        Enjoying your dinners?...</p>

<p>        Everyone NODS, expressing their thanks. Dashiell LEANS close to</p>
<p>        Indiana and WHISPERS.</p>

<p>                                        DASHIELL</p>
<p>                        Watch yourself, sport. Most of the</p>
<p>                        talk here tonight is about you. And</p>
<p>                        it isn't good.</p>

<p>        Indiana's eyes DART around the room. He sees the VARIOUS NAZIS.</p>
<p>        WATCHING him. Indy gives a CONFIDENT SMILE. A WORRIED Dashiell</p>
<p>        continues WHISPERING to Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        DASHIELL</p>
<p>                        I don't know what you've done to the</p>
<p>                        Nazis. But they are certainly no</p>
<p>                        friends of yours.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        EXT. ZOOLOGICAL COMPOUND</p>

<p>        DARK. SILENT. Many of the animals are ASLEEP in their cages. A</p>
<p>        SECURITY GUARD keeps watch on the compound. He STANDS outside of the</p>
<p>        METAL GATES. There is a SUDDEN SOUND. The guard TURNS.</p>

<p>        THE FIGURES OF THREE MEN stand before him. In the SHADOWS. The NERVOUS</p>
<p>        Guard places a hand on his holster.</p>

<p>                                        GUARD</p>
<p>                        Who's there?...</p>

<p>        We hear a MECHANICAL CREAK. A MAN'S LEATHER GLOVED HAND extends from</p>
<p>        the shadows. The hand's FINGER is POINTED at the Security GUARD.</p>

<p>        CLOSE UP: VARIOUS ANIMALS</p>

<p>        The sound of RAPID MACHINE GUN FIRE echoes throughout the camp! CAMERA</p>
<p>        RECORDS the animal's SHOCKED REACTIONS!</p>

<p>        THE SECURITY GUARD</p>

<p>        lies on the GROUND. DEAD. His body riddled with BULLETS. The SHINY,</p>
<p>        BLACK BOOTS of the three men PASS his body. We notice that one of the</p>
<p>        boot's SHOELACES are untied.</p>

<p>        TYKI</p>

<p>        STARES into the dark night. FEAR covers his face. He is SEATED inside</p>
<p>        of his cage. A CANDLE flickers beside him. Tyki's hands REST on the</p>
<p>        beautiful tapestry. Tyki LISTENS. He hears FOOTSTEPS. COMING toward</p>
<p>        his cage. Tyki REACHES to his side. He grabs a STONE DAGGER.</p>

<p>        Suddenly, a LOOD GONSHOT! The SPLINTERED LOCK from Tyki's cage goes</p>
<p>        spinning across the floor. The cage door CREAKS OPEN.</p>

<p>        GUTTERBUHG stands in the doorway. TWO NAZI SOLDIERS, HELMUT and KLACE</p>
<p>        (who we met earlier), are beside him. Gutterbuhg SMILES. His stiff</p>
<p>        right arm EXTENDS from his side. His leather gloved INDEX FINGER is</p>
<p>        POINTING ahead.</p>

<p>        Tyki GROWLS at the Nazis. He STANDS. RAISING the stone dagger OVER HIS</p>
<p>        HEAD.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg's FINGER BEGINS TO RAPIDLY FIRE BULLETS! His MECHANICAL ARM</p>
<p>        is actually a A MACEINE GUN!</p>

<p>        The bullets TEAR through Tyki's tapestry. They make a crooked,</p>
<p>        tattered line through the BEAUTIFOL WORK. DESTROYING it. A terrified</p>
<p>        Tyki WATCHES.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg STOPS shooting. He REMOVES the empty cartridge from a SLOT</p>
<p>        in his mechanical arm, and REPLACES it with another. He points the</p>
<p>        DEADLY FINGER at Tyki. A trembling Tyki DROPS the dagger. The three</p>
<p>        NAZIS walk toward the helpless pygmy.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        INT. DASHIELL'S BAR</p>

<p>        Indiana, Scraggy and Clare CONTINUE to excitedly STUDY the map. A</p>
<p>        NEGLECTED Betsy POURS herself the last of the wine. She is very DRUNK,</p>
<p>        singing along with the band's version of Cole Porter's "Night and</p>
<p>        Day".</p>

<p>        BENEATH THE TABLE</p>

<p>        Betsy continues to RUB her FOOT against Indiana's leg.</p>

<p>        INDIANA</p>

<p>        tries to IGNORE Betsy's playing. Scraggy continues to TRANSLATE the</p>
<p>        scroll.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        "With his Golden Hooped Rod,</p>
<p>                        And its powerful lightning rays,</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        The Golden Hooped Rod?</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        A heavenly staff with many different</p>
<p>                        powers...most notably, it had the</p>
<p>                        ability to transform itself into</p>
<p>                        hundreds of objects...</p>
<p>                                (staring)</p>
<p>                        It remains the most priceless</p>
<p>                        treasure of Sun Wu Kung's empire.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        And what is the...the Water Curtain</p>
<p>                        Cave?</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Sun Wu Kung's legendary hideout...an</p>
<p>                        enormous secret cave, hidden behind</p>
<p>                        a running waterfall.</p>

<p>        Clare again REACHES for her coffee. The cup and saucer are still</p>
<p>        TREMBLING. Clare PEEKS under the table, and again SEES Betsy's foot</p>
<p>        RUBBING Indiana's leg. Clare gives a revolted GRUMBLE. Indiana</p>
<p>        EXCITEDLY explains Scraggy's translation.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        This proves that the Water Curtain</p>
<p>                        Cave exists in Africa...</p>
<p>                                (to Scraggy)</p>
<p>                        Does it mention anything about Sun</p>
<p>                        Wu Kung's travels?</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        The Zarnbesi River! It has a</p>
<p>                        reputation for its deadly water</p>
<p>                        snakes...</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        It would have been Sun Wu Kung's</p>
<p>                        logical path.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (confident, anxious)</p>
<p>                        It will also be our logical path.</p>

<p>        Clare SMILES.</p>

<p>        BENEATH THE TABLE</p>

<p>        Betsy's foot CONTINUES to rub Indiana's leg. Finally Indy reaches</p>
<p>        down, trying to SLAP Betsy's foot away! But Indy's hand STUMBLES upon</p>
<p>        something else. The MECHANICAL BUG. Indy TRIES to remove the bug. But</p>
<p>        the tiny device WON'T BUDGE.</p>

<p>        ABOVE TABLE</p>

<p>        Indiana's hand is buried beneath the table, STRUGGLING to remove the</p>
<p>        bug. To Clare, it appears as if Indy is PLAYING with Betsy's foot.</p>
<p>        Clare gives an INCREDULOUS look to Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Please try to control that monstrous</p>
<p>                        libido of yours!</p>

<p>        Indiana finally REMOVES the mechanical bug. He LIFTS it above the</p>
<p>        table. EXAMINING it. Clare is about to ASK a question. Indy INDICATES</p>
<p>        for her to "Shhhh". He COVERS the bug and WHISPERS to the others.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        We have to get back to the compound.</p>
<p>                        Tyki may be in danger.</p>

<p>        Indiana, Clare and Scraggy HURRY from the table. A TIPSY Betsy</p>
<p>        Follows. Indiana passes the JAZZ BAND. He nonchalantly DROPS the</p>
<p>        mechanical bug into the trumpet player's HORN! The trumpet player</p>
<p>        hits a PIERCING HIGH NOTE!</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT T0:</p>

<p>        NAZI HEADQUARTERS</p>

<p>        The Nazi wearing the radio HEADPHONES emits a LOUD SCREAM! His</p>
<p>        eardrums BURSTING with the trumpet sound!</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        INT. COMPOUND</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg, Klaus and Helmut LEAD the bound and gagged Tyki OUT OF THE</p>
<p>        COMPOUND. They keep their LUGERS at his back. Suddenly, Klaus TRIPS</p>
<p>        over something. A FAWN. Klaus GROWLS. He SHOUTS a German order to</p>
<p>        Helmut, who GRABS a tight hold of the baby deer. Klaus AIMS his luger</p>
<p>        at the fawn's head. Gutterbuhg and Helmut exchange a chilling LAUGH.</p>
<p>        Tyki stares in HORROR. Klaus CLICKS the luger...ready to SHOOT...</p>

<p>        There is an earth shattering CRACK! A WHIP SHOOTS INTO FRAME! The whip</p>
<p>        WRAPS ITSELF around the luger! TEARING the gun OUT of Klaus' hand! The</p>
<p>        fawn breaks FREE and RUNS OFF. The Nazis exchange a SHOCKED glance.</p>
<p>        They TURN and SEE</p>

<p>        INDIANA JONES! He stands a FEW FEET away. Holding the WHIP. Indiana</p>
<p>        POINTS to Tyki, angrilly SHOUTING to the Nazis.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Get your hands off him.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg LAUGES. He POINTS his finger at Indiana. Indy is PUZZLED.</p>
<p>        The finger begins to SHOOT! RAPID MACHINE GUN FIRE! Indy DIVES for</p>
<p>        cover.</p>

<p>        Holding Tyki CAPTIVE, the Nazis TURN and begin to RUN out of the</p>
<p>        compound. Indy gets to his FEET. He LIFTS his gun. Ready to SHOOT. But</p>
<p>        the Nazis are running behind SEVERAL ROWS OF CAGES, filled with</p>
<p>        ANIMALS. Indiana CAN'T SHOOT. He dashes back OUTSIDE.</p>

<p>        EXT. ZOOLOGICAL COMPOUND</p>

<p>        Located on the WATERFRONT. Countless rows of LONG, WOODEN DOCKS line</p>
<p>        the marina. The Nazis run to below a ROTTED, ANCIENT DOCK. Here, one</p>
<p>        of their SPEEDBOATS waits. Motor RUNNING. RUDOLPH, a pudgy Nazi, is at</p>
<p>        the wheel. The Nazis hurriedly CLIMB into the speedboat, PUSHING Tyki</p>
<p>        inside with them.</p>

<p>        Indy RUNS to Scraggy's Model-T. Scraggy SITS in the driver's seat.</p>
<p>        Betsy and Clare SIT in the rear. A drunk Betsy still sings "Night and</p>
<p>        Day". Indy leaps onto the SIDEBOARD. He SEES the Nazis ahead, CLIMBING</p>
<p>        into the speedboat. Indy motions for Scraggy to DRIVE. FAST. TOWARD</p>
<p>        the dock.</p>

<p>        The Nazi speedboat SHOOTS FORWARD. Moving BENEATH the dock.</p>

<p>        Scraggy's Model-T FOLLOWS ABOVE, along the SHAKY dock. Indiana RIDES</p>
<p>        the car's rusted sideboard. He SEES the speedboat below, through the</p>
<p>        WIDE OPENINGS in the dock's slated boards. Indy begins to SHOOT at the</p>
<p>        Nazis. Gutterbuhg raises his mechanical arm, FIRING SHOTS back at</p>
<p>        Indiana.</p>

<p>        Machine gun fire SPLINTERS the dock boards, SLICING through the</p>
<p>        Model-T. The side mirror is BLASTED to pieces. The floor beneath Betsy</p>
<p>        and Clare erupts with FLYING BULLETS. JUST MISSING the girls. Clare is</p>
<p>        HORRIFIED. Betsy laughs HYSTERICALLY.</p>

<p>        The Model-T is less than TWENTY FEET from the end of the dock. If they</p>
<p>        continue ahead, the car will PLUNGE SEVERAL FEET INTO THE WATER! But</p>
<p>        Scraggy doesn't take his FOOT from the gas.</p>

<p>        GUTTERBUHG smiles, seeing the vast ocean ahead. Knowing he's almost</p>
<p>        FREE.</p>

<p>        As he DODGES bullets, Indiana SEES the end of the dock ahead. He</p>
<p>        SHOUTS to Scraggy.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        When I tell you... Hit the brakes!</p>

<p>        Scraggy NODS. The end of the dock is only a FEW FEET ahead. Getting</p>
<p>        CLOSER... CLOSER... Clare COVERS her eyes. Between hiccups, Betsy</p>
<p>        laughingly SINGS. Indy LOOKS to the speedboat... BACK to the</p>
<p>        approaching dock edge... He PAUSES... WAITING for the right moment...</p>
<p>        He SCREAMS!</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Now, Scraggy!</p>

<p>        Scraggy's foot SLAMS ON THE BRAKES! The sudden jolt sends Indy FLYING</p>
<p>        INTO THE AIR!</p>

<p>        The speedboat SHOOTS OUT from beneath the dock! Indiana LANDS DIRECTLY</p>
<p>        ON TOP OF THE SPEEDBOAT! A SPECTACULAR STUNT!</p>

<p>        Helmut POINTS his gun at Indy. Indy reacts with a SWIFT KICK to</p>
<p>        Helmut's jaw. The Nazi HITS the deck. OUT COLD. Klaus COMES for Indy.</p>
<p>        They begin to FIGHT. An angry Gutterbuhg tries to SHOOT... But Indy</p>
<p>        and Klaus move TOO QUICKLY! Gutterbuhg CAN'T get a clear shot.</p>

<p>        The Model-T has COME TO A STOP. SAFE. Its front wheels TEETER over the</p>
<p>        dock's edge. Scraggy, Betsy and Clare GET OUT. Clare CATCHES her</p>
<p>        breath. Knees SHAKING. Betsy is still LAUGHING.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        About time we had some fun!</p>

<p>        A WORRIED Scraggy sees Indiana, FIGHTING with the Nazis.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Bad spirits have Indy! He in</p>
<p>                        trouble! Big trouble!</p>

<p>        Scraggy RUNS OFF SCREEN.</p>

<p>        The Nazi speedboat is HEADED TOWARD THE SIDE OF AN ENORMOUS OCEAN</p>
<p>        LINER! Gutterbuhg RADIOS for help. Indiana and Klaus continue to</p>
<p>        FIGHT. ROLLING along the deck. Exchanging PUNCHES. A bound Tyki</p>
<p>        watches with WIDE EYES. HELPLESS.</p>

<p>        The speedboat makes a sudden SHARP TURN. AVOIDING A COLLISION with the</p>
<p>        Ocean liner. Indiana and Klaus TUMBLE OFF, THE BOAT! INTO THE WATER!</p>

<p>        UNDERWATER</p>

<p>        Indiana and Klaus CONTINUE their battle. They wrestle only a few feet</p>
<p>        from the ship's large, SPINNING STEEL PROPELLERS. The propellers</p>
<p>        create a SUCTION FORCE. DRAWING Indy and Klaus CLOSER... CLOSER...</p>
<p>        toward a SPINNING DEATH.</p>

<p>        Indy and Klaus grab hold of a dangling, STEEL ANCHOR. PREVENTING their</p>
<p>        bodies from being sucked into the propellers. Klaus PULLS a</p>
<p>        switchblade from his pocket. He ATTACKS Indy's CLENCHED FINGERS with</p>
<p>        the knife. Indy begins to LOSE HIS GRIP. His body INCHES toward the</p>
<p>        propellers. Klaus RAISES the knife, to FINISH OFF Indiana...</p>

<p>        But Klaus' UNTIED SHOELACE dangles beside the propellers. The shoelace</p>
<p>        CATCHES a spinning blade. The SHOCKED Nazi is pulled INTO THE</p>
<p>        PROPELLERS!</p>

<p>        Indiana TURNS AWAY, holding TIGHTLY to the anchor. A BLOOD RED CLOUD</p>
<p>        surges through the surrounding water. Indiana CLIMBS the anchor to</p>
<p>        safety.</p>

<p>        ABOVE WATER</p>

<p>        Indiana SURFACES. Taking a GULP of air. Suddenly, the water in front</p>
<p>        of him erupts with MACHINE GUN FIRE. Indiana SEES</p>

<p>        GOTTERBUHG! He has PARKED the Nazi speedboat only a FEW FEET AWAY.</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg SMILES, pointing his FINGER at the helpless Indiana. A</p>
<p>        SITTING DUCK. Gutterbuhg SMILES.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUHG</p>
<p>                        Goodnight, Doctor Jones.</p>

<p>        There is a LOUD GUNSHOT! Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm is HIT BY A</p>
<p>        BULLET! Pieces of SPRING, METAL and SPROCKETS fly from the wound.</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg TURNS. FURIOUS.</p>

<p>        DASHIELL, the nightclub owner, is a few feet away. He is driving a</p>
<p>        sleek SPEEDBOAT, its side adorned with the AMERICAN FLAG. Dashiell</p>
<p>        points a PISTOL at Gutterbuhg, ready to take ANOTHER SHOT...</p>

<p>        With a ROAR, The Nazi speedboat DRIVES AWAY! Toward a CLUSTER OF</p>
<p>        DOCKS! Indiana CLIMBS into Dashiell's speedboat.</p>

<p>                                        DASHIELL</p>
<p>                        Scraggy said you might be needing</p>
<p>                        some help, sport.</p>

<p>        Dashiell HITS the gas. TEARING after the Nazis.</p>

<p>        A FRENZIED, HIGH SPEED CHASE BEGINS! Through the DARKNESS. Beneath the</p>
<p>        ROWS OF DOCKS. The speedboats face countless OBSTACLES. They SWERVE</p>
<p>        around a virtual forest of wooden poles, which FLY BY AT BREAKNECK</p>
<p>        SPEED! The men DUCK and DODGE dangling FISH HOOKS and NETS. Many paths</p>
<p>        are BLOCKED by the wooden RAFTS and ROWBOATS. (NOTE: Because of the</p>
<p>        darkness, these obstacles APPEAR only when they are a FEW FEET AHEAD</p>
<p>        of the speedboats. This makes the chase completely SURPRISING and</p>
<p>        SCARY, causing a FUNHOUSE effect.)</p>

<p>        Throughout the chase, Indiana and the Nazis continue to exchange</p>
<p>        GUNFIRE. A frustrated Gutterbuhg CAN'T SHOOT. His mechanical-machine</p>
<p>        gun arm rendered USELESS by Dashiell's bullet. He continues to RADIO</p>
<p>        Nazi headquarters for help.</p>

<p>        Dashiell CATCHES UP with the Nazis. The two speedboats travel SIDE BY</p>
<p>        SIDE. Their edges SCRAPE together. SPARKS fly. The recovered Helmut</p>
<p>        AIMS his luger at Indiana... But Indy LEAPS toward the Nazi. The two</p>
<p>        FALL. ROLLING. TUMBLING. STRUGGLING for the gun. They fight BETWEEN</p>
<p>        the two speedboats. The crack below them slightly OPENING and CLOSING.</p>

<p>        Up ahead, an ENORMOUS STONE POLE appears. To AVOID a collision, the</p>
<p>        speedboats MUST SEPARATE. Dashiell SCREAMS.</p>

<p>                                        DASHIELL</p>
<p>                        Indy! Rollout!</p>

<p>        Indy FREES himself from Helmut and ROLLS back onto Dashiell's boat.</p>
<p>        Helmut LOOKS UP. He sees the stone pole AHEAD. COMING AT HIM. Helmut</p>
<p>        tries to MOVE...TOO LATE. The two boats SEPARATE. Helmut SMACKS into</p>
<p>        the pole! CRUSHED!</p>

<p>        Dashiell TURNS AWAY from the wheel, looking at Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        DASHIELL</p>
<p>                        You okay, sport?</p>

<p>        Indiana begins to answer...then sees SOMETHING. AHEAD. He SCREAMS.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Dash!...</p>

<p>        Dashiell TURNS BACK. The speedboat is HEADED STRAIGHT FOR A SOLID</p>
<p>        WOODEN WALL! A sign on the wall reads: FUTTERMAN'S FISHING WAREHOUSE.</p>

<p>        The Nazi speedboat has already made a SHARP TURN, AVOIDING the</p>
<p>        warehouse. There's NO TIME for Dashiell to TURN. Indy HITS the deck.</p>
<p>        The speedboat ARCHES upward, at an ANGLE... CRASH! The speedboat</p>
<p>        BLASTS into the warehouse. Splintered wood SPLATTERS through the air.</p>

<p>        INT. WAREHOUSE</p>

<p>        Dashiell's speedboat BURSTS through another wall. The boat SKIDS</p>
<p>        across the warehouse floor. SCREECHING TO A STOP! A SHAKEN Dashiell</p>
<p>        gets out. Indy RUNS to the window.</p>

<p>        INDIANA'S POV</p>

<p>        The NAZI SPEEDBOAT shoots out of the docks, ESCAPING across the water.</p>

<p>        Indiana grabs his WHIP. He KICKS OPEN the warehouse window. He SNAPS</p>
<p>        his wrist. CRACK. The whip SHOOTS forward, ATTACHING ITSELF TO THE</p>
<p>        REAR OF THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! Indy firmly GRIPS his end of the whip. The</p>
<p>        whip TIGHTENS. WHOOSH! Indiana is PULLED out of the window.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg exchanges a VICTORIOUS laugh with Rudolph, the speedboat</p>
<p>        driver, thinking they have LOST Indiana. A frightened Tyki LOOKS BACK.</p>
<p>        His eyes suddenly fill with HOPE. Gutterbuhg TURNS. His mouth DROPS</p>
<p>        OPEN.</p>

<p>        Indiana uses his WHIP to WATER SKI BEHIND THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! A red</p>
<p>        faced Gutterbuhg SLAMS his fist on the dashboard. He removes a SHARP</p>
<p>        KNIFE. He hurriedly begins to SLICE through Indy's whip. Trying to</p>
<p>        BREAK THE CONNECTION.</p>

<p>        Indiana AIMS his pistol at Gutterbuhg. But suddenly, a SHOT WHIZZES by</p>
<p>        Indy's head. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. COMING from behind.</p>
<p>        Indy TURNS. A SECOND NAZI SPEEDBOAT is in HOT PURSUIT! There are FIVE</p>
<p>        NAZIS inside. Armed with PISTOLS and RIFLES. All FIRING SHOTS at</p>
<p>        Indiana.</p>

<p>        Meanwhile, Gutterbuhg's knife continues to SLICE through Indy's whip.</p>
<p>        Only a FEW THREADS remain.</p>

<p>        Indiana performs some EXPERT WATER SKIING. SWERVING. SPINNING.</p>
<p>        JUMPING. All in an attempt to AVOID the flying bullets from behind.</p>
<p>        Suddenly, Indy's whip SNAPS! Indiana FALLS UNDERWATER! Directly IN THE</p>
<p>        PATH of the seccnd Nazi speedboat!</p>

<p>        Tyki HIDES his eyes. Gutterbuhg LAUGHS. It appears that Indiana has</p>
<p>        met a GRISLY DEATH.</p>

<p>        The Nazis in the second speedboat are DELIGHTED. SHAKING each other's</p>
<p>        hands. CAMERA PANS TO BELOW the speedboat. We move UNDERWATER. SOUND</p>
<p>        TRACK MUSIC SOARS! We see INDIANA. Very much ALIVE. He STRADDLES THE</p>
<p>        BOTTOM OF THE SPEEDING BOAT! HOLDING ON with all of his strength!</p>
<p>        Indiana CLIMBS toward the side of the speedboat, BATTLING the pressure</p>
<p>        of the rushing water.</p>

<p>        CAMERA FOLLOWS INDIANA, OUT OF THE WATER, AS HE CLIMBS ABOARD THE</p>
<p>        SECOND SPEEDBOAT. The four Nazis are LAUGHING. TALKING. Their backs</p>
<p>        turned to the APPROACHING Indiana. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy GRABS</p>
<p>        one of the Nazis and TOSSES HIM OVERBOARD. With a SWIFT PUNCH to the</p>
<p>        stomach and jaw, Indy sends another Nazi INTO THE WATER. The other two</p>
<p>        Nazis TACKLE Indy. They FALL to the deck. FIGHTING.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg LOOKS BACK. SHOCKED that Indy is still alive. Gutterbuhg</p>
<p>        GROWLS. FRUSTRATED. His eyes suddenly LIGHT. He SPOTS something.</p>
<p>        AHEAD.</p>

<p>        TWO GARGANTUAN OCEAN LINERS</p>

<p>        are MOVING TOWARD EACH OTHER. Coming TOGETHER. There is an OPENING</p>
<p>        between the two ships, that continues to get SMALLER, as the ships</p>
<p>        move CLOSER.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg SMILES. An IDEA. He orders Rudolph to DRIVE THROUGH THE</p>
<p>        OPENING.</p>

<p>        In the second speedboat, the Nazis have OVERCOME Indiana. One Nazi</p>
<p>        PINS Indy down. The other removes a THICK METAL CHAIN from his neck. A</p>
<p>        RED SWASTIKA dangles from the chain. The Nazi WRAPS the chain around</p>
<p>        Indy's neck. He begins to STRANGLE Indiana.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg's speedboat MOVES TOWARD the ocean liners. The opening</p>
<p>        between the two ships continues to SHRINK. Getting SMALLER...and</p>
<p>        SMALLER...</p>

<p>        The second speedboat is DIRECTLY BEHIND Gutterbuhg. The Nazis are</p>
<p>        STRANGLING Indiana. The color begins to LEAVE Indy's face. He GASPS</p>
<p>        for air.</p>

<p>        The opening between the two Ocean liners continues to get SMALLER...</p>
<p>        Less than TEN FEET WIDE. Gutterbuhg's speedboat is only a FEW FEET</p>
<p>        AWAY.</p>

<p>        Through his fluttering eyes, Indiana SEES Gutterbuhg's speedboat</p>
<p>        headed for the ocean liners. Indiana is nearly UNCONSCIOUS. The</p>
<p>        giggling Nazis TIGHTEN the chain around his neck.</p>

<p>        With LESS THAN AN INCH to spare... Gutterbuhg's speedboat SQUEEZES</p>
<p>        between the two Ocean Liners!</p>

<p>        The second speedboat is only a FEW FEET from the Ocean Liners. But as</p>
<p>        the ships move CLOSER...the opening is nearly CLOSED. The driver CAN'T</p>
<p>        TURN AWAY. He's TOO CLOSE. He emits a SCREAM. The Nazis PAUSE from</p>
<p>        strangling Indiana. They TURN.</p>

<p>        Indy MOVES FAST. He DIVES overboard. INTO THE WATER.</p>

<p>        The speedboat HITS the opening. TOO SMALL. The speedboat is CRUSHED</p>
<p>        between the two Ocean Liners. The Nazis let out their FINAL SCREAMS.</p>
<p>        Followed by a fiery EXPLOSION! Flaming pieces of the wreckage are</p>
<p>        SPLATTERED through the night sky.</p>

<p>        GOTTERBUHG turns. His grinning, sadistic face LIT by the explosion.</p>
<p>        Tyki's eyes are filled with FEAR.</p>

<p>        SEVERAL FEET AWAY, Indiana Jones SURFACES. ALIVE. He SWIMS to the</p>
<p>        nearby shore and CLIMBS out of the water. He RUBS his reddened neck,</p>
<p>        catches his breath and LOOKS into the distance. Indy SEES Gutterbuhg's</p>
<p>        speedboat. TOO FAR to catch.</p>

<p>        GUTTERBUHG sees the SILHOUETTE of Indy, standing on the distant shore.</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg orders the driver to move FASTER. The engine ROARS.</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg LOOKS back at Indy. The Nazi emits a MANIACAL LAUGH that</p>
<p>        pierces the air.</p>

<p>        Indiana watches the speedboat ESCAPE into the night. His eyes fill</p>
<p>        with RAGE. VENGEANCE. Clare, Scraggy and a VERY DRUNK Betsy JOIN Indy</p>
<p>        on the shore. Betsy PUTS her arms around Indiana. She RESTS her head</p>
<p>        on his shoulder. She CLOSES her eyes and emits a DRUNKEN SIGH.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        What a romantic night!</p>

<p>        An ANNOYED Indy pushes Betsy away. In a drunken stupor, Betsy moves to</p>
<p>        the next person, CLARE. Thinking she's still with Indiana, Betsy puts</p>
<p>        her arms AROUND Clare. A WORRIED Clare is TOO CONCERNED with the</p>
<p>        departing Nazi speedboat. Clare TURNS to Inqy.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Will they hurt Tyki?</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (shaking his head)</p>
<p>                        They know he's important to us.</p>
<p>                                (holds up ancient</p>
<p>                                scroll)</p>
<p>                        They'll use him to bargain for this.</p>

<p>        Eyes CLOSED, resting her head on Clare's shoulder, Betsy SIGHS.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Indy, you smell so good! So</p>
<p>                        masculine!</p>

<p>        Clare PUSHES Betsy away. Betsy SPINS and WRAPS HER ARMS around</p>
<p>        Scraggy. Clare watches the Nazi Speedboat DISAPPEAR into the night.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Will they be following us?</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Every step of the way.</p>

<p>        Betsy, still thinking she's SNUGGLING with Indiana, rubs her face</p>
<p>        against Scraggy's bristly beard.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Mmmm, Indy. I love it when you don't</p>
<p>                        shave. It's so sexy!</p>

<p>        Scraggy PUSHES Betsy away. She SPINS, this time putting her arms</p>
<p>        around a hanging FISHERMAN'S NET. Filled with FISH. Meanwhile, Scraggy</p>
<p>        LOOKS at Indiana and Clare.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Pandoola, God of Purity, say...</p>
<p>                        "Always stay ten paces ahead of bad</p>
<p>                        spirit".</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Exactly. We can't let the Nazis get</p>
<p>                        to the City first. If they do,</p>
<p>                        they'll wipe out one of the greatest</p>
<p>                        archeological finds in History!</p>

<p>        Indiana turns and WALKS AWAY. Clare and Scraggy hurriedly FOLLOW.</p>
<p>        There's NO TIME to lose. The drunken Betsy continues to embrace the</p>
<p>        net of DEAD FISH. Betsy TURNS. Eyes CLOSED. She SMILES.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        How 'bout a little goodnight kiss?</p>

<p>        Betsy KISSES the LIPS OF A DEAD FISH! She SMILES. IMPRESSED.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Mmmmm, Indy...you really know the</p>
<p>                        way to a girl's heart!</p>

<p>        Betsy OPENS her eyes. FACE TO FACE with the dead fish. Betsy SCREAMS</p>
<p>        and RUNS toward the departing Indiana, Clare and Scraggy!</p>

<p>        EXT. ZAMBESI RIVER - THE FOLLOWING DAY</p>

<p>        Early MORNING. The sparkling waters of the Zambesi are lined by thick</p>
<p>        JUNGLE. Sounds of screeching GIBBONS, exotic BIRDS, chattering</p>
<p>        INSECTS, and various other WILDLIFE echo from the jungle. BRIGHT RAYS</p>
<p>        of HOT sunlight sprinkle through the leaves of the towering palm</p>
<p>        trees.</p>

<p>        A 55 foot, tattered, wooden RIVER BOAT, the "ADOBO", travels along the</p>
<p>        Zambesi. The boat is filled with various crates and barrels of</p>
<p>        SUPPLIES. And there are several men, CREW MEMBERS, all natives of</p>
<p>        Mozambique. They are a MOTLEY crew, all armed with SWORDS and DAGGERS.</p>
<p>        They are DIRTY. TATTERED. UNKEMPT. The boat pulls a long, WOODEN RAFT</p>
<p>        behind it. Scraggy's MODEL-T is attached to the raft. One of the crew</p>
<p>        members, a YOUNG MAN, sits on the raft. He strums a BEATEN GUITAR,</p>
<p>        singing a FOLK SONG.</p>

<p>        INDIANA stands at the ship's steering wheel. Forehead COVERED with</p>
<p>        sweat. He GUIDES the ship along the twisting waters. CLARE exits from</p>
<p>        a cabin, carrying a stenographer's NOTEBOOK. She looks RADIANT. Her</p>
<p>        red hair SHIMMERS in the morning sun. Clare walks up BESIDE Indy. She</p>
<p>        CRINKLES her nose.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        What is that awful aroma?</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Scraggy's takin' a shower.</p>

<p>        Indy points OFF SCREEN. Scraggy, fully clothed, STANDS here. He rubs a</p>
<p>        large, FRESH ONION over his FACE, ARMS and LEGS. SQUEEZING the onion</p>
<p>        JUICE over his body. Indiana EXPLAINS to a befuddled Clare.</p>

<p>                        anxious archeology student...she</p>

<p>                                (egotistical shrug)</p>
<p>                        Who can blame her?...</p>

<p>                        But it's just some kinda' hero</p>
<p>                        worship thing...</p>

<p>        There was never any romance.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>

<p>                        I dreamed about our first night</p>
<p>                        together!</p>

<p>        Indy SIGHS. Clare DISGUSTINGLY shakes her head. She continues to</p>
<p>        scrawl more into her notebook. Indiana gives her a STARTLED look.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        You're writin' this down?...</p>

<p>                        I'm keeping an accurate record of</p>
<p>                        our journey.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        What's that got to do with my</p>
<p>                        personal life?</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Evidence. I plan on testifying at</p>
<p>                        your child molestation trial.</p>

<p>        Indiana SHAKES his head. STARING into the distance. He SIGHS.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Why do I do this to myself?</p>

<p>        Holding her head in PAIN, Betsy turns to Clare.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                                (holds her head in pain,</p>

<p>                        Hey, lady...you're s'posed to be a</p>
<p>                        Doctor...you got any cures for a</p>
<p>                        hangover?...</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        The best I've heard was used by a</p>
<p>                        New Zealand Tribe...</p>
<p>                                (pauses, thinking)</p>
<p>                        One part crushed owl skull...two</p>
<p>                        parts rhino saliva...one part zebra</p>
<p>                        dandruff.</p>

<p>        Betsy's face becomes PALE. Indy INTERRUPTS.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        No, No... Get a cup of donkey sweat</p>
<p>                        ...two spoons of skunk hair...and</p>
<p>                        one pint of shredded lizard tongue.</p>

<p>        Betsy turns a light shade of GREEN. Scraggy ARGUES.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        I always use family cure! Two spoons</p>
<p>                        chopped leeches... Half cup horse</p>
<p>                        mucous...two quarts crocodile urine!</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                                (ready to throw up)</p>
<p>                        Ex...cuse...me...!</p>

<p>        Betsy runs OFF SCREEN. The others exchange a SHRUG. Scraggy LOOKS at</p>
<p>        the river ahead.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        How far we travel, Indy?...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Almost 20 miles.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Any sign of the Nazis?</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (shakes his head,</p>
<p>                                confident)</p>
<p>                        Long as we keep up this pace...</p>
<p>                        they'll have trouble tracking us.</p>

<p>        CAMERA PANS from the hopeful faces of Indiana, Scraggy and Clare, to</p>
<p>        the CABIN behind them. Here, a CREW MEMBER HIDES in the shadows. His</p>
<p>        face HIDDEN. He HOLDS a small radio receiver. He WHISPERS into the</p>
<p>        receiver. Speaking in perfect GERMAN.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        GUTTERBUBG.</p>

<p>        He is seated in NAZI HEADQUARTERS. He repairs his detached, MACHINE</p>
<p>        GUN ARM, which sits on the table before him. Behind Gutterbuhg, a</p>
<p>        GROUP OF NAZIS listen to the radio transmission of Scraggy's</p>
<p>        treacherous Crew Member, who discloses the LOCATION of the River Boat.</p>
<p>        The Nazis CHART out the boat's exact location on a large, WALL MAP.</p>
<p>        LIEUT. MEPHISTO supervises the project. Tyki, BOUND, GAGGED and</p>
<p>        BRUISED, watches from a corner. MEPHISTO looks at all the Nazis.</p>

<p>                                        MEPHISTO</p>
<p>                                (German, English</p>
<p>                                subtitles)</p>
<p>                        We must leave. Immediately.</p>

<p>                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:</p>

<p>        NIGHT IN THE JUNGLE.</p>

<p>        VARIOUS SHOTS of exotic animals. A creeping PANTHER. A sleeping WHITE</p>
<p>        BAT. A tense SCORPION. A family of CROCODILES.</p>

<p>        ABOARD SHIP</p>

<p>        Indiana, Scraggy, Clare and Betsy are GATHERED on the deck. Seated in</p>
<p>        a CIRCLE. They are surrounded by the CREW MEMBERS. Everyone eats their</p>
<p>        DINNER from tin cans. The surrounding lanterns cast an EERIE LIGHT on</p>
<p>        the area. The young crew member plays a soft, SPOOKY tune on his</p>
<p>        guitar. Betsy is RESTLESS. She GLARES at the guitar player.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Don't you know somethin' else?</p>
<p>                        Somethin' upbeat?...</p>

<p>        The guitar player IGNORES Betsy, continuing to play. Betsy SIGHS.</p>
<p>        UPSET. BORED.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        It's so hot... Stuffy... Do we have</p>
<p>                        to stay on this stupid boat all</p>
<p>                        night?...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (nods)</p>
<p>                        We have to keep moving.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Can we at least jump in the</p>
<p>                        water?... Go for a swim?...</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        There's an old legend about the</p>
<p>                        Zambesi... In ancient times,</p>
<p>                        criminals were given their choice of</p>
<p>                        execution...or swimming across the</p>
<p>                        Zambesi. Most chose execution.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Clare's right. We'll be safer on the</p>
<p>                        boat.</p>
<p>                                (annoyed, to Betsy)</p>
<p>                        Now quit moanin' and eat your food.</p>

<p>        An angry Betsy TOSSES her tin can overboard. She STANDS. FURIOUS with</p>
<p>        Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        You are so rude! I travel thousands</p>
<p>                        of miles just to be with you...and</p>
<p>                        everybody treats me like dirt!</p>
<p>                                (to Clare)</p>
<p>                        Nobody even talks to me without</p>
<p>                        making some condescending remark</p>
<p>                        they think I'm too stupid to</p>
<p>                        understand!</p>
<p>                                (very upset)</p>
<p>                        So maybe I don't know a lot about</p>
<p>                        weird tribal dances... I'm still</p>
<p>                        pretty good with anthropology and</p>
<p>                        archeology... Maybe I could even</p>
<p>                        help you out...if somebody gave me a</p>
<p>                        chance...clued me in to what it is</p>
<p>                        we're doin' here...</p>
<p>                                (to Indy)</p>
<p>                        'Cause whether you like it or not,</p>
<p>                        Indiana Jones... I'm part of this</p>
<p>                        expedition, too!</p>

<p>        Clare RAISES an eyebrow. IMPRESSED. Indiana says NOTHING. He can't</p>
<p>        ARGUE. Scraggy INTERJECTS.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>

<p>                        we journey to, Indy.</p>

<p>        The crew members NOD. STARING at Indiana. Indiana turns to Clare. She</p>
<p>        SMILES.</p>

<p>                        Tell us all a bedtime story, Doctor</p>
<p>                        Jones.</p>

<p>        Indiana SIGHS. The crew member's GUITAR PLAYING COMBINES with the</p>
<p>        SOUND TRACK, backing up Indiana's story with an EERIE TUNE.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Long ago...a place known as the</p>
<p>                        Flower Fruit Mountain, in the</p>
<p>                        Chinese province of Ao-Lai...was</p>
<p>                        struck by lightning. A Stone Monkey,</p>
<p>                        "Sun Wu-Kung", was born.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        This monkey?... He could walk?...</p>
<p>                        Talk?... Like human?...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        More than human. He was blessed with</p>
<p>                        countless heavenly powers... But it</p>
<p>                        wasn't enough. Sun Wu-Kung wanted to</p>
<p>                        learn the secret of Eternal Life...</p>
<p>                        of Immortality...</p>

<p>                        to protect him, Sun Wu Kung</p>
<p>                        travelled the world for many years</p>
<p>                        ...learning the secret philosophies</p>
<p>                        and teachings of Eternal Youth.</p>
<p>                        Eventually, he was granted entrance</p>
<p>                        to heaven...where the Jade Emperor</p>
<p>                        gave Sun Wu Kung the title of "Great</p>
<p>                        Sage of the Heavens"...and permitted</p>
<p>                        him to oversee the Garden of</p>

<p>                        After several years, the stone</p>
<p>                        monkey returned to somewhere on</p>
<p>                        earth. Here, he ruled an empire...a</p>
<p>                        Civilization of Monkeys and humans</p>
<p>                        who had life spans of many hundred</p>
<p>                        years...</p>
<p>                                (shrugs)</p>
<p>                        The exact whereabouts of that Lost</p>
<p>                        City has been a mystery for hundreds</p>
<p>                        of years...until Doctor Clarke</p>
<p>                        discovered the pygmy.</p>

<p>        The crew members, Scraggy, Betsy and Clare, listen with FASCINATION.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        It's uncertain just how much of this</p>
<p>                        legend is based in reality...</p>
<p>                        Nevertheless, we're hoping to find</p>
<p>                        some sign of the Lost Civilization.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        What about Sun Wu Kung?...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Whatever he was...a stone idol...an</p>
<p>                        actual monkey...a human being...is</p>
<p>                        unknown. But he is one of the most</p>
<p>                        influentual religious figures in</p>
<p>                        History, and his remains are most</p>
<p>                        likely somewhere in the Lost City.</p>

<p>        Suddenly, they are INTERRUPTED BY A DISTANT SOUND. A LOW, RUMBLING</p>
<p>        SOUND. BIZARRE. UNEARTHLY. UNLIKE anything we've heard before. Indiana</p>
<p>        TURNS to Scraggy.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Sound familiar?</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                                (shakes his head)</p>
<p>                        It is far, far away...many miles...</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                                (frightened)</p>
<p>                        What is it?... Some kinda' weird</p>
<p>                        animal?...</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        No animal sounds like that.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Could be "Banseebaba".</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Banseebaba?</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Banseebaba is giant demon from hell.</p>
<p>                        He is 50 feet tall. Breathes fire.</p>
<p>                        Make sound like human never hear</p>
<p>                        before. He is made up of all evil in</p>
<p>                        the world!</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Cheery thought.</p>

<p>        The sound suddenly STOPS. Everyone exchanges a FRIGHTENED, TERRIFIED</p>
<p>        GLANCE. Indiana STANDS.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Whatever the hell it is... It went</p>
<p>                        to sleep for the night. Which is</p>
<p>                        what we should do.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        LATER THAT NIGHT - LONG SHOT - THE BOAT</p>

<p>        The boat sails along the RIVER. Beneath the MOONLIGHT. A lone CREW</p>
<p>        MEMBER stays awake. At the STEERING WHEEL. Other CREW MEMBERS sleep</p>
<p>        along the deck. Scraggy SLEEPS in a hanging cot.</p>

<p>        INDIANA</p>

<p>        is ASLEEP in his CABIN. Suddenly, the door SLOWLY CREAKS OPEN. A</p>
<p>        SHADOW appears on the cabin wall. COMING TOWARD Indiana. The shadow</p>
<p>        EXTENDS a hand. The hand GRABS Indy's blanket. Indy WAKES. He LEAPS</p>
<p>        out of bed and TACKLES the mysterious person. Indy FLIPS on the cabin</p>
<p>        lamp. The intruder is none other than...BETSY. Indiana PULLS Betsy to</p>
<p>        her feet. She gives a flirtatious SMILE.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Couldn't sleep. The heat. I'm in the</p>
<p>                        mood for passion.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        I'm in the mood for isolation.</p>

<p>        Indiana LEADS Betsy to the open door. He begins to PUSH her back</p>
<p>        outside. Betsy STOPS him.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        I'm not leaving. Not till I get a</p>
<p>                        kiss.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Betsy...</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                                (serious)</p>
<p>                        One kiss. Or I'll scream. I swear.</p>
<p>                        I'll wake the whole boat.</p>

<p>        Indiana has NO CHOICE. He SIGHS.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        OKay. Just one.</p>
<p>                                (leans toward her,</p>
<p>                                pauses)</p>
<p>                        Keep your mouth closed.</p>

<p>        They KISS. Betsy WRAPS her arms around Indiana, turning it into a</p>
<p>        PASSIONATE KISS.</p>

<p>        At that moment, ACROSS THE HALL, Clare exits the bathroom, TOOTHBRUSH</p>
<p>        in hand. She SEES the kissing Indiana and Betty. Clare STARES. OPEN</p>
<p>        MOUTHED. SHOCKED. Indiana OPENS his eyes. He SEES Clare WATCHING HIM.</p>
<p>        An ANGRY Clare MARCHES into her room. She SLAMS the door. WE HEAR</p>
<p>        Clare LOCKING the door behind her, and moving a piece of furniture in</p>
<p>        front of the door. Indiana PUSHES Betsy away. ANGRY. He quickly CLOSES</p>
<p>        his door. Betsy WALKS back to her room. A huge, SATISFIED SMILE covers</p>
<p>        her face.</p>

<p>        THE FOLLOWING MORNING</p>

<p>        SUNRISE. PEACEFUL. CALM. Birds SING. The River Boat has travelled</p>
<p>        countless miles, into the heart of the ZAMBESI. A tired CREW MEMBER</p>
<p>        mans the boat's steering wheel. CAMERA PANS DOWN, moving along the</p>
<p>        side of the boat. WE STOP AT WATER LEVEL. A HAND SHOOTS OUT OF THE</p>
<p>        WATER. GRIPPING a rusted, sharp KNIFE. Followed by ANOTHER HAND. And</p>
<p>        ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Until there are COUNTLESS HANDS, REACHING FOR</p>
<p>        THE SIDE OF THE RIVER BOAT. The hands GRAB HOLD of the boat. SEVERAL</p>
<p>        DARK FIGURES slowly RISE out of the water. Only the OUTLINES of their</p>
<p>        bodies are VISIBLE, backlit by the RISING SUN. The figures CLIMB UP</p>
<p>        the side of the boat. Carefully CREEPING. Moving SILENTLY.</p>

<p>        Indiana stands on the REAR DECK, shirt WRAPPED around his waist. He is</p>
<p>        SHAVING. CLARE sits a few feet away. WRITING in her journal. Indy</p>
<p>        GLANCES to her. CURIOUS.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        What's that you're writing?...</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        "The Erotic Adventures Of Indiana</p>
<p>                        Jones, Professor Of Perversity".</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (back to shaving)</p>
<p>                        Very funny.</p>

<p>        CAMERA PANS TO THE FRONT DECK. STOPPING on the DRIVER. He STARES</p>
<p>        ahead. STEERING the ship. SUDDENLY, A FIGURE APPEARS. BEHIND the</p>
<p>        driver. The figure GRABS the driver. AROUND THE NECK. Before the</p>
<p>        driver can SCREAM...the figure SLICES HIS THROAT.</p>

<p>        Scraggy WITNESSES this. Through an OPEN PORTHOLE. His face covered</p>
<p>        with SHOCK. FEAR.</p>

<p>        INT. LOWER CABIN - KITCHEN</p>

<p>        Betsy stands over a large SKILLET. She FRIES pancakes, LIFTING the</p>
<p>        first pancake, Betsy places it on a PLATE that rests beside her. Betsy</p>
<p>        TURNS to get another pancake. A HAND REACHES FROM OFF SCREEN. The hand</p>
<p>        GRABS the pancake from the plate. Betsy TURNS back. She sees the EMPTY</p>
<p>        PLATE. She is PUZZLED. CONFUSED. She SHRUGS, placing ANOTHER PANCAKE</p>
<p>        on the plate. She TURNS back to the skillet. Again, a hand GRABS the</p>
<p>        pancake. Betsy turns and again sees an EMPTY PLATE. She hears</p>
<p>        GIGGLING. BEHIND her. She turns and SEES</p>

<p>        AN ORIENTAL PIRATE. TALL. MUSCULAR. The Pirate TOWERS above Betsy. He</p>
<p>        is dressed in COLORFUL, TATTERED clothes. The pirate LAUGHS. His</p>
<p>        bloated mouth DRIBBLES with pancake crumbs. Betsy STEPS BACK.</p>
<p>        FRIGHTENED. The Pirate removes a DAGGER from his belt. Eyes filled</p>
<p>        with LECHERY, the Pirate moves toward Betsy. She GRABS the skillet.</p>
<p>        THROWING HOT OIL in the Pirate's face. He SCREAMS. Betsy DASHES OUT of</p>
<p>        the kitchen.</p>

<p>        INDIANA</p>

<p>        has nearly finished SHAVING. He tries to CONVINCE Clare of his</p>
<p>        innocence. She continues to WRITE. IGNORING him.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        You are blowing this Betsy thing all</p>
<p>                        out of proportion...</p>

<p>        Indiana LEANS down. He RINSES his face in a large BUCKET OF WATER. A</p>
<p>        DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! JUST MISSING Indiana. It STICKS into the</p>
<p>        wall. A FEW FEET ABOVE Indy's head. Clare WITNESSES this. SHOCKED.</p>
<p>        UNAWARE of the danger, Indiana RAISES his head out of the bucket. He</p>
<p>        still tries to REASON with Clare.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        It's not as if I have this sleazy</p>
<p>                        reputation...</p>

<p>        Clare is trying to INTERRUPT Indy, trying to POINT OUT the dagger. But</p>
<p>        before she can say a word, Indiana again LEANS into the water bucket.</p>
<p>        ANOTHER DAGGER SHOOTS INTO FRAME! INTO the wall. This time only INCHES</p>
<p>        above Indy's head. Indiana again RAISES his head.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        I am a respected...honored...</p>
<p>                        admired...</p>

<p>        Clare LEAPS FORWARD. She pushes Indy OUT OF THE WAY, moments before</p>
<p>        another DAGGER FLIES INTO FRAME! STICKING into the wall! Indy and</p>
<p>        Clare TURN.</p>

<p>        THREE PIRATES stand here. DIRTY. TOOTHLESS. UGLY. SWORDS EXTENDED,</p>
<p>        they MOVE toward Indiana and Clare. Indy's eyes DART to the water</p>
<p>        bucket table. His WHIP and PISTOL rest here. OUT OF REACH. Indy and</p>
<p>        Clare are TRAPPED. The Pirates move CLOSER...</p>

<p>        Suddenly, A LOUD SCREAM. The Pirates LOOK UP. SCRAGGY swings from a</p>
<p>        ROPE above. TOWARD the Pirates. Before the Pirates can react, Scraggy</p>
<p>        CRASHES into them. They TUMBLE to the deck. Scraggy SHOOTS to his</p>
<p>        feet. He tosses a spare SWORD to Indy. Scraggy and Indy begin to</p>
<p>        SWORDFIGBT the Pirates.</p>

<p>        Clare TURNS. DASHING around the corner. To SAFETY. A SUDDEN STOP. Her</p>
<p>        face is buried in the hairy, bare chest of KEZURE, an enormous, bear-</p>
<p>        like PIRATE KING. Kezure HASN'T BATHED in years. He is dressed in</p>
<p>        SEVERAL LAYERS of tattered, colorful clothing, GOLDEN JEWELRY, and</p>
<p>        ANIMAL SKINS. His STRINGY hair is long, tied in a PONYTAIL behind his</p>
<p>        head. A thick, long MOUSTACHE wraps around a large mouth, filled with</p>
<p>        crooked, GOLDEN TEETH. Clare SHRIEKS. Kezure GRABS her around the</p>
<p>        waist. He TOSSES Clare over his shoulder.</p>

<p>        The river boat is overcome with a mixture of ORIENTAL and BLACK</p>
<p>        Pirates. SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS! There is a HEATED BATTLE between the</p>
<p>        crew members and the Pirates. Fists FLYING. Swords CLASHING.</p>

<p>        Using her Brooklyn street smarts, Betsy FIGHTS like a pro. With a</p>
<p>        swift PUNCH and KICK, Betsy DEFEATS one Pirate. She takes his SWORD.</p>
<p>        ANOTHER Pirate comes for Betsy. She EDGES him on.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        C'mon... You ain't so tough. You</p>
<p>                        wouldn't last ten minutes in</p>
<p>                        Brooklyn.</p>

<p>        The Pirate ATTACKS. He and Betsy begin a HEATED SWORDFIGHT.</p>

<p>        Indiana and Scraggy CONTINUE TO BATTLE the onslaught of sword slinging</p>
<p>        Pirates. Suddenly, Indy is interrupted by Clare's LOUD SCREAM! He</p>
<p>        TURNS.</p>

<p>        A PIRATE SHIP</p>

<p>        has APPEARED. BESIDE the river boat. The ship is ANCIENT. OMINOUS.</p>
<p>        COUNTLESS PIRATES are aboard the ship. Armed with GUNS, BOWS AND</p>
<p>        ARROWS and CANNONS.</p>

<p>        EXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK</p>

<p>        KEZURE, the Pirate King, stands at the edge of the boat. He still</p>
<p>        HOLDS the screaming Clare over his shoulder. From the Pirate ship, the</p>
<p>        Pirates toss a GRAPNEL ROPE to Kezure. The Pirate King GRABS BOLD of</p>
<p>        the rope. Holding TIGHTLY to Clare, Kezure SWINGS from the river boat,</p>
<p>        to the Pirate Ship.</p>

<p>        INDIANA runs through the FIGHTING crew members and Pirates, in an</p>
<p>        effort to SAVE Clare. Suddenly, the SOUND OF CANNON FIRE! The river</p>
<p>        boat ROCKS! HIT by a CANNONBALL! Indy KEEPS his balance. SWORD in</p>
<p>        hand, he DIVES INTO THE WATER.</p>

<p>        Indiana SWIMS across the Zambesi. TOWARD the Pirate ship. The water</p>
<p>        surrounding Indy erupts with COUNTLESS SPRAYS OF BULLETS, CANNONBALLS</p>
<p>        and FLYING ARROWS.</p>

<p>        EXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK</p>

<p>        The swordfighting crew members manage to keep the many Pirates AT BAY.</p>
<p>        Scraggy EXCHANGES swordplay with a Pirate. The sword is KNOCKED from</p>
<p>        Scraggy's hand. He is DEFENSELESS. The Pirate COMES in for the kill.</p>
<p>        He RAISES HIS SWORD...ready to PLUNGE it into Scraggy's heart... The</p>
<p>        Pirate suddenly PAUSES. A HORRIFIED look on his face. The end of a</p>
<p>        SWORD SHOOTS OUT OF THE PIRATE'S CHEST! A MOMENT PASSES...the sword</p>
<p>        SLIDES BACK INSIDE of the Pirate's chest. The Pirate FALLS to the</p>
<p>        deck. BETSY stands behind him. She holds the BLOODIED SWORD. Scraggy</p>
<p>        gives her a THANKFUL NOD.</p>

<p>        EXT. PIRATE SHIP</p>

<p>        Indiana has MADE IT ACROSS the Zambesi. He CLIMBS UP the side of the</p>
<p>        Pirate Ship. The Pirates begin to SHOOT at Indy. Indy is HIT. An</p>
<p>        ARROW. In the ARM. He dives to safety in a nearby CANNON COMPARTMENT.</p>

<p>        INT. CANNON COMPARTMENT</p>

<p>        Indy PULLS the arrow out of his arm. He is suddenly ATTACKED by the</p>
<p>        Pirate Gunner. The two begin to STRUGGLE. FIGHT. CAMERA PANS TO the</p>
<p>        rear of the cannon, moving to a CLOSE UP of the FUSE. The fuse is LIT.</p>
<p>        BURNING.</p>

<p>        Meanwhile, Indy and the Pirate fight DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE CANNON'S</p>
<p>        OPEN BARREL! Every few seconds, each of their heads MOVES IN FRONT of</p>
<p>        the opening. The fuse continues to BURN. Getting LOWER...LOWER...</p>

<p>        EXT. PIRATE SHIP - TOP DECK</p>

<p>        Clare has been TIED to a mast pole. Kezure STANDS in front of her. As</p>
<p>        his men BATTLE around him, Kezure leans forward. The drooling Pirate</p>
<p>        King sloppily KISSES Clare. Along her NECK. Clare is NAUSEOUS.</p>

<p>        INT. CANNON COMPARTMENT</p>

<p>        Indy and the Pirate continue to FIGHT. The cannon fuse SPARKS. BURNING</p>
<p>        toward the bottom. The Pirate pushes Indy's head INSIDE OF THE CANNON</p>
<p>        OPENING. The FUSE will BLOW at any second. At the last moment, Indiana</p>
<p>        OVERPOWERS the Pirate. Indy LEAPS to the floor. The Pirate FALLS</p>
<p>        FORWARD. FACE TO FACE WITH THE CANNON OPENING! BOOM! The cannon FIRES!</p>
<p>        Indy's shirt is SPLATTERED with blood. Indiana RUNS to a wooden</p>
<p>        staircase, hurrying up the stairs. To the TOP DECK.</p>

<p>        EXT. PIRATE SHIP - TOP DECK</p>

<p>        Kezure kisses the bare shoulder of the STRUGGLING, HELPLESS Clare.</p>
<p>        Indy EMERGES from the cannon compartment. Upon seeing the Pirate King</p>
<p>        ATTACK Clare, Indiana SHOUTS.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        You son of a bitch.</p>

<p>        Kezure TURNS. He emits a gravelly laugh and scratches his neck,</p>
<p>        curiously STUDYING Indiana. Indy EXTENDS his sword. The Pirate King</p>
<p>        removes a long, sharp GOLDEN SWORD. They begin to FIGHT. Moving ALONG</p>
<p>        the deck. A FAST PACED, HEATED swordfight.</p>

<p>        EXT. RIVER BOAT - TOP DECK</p>

<p>        A PIRATE has taken over the boat's WHEEL. He STEERS the river boat OFF</p>
<p>        THE REGULAR PATH. It SPEEDS toward the base of a LARGE, THRASHING</p>
<p>        WATERFALL. The Pirate ship moves ALONGSIDE of the river boat, also</p>
<p>        HEADED for the waterfall. SCRAGGY and BETSY sees the waterfall ahead.</p>
<p>        PANIC fills their eyes. They DASH to the steering wheel. Betsy</p>
<p>        DISTRACTS the Pirate. They begin to SWORDFIGHT. Scraggy TAKES the</p>
<p>        steering wheel. He attaempts to steer the ship AWAY from the</p>
<p>        waterfall.</p>

<p>        EXT. PIRATE SHIP - TOP DECK</p>

<p>        Indiana and the Pirate King have climbed to the top of the SHIP'S</p>
<p>        MAST. They battle AMIDST the tangled ropes. SWORDS CLASHING. As the</p>
<p>        two men fight, Indy notices that the Pirate ship is HEADED FOR THE</p>
<p>        WATERFALL. Indiana has a sudden REALIZATION. He sees Scraggy, trying</p>
<p>        to STEER THE RIVER BOAT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. Indy SCREAMS above</p>
<p>        the cannon fire.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (still fighting)</p>
<p>                        Scraggy!... No!... Keep goin'</p>
<p>                        straight!... Full steam ahead!...</p>

<p>        SCRAGGY</p>

<p>        is CONFUSED by Indy's orders. He SCREAMS back to Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        What?... You crazy Indy?... We be</p>
<p>                        crushed!... We smash into rock</p>
<p>                        wall!...</p>

<p>        INDIANA</p>

<p>        still SWORDFIGHTING the Pirate King, SCREAMS to Scraggy.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        No!... Trust me!... Full steam</p>
<p>                        ahead!... Full steam ahead !...</p>

<p>        SCRAGGY</p>

<p>        BLESSES himself. His face is STRONG. CONFIDENT. He REVS the engine.</p>
<p>        FULL SPEED. He TIGHTLY CLUTCHES the wheel. AIMING the river boat</p>
<p>        toward the waterfall.</p>

<p>        INDIANA AND KEZURE</p>

<p>        SWING from sail to sail, continuing their SPECTACULAR swordfight.</p>
<p>        CLARE helplessly watches from the deck.</p>

<p>        THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP</p>

<p>        continue to move SIDE BY SIDE. Moving CLOSER...CLOSER...to the</p>
<p>        shattering waterfall.</p>

<p>        SCRAGGY</p>

<p>        continues to rev the RIVER BOAT'S engine. CHANTING various prayers</p>
<p>        under his breath. In the background, a FEISTY Betsy continues to</p>
<p>        swordfight.</p>

<p>        THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP</p>

<p>        PENETRATE the waterfall. The two boats are met with an exploding</p>
<p>        shower of POWERFUL WATER! Crew members and Pirates are TOSSED ABOUT</p>
<p>        the deck. Indiana and the Pirate King hold TIGHTLY to the sails, to</p>
<p>        AVOID being thrown into the waters below.</p>

<p>        EXT. RIVER BOAT</p>

<p>        The aged boat TOSSES. TILTS. SPINS. Nearly CAPSIZING. Boards CREAK and</p>
<p>        MOAN. Ready to BURST. But Scraggy holds TIGHTLY to the steering wheel.</p>
<p>        Keeping the boat AFLOAT.</p>

<p>        The powerful water sends Betsy SOMERSAULTING along the deck. She tries</p>
<p>        to GRAB HOLD of something...anything...that will PREVENT her from</p>
<p>        falling off the boat. Betsy finally CLUTCHES onto something. The ARM</p>
<p>        OF A DEAD PIRATE.</p>

<p>        THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP</p>

<p>        are IMMERSED into the waterfall. They DISAPPEAR behind the thrashing</p>
<p>        curtain of water.</p>

<p>        INT. BEHIND THE WATERFALL</p>

<p>        The Pirates' HIDDEN FORTRESS. An enormous, underground CAVERN.</p>
<p>        Hndreds of BURNING TORCHES cast a devilish glow. The grey rocks of the</p>
<p>        cavern walls stretch UPWARD. Filled with countless, tiny CAVES.</p>
<p>        Various stone artifacts and ancient untensils are SCATTERED throughout</p>
<p>        the cavern. There are several other PIRATES here. ARMED. Waiting for</p>
<p>        the RETURN of the Pirate Ship.</p>

<p>        The River Boat and Pirate Ship ENTER the cave. The rushing waterfall</p>
<p>        THRASHES behind them. The BATTERED and BRUISED River Boat comes to a</p>
<p>        ROUGH stop. SCREECHING along a far wall. The Pirate Ship sails to a</p>
<p>        SMOOTH STOP in the middle of the cavern. Armed with guns, knives and</p>
<p>        swords, the Pirates hurriedly SURROUND the intruding River Boat. They</p>
<p>        take Betsy, Scraggy and the crew members CAPTIVE.</p>

<p>        KEZURE leaps to the Pirate Ship's deck and quickly UNTIES Clare.</p>
<p>        Indiana ATTEMPTS to FOLLOW. He PAUSES. Quickly GRABBING A FEW STICKS</p>
<p>        OF DYNAMITE from the Pirate Ship deck. Kezure begins to LEAD Clare off</p>
<p>        of the ship. His sword at her THROAT. Indiana CALLS OUT.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Wait...</p>

<p>        Kezure STOPS. He TURNS. Indy WALKS toward Kezure, stopping less than</p>
<p>        TEN FEET from the Pirate King and Clare. Indy's eyes BURN through</p>
<p>        Kezure.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Free the girl...</p>
<p>                                (glances to his captive</p>
<p>                                friends)</p>
<p>                        ...and my friends...</p>
<p>                                (lights a match, moves</p>
<p>                                it toward TNT fuses)</p>
<p>                        ...or I blow your hideout here out</p>
<p>                        of the water!</p>

<p>        Kezure LAUGHS. Indiana LIGHTS the dynamite fuses. Kezure STOPS</p>
<p>        laughing...WORRIED for a moment... Then, the Pirate King breaks into a</p>
<p>        wide, DEFIANT SMILE.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        Good. We will all die.</p>

<p>        A STANDOFF. Indy DIDN'T EXPECT this. He is suddenly FRIGHTENED.</p>
<p>        PUZZLED. Betsy, Scraggy and Clare STARE at Indy. Waiting for his NEXT</p>
<p>        MOVE...as the dynamite fuse SLOWLY BURNS. Getting CLOSER...CLOSER...to</p>
<p>        the TNT. Kezure seems CALM. Perfectly WILLING TO DIE. Indy gets</p>
<p>        ANOTHER IDEA. He BLURTS it out to Kezure.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        We can take you to the Lost City of</p>
<p>                        Sun Wu Kung!</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        Hah! Better men than you have tried</p>
<p>                        to find the Lost City... They have</p>
<p>                        all failed.</p>
<p>                                (cynical laugh)</p>
<p>                        You are a fool.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (as the TNT fuse burns</p>
<p>                                LOWER...LOWER...)</p>
<p>                        No... You're the fool. You and your</p>
<p>                        friends are hiding out in Sun Wu</p>
<p>                        Kung's Water Curtain Cave...and you</p>
<p>                        don't even know it.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                                (puzzled, looking</p>
<p>                                around)</p>
<p>                        Huh?...</p>

<p>        Scraggy and Betsy exchange a SHOCKED glance. Clare is also SURPRISED</p>
<p>        by the news. The TNT fuse nears the end...ready to BLOW AT ANY</p>
<p>        SECOND... Indiana removes the ANCIENT SCROLL from his pocket. He</p>
<p>        EXTENDS the scroll to Kezure.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        The Sacred Pai-Cho Scroll.</p>

<p>        Kezure GRABS the scroll. Attempting to READ it. Indy INTERRUPTS.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Don't bother. Only WE can translate</p>
<p>                        it.</p>

<p>        Kezure EXAMINES the scroll. PUZZLED by the writing. Indiana and</p>
<p>        Scraggy exchange a HOPEFUL glanpe. Kezure PAUSES. THINKING. He MUMBLES</p>
<p>        to himself.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        The Lost City... Said to have</p>
<p>                        streets paved in gold...treasures</p>
<p>                        far greater than any mortal man</p>
<p>                        could imagine...</p>

<p>        Kezure PUSHES Clare away. TOWARD Indiana. Clare EMBRACES Indy, as he</p>
<p>        BLOWS OUT the dynamite fuse. Kezure GROWLS at Indy.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        Your pathetic lives will be spared.</p>
<p>                        For now.</p>
<p>                                (scratching his neck)</p>
<p>                        But everything we find in the Lost</p>
<p>                        City...belongs to ME.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Fat chance, Sinbad. It's 50-50. Or</p>
<p>                        you've got no deal.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                                (vicious smile)</p>
<p>                        It is my way. Or you've got no head.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        INT. WATER CURTAIN CAVE - THAT NIGHT</p>

<p>        A group of Pirates sit TOGETHER. DRUNK. They SING one of their ancient</p>
<p>        songs. The GUITAR strumming crew member accompanies them. Indiana and</p>
<p>        Scraggy sit around a BLAZING FIRE with Kezure and several other</p>
<p>        Pirates. Indy, wearing his spectacles, TRANSLATES the scrolls with</p>
<p>        Scraggy. Indiana is PUZZLED. TROUBLED. He LOOKS at Scraggy.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Read that last proverb again...</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                                (reads translation)</p>
<p>                        "High tide drowns curiosity,</p>
<p>                        Low tide quenches thirst".</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (stands, looking at the</p>
<p>                                surroundings)</p>
<p>                        There's something here...something</p>
<p>                        that could help us...</p>

<p>        Meanwhile, Betsy and Clare work in ANOTHER SECTION of the cave. Clare</p>
<p>        is doing some ARCHEOLOGICAL WORK, studying the various artifacts and</p>
<p>        utensils. Betsy ASSISTS her. They are surrounded by LEERING, HUNGRY</p>
<p>        EYED PIRATES. The drunken Pirates DON'T take their eyes off of the</p>
<p>        girls. Betsy NOTICES. She POINTS it out to Clare.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Look at 'em. It's like they've never</p>
<p>                        seen a woman before.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        To them... We're the ultimate women.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Kinda' flattering, isn't it?...</p>
<p>                        Being the girl of 200 guy's dreams?</p>

<p>        Clare and Betsy exchange a CHUCKLE.</p>

<p>        Meanwhile, Indiana, Scraggy and Kezure WALK through the cavern. Indy</p>
<p>        is LOOKING around. CURIOUS, he turns to Kezure.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Is there an area... A place where</p>
<p>                        the tide changes?...</p>

<p>        Kezure leads Indiana and Scraggy into a DARK CORNER of the cavern. A</p>
<p>        large, smooth WALL stretches to the ceiling. The wall is filled with</p>
<p>        intricate CRACKS. At the base of the wall, water slowly POURS into the</p>
<p>        cavern. Kezure POINTS to the water.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        In a few hours...the water will be</p>
<p>                        lower...much lower...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        And the remainder of this wall will</p>
<p>                        be visible?....</p>

<p>        Kezure NODS. Indiana's eyes LIGHT. A REALIZATION. He excitedly TURNS</p>
<p>        to Kezure.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        We're gonna need light. A lot of</p>
<p>                        light. On this wall.</p>

<p>        Kezure NODS. Indiana EXCHANGES an anxious, hopeful glance with</p>
<p>        Scraggy.</p>

<p>                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:</p>

<p>        CLOSE UP - A SNORING PIRATE</p>

<p>        CAMERA PULLS BACK. All of the Pirates SLEEP. Their slumbering bodies</p>
<p>        LIE in various positions, throughout the cave. Indiana and Kezure are</p>
<p>        STILL AWAKE. The flickering orange light of the TORCHES illuminates</p>
<p>        the wall in front of them. They AWAIT the lowering tide. Scraggy,</p>
<p>        Betsy and Clare SLEEP on the ground beside them. Kezure POURS two</p>
<p>        glasses of whiskey from a STONE BOTTLE. He gives a GLASS to Indiana.</p>
<p>        Kezure TOASTS.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        To my good fortune.</p>

<p>        Kezure GOBBLES down the whiskey. Indiana RELUCTANTLY drinks. Kezure</p>
<p>        pours TWO more glasses. LAUGHING.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        You know... We are very much alike,</p>

<p>                        I doubt that.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        We both share a remarkable talent</p>
<p>                        for killing.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        I've never gotten used to killing,</p>
<p>                        pal. I do it for survival.</p>

<p>                        I do it for pleasure.</p>

<p>        Indiana DOWNS his whiskey. A LAUGHING Kezure does the same. Indiana</p>
<p>        NOTICES something. ON the wall. He JUMPS to his feet. CAMERA PANS TO</p>
<p>        THE WALL. The tide is VERY LOW. The entire wall is now VISIBLE. What</p>
<p>        were once simple CRACKS, have become the specific LINES OF A MAP. A</p>
<p>        group of ARROWS leads to an "X" at the BOTTOM CORNER OF THE MAP. A</p>
<p>        FASCINATED Kezure and Indiana STUDY the wall.</p>

<p>                        the mountains... There is a village</p>
<p>                        there. The Mongooboo Tribe.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        Very well. I traded with the chief</p>
<p>                        for many years.</p>

<p>                        Good. We'll leave in the morning.</p>

<p>        CAMERA PANS FROM Indiana and Kezure, to a DARK CAVE. A FEW FEET away.</p>
<p>        Standing inside, is the figure of the MYSTERIOUS CREW MEMBER. The</p>
<p>        TRAITOR. His face is HIDDEN in the shadows. Again, he RADIOS back to</p>
<p>        Nazis. He WHISPERS in German. CAMERA DOLLIES INTO A CLOSE UP of his</p>
<p>        RADIO MICROPHONE. A RED SWASTIKA adorns the microphone.</p>

<p>        EXT. JUNGLE PLAINS - THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON</p>

<p>        Scraggy's decrepid MODEL-T TAXI putters across the flat, jungle</p>
<p>        terrain. The HOT SUN shines in the background. The car is completely</p>
<p>        PACKED with people. Ready to BURST. Scraggy DRIVES. Indiana, Clare and</p>
<p>        Betsy are CROWDED in the front seat. Kezure and four Pirates ride in</p>
<p>        the REAR COMPARTMENT. Everyone is UNCOMFORTABLE. CRAMPED. SWEATING.</p>
<p>        Two of Scraggy's crew members STRADDLE the sideboard. Three men sit on</p>
<p>        the ROOF, including the GUITAR PLAYER, who plays a delightful melody.</p>
<p>        Various rusted POTS, PANS and other UTENSILS dangle from the car. This</p>
<p>        creates a CHARMING, JINGLING sound.</p>

<p>        The taxi passes a HERD OF GIRAFFE. The beautiful animals stare in</p>
<p>        BEWILDERMENT at the passing taxi. Suddenly, there is a DISTANT SOUND.</p>
<p>        The same LOW, RUMBLING we heard earlier. The giraffes SCATTER. AFRAID</p>
<p>        of the unnatural sound.</p>

<p>        INT. TAXI</p>

<p>        The bizarre SOUND echoes through the taxi. Indy EXCHANGES a puzzled</p>
<p>        look with the others.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        That sound. Again.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                                (listening)</p>
<p>                        Still far away...but getting closer.</p>

<p>        The sound STOPS. Indiana is BOTHERED. DISTURBED. Kezure LEANS forward.</p>
<p>        He points to a CLUSTERED AREA OF JUNGLE. Nearly a MILE in the</p>
<p>        distance.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        The village is there. Beyond the</p>
<p>                        thick of jungle.</p>

<p>        Scraggy NODS. He DRIVES toward the village. Suddenly, AN ARROW SHOOTS</p>
<p>        THROUGH THE WINDOW! JUST MISSING everyone. It SHATTERS the passenger</p>
<p>        window.</p>

<p>        A TRIBE OF NATIVE WARRIORS appear on the terrain. There are HUNDREDS.</p>
<p>        SCREAMING in high pitched squeals. Their bodies ADORNED with red and</p>
<p>        white PAINT. The angry warriors RUN TOWARD the taxi. FIRING ARROWS!</p>

<p>        On the Taxi roof, the men DIVE for cover. Arrows WHIZ by their heads.</p>
<p>        Inside, everyone ROLLS UP the windows. The taxi is attacked with a</p>
<p>        SHOWER OF ARROWS. Scraggy FLOORS the gas. The taxi keeps MOVING AHEAD.</p>
<p>        SPEEDING toward the jungle. Indiana GLARES at Kezure.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Thought you said they knew you?...</p>

<p>        Kezure gives a PUZZLED SHRUG.</p>

<p>        The WARRIORS continue to CHASE the Taxi. Getting CLOSER. Firing more</p>
<p>        ARROWS. The taxi SPINS to a stop. Directly in front of a LARGE OPENING</p>
<p>        that leads into the jungle. Everyone POURS OUT of the Taxi. ARROWS fly</p>
<p>        by their heads. They DASH through the opening. Into the JUNGLE. The</p>
<p>        Warriors STOP. OUTSIDE of the opening. They DON'T ENTER. TURNING to</p>
<p>        each other, they begin to LAUGH. VICTORIOUS.</p>

<p>        INT. JUNGLE</p>

<p>        An almost PERFECT PATH has been cleared through the thick Jungle.</p>
<p>        Indiana and the others RUN through the path. Indy SUDDENLY PAUSES.</p>
<p>        MOTIONING for the others to STOP. A PUZZLED LOOK covers his face.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Wait... Listen... They're not</p>
<p>                        following us...</p>

<p>        One of the Pirates CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD. His foot TRIPS A THIN</p>
<p>        STRING that stretches across the path. WHOOSH! A BOOBY TRAPPED PALM</p>
<p>        TREE SWINGS FORWARD! It SLAMS into the Pirate! Like a giant BASEBALL</p>
<p>        BAT! It sends the Pirate FLYING UPWARD. HIGH INTO THE AIR! His body is</p>
<p>        THROWN several feet into the jungle.</p>

<p>        Indiana exchanges a CAUTIOUS look with the others.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Be careful where you step... We've</p>
<p>                        got to move slowly...very slowly...</p>

<p>        Indiana LEADS everyone. They CREEP through the path. Indy PAUSES.</p>
<p>        CAMERA PANS TO HIS WAIST. A SECTION OF VINE stretches across the path.</p>
<p>        ANOTHER booby trap. Indiana CRAWLS BENEATH THE VINE. He MOTIONS for</p>
<p>        the others to follow. One by one, they CAREFULLY CRAWL beneath the</p>
<p>        vine. The guitar player is LAST. He begins to CRAWL through. He NEARLY</p>
<p>        makes it, when...the top of his guitar HITS THE VINE! The vine SNAPS.</p>
<p>        There is a CREAKING SOUND.</p>

<p>        A GIANT, METAL TRAP, OVER FOUR FEET HIGH, SHOOTS UP FROM THE GROUND! A</p>
<p>        HUMAN TRAP! The GUITAR PLAYER DIVES TO SAFETY! The trap's SHARP METAL</p>
<p>        TEETH SNAP SHUT! The guitar is SNAPPED IN TWO!</p>

<p>        Soon, the path ERUPTS with countless ROWS OF TRAPS. They EJECT from</p>
<p>        the ground. SNAPPING SHUT. One AFTER the other. Everyone begins to</p>
<p>        RUN. The traps SNAP SHUT ONLY A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM! Everyone ROUNDS</p>
<p>        A CORNER... They COME UPON...</p>

<p>        AN ENORMOUS PIT! Over TEN FEET DEEP! Filled with countless layers of</p>
<p>        SCORPIONS! There is NOWHERE TO TURN. NOWHERE TO RUN. The METAL TRAPS</p>
<p>        continue to SHUT BEHIND THEM!</p>

<p>        Indiana removes his SWORD. He slices at A BAMBOO TREE. The traps</p>
<p>        CONTINUE TO SHUT BEHIND HIM. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. Indiana gives A</p>
<p>        FINAL WHACK TO THE TREE. It FALLS. STRETCHING across the pool. Only A</p>
<p>        FEW FEET ABOVE the stinging scorpions. Indiana begins to CLIMB ACROSS.</p>
<p>        Moving HAND OVER HAND. Everyone hurriedly FOLLOWS. The bamboo tree</p>
<p>        CREAKS with their every movement. Their feet DANGLE only INCHES above</p>
<p>        the scorpions. The last Pirate GRABS HOLD of the bamboo tree, just as</p>
<p>        the FINAL METAL TRAP SHUTS! JUST MISSING HIM!</p>

<p>        As the last Pirate makes his way ACROSS the pit, he DROPS a small bag</p>
<p>        of GOLD COINS. The coins REST a few feet below. DIRECTLY ON TOP of the</p>
<p>        scorpions. The Pirate PAUSES. DECIDING whether to climb to safety or</p>
<p>        retrieve the coins. Everyone else has MADE IT across. The GREEDY</p>
<p>        Pirate wants his money. With his left hand, he HOLDS TIGHTLY to the</p>
<p>        bamboo tree. With the other, he REACHES for the coins. His fingers are</p>
<p>        INCHES from the ciins. But he LOSES his grip. He FALLS. INTO THE PIT.</p>
<p>        SURROUNDED by hundreds of scorpions. He STRUGGLES to get out.</p>
<p>        CLIMBING. SWIMMING. But he only manages to SINK. The Pirate's SCREAMS</p>
<p>        die, as his body is ENGULFED by the stinging scorpions.</p>

<p>        Indiana and the others CONTINUE AHEAD. Moving SLOWLY. CAREFULLY.</p>
<p>        Someone's foot STEPS ON A WOODEN TRIGGER. There is another CREAKING</p>
<p>        SOUND. Behind everyone, a large BAMBOO DOOR EJECTS FROM THE GROUND. It</p>
<p>        leads to an UNDERGROUND CAGE. The door CREAKS OPEN. THREE FEROCIOUS</p>
<p>        LIONS LEAP OUT! TEETH BARED. GROWLING. They COME FOR the humans.</p>

<p>        Everyone DASHES FORWARD. RUNNING. The lions are in HOT PURSUIT. FAST.</p>
<p>        The humans don't stand a CHANCE. Suddenly, Clare STOPS. She TURNS.</p>
<p>        FACING the charging lions. Indiana LOOKS BACK. SCREAMING.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Clare! What are you...?!?</p>

<p>        The lions STOP. Inches from Clare. They SURROUND her. Ready to ATTACK.</p>
<p>        Indiana WATCHES. PUZZLED. Clare begins to make bizarre PURRING and</p>
<p>        COOING SOUNDS. The lions PAUSE. They RECOGNIZE the sounds. Clare</p>
<p>        CONTINUES. The lions begin to WARM UP to her. Clare KNEELS. She PETS</p>
<p>        the beasts. The lions SNUGGLE up to Clare. LICKING her face. Indiana</p>
<p>        and the others COME CLOSER. PUZZLED. Clare EXPLAINS.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        I imitated the sound of a Lion</p>
<p>                        Mother calling her babies.</p>

<p>        Betsy is IMPRESSED. Indiana SMILES. RELIEVED.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        C'mon. Let's get outta' --</p>

<p>        Indy TURNS...FACE TO FACE with a grotesque SHRUNKEN HEAD! He STEPS</p>
<p>        BACK. The shrunken head is worn around the neck of a tall, muscular</p>
<p>        TRIBAL CHIEF. Leader of the WARRIORS. Countless NATIVES stand behind</p>
<p>        the chief. A look of ANGER...HATE...covers the Chief's face. Indiana</p>
<p>        gives a HOPEFUL glance to Kezure.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Is this the Tribal Chief you told me</p>
<p>                        about?... Your friend?...</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                                (points to shrunken</p>
<p>                                head)</p>
<p>                        No. That is him.</p>

<p>        Indiana ROLLS his eyes. The warriors SURROUND everyone. ARROWS aimed.</p>
<p>        Ready to KILL. The Warriors lead everyone OUT of the path.</p>

<p>        EXT. MONGOOBO VILLAGE</p>

<p>        Several GRASS HUTS are scattered throughout this large village.</p>
<p>        Indiana and the others are LED into the village. They PASS the</p>
<p>        penetrating, unfriendly glares of the villagers. Kezure EXPLAINS to</p>
<p>        Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        This is a different tribe. New. They</p>
<p>                        have taken over the village.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        What happened to the other tribe?</p>

<p>        Kezure SHRUGS. Indiana TURNS to Scraggy.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        You recognize their language?</p>

<p>        PAGE 73 MISSING FROM HARD COPY</p>

<p>        Suddenly, a VOICE echoes from inside of the oven. The natives LISTEN.</p>
<p>        Again, the voice SHOUTS from inside. It's SCRAGGY. The natives</p>
<p>        RECOGNIZE the language. They quickly OPEN the oven door. Scraggy is</p>
<p>        SCREAMING in the tribe's tongue. The grille is PULLED out of the oven.</p>
<p>        The natives hurriedly UNTIE the slightly smoked Indiana, Kezure and</p>
<p>        Scraggy.</p>

<p>        Scraggy SHOOTS to his feet. FURIOUS. He begins to SHOUT at the tribal</p>
<p>        CHIEF. The Chief and the villagers are AWESTRUCK by Scraggy's words.</p>
<p>        The nervous Chief ORDERS Clare, Betsy and the others UNTIED. Scraggy</p>
<p>        WHISPERS to Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        I tell him we divine messengers of</p>
<p>                        Sun Wu-Kung. If he interfere with</p>
<p>                        our mission... Jade Emperor come</p>
<p>                        down from heavens and destroy his</p>
<p>                        village.</p>

<p>        Indy SMILES. Scraggy TURNS and again SHOUTS to the chief. The chief</p>
<p>        OBEYS Scraggy's every word. He LEADS Indy and Scraggy to another area</p>
<p>        of the village. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        I tell him we lose path to city... I</p>
<p>                        ask if he have something to help us.</p>

<p>        The chief leads Indy and Scraggy into a LARGE GRASS HUT.</p>

<p>        INT. GRASS HUT</p>

<p>        EMPTY, save for an elaborate MARBLE ALTAR. A dull MIRROR rests on the</p>
<p>        altar. The small mirror is surrounded by a crude, STONE FRAME. The</p>
<p>        chief PICKS up the mirror and GIVES it to Scraggy. The chief EXPLAINS.</p>
<p>        Scraggy GIVES the mirror to Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                                (translating)</p>
<p>                        He say this will help us. And since</p>
<p>                        we are divine messengers...we will</p>
<p>                        know how to use it!</p>

<p>        Indiana SMIRKS. He EXAMINES the mirror. Totally CONFUSED by it.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        EXT. MONGOOBOO VILLAGE - DAWN</p>

<p>        The village SLEEPS. QUIET. PEACEFUL. Scraggy's Model-T is PARKED here.</p>
<p>        Several of the crew members and Pirates are SLEEPING in and around the</p>
<p>        car. KEZURE is sprawled on the car's roof. SNORING. It is obvious that</p>
<p>        they have CAMPED here for the evening.</p>

<p>        Suddenly, a SLIGHT TREMOR surges through the village. A soft</p>
<p>        VIBRATION. Cooking utensils RATTLE. Grass huts SHAKE.</p>

<p>        INT. GRASS HUT</p>

<p>        Indiana SLEEPS here. In a HAMMOCK. The vibration WAKES Indy. As he</p>
<p>        moves to climb out of the hammock, a FIGURE LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM!</p>
<p>        BETSY.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Indy. I'm frightened.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        I'm claustrophobic.</p>

<p>        Indiana attempts to PUSH Betsy out of the hammock. She RESISTS. They</p>
<p>        begin to WRESTLE. STRUGGLE. The hammock becomes TANGLED around their</p>
<p>        bodies.</p>

<p>        Clare WALKS BY the hut. She LOOKS inside. To her, it appears that Indy</p>
<p>        and Betsy are in the middle of a PASSIONATE love scene. She emits a</p>
<p>        SHOCKED GASP. Indiana SEES Clare. He CALLS OUT.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Clare!... Wait!...</p>

<p>        But the startled Clare HURRIES AWAY. Indiana manages to ESCAPE Betsy</p>
<p>        and the tangled hammock. He LANDS on the floor. BREATHLESS.</p>

<p>        EXT. VILLAGE</p>

<p>        The vibrating INTENSIFIES. The ground begins to RUMBLE. The</p>
<p>        surrounding trees SHAKE. The villagers POUR out of their huts,</p>
<p>        gathering in the middle of town. FRIGHTENED. Indiana and Betsy JOIN</p>
<p>        Scraggy, Clare, Kezure and the others. Betsy is PUZZLED by the</p>
<p>        tremors.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        An earthquake?</p>

<p>        The Tribal Chief STEPS FORWARD. He says ONE WORD in his language.</p>
<p>        Scraggy TRANSLATES for the others.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Wildebeest.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        A HERD OF STAMPEDING WILDEBEEST</p>

<p>        Hundreds of the RAGING animals plow through the jungle. Moving FAST.</p>
<p>        They CRUSH everything in their path.</p>

<p>        EXT. MONGOOBOO VILLAGE</p>

<p>        The vibrating is LOUDER. HARDER. The villagers PANIC. They RUN AWAY.</p>
<p>        SCATTERING into the jungle. Indiana and his party are CLUSTERED</p>
<p>        together. Clare EXCLAIMS.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        We have to get out... Or we'll be</p>
<p>                        crushed to death.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Scraggy... How close?</p>

<p>        Scraggy puts his EAR to the trembling ground. He LISTENS.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Two miles.</p>

<p>        Indy dashes to the Model-T SUPPLY RACK. He tosses SHOVELS to each of</p>
<p>        the group. He LOOKS around.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Where's the softest ground?...</p>

<p>        Scraggy asks a PASSING VILLAGER. The villager SHOUTS some gibberish</p>
<p>        and continues running. Scraggy POINTS OFF SCREEN. Toward a COMMUNAL</p>
<p>        GRAVEYARD.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        THE WILDEBEEST.</p>

<p>        SNORTING. STOMPING. CARVING a wide path through the thick jungle.</p>
<p>        Small animals RUN for their lives. Bunnies DASH ahead of the herd.</p>
<p>        Monkeys SWING to other trees. The ANGRY Wildebeest continue ahead.</p>

<p>        EXT. VILLAGE</p>

<p>        Indiana and the others stand in the LARGE GRAVEYARD. SHOVELS in hand.</p>
<p>        They have DUG A LARGE HOLE. Pieces of DECAYED BODIES and SKELETONS</p>
<p>        protrude from the surrounding hole. Scraggy STARES at the ghastly</p>
<p>        sight. Eyes WIDE. FEARFUL. He begins to BABBLE. HYSTERICAL.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Oh, no! Many dead spirits! Bad</p>
<p>                        spirits... We must stay away...</p>

<p>        Indy interrupts by PUSHING SCRAGGY INTO THE OPEN GRAVE. Scraggy falls</p>
<p>        into the ARMS OF A SKELETON. He SCREAMS.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        THE HERD OF WILDEBEEST</p>

<p>        BURSTING through a section of jungle. They arrive on the VAST JUNGLE</p>
<p>        PLAIN. Directly ahead of them, several feet in the distance, is the</p>
<p>        MONGOOBOO VILLAGE. The Wildebeest head STRAIGHT for the village.</p>

<p>        EXT. VILLAGE</p>

<p>        DESERTED. NO SIGN of human life. Everything TREMBLES with the force of</p>
<p>        a major earthquake. The wildebeest ARRIVE. DESTROYING the village.</p>
<p>        Grass Huts are FLATTENED. The enormous stone oven COLLAPSES. CRUMBLING</p>
<p>        to pieces. Scraggy's Model-T is OVERTURNED.</p>

<p>        With nothing left standing, the wildebeest MOVE ON. The village has</p>
<p>        been completely DEVASTATED. Surrounded with a heavy CLOUD OF DUST.</p>
<p>        CAMERA PANS TO THE GRAVEYARD. Grave markers and tombstones lie BROKEN</p>
<p>        and CRUSHED. Countless HOOFPRINTS cover the flat ground. The dust</p>
<p>        begins to SETTLE. The graveyard ground suddenly BUCKLES. MOVING. A</p>
<p>        HAND shoots out. Indiana CLIMBS OUT of the dirt. He is FOLLOWED by the</p>
<p>        others, who also CLIMB OUT from underground. Everyone is UNHURT. SAFE.</p>
<p>        PROTECTED by the ground above. A skeleton has ATTACHED itself to</p>
<p>        Betsy. REFUSING to let go.</p>

<p>        Scraggy, Indy and a few of the men RUN to the overturned Model-T Taxi.</p>
<p>        They GRAB hold of the car and TURN it back upright.</p>

<p>        Clare LOOKS at the devastated village. Betsy stands beside her,</p>
<p>        STRUGGLING TO ESCAPE from the clutches of the skeleton. Clare looks</p>
<p>        into the DISTANCE. Watching the DEPARTING Wildebeest. She is TROUBLED.</p>
<p>        WORRIED.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        That's odd... Wildebeests will not</p>
<p>                        stampede unless provoked...</p>

<p>        Suddenly, the same LOW, RUMBLING SOUND from earlier, ECHOES through</p>
<p>        the area. But this time it is LOUD. Nearly DEAFENING. Scraggy LOOKS at</p>
<p>        Indy.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        This time, it is very close, Indy.</p>
<p>                        Very close!</p>

<p>        At that moment, directly behind Scraggy and Indy, the jungle ERUPTS!</p>
<p>        The trees SEPARATE. CRASHING to the ground. Making way for some GIANT</p>
<p>        BEHEMOTH. Scraggy and the others LEAP IN ONE DIRECTION. Indiana LEAPS</p>
<p>        IN ANOTHER.</p>

<p>        A GIANT TANK</p>

<p>        SHOOTS out of the jungle. A METAL MONSTROSITY. ONE of a kind. The tank</p>
<p>        is over TEN TIMES the size of a normal tank. Nearly 100 FEET LONG.</p>
<p>        Over 25 FEET HIGH. It is equipped with THREE LEVELS. On the TOP LEVEL,</p>
<p>        is the tank's swivelling GUN BARREL. ENORMOUS. The size of a CANNON.</p>
<p>        Two giant, BLAZING RED SWASTIKAS adorn both sides of the tank's SECOND</p>
<p>        LEVEL.</p>

<p>        The tank RUNS OVER Scraggy's Model-T. The car is FLATTENED. A THICK</p>
<p>        CLOUD OF DUST erupts from the ground.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        GUTTERBUHG is here. He views the outside action through a PERISCOPE.</p>
<p>        TWO NAZI GUNNERS are behind him. WAITING for orders to shoot. TYKI</p>
<p>        sits in the background. The confused pygmy is BOUND and GAGGED.</p>

<p>        OUTSIDE</p>

<p>        Scraggy, Clare, Betsy, Kezure and the others DASH across the plains.</p>
<p>        RUNNING AWAY from the pursuing tank. But Indiana is NOT with them.</p>
<p>        Scraggy, UNABLE TO SEE through the dust, calls out.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Indy?... Indy?...</p>

<p>        Indiana is SEVERAL FEET AWAY. On the GROUND. ALONE. LOST in the thick</p>
<p>        of DUST. Suddenly, a DARK FIGURE appears. TOWERING over Indiana. The</p>
<p>        dust begins to CLEAR. Revealing a protruding WHITE HORN. More dust</p>
<p>        CLEARS. We see that the figure is a large, BLACK RHINOCEROS! Indy</p>
<p>        LEAPS to his feet. The rhino SNORTS. Indy turns to RUN. The rhino</p>
<p>        CHASES him!</p>

<p>        Meanwhile, with most of the dust CLEARED, the TANK CHASES INDY'S</p>
<p>        FRIENDS ACROSS THE JUNGLE PLAINS.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg LOOKS into the periscope. Indy's friends are in his SIGHTS.</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg SCREAMS to the gunners.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUHG</p>
<p>                                (German; English</p>
<p>                                subtitles)</p>
<p>                        Fire!</p>

<p>        OUTSIDE</p>

<p>        The tank's large barrel FIRES A SHOT at the running group. The blast</p>
<p>        FLIES OVER THEIR HEADS. JUST MISSING everyone. It BLASTS a row of palm</p>
<p>        trees to smithereens.</p>

<p>        INDIANA is still running from the rampaging rhino. Indy begins to RUN</p>
<p>        IN A CIRCLE. The angry rhino FOLLOWS him. The circle begins to</p>
<p>        TIGHTEN... Becoming SMALLER... SMALLER... Until Indy is nearly running</p>
<p>        ALONGSIDE of the rhino. At the exact moment, Indy GRABS HOLD of the</p>
<p>        rhino. He LEAPS onto the beast. With a bit of careful maneuvering,</p>
<p>        Indiana is RIDING THE RHINOCEROS!</p>

<p>        Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others CONTINUE TO RUN. The tank</p>
<p>        is right BEHIND THEM. MOVING FAST. In HOT PURSUIT. The tank FIRES</p>
<p>        ANOTHER SHOT! It SPLATTERS the ground. BESIDE the group. Again, JUST</p>
<p>        MISSING everyone. The group TURNS. RUNNING in ANOTHER DIRECTION. The</p>
<p>        tank FOLLOWS.</p>

<p>        Indiana continues to ride the WILD, BUCKING rhino. He has NO CONTROL</p>
<p>        over the beast. The rhino spots SOMETHING. The TANK. From this angle,</p>
<p>        the tank, with its large protruding gun barrel, resembles a GIANT</p>
<p>        RHINOCEROS. Seeing this, the rhino turns and RUNS TOWARD the tank.</p>
<p>        HEAD ON. Indy holds TIGHTLY.</p>

<p>        Scraggy and the others PAUSE. They see the tank BEHIND THEM. They see</p>
<p>        the rhino AHEAD of them. The group makes QUICK TURN. To the RIGHT.</p>
<p>        They run toward a RAVINE.</p>

<p>        The tank is headed STRAIGHT for Indy and the rhino. Both moving at</p>
<p>        FULL SPEED.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Through the periscope, Gutterbuhg SEES Indy and the rhino.</p>

<p>        INDIANA</p>

<p>        continues to RIDE the uncontrollable rhino. They are within THIRTY</p>
<p>        FEET of the oncoming tank.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg SCREAMS in German, ordering the Nazi Gunner to "Fire".</p>

<p>        EXT. PLAINS</p>

<p>        The tank FIRES. The blast is LOW. The ground in front of Indy and the</p>
<p>        rhino EXPLODES. A cloud of dust ERUPTS.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg LOOKS through the periscope. His view is BLOCKED by dust.</p>

<p>        EXT. PLAINS</p>

<p>        The tank is UPON Indy and the rhino. The rhino SCREECHES to a stop.</p>
<p>        FRIGHTENED by the blast. Indiana LEAPS ONTO THE TANK. GRIPPING the</p>
<p>        front section. HOLDING ON for dear life. Moments before he is crushed</p>
<p>        beneath the tank's giant treads, the RHINO TURNS and RUNS OFF.</p>

<p>        Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others, have arrived at the foot</p>
<p>        of a tall, several branched TREE. Located at the side of the RAVINE.</p>
<p>        Over the ravine's edge, is a SEVERAL HUNDRED FOOT DROP onto jagged</p>
<p>        rocks. Scraggy begins to CLIMB the tree.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Safest place from bad spirits...is</p>
<p>                        in branches of tree.</p>

<p>        The others SHRUG. They have NO CHOICE but to FOLLOW Scraggy up into</p>
<p>        the branches of the tree.</p>

<p>        Indiana CLIMBS along the side of the monstrous tank. He searches for a</p>
<p>        PASSAGEWAY inside of the tank.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        The Nazis are UNAWARE of Indy's presense on the tank. Gutterbuhg</p>
<p>        CONTINUES to look through the periscope. The dust begins to CLEAR. He</p>
<p>        FOCUSES his sights on Indy's friends. LOCATED several feet away. They</p>
<p>        CLIMB into the TREE. Gutterbuhg SMILES.</p>

<p>        EXT. TANK</p>

<p>        Indy CANNOT FIND a passageway into the tank. He SEES the GUN BARREL.</p>
<p>        OVERHEAD. It SWIVELS. AIMING toward the tree filled with Indy's</p>
<p>        friends. Indy GRABS one of the tank's LARGE HEADLIGHTS. He PULLS HARD.</p>
<p>        SNAPPING OFF the headlight. Indy LEAPS upward. He quickly STUFFS the</p>
<p>        headlight inside of the barrel opening.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        The tree of Indy's friends are in Gutterbuhg's SIGHTS. A PERFECT SHOT.</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg SCREAMS in German, ordering the Nazi gunners to SHOOT. They</p>
<p>        FIRE. But the barrel BACKFIRES! EXPLODING in the face of the two Nazi</p>
<p>        gunners. It sends them FLYING against the wall. OUT COLD. The cabin</p>
<p>        fills with SMOKE. Only Gutterbuhg and Tyki REMAIN. A FURIOUS</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg PICKS up the radio. He SCREAMS into the microphone.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUHG</p>
<p>                                (German; English</p>
<p>                                subtitles)</p>
<p>                        Send help! We need assistance!</p>

<p>        Tyki HELPLESSLY watches in the background. Gutterbuhg LOOKS into the</p>
<p>        periscope. He SEES Indiana. ON the tank. Gutterbuhg hits a RED BUTTON.</p>
<p>        On the CONTROL PANEL.</p>

<p>        EXT. TANK</p>

<p>        COUNTLESS ROWS OF MACHINE GUNS eject from secret slots. All AROUND the</p>
<p>        tank's FIRST LEVEL. The machine guns begin to FIRE. RAPIDLY. WILDLY.</p>
<p>        Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the guns. He CLIMBS to the SECOND LEVEL. But</p>
<p>        the large SWASTIKAS begin to move. OPENING. They are actually HIDDEN</p>
<p>        DOORS. SECRET COMPARTMENTS. Several NAZI SOLDIERS exit the</p>
<p>        compartments. They COME FOR Indiana. He FIGHTS the onslaught of</p>
<p>        soldiers. PUNCHING. WRESTLING.</p>

<p>        The tank, without a driver, begins to wildly SPIN. Going in CIRCLES.</p>

<p>        From the tree, SCRAGGY sees Indy's dillemma. He SHOUTS to the others.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Indy in trouble! We must help!</p>

<p>        Scraggy begins to CLIMB OUT of the tree. A GUN suddenly MOVES INTO</p>
<p>        FRAME. POINTED at Scraggy's head. Scraggy TURNS. One of his CREW</p>
<p>        MEMBERS holds the gun.</p>

<p>                                        CREW MEMBER</p>
<p>                                (German accent)</p>
<p>                        Don't move.</p>
<p>                                (to the others)</p>
<p>                        All of you. Stay where you are.</p>

<p>        Scraggy and the others FREEZE. Clare makes a REALIZATION. She GLARES</p>
<p>        at the Crew Member.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        It was you. You're the reason the</p>
<p>                        Nazis found us.</p>

<p>        The crew member gives an evil SMILE.</p>

<p>        Indiana continues to FIGHT the Nazis, along the SECOND LEVEL of the</p>
<p>        frenzied tank. Indy has DEFEATED most of the soldiers. Only TWO NAZIS</p>
<p>        remain. They OVERCOME Indy. They push him DOWNWARD. Toward the tank's</p>
<p>        FIRST LEVEL. Toward the rows of FIRING MACHINE GUNS. Indiana STRUGGLES</p>
<p>        to break free. But the powerful Nazis push him CLOSER...CLOSER...to</p>
<p>        the machine guns.</p>

<p>        In the TREE, the crew member keeps his pistol AIMED at Scraggy's head.</p>
<p>        CAMERA PANS UPWARD. Kezure is PERCHED on the top branch. ABOVE</p>
<p>        Scraggy. At the right moment, Kezure LEAPS DOWN. ON TOP of the</p>
<p>        treacherous crew member. Kezure KNOCKS the gun from the crew member's</p>
<p>        hand. BLAM! The gun GOES OFF. A stray bullet STRIKES the tree trunk.</p>
<p>        Kezure PUNCHES the crew member, who LOSES HIS BALANCE and FALLS from</p>
<p>        the tree. Going OVER THE EDGE of the ravine. His body DROPS hundreds</p>
<p>        of feet. CRASHING to the rocks below.</p>

<p>        Kezure SMILES. VICTORIOUS. But the tree suddenly CREAKS. GROANS. A</p>
<p>        CRACK has formed around the trunk, where the bullet STRUCK. The tree</p>
<p>        begins to TILT. Slowly TEETERING over the ravine's edge. Everyone</p>
<p>        PANICS. Betsy SHOUTS.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Nobody move. Or we'll go over.</p>

<p>        Everyone FREEZES. Scared to DEATH. They TIGHTLY GRIP their branches.</p>
<p>        The tree SWAYS. SLOWLY.</p>

<p>        Indiana still FIGHTS the two Nazis. STRUGGLING to keep his body from</p>
<p>        the tank's deadly machine guns. Indy FLIPS one of the Nazis over his</p>
<p>        head. The Nazi falls DIRECTLY IN FRONT of an entire row of machine</p>
<p>        guns. His body does a GROTESQUE DANCE OF DEATH. RIDDLED with bullets.</p>

<p>        Indiana and the other Nazi exchange PUNCHES. Their bodies TUMBLE over</p>
<p>        the rear of the tank. They fall onto a SMALL LEDGE. Above the</p>
<p>        enormous, rotating TANK TREADS. Indy and the Nazi battle to push the</p>
<p>        other OFF THE LEDGE. Indiana PREVAILS. He pushes the Nazi ON TOP of</p>
<p>        the giant treads. The Nazi tries to CLIMB BACK...but his body is</p>
<p>        DRAGGED BENEATH THE TANK. CRUSHED.</p>

<p>        Indiana turns, seeing Gutterbuhg climb out of a SECRET HATCH. On the</p>
<p>        tank's TOP LEVEL. Gutterbuhg POINTS HIS FINGER at Indy. It rapidly</p>
<p>        FIRES BULLETS. Indy DODGES around the side of the tank. Bullets BOUNCE</p>
<p>        off the metal beside him.</p>

<p>        Meanwhile, Indy's friends sit BREATHLESSLY on the swaying tree.</p>
<p>        Everyone is SILENT. STILL. Kezure suddenly SNEEZES. The tree CREAKS.</p>
<p>        It WAVERS over the ravine's edge. Nearly GOING OVER. But it DOESN'T.</p>
<p>        Everyone CATCHES THEIR BREATH. The tree continues to TEETER.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg PURSUES Indiana. Playing CAT AND MOUSE along the top level</p>
<p>        of the tank. Indiana PEERS around a corner. Seeing Gutterbuhg AHEAD.</p>
<p>        Indy grabs hold of the large ROTATING GUN BARREL. Indy LIFTS his feet.</p>
<p>        He SWINGS FORWAFD. RIDING the gun barrel. He SPINS around the tank's</p>
<p>        side and comes up BEHIND the unsuspecting Gutterbuhg. Indy JUMPS the</p>
<p>        Nazi. They begin to FIGHT. Gutterbuhg tries to move his Mechanical arm</p>
<p>        INTO POSITION. To SHOOT Indy.</p>

<p>        The tank continues to LOSE CONTROL. It no longer SPINS in CIRCLES. It</p>
<p>        is headed STRAIGHT TOWARD the tree filled with Indy's friends.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Tyki SITS inside. WATCHING through the periscope. HELPLESS.</p>

<p>        EXT. PLAINS</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg and Indiana continue to FIGHT. Suddenly, there is a BUZZING</p>
<p>        SOUND. An AIRPLANE ENGINE. Indiana LOOKS TO THE SKY. A NAZI BIPLANE</p>
<p>        FLIES TOWARD HIM. The biplane DIVES. Moving LOWER. LOWER. Gutterbuhg</p>
<p>        ROLLS OUT OF THE WAY. Indy is TRAPPED. A SITTING DUCK. The biplane</p>
<p>        SWOOPS DOWN. Trying to HIT Indy. He DIVES onto the tank top. Lying</p>
<p>        FLAT. The plane flies DIRECTLY OVER Indy. JUST MISSING him by a FEW</p>
<p>        FEET.</p>

<p>        Meanwhile, the tank still DRIVES DIRECTLY TOWARD the swaying tree and</p>
<p>        ravine. Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others remain FROZEN.</p>
<p>        STILL. WATCHING the tank come for them. They are FRIGHTENED. HELPLESS.</p>

<p>        Indy and Gutterbuhg have RESUMED their fighting. STANDING on the</p>
<p>        tank's top. The biplane LOOPS in the air. Coming back for ANOTHER</p>
<p>        SHOT. Gutterbuhg LEAPS out of its path. The plane HEADS STRAIGHT for</p>
<p>        Indy. He again DIVES to the tank's top. The biplane SWOOPS DOWN. This</p>
<p>        time AIMING LOWER. As it PASSES Indy, its wheels GRAZE his back. Indy</p>
<p>        CRIES OUT.</p>

<p>        The tank continues to SPEED TOWD the tree of trapped people. Getting</p>
<p>        CLOSER...CLOSER...</p>

<p>        His back ACHING, Indy struggles to keep Gutterbuhg's machine gun arm</p>
<p>        from shooting him. The biplane does another midair LOOP. It TURNS and</p>
<p>        HEADS straight for Indy. This time, the plane WON'T MISS. As the</p>
<p>        biplane gets CLOSE... Indy grabs a tight HOLD of Gutterbuhg's</p>
<p>        Mechanical arm. Indy RAISES the arm. AIMING at the biplane. Indy pulls</p>
<p>        the arm's TRIGGER. FIRING a round of shots. The rapid bullets STRIKE</p>
<p>        the plane's belly. The biplane LOSES CONTROL. Its engine COUGHS. DIES.</p>
<p>        The biplane SPINS. Flipping into a NOSEDIVE. Leaving a trail of BLACK</p>
<p>        SMOKE. The biplane HITS the ground. A FLAMING CRASH! SEVERAL FEET from</p>
<p>        the tank.</p>

<p>        Indiana OVERPOWERS Gutterbuhg. With TWO HARD PUNCHES, Indy FLOORS the</p>
<p>        Nazi. Gutterbuhg lies SPRAWLED on the tank's top. UNCONSCIOUS. Indy</p>
<p>        TURNS. He sees that the speeding tank is going to CRASH into the</p>
<p>        treefull of his friends. Indiana LEAPS into the open tank compartment.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Indiana TAKES the controls. But they are completely ALIEN to him. He</p>
<p>        hears a SQUEAL. TYKI. Behind HIM. Tyki motions to a SPECIFIC CONTROL.</p>
<p>        Indy GRABS HOLD of it.</p>

<p>        EXT. PLAINS</p>

<p>        The tank SCREECHES. SPINNING TO A STOP. INCHES from the swaying tree.</p>
<p>        Scraggy, Clare, Betsy, Kezure and the others, emit a UNIFIED SIGH OF</p>
<p>        RELIEF. But the tree suddenly CRACKS. It TILTS. FALLING OVER THE</p>
<p>        RAVINE EDGE! Everyone SCREAMS!</p>

<p>        There is the sudden CRACK OF A WHIP! The whip WRAPS ITSELF around the</p>
<p>        trunk of the tree. Indiana HOLDS the opposite end. He PULLS with all</p>
<p>        of his strength. HOLDING the tree in place. He PREVENTS the tree from</p>
<p>        FALLING into the ravine. Indy SHOUTS to his friends. Through GRITTED</p>
<p>        TEETH.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Jump!... Jump!...</p>

<p>        Everyone begins to LEAP from the tree. To the GROUND. Indy CONTINUES</p>
<p>        to hold the tree in place. Muscles BULGING. Sweat POURING. Veins</p>
<p>        POPPING. Soon, everyone is back on the GROUND. SAFE. Indy RETRIEVES</p>
<p>        his whip. The tree TILTS. FALLING over the ravine edge. The tree</p>
<p>        CRASHES to the rocks below. SPLINTERING into a million pieces.</p>

<p>        On the top level of the tank, Gutterbuhg STIRS. WAKES. But Indiana is</p>
<p>        UPON HIM. Using a rope, Indy TIES UP Gutterbuhg. He removes the AMMO</p>
<p>        CARTRIDGE from the Nazi's mechanical arm. EMPTYING the bullets onto</p>
<p>        the ground. Indiana PUSHES Gutterbuhg INSIDE THE TANK.</p>

<p>        Tyki CRAWLS out of the tank. He SEES Clare. TEARS of happiness fill</p>
<p>        his eyes. He RUNS to Clare. The two exchange a WARM EMBRACE. Tyki SEES</p>
<p>        Scraggy. They shake hands and begin an EXCITED CONVERSATION. Like two</p>
<p>        OLD FRIENDS.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Indy grabs the RADIO MICROPHONE. He HOLDS it in front of Gutterbuhg.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Call your mommy.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg GROWLS. He SPEAKS German into the microphone. The voice of</p>
<p>        LIEUT. MEPHISTO answers. Echoing over the SPEAKERS. Indy GRABS the</p>
<p>        microphone. INTERRUPTING.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        This is Jones. I've got your tank.</p>
<p>                                (pause)</p>
<p>                        It's all over, pal. You lose.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        CLOSE-UP: LIEUT. MEPHISTO</p>

<p>        He is ANGRY. UPSET. But he FORCES himself to CALMLY address Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        MEPHISTO</p>
<p>                        Doctor Jones... You surprise me. For</p>
<p>                        a supposedly intelligent man...you</p>
<p>                        jump to childish conclusions.</p>
<p>                        Remember... You are driving our</p>
<p>                        tank. We can FOLLOW you anywhere.</p>
<p>                                (vehement)</p>
<p>                        You are far from defeating us, my</p>
<p>                        friend. The battle has only just</p>
<p>                        begun.</p>

<p>        CAMERA PULLS BACK. Mephisto is standing beside a long ROW OF TENTS.</p>
<p>        Housing many TROOPS. Several JEEPS are parked in the background. All</p>
<p>        mounted with RECOILEST CANNONS. 5 CANVAS TRUCKS are also here. Filled</p>
<p>        with more TROOPS, CANNONS and AMMUNITION. The Nazis have assembled an</p>
<p>        ENTIRE ARMY!</p>

<p>        INDIANA</p>

<p>        DROPS the microphone. Suddenly WORRIED. He HURRIES out of the tank.</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg stays BEHIND. LAUGHING.</p>

<p>        EXT. PLAINS</p>

<p>        Indiana HURRIES to Tyki and the others. Indy shoots an IMPATIENT</p>
<p>        glance to Scraggy.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        We've got to move. Fast.</p>
<p>                                (points to Tyki)</p>
<p>                        Ask him if he knows the way to the</p>
<p>                        City from here.</p>

<p>        Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The pygmy ANSWERS, pointing OFF SCREEN. Scraggy</p>
<p>        TRANSLATES for Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        He do not know exact place... But it</p>
<p>                        is somewhere over there.</p>

<p>        Indy TURNs to the direction where Scraggy points. Several miles away,</p>
<p>        we see COUNTLESS ROWS OF MOUNTAINS. Thick layers of CLOUDS surround</p>
<p>        the mountains. Indiana SIGHS.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        A lotta' good that does us... It</p>
<p>                        could take us months...years...to</p>
<p>                        search everyone of those.</p>

<p>        Betsy has an IDEA. She removes the STONE MIRROR from Indiana's pocket.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Maybe he knows what to do with</p>
<p>                        this...</p>

<p>        Betsy GIVES the mirror to Tyki. His eyes WIDEN. In AWE. Tyki</p>
<p>        RECOGNIZES the mirror. He excitedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who</p>
<p>        TRANSLATES for Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        It is "Magical Mirror of Sun Wu</p>
<p>                        Kung"...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        But whattayou do with it?</p>

<p>        Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The energetic pygmy PLACES the mirror against an</p>
<p>        upright stone. Tyki ADJUSTS the mirror, until it FACES the distant</p>
<p>        mountains. Tyki emits a high pitched GIGGLE. POINTING to the mirror.</p>
<p>        Everyone GATHERS around the mirror. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS.</p>

<p>        The mirror reflects the CLOUDS above the mountains. But above one</p>
<p>        SPECIFIC MOUNTAIN, we see the image of a CITY REFLECTED ON THE CLOUDS!</p>

<p>        Indiana TURNS away from the mirror, looking at the SPECIFIC MOONTAIN.</p>
<p>        But the city is ONLY REFLECTED IN THE MAGICAL MIRROR! Clare SMILES at</p>
<p>        Indy, quoting Tyki from earlier.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        "I come from Land Of City On</p>
<p>                        Clouds".</p>

<p>        Indiana NODS. HOPEFUL. ANXIOUS. He looks back to the magical</p>
<p>        REFLECTION.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        THE TANK</p>

<p>        travelling a NARROW PATH. Along the side of a STEEP MOUNTAIN. The tank</p>
<p>        moves UPWARD. Toward the mountain TOP. The tank JERKS. WOBBLES. It's</p>
<p>        as if the driver were having TROUBLE with the controls.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Indiana DRIVES. UNFAMILIAR with the controls. The tank is CROWDED with</p>
<p>        everyone. Betsy and Clare sit BESIDE Indy. Gutterbuhg is DIRECTLY</p>
<p>        BEHIND HIM. Kezure TEACHES a game to Scraggy. Tyki, the Pirates and</p>
<p>        the various crew members WATCH. The game appears to be a BIZARRE</p>
<p>        VERSION of chess. Only the tokens are DRIED INSECTS and LIZARDS.</p>
<p>        Kezure EXPLAINS.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        This is called "Taskipi". Only the</p>
<p>                        bravest play.</p>

<p>        Upon hearing this, Scraggy is even MORE EXCITED TO PLAY. The game</p>
<p>        BEGINS.</p>

<p>        Indiana is becoming extremely FRUSTRATED by the tank controls. Betsy</p>
<p>        gives a SERIOUS LOOK to him.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        I've been talking to Dr. Clarke</p>
<p>                        about our problem.</p>

<p>                        Problem?... Hey... What're you two</p>
<p>                        doin' talkin' behind my back?...</p>

<p>                        Betsy needed help. I obliged.</p>

<p>                        Since when did you become the female</p>
<p>                        Sigmund Freud?</p>

<p>        Indy ROLLS HIS EYES. Meanwhile, Kezure has TAKEN all of Scraggy's</p>
<p>        tokens. He's obviously WON the game. A carefree Scraggy THROWS up his</p>
<p>        hands.</p>

<p>                        choose a souvenir.</p>
<p>                                (removes a knife)</p>
<p>                        A part of your body. Any part I</p>
<p>                        wish.</p>

<p>        Scraggy GULPS. Kezure PAUSES. RUBBING his jaw. THINKING. Meanwhile,</p>
<p>        Betsy EXPLAINS to Indians.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Dr. Clarke says that you're not</p>
<p>                        really in love with me. You're just</p>
<p>                        trying to prove that you can still</p>
<p>                        attract younger women. You're</p>
<p>                        terrified of getting old.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        That's crazy.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        That's what I told her. I told her</p>
<p>                        that you really did love me.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (fumbling)</p>
<p>                        Well...that's...ah...well...</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                                (worried)</p>
<p>                        You mean... She was right?...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        No... I mean Yes... I mean...</p>

<p>        Indy TURNS, seeing Clare GLARING at him. Indy SIGHS. PAUSES. He gives</p>
<p>        Betsy a TENDER, HONEST look.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        No, Betsy. I don't love you.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                                (tears fill her eyes)</p>
<p>                        That's the first time you ever said</p>
<p>                        it!</p>

<p>        Betsy begins CRYING. Into Clare's ARMS. Indiana SHAKES his head. Clare</p>
<p>        COMFORTS Betsy.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        There. There. He's a very disturbed</p>
<p>                        man.</p>

<p>        Indiana SIGHS. He TURNS. FACE to FACE with a GRINNING and NODDING</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg.</p>

<p>        Kezure has made his DECISION. Scraggy WAITS. TERRIFIED. Kezure RAISES</p>
<p>        his knife. TOWARD Scraggy's face.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        Your eyes. They are a striking deep</p>
<p>                        blue.</p>

<p>        Scraggy COVERS his face. Kezure ATTACKS him. Trying to CUT OUT</p>
<p>        Scraggy's eyes. A FIGHT begins. The crew members VS. the Pirates.</p>
<p>        Indiana TURNS, away from the controls. He BREAKS UP the fight.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (angry)</p>
<p>                        Enough. We're in this together. If</p>
<p>                        we start fighting among ourselves...</p>
<p>                        we'll never get out alive.</p>

<p>        The men CALM DOWN. CATCHING their breath. Kezure PUTS AWAY his knife.</p>
<p>        He GLARES at Scraggy.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        You owe me, old man.</p>

<p>        EXT. MOUNTAIN</p>

<p>        The tank, without a driver, begins to SWERVE OFF THE MOUNTAIN ROAD.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Clare NOTICES the tank going over the mountain. She SCREAMS.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Doctor Jones!!!</p>

<p>        Indy TURNS. LEAPING back to the controls. He hurriedly STEERS the tank</p>
<p>        back onto the mountain path. Saving it at the LAST MOMENT. Everyone</p>
<p>        CATCHES their breath. Indiana STEPS on the gas, continuing AHEAD.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        EXT. MOUNTAIN - A FEW HOURS LATER</p>

<p>        The tank has nearly made it to the TOP of the mountain. Trekking</p>
<p>        through a NARROW, ROCKY RAVINE. The tank rolls to a STOP. The top</p>
<p>        hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indiana, Scraggy and Tyki POP OUT. Tyki suddenly</p>
<p>        points to the MOUNTAIN TOP, which is cloaked in thick LAYERS OF</p>
<p>        CLOUDS. Tyki's eyes fill with JOYOUS TEARS. He begins to SHOUT. His</p>
<p>        voice SQUEALS with EXCITEMENT. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indy.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        He say that two miles ahead...we</p>
<p>                        will find his home.</p>

<p>        Indiana SMILES. EXCITED by the prospects. TOUCHED by Tyki's reaction.</p>
<p>        Indy looks to the FOOT of the mountain. Several miles BELOW.</p>

<p>        THE NAZI FORCES</p>

<p>        have ARRIVED! They are still at least TWO HOURS from reaching Indiana</p>
<p>        and the others. The massive army MOVES FAST. They begin to DRIVE along</p>
<p>        the mountain path. FOLLOWING Indiana. In HOT PURSUIT.</p>

<p>        Indy PAUSES. WORRIED. THINKING. He LOOKS at the surrounding ROCKY</p>
<p>        WALLS, then to the tank's enormous GUN BARREL. An IDEA. He HURRIES</p>
<p>        back inside of the tank. Scraggy and Tyki FOLLOW. CLOSING the hatch</p>
<p>        above them.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Indy LOOKS at the tank's control panel. A PUZZLEMENT. He LOOKS at</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        How do I work the big gun?</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg SMILES. He REFUSES to answer. Indy has NO TIME for games.</p>
<p>        He LOOKS at Kezure.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Want your souvenir?</p>
<p>                                (grabs Gutterbuhg's left</p>
<p>                                arm)</p>
<p>                        Start with his good arm.</p>

<p>        Kezure SMILES and removes his LONG KNIFE. He moves it Gutterbuhg's</p>
<p>        NECK. The snivelling Nazi CRIES OUT.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUHG</p>
<p>                        W-W-Wait!... Please!...</p>

<p>        Indy NODS to Kezure. The Pirate King moves his KNIFE. Gutterbuhg</p>
<p>        hurriedly POINTS to two switches on the control panel.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUHG</p>
<p>                        There. That is what you want.</p>

<p>        Indy NODS. He TURNS to the switches.</p>

<p>        EXT. RAVINE</p>

<p>        CLOSE-UP: The tank's large gun barrel SWIVELS. Pointing UPWARD. To the</p>
<p>        ROCKS above. The gun FIRES A SHOT. It swivels a FEW FEET. Then FIRES</p>
<p>        ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. A RUMBLING SOUND echoes through the area.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Indy HITS the gas.</p>

<p>        EXT. RAVINE</p>

<p>        The tank SHOOTS forward. SPEEDING ahead. An AVALANCHE BEGINS! JUST</p>
<p>        MISSING the tank. Several pounds of ROCKS and DEBRIS fall from above.</p>
<p>        The rocks create A THICK WALL. BLOCKING the mountain path.</p>

<p>        The tank CONTINUES along the twisting, narrow mountain path. Moving</p>
<p>        further and further UPWARD. The tank DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK CLOUDS</p>
<p>        that surround the mountain.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Indiana LOOKS through the persiscope. His view BLINDED by the clouds.</p>

<p>        EXT. MOUNTAIN</p>

<p>        The tank is a LARGE, GREY BLUR through the clouds. Several DARK,</p>
<p>        BULKING FIGURES APPEAR! They CLIMB along the ravine sides and tops.</p>
<p>        The mysterious figures SURROUND the tank. All are holding ENORMOUS</p>
<p>        BOULDERS over their heads. AIMED at the tank.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Indy EASES up on the gas. The tank SLOWS. Suddenly, there is a LOUD</p>
<p>        CRASH! The tank is HIT. RATTLING. SHAKING. Everyone is TOSSED. Save</p>
<p>        for Indy, who STAYS at the controls. He continues to GUIDE the tank</p>
<p>        FORWARD. There is another CRASH. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.</p>

<p>        EXT. MOUNTAIN</p>

<p>        The dark figures SHOWER the tank with heavy boulders. The tank's gun</p>
<p>        barrel SNAPS IN TWO. Headlights SMASH. Its body becomes DENTED.</p>
<p>        CRACKED.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Indiana is TOUGH. PERSISTENT. He continues to move the jolting tank</p>
<p>        FORWARD. As the surrounding walls CAVE IN. SHATTER. Everyone PANICS.</p>
<p>        SCREAMING.</p>

<p>        EXT. MOUNTAIN</p>

<p>        The injured, wobbling tank moves OUT OF THE CLOUDS. Arriving around</p>
<p>        the corner from the MOUNTAIN TOP. The countless dark figures continue</p>
<p>        to FOLLOW the tank. SCURRYING along the ravine sides and tops. The</p>
<p>        figures EMERGE from the clouds. For the first time, they are VISIBLE.</p>
<p>        And we see that the figures are TALL... HAIRY... MUSCULAR... GORILLAS!</p>
<p>        They CONTINUE to assault the tank with boulders.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Indiana still attempts to move the tank FORWARD. But the engine begins</p>
<p>        to COUGH. SPUTTER. And DIES.</p>

<p>        EXT. MOUNTAIN</p>

<p>        The tank COMES TO A SUDDEN STOP. One of the Gorillas emits a BIGS</p>
<p>        PITCHED SHRIEK. COMMUNICATING with the others. The others PAUSE. They</p>
<p>        STOP the attack. The Gorillas APPROACH the tank. SLOWLY. CAUTIOUSLY.</p>
<p>        The apes REACH OUT. TOUCHING the tank's wrecked body. A few of the</p>
<p>        apes begin to CLIMB onto the tank.</p>

<p>        The tank's top hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indy's HEAD pops out. TWO HAIRY ARMS</p>
<p>        REACH INTO FRAME AND GRAB INDIANA! An enormous Gorilla pulls Indy OUT</p>
<p>        OF THE HATCH! The ape TOSSES INDY OFF SCREEN!</p>

<p>        Indiana FLIES INTO THE AIR! He LANDS IN THE ARMS of another Gorilla.</p>
<p>        The ape TAKES Indy's WHIP and THROWS him to another Gorilla, who takes</p>
<p>        Indy's HAT. The Gorilla TOSSES Indy to another ape, who tears off</p>
<p>        Indy's LEATHER JACKET. The helpless Indy is THROWN to yet another</p>
<p>        Gorilla. The angry ape RAISES Indy over his head. The Gorilla prepares</p>
<p>        to THROW INDIANA OFF OF THE MOUNTAIN'S EDGE!</p>

<p>        Tyki's VOICE ERUPTS FROM OFF SCREEN. The Gorilla PAUSES, suspending</p>
<p>        Indiana HIGH IN THE AIR. The Gorilla TURNS to Tyki. The pygmy STANDS</p>
<p>        on the tank. He SHOUTS AN ORDER to the Gorilla. The ape NODS.</p>
<p>        UNDERSTANDING. He KNOWS Tyki. The Gorilla gently PLACES Indy back on</p>
<p>        the ground. Indiana ADJUSTS what remains of his clothing. He turns,</p>
<p>        seeing A GROUP OF GORILLAS. HUDDLED together. The Gorillas SEPARATE.</p>
<p>        They have DRESSED one of the apes in INDIANA'S HAT, LEATHER JACKET AND</p>
<p>        WHIP! The ape begins to SNAP THE WHIP, almost as if he were IMITATING</p>
<p>        Indy.</p>

<p>        Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the others have CLIMBED OUT of the tank.</p>
<p>        Upon seeing the Gorilla DRESSED as Indy, they BURST INTO LAUGHTER. A</p>
<p>        very ANGRY Indiana growls at Tyki.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (pointing to Gorilla)</p>
<p>                        Tell him to take off my stuff!</p>

<p>        Through laughter, Scraggy TRANSLATES for Tyki. The pygmy SHOUTS an</p>
<p>        order to the Gorilla. The ape REMOVES the hat and leather jacket,</p>
<p>        RELUCTANTLY giving them back to a grumbling Indiana.</p>

<p>        Tyki continues to SHOOT orders to the other Gorillas. The pygmy</p>
<p>        suddenly appears STRONG. AUTHORITATIVE. He obviously has POWER over</p>
<p>        the beasts. The Gorillas GATHER together. They MOVE TOWARD the people.</p>
<p>        The apes GENTLY take the hands of the various humans. It is a WARM,</p>
<p>        ENCHANTING sight, as the friendly Gorillas LEAD the humans forward.</p>
<p>        Clare, using her Gorilla MOTIONS and SOUNDS, communicates with the</p>
<p>        beasts. The group moves AROUND A TWISTING CORNER OF THE PATH. Toward</p>
<p>        the MOUNTAIN TOP.</p>

<p>        AROUND THE CORNER</p>

<p>        Indiana and the others are met with an AWESOME SIGHT! Indy STOPS. His</p>
<p>        mouth DROPS OPEN. Clare is equally ASTOUNDED. Betsy and the others</p>
<p>        STARE AHEAD. In total WONDERMENT. Even Gutterbuhg is AMAZED. The SOUND</p>
<p>        TRACK MUSIC EXPLODES INTO A THUNDERING CRESCENDO!</p>

<p>        THE LOST CITY OF SUN WU-KUNG</p>

<p>        LIES AHEAD of the group. A SPECTACULAR SIGHT! A city whose every</p>
<p>        building and tower is cast in SOLID GOLD! SPARKLING! GLISTENING! A</p>
<p>        HEAVENLY place. The City is protected by a deep MOAT. The fins of</p>
<p>        several SHARKS move through the moat waters. A THICK STONE WALL</p>
<p>        surrounds the city. A large, golden DRAWBRIDGE is built into the wall.</p>
<p>        PASSAGEWAY into the city.</p>

<p>        A tremendous TOWER stretches above the city walls. The GUARD, a pygmy</p>
<p>        similiar to Tyki, is POSTED in the tower. The guard SPOTS Tyki,</p>
<p>        approaching the city walls. The guard's EYES LIGHT. He SMILES. The</p>
<p>        guard CRIES OUT! SHOUTING to everyone inside of the City. He continues</p>
<p>        to REPEAT a certain phrase.</p>

<p>        Scraggy TRANSLATES the guard's words for Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        He say... "Our Prince has returned</p>
<p>                        home".</p>

<p>        Indiana SMILES. Soon, the beautiful sound of COUNTLESS RINGING BELLS</p>
<p>        is heard, welcoming Tyki home. Eyes WATERING, a proud Tyki and the</p>
<p>        Gorillas LEAD everyone to the foot of the City Walls. The enormous</p>
<p>        drawbridge begins to LOWER. A STUNNING SHAFT OF GOLDEN LIGHT escapes</p>
<p>        from the opening. As the drawbridge continues to lower, the shaft of</p>
<p>        light becomes WIDER. BRIGHTER. It ILLUMINATES the faces of Indy and</p>
<p>        the others. When the drawbridge is completely LOWERED, everyone is LED</p>
<p>        INTO THE CITY. Their bodies SILHOUETTED against the warm glowing</p>
<p>        light.</p>

<p>        INT. CITY</p>

<p>        WE ENTER with Indy and the others. The city is BURSTING with the</p>
<p>        bright colors of various VEGETABLE and FRUIT GARDENS, and various</p>
<p>        other EXOTIC PLANT LIFE. Luscious GREEN GRASS and CRYSTAL CLEAR LAKES</p>
<p>        surround many of the homes. The earthen streets are literally PAVED</p>
<p>        WITH GOLD. The men and women of the City are members of Tyki's RACE.</p>
<p>        ORIENTAL PYGMIES. There is a PEACEFUL, JOYOUS quality about them. They</p>
<p>        RUSH toward Tyki. EMBRACING him. SHOWERING him with kisses. WELCOMING</p>
<p>        him home.</p>

<p>        Indiana and the others are in AWE of this new world. Gutterbuhg WALKS</p>
<p>        with them. CAMERA PANS to his HANDS. He struggles to UNTIE his</p>
<p>        bindings.</p>

<p>        Kezure SPOTS something. A small, SOLID GOLD GARDEN TOOL. Lying in a</p>
<p>        VEGETABLE GARDEN. Kezure's eyes fill with GREED. He moves to STEAL the</p>
<p>        can. Kezure GRABS the tool and begins to HIDE it. BENEATH his cloak. A</p>
<p>        LARGE GORILLA'S HAND GRABS Kezure's arm. TOWERING over the Pirate</p>
<p>        king, the Gorilla WAVES his finger at Kezure. A WARNING. NO STEALING.</p>
<p>        The nervous Kezure NODS. He PLACES the garden tool back on the ground.</p>

<p>        Meanwhile, Indy and the others are led to an elaborate PALACE. They</p>
<p>        ascend the several GOLDEN STAIRS, toward the entrance. The palace</p>
<p>        doors OPEN. An OLDER MAN steps outside. He is BOHBALA. The City's</p>
<p>        RULER. A few PALACE GUARDS stand beside him. Bohbala RAISES his arms</p>
<p>        over the crowd. Pygmies and Gorillas DROP TO THEIR KNEES. In REVERNCE.</p>

<p>        Tyki RUNS to Bohbala. They EMBRACE. TEARS OF JOY fill their eyes.</p>
<p>        Bohbala WIPES away his tears. He gives a WARM SMILE to Indiana and the</p>
<p>        others. He SPEAKS. SOFTLY. In a WISE voice. Scraggy TRANSLATES for the</p>
<p>        others.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        He thank us...for returning his son.</p>

<p>        Indiana and the others SMILE. Betsy WHIPSERS to Indy.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        If the little guy's pushin' 200</p>
<p>                        years?... How old's his Father?</p>

<p>        Indy motions for Betsy to "Shhh". Bohbala continues to SPEAK. Scraggy</p>
<p>        TRANSLATES.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        His name "Bohbala". He is Ruler of</p>
<p>                        City, faithful servant of his Lord</p>
<p>                        and Master... Sun Wu-Kung.</p>
<p>                                (pause, smile)</p>
<p>                        He welcome us to stay. As long as we</p>
<p>                        wish.</p>

<p>        Indiana exchanges a HOPEFUL glance with Clare. As Bohbala CONTINUES to</p>
<p>        speak, CAMERA PANS TO GUTTERBUHG. The Nazi has successfully UNTIED his</p>
<p>        bindings. FREE. While the others listen to Bohbala, Gutterbuhg REMOVES</p>
<p>        ONE SPARE BULLET FROM HIS MOUTH. He slyly INSERTS the bullet into his</p>
<p>        mechanical arm.</p>

<p>        Indiana is TOO CONCERNED with Bohbala to notice Gutterbuhg.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (anxious, to Scraggy)</p>
<p>                        Ask him where we may find the burial</p>
<p>                        place...or the remains...of Sun Wu-</p>
<p>                        Kung...</p>

<p>        Scraggy TURNS to ask Bohbala. But his question is INTERRUPTED by</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg's MECHANICAL ARM. It EXTENDS INTO FRAME! Its finger POINTED</p>
<p>        AT INDIANA! Everyone STARES. SHOCKED. But the bizarre sight greatly</p>
<p>        AMUSES Bohbala. He begins to LAUGH. He REACHES OUT and PUSHES</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg's finger away. But the machine gun GOES OFF! FIRING!</p>
<p>        Bohbala is HIT! In the CHEST. He FALLS. Tyki KNEELS, cradling</p>
<p>        Bohbala's head in his arms. Tyki CALLS his Father's name. It is</p>
<p>        FUTILE. Bohbala is DEAD.</p>

<p>        The crowd of villagers STARE. CONFUSED. They are unaccustomed to</p>
<p>        VIOLENCE.</p>

<p>        Indiana CLUTCHES Gutterbuhg by the throat.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Bastard...</p>

<p>        Indiana pulls back his fist to PUNCH the Nazi. But Indy is STOPPED by</p>
<p>        the PALACE GUARDS. They move their SWORDS to his throat. Indy is</p>
<p>        suddenly PUZZLED. The VILLAGERS FALL TO THEIR KNEES. BOWING to</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg. A distraught Tyki hurriedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who</p>
<p>        translates for Indy.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        It is written... If ruler is</p>
<p>                        defeated by greater power...he who</p>
<p>                        possess that power...</p>
<p>                                (points to Gutterbuhg)</p>
<p>                        ...shall become ruler!</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg's eyes fill with a sadistic THRILL. He RAISES his</p>
<p>        MECHANICAL ARM. In a "Heil Hitler" POSE. The entire City IMITATES the</p>
<p>        Nazi. RAISING their right arms. CHEERING. HAILING their new leader.</p>

<p>        Indiana is HORRIFIED by the scene. Tyki is UPSET. SCREAMING. He knows</p>
<p>        that Gutterbuhg is truly EVIL! But NONE of the villagers listen.</p>
<p>        Indiana LOOKS to his SHOCKED friends.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        This is turning into one helluva</p>
<p>                        nightmare.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUBG</p>
<p>                                (hears, smiles at Indy)</p>
<p>                        One you will never awaken from,</p>
<p>                        Doctor Jones.</p>

<p>        Indy GLARES at Gutterbuhg. Clare and Betsy exchange a FRIGHTENED</p>
<p>        glance.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        INT. PALACE - RULER'S CHAMBER</p>

<p>        A beautiful, expansive chamber, filled with TAPESTRIES and ARTWORK.</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg sits in an elaborate GOLDEN THRONE. He has donned a</p>
<p>        ghoulish NEW OUTFIT. The robes of BOHBALA, the dead ruler. Gutterbuhg</p>
<p>        is being ATTENDED upon by several villagers, who bring him countless</p>
<p>        PLATES OF FOOD. He is surrounded by SEVERAL WOMEN, who patiently wait</p>
<p>        for his orders. Gutterbuhg GOBBLES down the variety of food and wine.</p>
<p>        DROOLING. SLOBBERING.</p>

<p>        Scraggy KNEELS before the Nazi. Gutterbuhg USES Indiana's WHIP as a</p>
<p>        LEASH. It is TIED around Scraggy's neck and HELD by the Nazi.</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg PULLS the leash. HARD. Nearly STRANGLING Scraggy. His mouth</p>
<p>        FILLED WITH FOOD, Gutterbuhg SCREAMS at Scraggy.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUHG</p>
<p>                        I want to see Jones!</p>

<p>        Scraggy TRANSLATES for the guards.</p>

<p>        INT. DUNGEON</p>

<p>        DARK. MUSTY. Surrounded with moss covered STONE WALLS. Located BENEATH</p>
<p>        the Palace. Indy and the others are LOCKED inside. Everyone is SILENT.</p>
<p>        STARING. WAITING. Clare CONSOLES a tearful, despondent Tyki. The</p>
<p>        dungeon gate OPENS. The two Guards ENTER. They DRAG Indiana out of the</p>
<p>        dungeon. Betsy CALLS OUT to Indy. Trying to FOLLOW. But the guards</p>
<p>        SLAM the wooden door in Betsy's face. She peers through the small</p>
<p>        BARRED WINDOW. WORRIED. UPSET.</p>

<p>        INT. PALACE</p>

<p>        Indiana is LED into the Ruler's Chamber. Indy SEES Scraggy, tied to a</p>
<p>        leash. An angry, VENGEFUL look covers Indy's face. He TURNS to</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg. The Nazi, still STUFFING his face with food, pulls TIGHTLY</p>
<p>        on Scraggy's leash.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUHG</p>
<p>                        Your friend makes a wonderful</p>
<p>                        interpreter.</p>

<p>        Indy's eyes BURN. Gutterbuhg GULPS down a glass of wine. Liquid</p>
<p>        SPITTLES from the sides of his mouth. He LOOKS at Indy.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUHG</p>
<p>                        "The Nazi Party will exist for one</p>
<p>                        thousand years...and I wish to be</p>
<p>                        alive for every year!"</p>
<p>                                (pause)</p>
<p>                        That is a favorite philosophy of our</p>
<p>                        feuher.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Your feuher's philosphies belong on</p>
<p>                        a bathroom wall.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUHG</p>
<p>                                (angry, slapping Indy</p>
<p>                                across the face)</p>
<p>                        This is a very serious matter,</p>
<p>                        Doctor Jones. It could save your</p>
<p>                        life.</p>
<p>                                (pause)</p>
<p>                        I understand that somewhere in this</p>
<p>                        City...there is a Garden of...</p>
<p>                        Immortal Peaches?...</p>
<p>                                (Indy doesn't respond,</p>
<p>                                Gutterbuhg continues)</p>
<p>                        I want information about this</p>
<p>                        Garden... And I would greatly</p>
<p>                        appreciate it, if you would share</p>
<p>                        everything you know, with me.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        I don't share anything with Nazis.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg NODS. He TAKES another bite of food, shooting a GLOWERING</p>
<p>        look to Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUHG</p>
<p>                        Very well. My friends will be here</p>
<p>                        soon. They will rest...enjoy the</p>
<p>                        pleasures of my newfound kingdom...</p>
<p>                                (kisses a woman, and</p>
<p>                                pushes her away)</p>
<p>                        Then we shall exterminate these</p>
<p>                        worthless people! Destroy their</p>
<p>                        City! And we will carry away all of</p>
<p>                        its riches...in pieces.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg goes back to his FOOD. Scraggy exchanges a WORRIED GLANCE</p>
<p>        with Indiana.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        THE NAZI ARMY</p>

<p>        TRAVELLING along the narrow mountain path. They are more than HALFWAY</p>
<p>        up the mountain. LIEUT. MEPHISTO rides in the FRONT JEEP. He LOOKS to</p>
<p>        his driver, who REPORTS to Mephisto.</p>

<p>                                        DRIVER</p>
<p>                                (German, English</p>
<p>                                subtitles)</p>
<p>                        Sir... We shall reach the mountain</p>
<p>                        top in less than sixty minutes.</p>

<p>        Mephisto NODS. ANXIOUS.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        THE LOST CITY - COLISEUM</p>

<p>        An enormous STONE ARENA. Located in the CENTER of the City. It</p>
<p>        resembles the ROMAN COLISEUM in size and structure. The coliseum's top</p>
<p>        walls are SURROUNDED by countless, large METAL BELLS. The bells are</p>
<p>        RINGING. They are the same bells we heard earlier...but they now sound</p>
<p>        EERIE... THREATENING. The many seats are FILLED with members of the</p>
<p>        village. All GATHERED for a special event.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg sits in the elaborate RULER'S BOX. It is covered with a</p>
<p>        protective, GOLDEN GRATING. The box is located directly above the</p>
<p>        earthen PLAYING FIELD. Indy's WHIP is still tied around Scraggy's</p>
<p>        neck, who kneels at Gutterbuhg's FEET.</p>

<p>        TWO GUARDS lead a shirtless INDIANA JONES onto the playing field. They</p>
<p>        bring Indy to a STEEL CAGE, located directly below Gutterbuhg's box.</p>
<p>        Inside of the cage, are TWO ENORMOUS BUFFALO. ANGRY. RESTLESS.</p>

<p>        Betsy, Clare, Tyki, Kezure, the remaining Pirates and Crew members,</p>
<p>        all helplessly watch from inside of a LARGE METAL CAGE. The cage is</p>
<p>        SUSPENDED in the air... DANGLING over a deep pit. It is filled with</p>
<p>        COUNTLESS MANEATING TIGERS.</p>

<p>        Indy is LED into the cage. BETWEEN the two buffalo. The guards GRABS</p>
<p>        HOLD of Indiana. They TIE one of his arms, and one of his legs, to</p>
<p>        EACH SIDW of the buffalo. Preparing to DRAW and QUARTER Indiana.</p>

<p>        A DELIGHTED Gutterbuhg PEERS DOWN at Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUHG</p>
<p>                        Doctor Jones... Those beasts are</p>
<p>                        anxious to run wild. Free.</p>
<p>                                (vicious smile)</p>
<p>                        How long will you be able to ride...</p>
<p>                        before they TEAR YOU IN TWO?</p>

<p>        Indy LOOKS at Scraggy, who is very FRIGHTENED.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUHG</p>
<p>                        Goodbye, Doctor Jones.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg TURNS to the guards. Ready to give them the ORDER...to OPEN</p>
<p>        THE CAGE and SET THE BUFFALO FREE! Indy suddenly SCREAMS.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Heil Hitler!</p>

<p>        Upon hearing the words, Gutterbuhg STANDS. Like a ROBOT. He RAISES his</p>
<p>        mechanical arm in a "Heil Hitler" POSE.</p>

<p>                                        GUTTERBUHG</p>
<p>                        Heil Hitler!</p>

<p>        The FINGERS of Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm get CAUGHT IN THE METAL</p>
<p>        GRATING ABOVE HIS HEAD! Gutterbuhg TRIES TO REMOVE his fingers. NO</p>
<p>        GOOD. STUCK. Gutterbuhg PULLS. HARD. His mechanical arm is RIPPED FROM</p>
<p>        ITS SOCKET! It DANGLES from the grating.</p>

<p>        The crowd WATCHES. PUZZLED. SHOCKED.</p>

<p>        Scraggy THINKS FAST. He LEAPS to his feet and GRABS the arm. He TEARS</p>
<p>        IT OUT of the grating. Scraggy HOLDS the arm above his head. Now it is</p>
<p>        HE who possesses the POWER! The crowd CHEERS Scraggy! Their NEW RULER!</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg STEPS BACK. Suddenly FRIGHTENED. Scraggy ORDERS the guards</p>
<p>        to FREE Indiana. The guards hurriedly UNTIE Indy from the buffalo.</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg TURNS. RUNNING out of the Coliseum. Scraggy SCREAMS to the</p>
<p>        people, motioning for them to FOLLOW Gutterbuhg. Several people LEAP</p>
<p>        from their seats. CHASING the Nazi.</p>

<p>        EXT. COLISEUM</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg DASHES OUT! A CROWD OF VILLAGERS follow him. In HOT</p>
<p>        PURSUIT. Gutterbuhg RUNS toward the city gates. He RUNS through.</p>
<p>        ESCAPING the City. The crowd PAUSES. STOPPING. They'll go NO FURTHER.</p>
<p>        They SCREAM and SHOUT at the departing Gutterbuhg, who disappears INTO</p>
<p>        THE MOUNTAINS.</p>

<p>        INT. COLISEUM</p>

<p>        Indiana REJOINS his friends on the playing field. They have been FREED</p>
<p>        from the cage. Scraggy gives the WHIP to Indy. Indy is IMPATIENT.</p>
<p>        WORRIED. He LOOKS at everyone.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Nazis'll be be here soon. We gotta</p>
<p>                        move fast.</p>

<p>        Scraggy gives Gutterbuhg's MECAHNICAL ARM to Tyki. The pygmy NODS. He</p>
<p>        UNDERSTANDS. Tyki RAISES THE ARM TOWARD THE PEOPLE. They CHEER Tyki,</p>
<p>        their rightful ruler. Tyki, PULLS BACK and THROWS the mechanical arm.</p>
<p>        HIGH INTO THE AIR! It SOARS several feet! FLYING OVER the coliseum</p>
<p>        walls.</p>

<p>        EXT. CITY</p>

<p>        The arm flies THROUGH the air... It lands into the MOAT! The arm is</p>
<p>        ATTACKED by a horde of hungry sharks. They TEAR it to pieces.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH</p>

<p>        The Nazis have arrived at the section of path that is BLOCKED by the</p>
<p>        AVALANCHE. Their other VEHICLES and TROOPS have pulled back. A FEW</p>
<p>        HUNDRED FEET from the AVALANCHE. SEVERAL STICKS OF DYNAMITE have been</p>
<p>        placed beneath the avalanche. The T.N.T. is connected to a LONG FUSE,</p>
<p>        that extends along the path. LIEUT. MEPHISTO stands at the fuse's end.</p>
<p>        He STRIKES a match. Preparing to LIGHT THE FUSE. The match flare is</p>
<p>        INCHES from the fuse... Mephisto is INTERRUPTED by a FAMILIAR VOICE.</p>
<p>        It is GUTTERBUHG. Mephisto BLOWS OUT the match.</p>

<p>        A SOAKING WET Sgt. Gutterbuhg SLIDES down the edge of the ravine. He</p>
<p>        still wears the COLORFUL, ELABORATE ROBES of Bohbala. Mephisto is</p>
<p>        PUZZLED by Gutterbuhg's BIZARRE APPEARANCE. Gutterbuhg STOPS in front</p>
<p>        of Mephisto. Gutterbuhg ATTEMPTS a "Heil, Hitler"... but suddenly</p>
<p>        realizes that his mechanical arm is GONE. Gutterbuhg DRIPS WATER all</p>
<p>        over Mephisto, who is DISGUSTED by the appearance of his officer. He</p>
<p>        SLAPS Gutterbuhg.</p>

<p>                                        MEPHISTO</p>
<p>                                (German; English</p>
<p>                                subtitles)</p>
<p>                        Idiot!... Why are you dressed like</p>
<p>                        that!... Where is your uniform?...</p>

<p>        Before he can answer, Gutterbuhg is SHOVED AWAY by the disgusted</p>
<p>        Mephisto, who ATTEMPTS to LIGHT the fuse. But his matches are USELESS.</p>
<p>        Soaked with WATER. Furious, Mephisto SLAPS Gutterbuhg, ordering him to</p>
<p>        fetch something. The snivelling Gutterbuhg nods and bows, SCURRYING</p>
<p>        away. He RUNS into the rear of A CANVAS TRUCK.</p>

<p>        INT. TRUCK</p>

<p>        Filled with several crates of DYNAMITE and SUPPLIES. Gutterbuhg DASHES</p>
<p>        inside. Toward a SILVER, METALLIC BRIEFCASE that rests in the rear of</p>
<p>        the truck. Gutterbuhg's greasy fingers OPEN the briefcase.</p>

<p>        Inside, encased in black velvet, are TWO RECTANGULAR COMPARTMENTS. One</p>
<p>        of the compartments is EMPTY. The other houses another MECHANICAL ARM.</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg quickly ATTACHES the arm to the stub of his shoulder and</p>
<p>        RUNS BACK OUTSIDE.</p>

<p>        EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg REJOINS Mephisto and EXTENDS his new mechanical arm TOWARD</p>
<p>        THE FUSE. Gutterbuhg POINTS his finger. He SQUEEZES A LEVER, located</p>
<p>        on the palm of the mechanical arm. A BRIGHT, JAGGED LINE OF ELECTRICAL</p>
<p>        CURRENT shoots from the arm's finger! The electricity LIGHTS the fuse.</p>
<p>        It BURNS. Moving TOWARD the dynamite. Gutterbuhg and Mephisto HIDE</p>
<p>        behind a rock. There is a LOUD EXPLOSION. Rocks and debris FLY THROUGH</p>
<p>        THE AIR. The path is CLEARED.</p>

<p>        INT. CITY</p>

<p>        The SOUND OF THE EXPLOSION echoes through the City. SHAKING the city</p>
<p>        walls. The Nazis are CLOSE.</p>

<p>        Indiana STANDS in the city square. He has ASSEMBLED everyone for the</p>
<p>        battle. Tyki and the pygmies are armed with BOWS and ARROWS, SPEARS</p>
<p>        and BLOW PIPES. Kezure and the Pirates hold their SWORDS. Scraggy's</p>
<p>        men carry REVOLVERS and DAGGERS. Clare and Betsy STAND with several</p>
<p>        Gorillas. Tyki WHISPERS to Scraggy, who TRANSLATES for Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        They want you to give speech.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        What?!?...</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Before battle... General always give</p>
<p>                        speech to inspire troops.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        General?... Who the hell do they</p>
<p>                        think I am... Custer?...</p>

<p>        But ALL EYES are on Indiana. DEPENDING on him. Indy SIGHS. Trying to</p>
<p>        THINK of something to say. He MUMBLES to Scraggy.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Geez... The only speeches I remember</p>
<p>                        are from college...when I played</p>
<p>                        ball...</p>

<p>        Scraggy SHRUGS. Indy CLEARS his throat. He LOOKS at everyone.</p>
<p>        FUMBLING.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Men...and, ah...women... I...ah...</p>
<p>                        We're about to face one of our</p>
<p>                        toughest opponents... They've got</p>
<p>                        size...hardware...and well, quite</p>
<p>                        frankly...we're the underdogs...</p>

<p>        Indy's eyes LIGHT. A moment of INSPIRATION. The background MUSIC</p>
<p>        SLOWLY BEGINS TO RISE. Indy's voice becomes LOUDER. TOUGHER.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        But...well, if it wasn't for the</p>
<p>                        little guy...where would this</p>
<p>                        country be?...</p>
<p>                                (excited, louder)</p>
<p>                        I mean...I knew this little guy once</p>
<p>                        ...a scrawny runt, with thick black</p>
<p>                        glasses and about 300 different</p>
<p>                        kinds of allergies... But this</p>
<p>                        little kid had a dream... He wanted</p>
<p>                        to be on the football team.</p>
<p>                                (Music rises, so does</p>
<p>                                Indy's voice)</p>
<p>                        Well, all the big guys made his life</p>
<p>                        miserable...always shoving his head</p>
<p>                        in the drinking fountain...putting</p>
<p>                        mustard in his pants...throwing me</p>
<p>                        ...'er, HIM!...throwing HIM in the</p>
<p>                        shower with all his clothes on...</p>
<p>                                (louder, heartfelt)</p>
<p>                        But that little guy didn't quit. Be</p>
<p>                        worked hard. Never gave up. And in</p>
<p>                        two years...he was the Quarterback.</p>
<p>                        Star of the team. And you know why?...</p>
<p>                                (Music SOARS, as does</p>
<p>                                Indy's voice)</p>
<p>                        'Cause that little kid had somethin'</p>
<p>                        that those big guys never heard</p>
<p>                        of... He had HEART! And nothin' can</p>
<p>                        stop that! Nothin'!</p>
<p>                                (we hear the Nazis</p>
<p>                                approaching, Indy</p>
<p>                                screams)</p>
<p>                        Now let's go out there and show 'em</p>
<p>                        JUST HOW TOUGH THE LITTLE GUYS ARE!</p>

<p>        Everyone breaks into a loud CHEER. Ready to FIGHT. The sound track</p>
<p>        music SOARS. Indiana RAISES HIS SWORD. He TURNS and RUNS toward the</p>
<p>        DRAWBRIDGE. The people FOLLOW, as Indy LEADS THEM INTO BATTLE!</p>

<p>        EXT. CITY</p>

<p>        Indiana, armed with a shield, sword and pistol, LEADS his troops</p>
<p>        forward. The Nazis are APPROACHING. LIEUT. MEPHISTO rides in the front</p>
<p>        jeep, which is mounted with a large RECOILIST MACHINE GUN. The entire</p>
<p>        Nazi army is BEHIND HIM. Mephisto's jeep begins to CROSS the</p>
<p>        drawbridge. Moving TOWARD Indiana and the others. The recoilist</p>
<p>        machine gunner OPENS FIRE on Indy and the troops.</p>

<p>        Bullets BOUNCE from Indy's shield. Several of the pygmies are HIT.</p>
<p>        FALLING to the drawbridge. An angry pygmy THROWS his spear. It HITS</p>
<p>        the machine gunner. THROUGH the heart.</p>

<p>        The jeep continues to DRIVE FORWARD. HEADED straight for Indiana, who</p>
<p>        LEAPS ONTO the jeep's hood. Indy's troops SPLIT INTO GROUPS. Dashing</p>
<p>        around the speeding jeep to BATTLE the oncoming Nazis.</p>

<p>        Indiana CRAWLS along the jeep hood. TOWARD the Nazis. Mephisto</p>
<p>        attempts to SHOOT Indy. The bullets ZIP through the windshield.</p>
<p>        WHIZZING by Indy's head. Indiana GRABS Mephisto. He PULLS the Nazi</p>
<p>        over the windshield. Indiana and Mephisto TUMBLE along the jeep's</p>
<p>        hood. FIGHTING. STRUGGLING for the gun.</p>

<p>        The jeep DIRECTLY BEHIND Mephisto is filled with several CRATES OF</p>
<p>        DYNAMITE. GUTTERBUHG, back in uniform, rides here with THREE NAZI</p>
<p>        SOLDIERS. As the pygmy troops come forward, Gutterbuhg EXTENDS HIS</p>
<p>        MECHANICAL ARM. He ZAPS several of the pygmies. KILLING them with</p>
<p>        deadly JOLTS OF ELECTRICITY.</p>

<p>        As the jeep PASSES through the City gates, Indiana and Mephisto</p>
<p>        continue to BATTLE along the hood.</p>

<p>        INT. CITY</p>

<p>        Mephisto ATTEMPTS TO SHOOT Indiana. But Indy PUSHES AWAY the Nazi's</p>
<p>        arm. The gun FIRES. HITTING the jeep driver, who SLUMPS over the</p>
<p>        wheel. The speeding jeep SPINS OUT OF CONTROL. It FLIPS. Sending</p>
<p>        Indiana and Mephisto FLYING through the air. They TUMBLE to the</p>
<p>        ground. The jeep CRASHES into a wall.</p>

<p>        A SHAKEN Indiana gets to his feet. Mephisto LIES A few feet away. OUT</p>
<p>        COLD. Suddenly, a BLAST OF ELECTRICITY BURSTS INTO FRAME! SPARKING the</p>
<p>        ground beside Indiana. Indy TURNS and sees GUTTERBUBG! The Nazi's jeep</p>
<p>        has ENTERED the city. Gutterbuhg POINTS his mechanical arm toward</p>
<p>        Indy. ANOTHER ELECTRICAL SHOCK ejects from his finger. Indy DIVES. The</p>
<p>        shock TEARS A SMOLDERING HOLE through the building behind him. Only</p>
<p>        INCHES above Indy.</p>

<p>        Meanwhile, the Nazis begin to UNLOAD the dynamite from Gutterbubg's</p>
<p>        jeep. They UNWRAP a long, section of FUSE from a large coil. Placing</p>
<p>        the fuse ALONG THE GROUND.</p>

<p>        Indiana is RUNNING for his life. Gutterbuhg is DIRECTLY BEHIND him. In</p>
<p>        HOT PURSUIT. The Nazi continuously FIRES ELECTRICAL SHOTS at Indiana.</p>
<p>        The thin lines of electricity WHIZ by Indy's HEAD. His ARMS. His LEGS.</p>
<p>        JUST MISSING INDY. A CAT AND MOUSE CHASE BEGINS, as Gutterbuhg PURSUES</p>
<p>        Indiana throughout the city.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        TYKI AND SEVERAL PYGMIES</p>

<p>        They have CLIMBED to the top of the City Walls. From here, they GUARD</p>
<p>        and DEFEND their city. Crowds of NAZI TROOPS are on foot. Running</p>
<p>        TOWARD the city walls. The pygmies SHOWER the Nazis with ARROWS,</p>
<p>        SPEARS and POISINOUS DARTS. The Nazis fight back with MACHINE GUNS and</p>
<p>        RIFLES. A HEATED, BLOODY BATTLE.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        SCRAGGY AND THE CREW MEMBERS</p>

<p>        They stand at the CITY GATE. PROTECTING the City entrance. They</p>
<p>        hurriedly load a large, wooden CATAPULT with a huge BALL OF HAY. A</p>
<p>        crew member TORCHES the hay. It BURSTS INTO FLAME. Scraggy CRIES</p>
<p>        "Fire!" His men LAUNCH the fireball. It SAILS over the City Walls.</p>

<p>        THE FIREBALL</p>

<p>        LANDS directly onto a speeding NAZI JEEP. The Nazis and jeep CATCH</p>
<p>        FIRE! The vehicle LOSES CONTROL. The flaming jeep CRASHES into the</p>
<p>        side of a mountain wall.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        A NAZI TANK</p>

<p>        ROLLS toward the city. Its GUN BARREL aimed at the city walls. CAMERA</p>
<p>        PANS AWAY, SEVERAL FEET AHEAD OF THE TANK. CAMERA MOVES UPWARD, TO THE</p>
<p>        MOUNTAIN TOP, ABOVE the path. CLARE is here. A GROUP OF GORILLAS are</p>
<p>        beside her. The apes each have a TIGHT HOLD of individual sections of</p>
<p>        HANGING VINE. They stand at the EDGE OF THE RAVINE. Clare LOOKS to the</p>
<p>        OPPOSITE RAVINE. BETSY is here. She stands with ANOTHER GROUP OF</p>
<p>        GORILLAS, who also securely bold lengths of vine.</p>

<p>        On the mountain path, the Nazi tank PASSES DIRECTLY BENEATH Betsy and</p>
<p>        Clare. The two women TURN to the Gorillas. Emitting Gorilla GRUNTS,</p>
<p>        MOANS and MOTIONS, Betsy and Clare COMMUNICATE with the apes. The</p>
<p>        Gorillas LISTEN. NODDING. UNDERSTANDING. When the tank is DIRECTLY</p>
<p>        BELOW... Betsy and Clare ORDER the Gorillas to JUMP!</p>

<p>        The apes SWING from the mountain. RIDING the vines. TOWARD the tank.</p>
<p>        The Gorillas LAND on the tank. They CLIMB aboard. EXPLORING the tank's</p>
<p>        surface.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        FILLED with Nazis. The gunner looks into the PERISCOPE. He is met with</p>
<p>        the reflection of a SNARLING GORILLA'S FACE. He SCREAMS and JUMPS</p>
<p>        BACK.</p>

<p>        There is a sound of RIPPING METAL. Suddenly, the tank's top HATCH is</p>
<p>        TORN OPEN. COUNTLESS GORILLAS pour inside! The apes ATTACK.</p>
<p>        OVERPOWERING the Nazis.</p>

<p>        EXT. TANK</p>

<p>        As the Gorillas climb inside of the tank, Betsy SWINGS across the</p>
<p>        passageway to Clare. She EXCHANGES a congratulatory handshake with</p>
<p>        Clare. Betsy's face suddenly goes WHITE. A SHOCKING SIGHT.</p>

<p>        A GROUP OF NAZIS have climbed to the mountain top. The soldiers SPOT</p>
<p>        Clare and Betsy. They RUN TOWARD the women. Betsy and Clare DASH OFF.</p>
<p>        Into the THICK of the jungle. The Nazis FOLLOW. In HOT PURSUIT.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        TWO LARGE CANVAS TRUCKS</p>

<p>        BARRELLING along the mountain path. KEZURE, the Pirate King, LEAPS</p>
<p>        from the side of the path, between the two trucks. Kezure climbs onto</p>
<p>        the REAR BUMPER of the FIRST TRUCK. The DRIVER of the SECOND TRUCK</p>
<p>        spots Kezure. He begins to FIRE SHOTS at the Pirate King. As bullets</p>
<p>        whiz by him, Kezure hurriedly removes a thick METAL CHAIN from around</p>
<p>        his neck. He securely CONNECTS the two truck BUMPERS with the chain.</p>

<p>        INT. SECOND TRUCK</p>

<p>        Filled with NAZI TROOPS. SEATED. ARMED. Waiting to FIGHT. There is a</p>
<p>        sudden RIPPING SOUND. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. The NAZIS are</p>
<p>        STARTLED to see the BLADES OF COUNTLESS SWORDS. PIERCING the canvas.</p>
<p>        Through all SIDES of the truck. SEVERAL PIRATES leap through the</p>
<p>        canvas. ATTACKING the Nazis. The Nazis FIGHT BACK with bayonets and</p>
<p>        daggers.</p>

<p>        INT. FIRST TRUCK - CABIN</p>

<p>        Two Pirates BURST into the cabin. They STAB the Nazi driver. The</p>
<p>        CACKLING Pirates take control of the steering wheel. They madly STEER</p>
<p>        the truck toward the steep EDGE of the mountain path.</p>

<p>        THE FIRST TRUCK</p>

<p>        PLUMMETS over the eage. The second truck, ATTACHED by the metal chain,</p>
<p>        FOLLOWS the first truck. The two canvas trucks FALL into the moat!</p>
<p>        SPLASHING into the shark infestea waters!</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        INT. CITY</p>

<p>        The Nazis have planted an enormous PILE OF DYNAMITE on the palace</p>
<p>        stairs. Enough to DESTROY the entire city. The T.N.T. is attached to a</p>
<p>        LONG FUSE, that stretches hundreds of feet, over VARIOUS SECTIONS of</p>
<p>        the city. The Nazis LIGHT the fuse end. It SPARKS. IGNITES. BURNING</p>
<p>        FAST. The Nazis TURN and RUN.</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg continues to CHASE Indiana. BLASTS OF ELECTRICITY SHOOT</p>
<p>        from the Nazi's arm. Indy DUCKS... DODGES... AVOIDING the electrical</p>
<p>        jolts. Indy SPINS around a building corner. He spots the BURNING FUSE.</p>
<p>        It STRETCHES along the ground, moving up OVER a wooden fence. Indy</p>
<p>        DIVES and STOMPS OUT the fuse. But Gutterbuhg, who is directly behind</p>
<p>        Indy, RELIGHTS the fuse with a shot of electricity. Before Indy has a</p>
<p>        chance to stop the fuse...Gutterbuhg AIMS at Indy. Indy LEAPS OVER the</p>
<p>        fence. Gutterbuhg SHOOTS. The fence is SPLINTERED by the powerful</p>
<p>        electrical blast.</p>

<p>        Indiana runs into a small ALLEYWAY. The burning fuse STRETCHES up</p>
<p>        along the alley wall, moving to the ROOFTOP. Indy begins to climb the</p>
<p>        ancient golden bricks that PROTRUDE from the wall. TOWARD the roof.</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg APPEARS. He SHOOTS at Indiana, who avoids the blast by</p>
<p>        LEAPING onto the roof. Gutterbuhg hurriedly begins to CLIMB the wall.</p>
<p>        FOLLOWING Indiana.</p>

<p>        EXT. ROOFTOP</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg ARRIVES at the top. He LOOKS around. There is NO SIGN of</p>
<p>        Indy. But the fuse RESTS at the roof's edge. UNLIT. Gutterbuhg</p>
<p>        RESTARTS the fuse. At that moment, Indiana LEAPS OUT from inside of</p>
<p>        the stone smokestack. He JUMPS the unsuspecting Gutterbuhg. They</p>
<p>        TUMBLE and FALL OFF the rooftop edge.</p>

<p>        Indiana and Gutterbuhg HIT the ground. They continue to STRUGGLE...</p>
<p>        FIGHT...as the fuse BURNS in front of them. It SPEEDS toward the pile</p>
<p>        of dynamite. Less than FIFTY FEET AHEAD. Still wrestling with</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg, Indy ROLLS toward the fuse. Indy reaches out and STOPS THE</p>
<p>        FUSE with his hand. But Gutterbuhg MOVES FAST. Again, the Nazi</p>
<p>        RELIGHTS the fuse.</p>

<p>        Indy suddenly LEAPS to his feet. He RUNS OFF SCREEN. Gutterbuhg</p>
<p>        FOLLOWS. The fuse continues to BURN. Moving CLOSER...CLOSER...to the</p>
<p>        dynamite.</p>

<p>        Indiana runs to a CLUSTER OF TREES. He comes to an abrupt stop,</p>
<p>        between TWO TREES. Gutterbuhg is UPON HIM. The Nazi PAUSES. Only a FEW</p>
<p>        FEET from Indy. Gutterbuhg POINTS his arm at Indy. A CLEAR SHOT.</p>
<p>        Gutterbuhg SMILES. Indiana is TRAPPED.</p>

<p>        THE FUSE is now only a FEW FEET from the dynamite. It will BLOW at any</p>
<p>        second!</p>

<p>        Gutterbuhg SHOOTS. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy LEAPS OUT OF THE WAY,</p>
<p>        revealing a LARGE LAKE behind him. It's TOO LATE for Gutterbubg. The</p>
<p>        electrical current HITS THE WATER. The Nazi's body SURGES with</p>
<p>        electricity. Gutterbuhg FRIES. He SHIVERS. SHAKES. FROZEN, as the</p>
<p>        powerful electrical current FLOWS through his veins. SMOKE billows</p>
<p>        from his body. His mechanical arm suddenly EXPLODES. Gutterbuhg's</p>
<p>        charred body FALLS. FACE DOWN. ELECTROCUTED.</p>

<p>        Indiana LEAPS TO HIS FEET. Suddenly remembering... THE FUSE! It is now</p>
<p>        INCHES from the T.N.T. Indy can't get to it IN TIME. He GRABS his</p>
<p>        whip. His arm SNAPS FORWARD. The whip CRACKS. It SLICES the remaining</p>
<p>        fuse in two. The fuse FIZZLES and GOES OUT. The city is SAVED. Indy</p>
<p>        SIGHS. There is a GUNSHOT! A BULLET whizzes by Indy's head. He TURNS.</p>

<p>        MEPHISTO, bruised and bloodied from the jeep accident, stands SEVERAL</p>
<p>        FEET AWAY. Mephisto's LUGER is aimed at Indy. Prepared to take ANOTHER</p>
<p>        SHOT. Indy removes his REVOLVER. He FIRES at Mephisto. The Nazi DASHES</p>
<p>        into the COLISEUM. Indiana FOLLOWS.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        TYKI</p>

<p>        BATTLING the oncoming Nazis with his sword. Tyki fights HARD. FAST. He</p>
<p>        manages to DEFEAT many Nazis. But the sword is suddenly KNOCKED from</p>
<p>        Tyki's hand. A TROOP OF NAZIS come toward him. Their eyes MURDEROUS.</p>
<p>        Tyki is TRAPPED. HELPLESS.</p>

<p>        INT. CITY</p>

<p>        Scraggy and his crew members load ANOTHER FIREBALL onto the catapult.</p>
<p>        Scraggy cries "FIRE!" The fireball FLIES over the city walls. It lands</p>
<p>        DIRECTLY IN FRONT of the Nazi troops who are about to attack Tyki.</p>
<p>        Many of the soldiers CATCH FIRE. The others RUN from the flames. Tyki</p>
<p>        is UNHURT. He REJOINS his friends in the battle.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        CLARE AND BETSY</p>

<p>        BREATHLESS...FRIGHTENED...they continue to RUN through the jungle. The</p>
<p>        Nazis are a few feet BEHIND THEM. Moving FAST. Getting CLOSER. The</p>
<p>        women turn a corner, scramble through a section of bushes and find</p>
<p>        themselves face to face with...ANOTHER TROOP OF NAZIS.</p>

<p>        Clare and Betsy STOP. TRAPPED. SURROUNDED by Nazis. The soldiers MOVE</p>
<p>        TOWARD the women. The Nazis eyes are LECHEROUS. HUNGRY. Clare WHISPERS</p>
<p>        to a TREMBLING Betsy.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Do exactly what I do.</p>

<p>        Betsy NODS. The Nazis MOVE CLOSER. Clare looks to the SKY. She begins</p>
<p>        to make BIZARRE...HIGH PITCHED...NOISES. A CONFUSED Betsy makes the</p>
<p>        same noises. The Nazis LOOK at each other and CHUCKLE. The women</p>
<p>        CONTINUE to make the sounds.</p>

<p>        Suddenly, the exact sound seems to ECHO FROM THE SKY. It becomes</p>
<p>        LOUDER... LOUDER... But it belongs to A HUNDRED VOICES. The Nazis</p>
<p>        PAUSE. Looking UPWARD. PUZZLED.</p>

<p>        There is a SPLATTERING OF BIRDS. They ATTACK from above. The birds'</p>
<p>        screeching is IDENTICAL to Clare and Betsy's calls. The angry birds</p>
<p>        ATTACK THE NAZIS. PECKING. SCRATCHING. BITING. Clare and Betsy</p>
<p>        CONTINUE to make the sounds, which causes the birds to IGNORE THEM.</p>
<p>        The Nazis SCREAM. DROPPING their weapons. FALLING to their knees. Each</p>
<p>        soldier is COVERED with birds. They are being TORN TO SHREDS. Clare</p>
<p>        and Betsy TURN and RUN. ESCAPING into the jungle. The Nazis' screaming</p>
<p>        ECHOES behind them. As they run, Clare EXPLAINS to Betsy.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        I made the sound of a baby Swandola</p>
<p>                        bird, crying for help... The Mother</p>
<p>                        birds immediately reply to the cries</p>
<p>                        ...angrily protecting their</p>
<p>                        children, and murdering the baby's</p>
<p>                        attackers.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        THE TWO CANVAS TRUCKS</p>

<p>        They crookedly FLOAT along the shark infested moat waters. The</p>
<p>        battered, bruised trucks now resemble two sinking PIRATE SHIPS. Kezure</p>
<p>        and the Pirates BATTLE the Nazis along the truck frames. The pirates</p>
<p>        fight in their element... WATER! With fast SWINGING SWORDS, the</p>
<p>        Pirates are defeating the Nazis. Several Nazis fall INTO THE WATER and</p>
<p>        are immediately ATTACKED by countless SHARKS.</p>

<p>        At one point, Kezure FALLS INTO THE WATER. Several SHARKS come for</p>
<p>        him. The Pirate King DISAPPEARS beneath the water surface. A few of</p>
<p>        his men PAUSE. WORRIED. AFRAID. Suddenly, Kezure LEAPS OUT OF THE</p>
<p>        WATER. He holds a LIVE SHARK in his hands. The crazed Kezure TAKES A</p>
<p>        BITE from the shark. He TOSSES the fish back into the water. Kezure</p>
<p>        CHEWS ana SWALLOWS the raw shark meat. BLOOD spills down his chin.</p>
<p>        Kezure resumes his FIGHTING with the Nazis, as the two truck frames</p>
<p>        continue to SINK.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        Several Nazis are SPRAWLED on the tank floor. UNCONSCIOUS. UNDRESSED.</p>
<p>        CAMERA PANS UPWARD. The Gorillas have TAKEN CONTROL of the tank. They</p>
<p>        have DRESSED THEMSELVES IN NAZI UNIFORMS!</p>

<p>        EXT. TANK</p>

<p>        As the battle RAGES around them, the Gorilla's tank makes a sudden</p>
<p>        U-TURN. It heads straight for the SECOND NAZI TANK.</p>

<p>        INT. SECOND TANK</p>

<p>        The Nazis stare through their PERISCOPE. Puzzled by the sight of their</p>
<p>        own tank COMING TOWARD THEM.</p>

<p>        EXT. TANK</p>

<p>        The Gorilla's tank FIRES A DIRECT SHOT at the other Nazi tank. BLAM!</p>
<p>        The Nazis' tank is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS.</p>

<p>        INT. GORILLA TANK</p>

<p>        The Gorillas break into a VICTORIOUS CHEER. JUMPING. SCREAMING.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        INT. COLISEUM</p>

<p>        Indiana WALKS across the coliseum floor. REVOLVER in hand. He moves</p>
<p>        SLOWLY. CAUTIOUSLY. He is looking for a SIGN of Mephisto. But</p>
<p>        everything is SILENT. CALM. DESERTED.</p>

<p>        Mephisto SNEAKS along the top wall of the coliseum. HIDING behind the</p>
<p>        row of surrounding BELLS. The Nazi UNLATCHES the chain that holds all</p>
<p>        of the bells in place. The bells begin to FALL. THUNDERING down the</p>
<p>        coliseum stairs.</p>

<p>        Indy COVERS his ears. The sound of countless CLANGING BELLS is nearly</p>
<p>        deafening. He TURNS. Seeing the enormous bells ROLLING TOWARD HIM!</p>
<p>        Indiana begins to RUN. GIANT ROLLING BELLS CHASE HIM FROM ALL</p>
<p>        DIRECTIONS! Indy TWISTS...TURNS...LEAPS...in an effort to avoid being</p>
<p>        CRUSHED by the heavy bells.</p>

<p>        Mephisto WATCHES from above. SMILING.</p>

<p>        Indy CONTINUES to run. A giant ROLLING BELL chases him from behind.</p>
<p>        The bell GAINS SPEED. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. A few feet in front of</p>
<p>        Indy...is the deadly TIGER PIT. But Indy CAN'T STOP RUNNING, or he'll</p>
<p>        be CRUSHED by the bell. Indiana LEAPS INTO THE PIT! The bell ROLLS</p>
<p>        DIRECTLY OVER the pit.</p>

<p>        But Indiana is SAFE. There is a FIVE INCH DROP from the ground, to the</p>
<p>        pit's OVERHEAD METAL BARS. Indy LIES on the bars. SAFELY above the</p>
<p>        countless TIGERS.</p>

<p>        The bells have all COME TO A STOP. They LIE around the coliseum</p>
<p>        ground. STILL. Only one bell GENTLY ROCKS. It slowly TEETERS on the</p>
<p>        coliseum stairs. It HASN'T yet rolled off.</p>

<p>        Indiana begins to CLIMB OUT out of the pit, when suddenly... ANOTHER</p>
<p>        GUNSHOT RINGS OUT. Indy is HIT. In the CHEST. He SLIPS. FALLS. Bis</p>
<p>        wounded body is SPRAWLED on the bars. TEETERING. Ready to FALL into</p>
<p>        the waiting tigers.</p>

<p>        Mephisto's luger is SMOKING. The Nazi WALKS down the coliseum stairs.</p>
<p>        He moves TOWARD Indiana. Seeing Mephisto heading for him... Indiana</p>
<p>        REMOVES his gun. He AIMS at the Nazi. But Indy's vision is BLURRED.</p>
<p>        His hand TREMBLES. Mephisto's silhouette nears... But the bullet ZIPS</p>
<p>        PAST Mephisto and STRIKES a section of wood below the teetering bell.</p>
<p>        This causes the bell to FALL...and slowly ROLL forward.</p>

<p>        Mephisto ARRIVES at the edge of the Tiger Pit. He is about to shoot</p>
<p>        Indy...then comes upon ANOTHER IDEA. Mephisto LOWERS the luger. He</p>
<p>        gives a SWIFT KICK to Indy's ribs. Indiana FALLS THROUGH the bars. His</p>
<p>        arm SHOOTS OUT. With his last bit of strength, Indy's hand GRABS HOLD</p>
<p>        of a bar. CLUTCHING on for dear life. His body DANGLES over the</p>
<p>        tigers. They SNAP at his legs. HUNGRY. GROWLING. Mephisto SMILES. He</p>
<p>        STEPS on Indy's fingers. GRINDING them beneath his boot heel. Indy</p>
<p>        CRIES OUT... He's going to FALL...</p>

<p>        Mephisto PAUSES. He HEARS something behind him. A CLANGING BELL.</p>
<p>        Getting CLOSER. LOUDER. Mephisto TURNS. He sees the GIANT BELL. COMING</p>
<p>        at him. Only INCHES AWAY. There is NO TIME to move. The bell ROLLS</p>
<p>        OVER MEPHISTO. KNOCKING him INTO THE PIT.</p>

<p>        Mephisto FALLS through the bars. INSIDE the pit. INTO the middle of</p>
<p>        the hungry tigers. Mephisto SCREAMS. The tigers are UPON HIM. The Nazi</p>
<p>        is RIPPED TO SHREDS. Within seconds, his screams are a MEMORY.</p>

<p>        A very WEAK Indiana still clutches the bar. He manages to BOOST</p>
<p>        himself out of the pit. He takes a FEW STEPS. WOBBLING. BLOOD pours</p>
<p>        from the wound in his chest. He STUMBLES. To his KNEES. His eyes ROLL</p>
<p>        BACK. He FALLS to the ground. His body is STILL. MOTIONLESS.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        The Gorillas, still dressed as NAZIS, continue to DRIVE THE TANK</p>
<p>        FORWARD.</p>

<p>        EXT. TANK</p>

<p>        The tank SPEEDS TOWARD THE ROWS OF CHARGING NAZI TROOPS. The Nazis</p>
<p>        STOP. SHOCKED to see their own tank coming at them. But the tank</p>
<p>        continues to BARREL AHEAD. Many of the Nazis are CRUSHED beneath the</p>
<p>        heavy tank treads. Others DROP their weapons and RUN. FRIGHTENED.</p>

<p>        INT. TANK</p>

<p>        The Gorillas are ECSTATIC. HOWLING. CHEERING.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        KEZURE AND THE PIRATES</p>

<p>        They have DEFEATED all of the Nazis. One of the canvas trucks has</p>
<p>        completely SUNK. Only a small section of the other truck JUTS OUT of</p>
<p>        the water. The Pirates CLING to the fleeting safety of the sinking</p>
<p>        truck frame, which is surrounded by several HUNGRY SHARKS. There are</p>
<p>        even TOO MANY maneaters for the powerful Kezure to handle. As the</p>
<p>        frame continues to SINK...the Pirates' feet get CLOSER...CLOSER...to</p>
<p>        the snapping sharks...</p>

<p>        Suddenly, a ROPE DROPS FROM OVERHEAD! Kezure LOOKS UP. SCRAGGY and his</p>
<p>        crew members stand on the DRAWBRIDGE. They have DROPPED the line.</p>
<p>        Kezure and the Pirates CLIMB upward. To SAFETY.</p>

<p>        On the drawbridge, Scraggy ASSISTS Kezure. Scraggy SMILES, repeating</p>
<p>        Kezure's earlier threat.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        You owe me, old man.</p>

<p>        Kezure LAUGHS. He EMBRACES Scraggy. They are joined by TYKI and the</p>
<p>        OTHER PYGMIES. A sudden CALM...a sudden SILENCE...overcomes the city.</p>
<p>        The battle has ENDED. The Nazis have been DEFEATED. The city is SAVED.</p>
<p>        But Tyki is SOLEMN. DISTRESSED. He STARES OFF SCREEN. CAMERA PANS TO</p>
<p>        HIS P.O.V. We see the countless BODIES OF PYGMIES. SPRAWLED on the</p>
<p>        ground. DEAD. The price you pay for FREEDOM. Suddenly, the silence is</p>
<p>        INTERRUPTED. Someone is CRYING. It is BETSY.</p>

<p>        Scraggy looks OFF SCREEN, to the direction of the sounds. The color</p>
<p>        LEAVES his face.</p>

<p>        SCRAGGY'S P.O.V.</p>

<p>        A group of pygmies CARRY the limp body of Indiana Jones out of the</p>
<p>        coliseum. They GENTLY LOWER Indy's body to the ground. Clare and Betsy</p>
<p>        KNEEL beside Indy. TEARS run down Betsy's face.</p>

<p>        Scraggy suddenly BREAKS AWAY from the crowd. CAMERA DOLLIES WITH HIM</p>
<p>        as he runs toward Indy. Scraggy STOPS at Indy's body. Clare, eyes</p>
<p>        FILLED with tears NODS to Scraggy. She can BARELY utter the words...</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        He's...dead...</p>

<p>        TEARS erupt in Scraggy's eyes. He breaks down CRYING. A startled</p>
<p>        KEZURE joins the others. CAMERA PULLS BACK to an extremely LONG SHOT.</p>
<p>        The entire village GATHERS around Indiana's body. Everyone is SOLEMN.</p>
<p>        SILENT.</p>

<p>                                                                        A SLOW DISSOLVE:</p>

<p>        CLOSE-UP: INDIANA'S BODY.</p>

<p>        It is LYING in state. Resting on a BAMBOO STRETCHER. It is covered</p>
<p>        with EXOTIC, COLORFUL FLOWERS. CAMERA PULLS BACK. Indy is being</p>
<p>        carried by several, elaborately dressed PYGMIES. At the head of a long</p>

<p>        FUNERAL PROCESSION. Betsy, Clare, Scraggy and Kezure MARCH beside</p>
<p>        Indy's body. They also wear the ceremonial FUNERAL FLOWERS. Behind</p>
<p>        them, the body of BOHBALA is being carried. And behind the ruler, the</p>
<p>        bodies of all DEAD PYGMIES are being carried by the remaining</p>
<p>        VILLAGERS and GORILLAS. It is NIGHTIME. All mourners are carrying</p>
<p>        FLICKERING CANDLES. At the rear of the procession, a lone pygmy strums</p>
<p>        an UNUSUAL STRING INSTRUMENT. This creates a HAUNTING melody.</p>

<p>        CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A LONG SHOT, as we see the procession move</p>
<p>        through the city. The hundreds of flickering candles against the dark</p>
<p>        night sky create a BEAUTIFUL IMAGE. The procession arrives at a large</p>
<p>        STONE WALL. It appears to be a DEAD END. Tyki WALKS to the wall.</p>

<p>        He FALLS to his knees and begins to CHANT. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and</p>
<p>        Kezure WATCH. There is a SMALL RUMBLE. A hairline CRACK begins to form</p>
<p>        in the mountain. As if it were being DRAWN by an invisible hand, the</p>
<p>        crack forms a LARGE DOOR in the wall. The door slowly OPENS. An almost</p>
<p>        BLINDING WHlTE LIGHT emanates from inside. Tyki ENTERS. The procession</p>
<p>        FOLLOWS.</p>

<p>        INT. WALL</p>

<p>        The procession ascends a TWISTING STONE STAIRCASE, that spirals</p>
<p>        upward, where the light becomes BRIGHTER... BRIGHTER... At the</p>
<p>        stairway top, there is ANOTHER DOORWAY. Tyki and the others ENTER.</p>
<p>        Indiana's body is CARRIED through.</p>

<p>        THE GARDEN OF IMMORTAL PEACHES!</p>

<p>        A breathtakingly beautiful forest of never ending luscious green</p>
<p>        trees, filled with succulent, ripe PEACHES. We have never seen COLORS</p>
<p>        like this. So MAGICAL...so INTENSE... Bright SUNLIGHT shines from a</p>
<p>        vivid blue sky. There is always a RAINBOW here. The procession ENTERS.</p>
<p>        Scraggy, Clare, Betsy and Kezure stare in total WONDERMENT. Betsy is</p>
<p>        PUZZLED by the bright sunlight.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        But... It's... It's the middle of</p>
<p>                        the night...</p>

<p>        Tyki WHISPERS to Scraggy, who explains to Betsy.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Sun always shine in the Garden of</p>
<p>                        Immortal Peaches.</p>

<p>        Clare NODS. Kezure is MESMERIZED by the peach trees. His mouth HANGS</p>
<p>        OPEN. He TURNS to Scraggy.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        These are the peaches that make one</p>
<p>                        ...forever young?...</p>

<p>        Scraggy NODS. Tyki LEADS the procession to a clearing in the garden.</p>
<p>        Many freshly dug GRAVES are here. All of the bodies are carried to</p>
<p>        SEPARATE GRAVES, including Indiana And Bohbala.</p>

<p>        A few feet ahead of the graves, rests the LARGEST PEACH TREE in the</p>
<p>        forest. It is much WIDER and TALLER than the others. There is a small,</p>
<p>        glass encased TOMB built into the tree. Inside of the tomb, is a TINY</p>
<p>        SKELETON. No more than FOUR FEET TALL. The skeleton is adorned with a</p>
<p>        LION SKINNED ROBE and golden CROWN. In its hand, the skeleton clutches</p>
<p>        the famous GOLDEN HOOPED ROD, a glorious, elaborate STAFF. An ancient</p>
<p>        inscription is ETCHED IN STONE over the tomb. Pointing to the</p>
<p>        inscription, Clare TURNS to Scraggy.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        What does it say?...</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                                (translating)</p>
<p>                        "Our Lord... Our Master... Sun...</p>
<p>                        Wu... Kung"</p>

<p>        THE SOUND TRACK MUSIC RISES. It is the tomb of the STONE MONKEY KING.</p>
<p>        Clare exchanges an AWE INSPIRED glance with Betsy, then looks to the</p>
<p>        still body of Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Damn you, Jones! Why couldn't you be</p>
<p>                        here to share this with me!</p>

<p>        The pygmies begin to LOWER the dead bodies, including Indiana and</p>
<p>        Bohbala, into the ground. Tyki reads from ANCIENT SCRIPTURE. Scraggy</p>
<p>        SOBS on the shoulder of Kezure, who continues to stare in ASTONISHMENT</p>
<p>        at the peach trees.</p>

<p>        Suddenly, there is a RUMBLING SOUND. Followed by a slight, TREMOR. The</p>
<p>        trees begin to SWAY, as a HOWLING WIND rushes through them. The tomb</p>
<p>        of Sun Wu Kung GLOWS with a BRIGHT LIGHT. The glass surrounding the</p>
<p>        tomb suddenly SHATTERS. The skeleton's head TURNS. Its body RATTLES.</p>
<p>        Beginning to MOVE. The skeleton STEPS OUT OF THE TOMB.</p>

<p>        Everyone STARES in awe. TERRIFIED.</p>

<p>        The skeleton takes a FEW STEPS forward, STOPS, and RAISES its arms.</p>
<p>        HIGH in the air. The skeleton OPENS its mouth. Emitting a HIGH PITCHED</p>
<p>        ...UNEARTHLY...SCREECH! An ectoplasmic GREEN SMOKE seeps from the</p>
<p>        skeleton's fingers, slowly TRAVELING over the heads of the humans. The</p>
<p>        ectoplasm separates into several INDIVIDUAL LINES, that touch down</p>
<p>        upon EACH OF THE GORILLAS. The ectoplasm ENCIRCLES each the Gorilla's</p>
<p>        bodies. The Gorillas begin to RISE from the ground. HIGH in the air.</p>
<p>        The ectoplasm appears to be CARRYING them toward Sun Wu Kung. As the</p>
<p>        Gorillas TRAVEL through the air, their bodies begin to SHRINK. Growing</p>
<p>        SMALLER. THINNER.</p>

<p>        The humans stare into the SKY. Watching the AMAZING, MAGICAL</p>
<p>        TRANSFORMATION.</p>

<p>        As the Gorillas get CLOSER to Sun Wu Kung, their bodies have shrunken</p>
<p>        to TINY, HAIR-LIKE substances. When the Gorillas ARRIVE at the</p>
<p>        skeleton, they ATTACH themselves to his body. We see that the shrunken</p>
<p>        Gorillas are actually individual HAIRS on the skeleton's body. As the</p>
<p>        countless hairs CONVERGE, the skeleton begins to take SHAPE...FORM...</p>

<p>        SUN WU KUNG COMES TO LIFE! He is UNLIKE anyone or anything we have</p>
<p>        ever seen. HALF-HUMAN. HALF-HONKEY. His face is covered with WRINKLES.</p>
<p>        His wide eyes are COAL BLACK. PROBING. WARM. When he smiles, it is</p>
<p>        DEVILISH, but incredibly CHARMING. His movements are PERKY. QUICK. An</p>
<p>        extremely ADORABLE little fellow. Instantly LOVABLE. But there is a</p>
<p>        STRONG, POWERFUL presense about him. He is indeed, a HEAVENLY FIGURE.</p>

<p>        Sun Wu Kung LOOKS over the congregation. Everyone FALLS to their</p>
<p>        knees. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and a RELUCTANT Kezure do the same.</p>

<p>        Sun Wu Kung PACES through the clearing. He LOOKS into the many graves.</p>
<p>        He is DISTRESSED. TROUBLED. His wrinkled face twists into FURIOUS</p>
<p>        expression. He RAISES his golden hooped rod to the sky. He SCREAMS.</p>
<p>        His old voice CREAKS and GROANS.</p>

<p>                                        SUN WU KUNG</p>
<p>                        We cannot bury these men!... This is</p>
<p>                        a garden of life... Not of death!...</p>

<p>        Betsy WHISPERS to Clare.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Why's he speakin' in English?</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        He is a heavenly being. According to</p>
<p>                        legend, when a heavenly being</p>
<p>                        speaks, men of all countries can</p>
<p>                        understand him. We hear him in</p>
<p>                        English...the pygmies hear him in</p>
<p>                        their language.</p>

<p>        Betsy NODS. Sun Wu Kung CONTINUES his heartfelt scream into the</p>
<p>        heavens.</p>

<p>                                        SUN WU KUNG</p>
<p>                        Return their souls!... I demand</p>
<p>                        it!... Return their souls!</p>

<p>        A few MOMENTS pass. Then...a thick, white cloud ECLIPSES the sun. A</p>
<p>        small hole in the cloud, allows one RAY OF SUNLIGHT to shine through.</p>
<p>        The ray shines down upon ONE PARTICULAR PEACH TREE. Sun Wu Kung TURNS</p>
<p>        to that peach tree. He raises the GOLDEN HOOPED ROD toward the tree.</p>
<p>        He begins to SING an unusual hymn. Suddenly, several peaches magically</p>
<p>        FLY from the trees. They congregate ABOVE the golden hooped rod. The</p>
<p>        peaches SPIN in midair. With quick movements of the rod, Sun Wu Kung</p>
<p>        SENDS several peaches flying OFF SCREEN.</p>

<p>        CAMERA FOLLOWS the magical peaches as they SEPARATE and FLY INTO EACH</p>
<p>        GRAVE. Toward the BODIES OF THE DEAD PYGMIES. Each body is HIT with an</p>
<p>        individual peach. When the peaches MAKE CONTACT with the dead bodies,</p>
<p>        there is a small, colorful EXPLOSION. A small FIREWORKS display. The</p>
<p>        bodies erupt with a BRIGHT GOLDEN GLOW. A few moments PASS. One of the</p>
<p>        bodies STIRS. MOVES. The body SITS UP. Gets to its FEET. ANOTHER BODY</p>
<p>        does the same. So does ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. Soon, the various pygmies</p>
<p>        CLIMB out of the graves. Their wounds have DISAPPEARED. Their life has</p>
<p>        been RESTORED.</p>

<p>        Sun Wu Kung flings the remaining TWO PEACHES into the GRAVES of</p>
<p>        Indiana and Bohbala. There is a small EXPLOSION...followed by the WARM</p>
<p>        GLOW of their bodies. The wound in Indy's chest VANISHES. His eyes POP</p>
<p>        OPEN. To the delight of his friends, Indy STANDS. ALIVE. He is</p>
<p>        PUZZLLED by the surrounding grave. Clare, Scraggy and Betsy HELP</p>
<p>        Indiana OUT of the grave. They SHOWER him with EMBRACES and KISSES.</p>
<p>        But Indy remains CONFUSED. PUZZLED.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        What the hell's goin' on?</p>

<p>        Sun Wu Kung, looking very PLEASED with himself, stands BEHIND Indiana.</p>
<p>        Clare SMILES at Indy.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        I think there is someone you should</p>
<p>                        meet...</p>

<p>        Clare POINTS to behind Indy, who TURNS and sees the smiling SUN WU</p>
<p>        KUNG. Indy is at first SHOCKED... His face breaks into a CHILDLIKE</p>
<p>        SMILE...filled with DELIGHT. He then manages to UTTER...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        You... You're... Sun Wu Kung?...</p>

<p>        Sun Wu Kung STEPS FORWARD. He nods and ANSWERS.</p>

<p>                                        SUN WU KUNG</p>
<p>                        You are... Indiana Jones?...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (taken aback)</p>
<p>                        Huh?... You know me?</p>

<p>                                        SUN WU KUNG</p>
<p>                                (nods)</p>
<p>                        I have watched you for many, many</p>
<p>                        years...from the heavens. I was</p>
<p>                        fascinated by your bravery...your</p>
<p>                        passion...in searching for me.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Well, I... Thanks I'm very honored.</p>

<p>                                        SUN WU KUNG</p>
<p>                        The honor is mine, Doctor Jones. You</p>
<p>                        and your friends have saved my city</p>
<p>                        from ruin.</p>
<p>                                (a pause)</p>
<p>                        I would like to return the favor.</p>

<p>        Sun Wu Kung gives Indiana the GOLDEN HOOPED ROD. Indiana takes the</p>
<p>        PRICELESS ARTIFACT. He STARES at the beautiful rod. He is very MOVED.</p>
<p>        SPEECHLESS. Sun Wu Kung EXPLAINS. RAISES an eyebrow.</p>

<p>                                        SUN WU KUNG</p>
<p>                        The Golden Hooped Rod will be a</p>
<p>                        faithful friend. It is capable of</p>
<p>                        one hundred transformations...and</p>
<p>                        will always remain by your side.</p>

<p>        Indy manages a NOD. Sun Wu Kung SIGHS.</p>

<p>                                        SUN WU KUNG</p>
<p>                        I will explore the heavens for</p>
<p>                        another. Surely, my search will be</p>
<p>                        shorter and less hazardous than</p>
<p>                        yours!</p>

<p>        Indiana SMILES.</p>

<p>        Meanwhile, Kezure uses the oppurtunity to SNEAK AWAY. He DISAPPEARS</p>
<p>        into a cluster of PEACH TREES. He CLIMBS the smallest tree. The GREEDY</p>
<p>        Pirate King begins to PICK several peaches. HIDING them in his</p>
<p>        pockets.</p>

<p>        Sun Wu Kung LOOKS OVER the healthy, restored community of pygmies. The</p>
<p>        Monkey King SMILES.</p>

<p>                                        SUN WU KUNG</p>
<p>                        With my city alive again...I will be</p>
<p>                        able to return to the heavens.</p>
<p>                                (warm smile to Indy and</p>
<p>                                the others)</p>
<p>                        Goodbye...my dear friends.</p>

<p>        Sun Wu Kung again RAISES his arms. Green ECOTPLASM again emanates from</p>
<p>        his fingers. The individual strands of HAIR fly from his body. In a</p>
<p>        reversal of what we saw only moments ago, the strands of hair FLY</p>
<p>        through the air. They grow LARGER...LARGER...until they resume the</p>
<p>        shape of the GORILLAS.</p>

<p>        Sun Wu Kung has RETURNED to his skeletal form. He TURNS and WALKS back</p>
<p>        to his resting place. The pieces of broken glass RE-ASSEMBLE. SEALING</p>
<p>        the tomb.</p>

<p>        Kezure, his pockets STUFFED with peaches, hurriedly REJOINS the</p>
<p>        others. Tyki EMBRACES Bohbala, glad to have his Father ALIVE. Bohbala,</p>
<p>        resuming his position as Ruler, LEADS HIS PEOPLE out of the garden.</p>
<p>        Indiana, CLUTCHING his golden hooped prize, EXITS with the others.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        EXT. CITY GATES - THE FOLLOWING MORNING</p>

<p>        Indiana, Clare, Betsy, Scraggy, Kezure, the Pirates and Crew members,</p>
<p>        have GATHERED outside of the city walls for the journey home. They are</p>
<p>        saying "Goodbye" to TYKI, BOHBALA And the other PYGMIES.</p>

<p>        Clare and Tyki exchange a TEARFUL FAREWELL, communicating in hand</p>
<p>        signals. They share a final EMBRACE. Bohbala again THANKS Indiana for</p>
<p>        his help. Betsy says "Goodbye" to the many GORILLAS. Betsy</p>
<p>        COMMUNICATES in Gorilla hand motions and growls.</p>

<p>        Indiana, holding the Golden Hooped Rod, TURNS and moves across the</p>
<p>        drawbridge. The others FOLLOW. The entire city of pygmies and Gorillas</p>
<p>        CHEER for their departing friends. Indy and the others DISAPPEAR into</p>
<p>        the clouds, walking down the MOUNTAIN PATH. The Lost city GLISTENS in</p>
<p>        the background. The drawbridge CLOSES...until the next visitor</p>
<p>        ARRIVES.</p>

<p>                                                                        DISSOLVE T0:</p>

<p>        EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH - A FEW HOURS LATER</p>

<p>        Early AFTERNOON. The sun is HOT. SCORCHING. Indy and his party REST.</p>
<p>        They NAP in a shady section of the path. CAMERA PANS THE SNOOZING</p>
<p>        BODIES of everyone, coming to a STOP at Indiana. The Golden Hooped Rod</p>
<p>        RESTS beside Indy. A HAND COMES INTO FRAME and GRABS the staff. OTHER</p>
<p>        HANDS MOVE INTO FRAME. They STEAL Indy's WHIP and REVOLVER. They TAKE</p>
<p>        all weapons from Scraggy and his crew members.</p>

<p>        Indiana is awakened by a SWORD. At his THROAT. Indy REACHES for his</p>
<p>        gun and whip...GONE. He LOOKS UP. KEZURE stands over him, holding the</p>
<p>        sword in one hand, the GOLDEN ROD in another. Indy TURNS. The other</p>
<p>        Pirates hold SWORDS and DAGGERS at the throats of Clare, Betsy,</p>
<p>        Scraggy and the crew members. Kezure TWIRLS the golden hooped rod in</p>
<p>        front of him. He SMILES at Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        She is a wonderful treasure...</p>
<p>                        Eh?...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        We had a deal.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                                (moves sword closer to</p>
<p>                                Indy's throat)</p>
<p>                        I have no deals with dead men.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Son of a bitch.</p>

<p>        Kezure LAUGHS. He has REMOVED a peach from his pocket. He SHINES the</p>
<p>        peach on his cloak, and gives a SHRUG to Indiana.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                                (shrugs, laughs)</p>
<p>                        I am an old Pirate, Doctor Jones. Do</p>
<p>                        you suddenly expect me to treat you</p>
<p>                        with kindness and fairness?... It is</p>
<p>                        not my way of life!</p>

<p>        Indy is DISGUSTED. Kezure TAKES A LARGE BITE from the peach. As he</p>
<p>        chews and swallows, Kezure NODS to his men, motioning toward Indy and</p>
<p>        the others.</p>

<p>                                        KEZURE</p>
<p>                        Kill them...</p>
<p>                                (takes another bite of</p>
<p>                                the peach)</p>
<p>                        But save their hair. I will make a</p>
<p>                        coat out of it.</p>

<p>        The men MOVE to kill Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the crew members.</p>
<p>        Suddenly, Kezure emits a LOUD SCREAM. He GRABS his stomach in pain. He</p>
<p>        FALLS to his knees. The HALF EATEN PEACH rolls from his hand. Onto the</p>
<p>        GROUND.</p>

<p>        Indy and Clare RUSH TOWARD Kezure. Something very STRANGE is happening</p>
<p>        to the Pirate King... His hair begins to FALL OUT. His teeth ROT. His</p>
<p>        skin SHRIVELS. His body becomes THINNER. SPINDLY. Kezure has begun to</p>
<p>        RAPIDLY AGE. He continues to SCREAM. In horrible PAIN.</p>

<p>        The Pirates STEP AWAY. FRIGHTENED. The others WATCH IN HORROR.</p>

<p>        Kezure's body CONTORTS. His skin WITHERS... FLAKES... It begins to</p>
<p>        PEEL from his bones. His screams FADE... His eyeballs ROLL OUT of</p>
<p>        their sockets. Only his skeleton REMAINS. It turns BLACK and CRUMBLES</p>
<p>        TO DUST. Only his elaborate clothing REMAINS. The many stolen peaches</p>
<p>        ROLL OUT of his cloak, onto the ground.</p>

<p>        The remaining Pirates DROP THEIR WEAPONS. They RUN OFF down the</p>
<p>        mountain. SCARED to death!</p>

<p>        Indiana HOLDS the half eaten peach in his hand. Betsy is PUZZLED.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        I thought the peaches promised</p>
<p>                        immortality...eternal youth?...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        The garden of immortal peaches</p>
<p>                        promises life only to those who are</p>
<p>                        pure in heart.</p>
<p>                                (pause)</p>
<p>                        Kezure was evil. His heart was</p>
<p>                        filled with greed.</p>

<p>        Indiana DROPS the peach to the ground. He grabs his WHIP, REVOLVER and</p>
<p>        GOLDEN HOOPED ROD. Scraggy and his crew members RETRIEVE their</p>
<p>        weapons. Everyone TURNS, CONTINUING down the mountain path. LEAVING</p>
<p>        Kezure's clothes and the several peaches behind.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        EXT. MOZAMBIQUE - DOCK - A FEW DAYS LATER</p>

<p>        Passengers board a large OCEAN LINER, bound for the United States.</p>
<p>        INDIANA JONES is here. Bags PACKED. He holds a rectangular wooden</p>
<p>        crate, covered with the words "FRAGILE". The Golden Hooped Rod is</p>
<p>        obviously STORED inside. Indy is WAITING for someone. He impatiently</p>
<p>        CHECKS his wristwach. LOOKING around. He GRUMBLES to himself.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Where's Betsy?... The boat leaves in</p>
<p>                        five minutes...</p>

<p>        Suddenly, a HORN interrupts. Indy turns to the DIRECTION OF THE SOUND.</p>
<p>        It is SCRAGGY. He is wearing DRIVING GOGGLES. He rides a battered,</p>
<p>        bruised MOTORCYCLE, attached to a ricketty SIDECAR. The word "TAXI" is</p>
<p>        painted on the sidecar's exterior. Scraggy PULLS UP beside Indiana.</p>
<p>        Scraggy JUMPS OFF the motorcycle. Excitedly, he RUNS toward Indy.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Oh, Indy! Indy! I want to give you</p>
<p>                        something for your journey!</p>

<p>        Scraggy FUMBLES through his pockets. He removes a small bottle of</p>
<p>        PURPLE LIQUID. He HOLDS it out to Indy.</p>

<p>                                        SCRAGGY</p>
<p>                        Take one drink before bed. It keep</p>
<p>                        out all bad spirits.</p>

<p>        Indy DECLINES. He flashes a FLASK OF WHISKEY from inside of his coat</p>
<p>        pocket.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Thanks, Scraggy...</p>

<p>        But this'll keep out all the bad spirits. Scraggy SHRUGS. They are</p>
<p>        suddenly INTERRUPTED.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY (O.S.)</p>
<p>                        Indy!...</p>

<p>        Indiana TURNS. BETSY and CLARE walk toward him. Indy LOOKS at Betsy.</p>
<p>        PUZZLED.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Where're your bags?</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        I'm not leaving.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Huh?... But, you... You have to</p>
<p>                        finish school.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        I'm staying on as Clare's assistant.</p>

<p>        Indy shoots a JEALOUS GLANCE to Clare, then back to Betsy.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        But you're MY assistant.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Not any more. I'm having my credits</p>
<p>                        transfered.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        Why?...</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Clare is a brilliant teacher.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (jealous)</p>
<p>                        So am I.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Yes, but I don't offer a course in</p>
<p>                        seduction.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        You stay out of this.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Indy... I thought you wanted me out</p>
<p>                        of your life...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        That was before I realized how</p>
<p>                        gifted...how talented you are... I</p>
<p>                        mean... I could really use you...</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Especially aboard ship for three</p>
<p>                        weeks. It gets terribly lonely.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        I warned you...</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Indy, I've learned a lot from you.</p>
<p>                        But it's time I started</p>
<p>                        concentrating on a career in</p>
<p>                        anthropology...instead of romance.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (sighs, to Betsy)</p>
<p>                        You've certainly developed a mature</p>
<p>                        attitude.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                                (hugs him)</p>
<p>                        Thanks to you.</p>
<p>                                (pauses, looking into</p>
<p>                                Indy's eyes)</p>
<p>                        You know... I always thought of you</p>
<p>                        as my knight in shining armor...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (flattered)</p>
<p>                        Really?</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        But now, I'll think of you as the</p>
<p>                        Father I never had.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (rolls his eyes)</p>
<p>                        Terrific.</p>

<p>        Clare WALKS up to him. She EXTENDS her hand.</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Doctor Jones...although your libido</p>
<p>                        is questionable, your bravery and</p>
<p>                        intelligence are exceptional.</p>
<p>                                (a smile)</p>
<p>                        It has been an honor working with</p>
<p>                        you.</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (taken aback)</p>
<p>                        Why... Thanks.</p>

<p>        Indy LEANS toward Clare, as if he is going to KISS HER. He RAISES an</p>
<p>        eyebrow. SPEAKING in his smoothest...most suave...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                        You know, Clare...there's</p>
<p>                        something...</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Yes...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (moving closer)</p>
<p>                        ...something I've been wanting to</p>
<p>                        do...</p>

<p>                                        CLARE</p>
<p>                        Yes...</p>

<p>                                        INDIANA</p>
<p>                                (closer)</p>
<p>                        ...since we first met...</p>

<p>        LEANING forward, Indy closes his eyes to KISS Clare. But Clare MOVES</p>
<p>        AWAY. BONZO THE GORILLA enters the FRAME. BONZO KISSES Indy on the</p>
<p>        lips. Indy OPENS his eyes. He tries to MOVE AWAY. But the Gorilla will</p>
<p>        not move, WRAPPING HER ARMS around Indy. The Gorilla WRESTLES Indy to</p>
<p>        the ground.</p>

<p>        By using Gorilla HAND MOTIONS and GRUNTS, Clare manages to persuade</p>
<p>        BONZO to MOVE AWAY from Indiana. Indy WIPES his mouth. Clare, Betsy</p>
<p>        and Scraggy are LAUGHING. Betsy EXPLAINS to Clare.</p>

<p>                                        BETSY</p>
<p>                        Sorry. Guess I left her cage open...</p>
<p>                        she followed us.</p>

<p>        The ocean liner's horn SOUNDS! It begins to DRIFT away from the dock.</p>
<p>        Indiana TURNS and RUNS up the stairs, leading to the boat. The boat is</p>
<p>        a FEW FEET from the dock. Indy LEAPS onto the boat. He MAKES IT. JUST</p>
<p>        IN TIME.</p>

<p>        Indiana pauses... Suddenly UPSET. He realizes that he's FORGOTTEN the</p>
<p>        Golden Hooped Rod! It SITS on the dock. At Scraggy's FEET. As the</p>
<p>        Ocean Liner PULLS AWAY, Indy is about to SCREAM to his friends... But</p>
<p>        Clare PICKS UP the crate. She SHRUGS to Indy. The ocean liner pulls</p>
<p>        FURTHER...FURTHER...from the dock. Indiana is HELPLESS. He CAN'T GO</p>
<p>        BACK.</p>

<p>                                                                        DISSOLVE TO:</p>

<p>        INT. CLARE'S ROOM - THAT EVENING</p>

<p>        Clare is SOUND ASLEEP in bed. CAMERA PANS TO a corner of the room. The</p>
<p>        wooden crate holding the Golden Hooped Rod RESTS here. Suddenly, the</p>
<p>        box's NAILS begin to TWIST. TURN. As if they were being turned by</p>
<p>        INVISIBLE HANDS. They FALL OUT of the box. DROPPING to the floor. ONE</p>
<p>        by ONE. The box SLOWLY OPENS. The Golden Hooped Rod SHIKMERS in the</p>
<p>        moonlight. Suddenly, the staff begins to MOVE. TWISTING. SHRINKING. It</p>
<p>        CHANGES SHAPE...turning into a GOLDEN EAGLE! The bird slowly FLAPS its</p>
<p>        wings and FLIES OUT of the open window. INTO the night. Clare</p>
<p>        continues to peacefully SLEEP.</p>

<p>                                                                        CUT TO:</p>

<p>        EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT</p>

<p>        The full moon ILLUMINATES the night sky. SHIMMERING across the ocean</p>
<p>        waters. Countless BRIGHT STARS sparkle in the night sky. Indy's OCEAN</p>
<p>        LINER sails across the water. The image of an EAGLE appears in the</p>
<p>        night sky. SILHOUETTED against the moon.</p>

<p>        INT. SHIP CABIN</p>

<p>        Indiana Jones is SOUND ASLEEP in his bed. The room's porthole</p>
<p>        mysteriously SWINGS OPEN. The Golden Eagle FLIES inside. The eagle</p>
<p>        TRANSFORMS back into the Golden Hooped Rod. The rod LEANS AGAINST the</p>
<p>        wall. The moonlight REFLECTS the rod, SHINING into Indiana's eyes.</p>
<p>        Indy WAKES. He SITS UP and sees the Golden Hooped Rod. At first, he is</p>
<p>        SHOCKED. He TOUCHES the rod...then comes upon a REALIZATION. The</p>
<p>        CREAKY VOICE of Sun Wu Kung FILLS the SOUNDTRACK.</p>

<p>                                        SUN WU KUNG (V.O.)</p>
<p>                        The Golden Hooped Rod will be a</p>
<p>                        faithful friend. It is capable of</p>
<p>                        one hundred transformations...and</p>
<p>                        will always remain by your side.</p>

<p>        Indy STANDS. He turns and LOOKS out of the porthole. A DREAMY...</p>
<p>        SATISFIED smile covers Indy's face, as he stares at the stars ABOVE.</p>
<p>        SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS. CAMERA PULLS BACK, TO EXTREMELY LONG SHOT of</p>
<p>        the ship SAILING across the ocean.</p>

<p>                                        THE END</p></font></body>
