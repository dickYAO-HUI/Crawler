                                                Registered WGAW

     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS
     AND SOME "OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS
     SOFT COPY.




     FADE IN:

     EXT. SAWYER'S BACKYARD--DAWN

     Elegiac music murmurs as three female and barefoot PAIRS OF
     LEGS in skirts break from tableau to gently engage in Croquet.
     A blue mallet hits a blue ball through a wicket, a green
     mallet knocks a green ball, and a yellow mallet pushes forward
     a yellow ball, all in enticing syncopation.

     Suddenly a red ball rockets through the dew covered grass and
     hits the green ball. The LEGS all stop moving as a FOURTH PAIR
     OF LEGS, this one in stylish shoes and stockings, marches to
     the red ball and steps on it. A red mallet is brought down
     hard on the red ball causing the adjacent green ball to
     thunder out of view. The Pair of Legs manuevering the green
     ball departs. This process of elimination is grimly
     repeated with the yellow ball and yet again with the blue
     ball.

     However, when the BLUE MALLETED PLAYER makes her sad exit,
     the viewer's viewpoint glides along with this particular Pair
     of Legs. A red ball whizzes by. The Legs stop. Another red
     ball malevolently sails past the Legs. Then yet another red
     ball. A fourth red ball makes brutal contact with the Legs
     causing the Player to fall to her knees and into the frame. The
     Player is VERONICA SAWYER.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DAY

     VERONICA SAWYER, a sullen seventeen year old beauty, lies atop
     her bed dressed in a chic but understated ensemble, her eyes
     glazed open in a morning reverie. She blows up at her bangs
     then slides off her bed, launching into voice-over narration
     over the empty bed.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               Heather told me she teaches people
               Real Life.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY--DAY

     Continuing her narration, VERONICA glides through a bustling
     high school hallway with a frozen smile.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               She said Real Life sucks Losers dry.
               If you want to fuck with the eagles,
               you have to learn to fly.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CAFETERIA--DAY

     With her back turned to the viewer, VERONICA stands at the
     outskirts of the cafeteria entrance. The viewer's viewpoint
     approaches and finally curls around VERONICA to reveal that
     she is writing in a diary, wearing a monocle.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               I said so you teach people how to
               spread their wings and fly. She
               said Yes.

     THE DIARY PAGE

     VERONICA'S pen sways across the diary page forming the words
     echoed by her voice-over.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               I said You're Beautiful.

     A sudden off-screen bark from HEATHER MCNAMARA causes the pen
     to recklessly rocket across the written words.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA (O.S.)
               God, come <u>on</u> Veronica!

     VERONICA coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily
     addressing the amusingly robust, conventionally beautiful,
     trendily coiffed HEATHER MCNAMARA.

                             VERONICA
               What's your damage, Heather? You
               ruined my...

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me,
               blame Heather. She told me to haul
               your ass into the caf pronto. Back
               me up, Heather.

     From behind HEATHER MCNAMARA emerges a similarly trendily
     accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif, HEATHER DUKE.
     She is clutching a tattered copy of "The Catcher in the Rye."

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.

                             VERONICA
               Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...

     INT. INSIDE THE CAFETERIA--DAY

     VERONICA, flanked by HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE,
     strides into the lunchroom pandemonium.

     The stunning HEATHER CHANDLER turns from the tray before her
     toward her incoming comrades. She is dressed stylishly and
     expensively but not trendily; her hair, dramatically tied
     back.

                             VERONICA
                       (submissively)
               Hello, Heather.

     Pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper, HEATHER
     CHANDLER smiles. The content of what Heather says is
     consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks
     is sexy, dangerous, and mysterious. She is a mythic bitch.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of
               Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge
               a hot and horny but realistically
               low-key note in Kurt's handwriting
               and we'll slip it into Martha
               Dumptruck's lunch tray.

                             VERONICA
               Shit, Heather. I don't have anything
               against Martha Dunnstock.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               You don't have anything <u>for</u> her
               either. Come on, it'll be Very. The
               note'll give her shower nozzle
               masturbation material for weeks.

                             VERONICA
               I'll think about it.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
                       (looking off)
               Don't think.

     POV ON CAFETERIA LINE

     Unattractive and quite overweight, MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK
     guiltily plops two jellos on her tray and clunks forward in
     line.

     CAFETERIA ENTRANCE

     VERONICA's arm, seemingly involuntary, latches onto the
     outstretched pen.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Splendid. I'll dictate. Veronica
               needs something to write on.
               Heather, bend over.

     Both HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE bend over. HEATHER
     CHANDLER violently laughs.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               How nice. Two assholes: no waiting.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE stand erect, embarrassed.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Heather Duke, back down.

     VERONICA scurries to the contorting HEATHER DUKE.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Dear Martha, you're so sweet..

     THE JOCKS' TABLE

     The traditionally handsome KURT KELLY and the massive RAM sit
     with other typical Jocks taking in VERONICA and the HEATHERS.

                             KURT
               It'd be so righteous to be in a
               Veronica Sawyer-Heather Chandler
               sandwich. Punch it in, Ram.

     KURT and RAM raise their right arms and slam their fists
     together.

                             RAM
               Hell yes. I wanna set a Heather on
               my Johnson and just start spinning
               her like a fucking pinwheel.

     RAM makes a frantic spinning motion.

     CAFETERIA ENTRANCE

     In slow motion, VERONICA finishes the note and rises up along
     with her makeshift desk, HEATHER DUKE.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line.

     VERONICA hands the note to an impressed HEATHER CHANDLER.

     MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK pays the CASHIER and then, grasping
     her lunch tray with both hands, moves toward VERONICA and the
     HEATHERS.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA excitedly tugs on HEATHER CHANDLER'S arm as
     MARTHA approaches. With a tranquil smile, HEATHER CHANDLER
     passes the note to her frantic disciple.

     In a self-consciously clandestine manner, HEATHER MCNAMARA
     saunters past MARTHA then wields around to sneakily tuck the
     note onto MARTHA's tray.

     The slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles
     past a magnetic preppie PETER DAWSON and a thin, black,
     bespectacled DENNIS. The guys are working a large stand which
     has a cashbox reading THE FOODLESS FUND and a banner reading
     WESTERBURG FEEDS THE WORLD.

                             PETER
               Come on people, let's give that
               leftover lunch money to people
               without lunches! Those tater tots
               you threw away today are a delicacy
               in Africa! They're Thanksgiving dinner!

     HEATHERS' TABLE

     The Girls reach their table with HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER
     DUKE sitting themselves down first.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
                       (looking to the stand)
               God, aren't they fed yet? Do they
               even have Thanksgiving in Africa?

                             VERONICA
                       (low key sarcasm)
               Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater
               tots; it's a real party continent.

     HEATHER CHANDLER draws up a clipboard.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Sawyer. Guess what today is?

                             VERONICA
               Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So
               what's the question?

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Yeah, so what's the question?

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               God-damn Heather, you were with me
               in Study Hall when I thought of it.
               Such a pillowcase.

                             HEATHER DUKE
                       (hurt)
               I forgot.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER briskly bop away from the table
     as a wounded HEATHER DUKE retreats to The Catcher in the Rye.

                             VERONICA
               Hey, this question wouldn't be that
               bizarro thing you were babbling
               about over the phone last......

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he
               gave me another topic that was
               political, I'd spew burrito chunks.

     VERONICA shakes her head and looks off. She's suddenly
     captured by the sight of a JAMES DEANESQUE GUY sitting stark
     in a long, tan gunslinger coat, behind a <u>Rebel</u> <u>Without</u> <u>a</u> <u>Cause</u>
     lunchbox. They make eye contact.

     Transfixed, VERONICA crashes into seated BETTY FINN, a
     slightly overweight, unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by
     clones.

                             BETTY
               Sorry Veronica.

                             VERONICA
               Betty Finn. Gosh.....

     VERONICA crouches down, embarrassed and rueful.

                             VERONICA
               I'm really sorry I couldn't make it
               to your birthday party last month.

                             BETTY
               That's okay. Your Mom said you had
               a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip
               my own birthday party for a date.

     VERONICA gently laughs at BETTY's innocent awe.

                             VERONICA
              Don't say that.

                             BETTY
              Oh Ronnie, you have to look at
              what I dug up the other day.

     BETTY pulls from her purse a picture showing a YOUNG BETTY
     FINN AND VERONICA SAWYER, arm-in-arm, dressed in Halloween
     costumes: BETTY is an angel, VERONICA is a witch.

     VERONICA glows at the photo until HEATHER CHANDLER tows
     VERONICA away causing the picture to fall face up on the
     floor.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

                             VERONICA
               I was talking with someone!

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Color me impressed. I thought you
               grew out of Betty Finn.

     THE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE

     A coolly coed cabal of Country Club Kids icily eye the
     approaching VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER. Country Club
     kid COUTRNEY sourly speaks out.

                             COURTNEY
               Oh great. Here comes Heather.

                             KEITH
               Shit.

     MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE

     Alone at a table in the Siberia of the cafeteria, MARTHA
     finishes a forkful of chicken. She spears her plate again and
     brings the fork up. <u>The</u> note is wedged inside it.

     THE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE

     HEATHER CHANDLER, Veronica in tow, hits the Country Club Kids
     with a salvo of false pleasantness, capped by a scowling
     smile.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Hi Courtney. Love your blouse. Ooh,
               let me snare a tater.

     COURTNEY expresses elation in spite of herself as HEATHER
     CHANDLER delicately takes a tot and turns around to face
     VERONICA. HEATHER CHANDLER inserts her finger in her mouth
     doing the "induce-vomiting" signal before devouring the tot
     and turning back around.

                             COURTNEY
               Thanks. I just got it last night at
               the Limited. Totally blew my allowance.

     HEATHER CHANDLER raises her clipboard. VERONICA closes her
     eyes and shakes her head with a half-smile.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               That's pretty very. Now check this out. You
               win five million dollars from Publishers
               Sweepstakes, but on the same day what's-
               his-face gives you the check, aliens
               land on earth and say they're going
               to blow up the world in two days.
               What would you do?

     A stunned tableau; until Country Club Kid KEITH speaks.

                             KEITH
               That's easy. I'd just slide that wad
               over to my father. He's like one of
               the top brokers in the state.

                             VERONICA
               Wake up. In two days, Earth's going
               up like a Roman Candle. Crab Nebula City.

                             KEITH
               Man, in two days, my dad could
               double my money. Triple it.

                             COURTNEY
               If I got that money, I'd give it
               all to the Homeless. Every cent.

                             VERONICA
               You're beautiful.

     THE FOODLESS FUND STAND

     PETER reaches into the Foodless Fund Box and takes some bills.

                             PETER
               Dennis, my man, run over to Mickey
               D.'s and get me a Big Mac and some fries.

                             DENNIS
               But that's the Foodless Fund money.

                             PETER
               Hey, even Bob Geldof's got to eat.
               If it makes you feel better, bag the
               fries, and nab yourself an Apple Pie.

     CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE

     HEATHER CHANDLER drags VERONICA down a cafeteria lane.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               If you're going to openly be a bitch....

                             VERONICA
                       (submissive)
               I'm sorry, it's just why can't we
               talk to different kinds of people?

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I
               look like Mother Theresa? If I did,
               I probably wouldn't mind talking to
               the Geek Squad.

     She points to a table of unfashionably dressed and coiffed
     students. Some wear glasses, some wear braces, some wear
     both.

     THE GEEKS' TABLE

     The GEEKS react to being pointed at. Their boney leader RODNEY
     splatters milk over himself.

                             RODNEY
               Did you see that? Heather Number
               One looked right at us.

                             BIG CYNIC
               It must be love.

     CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE

     VERONICA confronts HEATHER CHANDLER.

                             VERONICA
               Doesn't it bother you that everyone in
               the school thinks you're a piranha?

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Like I give a shit. They all want me,
               as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped
               at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.

                             VERONICA
               Pretend you're a missionary saving
               a colony of cootie victims.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
                       (giving in)
               Whatever. I don't believe this. We're
               going to a party at Remington University
               tonight and we're brushing up our
               conversation skills with the
               scum of the school.

     MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE

     Her sweaty lips moving rapidly, MARTHA anxiously reads the
     note.

     THE GEEKS' TABLE

     The nervous GEEKS fidget and roughhouse each other in an
     involuntarily immature reaction to their beautiful
     interviewers.

                             GEEK WITH BRACES
               No seriously, I'd probably go to
               Egypt. With a girl.

                             BIG CYNIC
               Taking a hooker to the Pyramids on
               the last day of Mankind. You
               sentimental old fart.

                             BRACES
               Geez, forget it.

                             VERONICA
               What about you Rodney?

                             RODNEY
                       (quietly to the others)
               I told you she knew my name.
                       (beat of contemplation)
               I'd change my life. New clothes.
               New haircut. New house. New home.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               How sad! Blowing all your cash on
               two days of trying to be hip.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     VERONICA tugs HEATHER CHANDLER away from the table.

                             VERONICA
               If you're going to openly be a bitch....

     As HEATHER CHANDLER continues to guffaw, VERONICA again
     catches sight of the JAMES DEANESQUE GUY. He wraps his fingers
     around an egg and unfolds them back. The egg is gone. He
     smiles. VERONICA smiles back.

     Her trance is broken by a boisterous HEATHER MCNAMARA and
     HEATHER DUKE who careen into the two pollsters.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               God, scan on Martha Dumptruck.

     POV ON MARTHA

     MARTHA looks up from the note to the JOCKS' table and KURT
     KELLY, then flustered, back down at the note.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               This is the part I hate. The waiting.
               I'd say we're like twenty minutes from
               major humiliation. Come on, Veronica.

     HEATHER CHANDLER floats off. A disturbed VERONICA takes a
     moment to react.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Veronica?

     VERONICA follows the leader. She calls out.

                             VERONICA
               Damn..

     EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT--DAY

     VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER march into the school parking
     lot toward four HEAVY METALERS (one female) hanging out on a
     car hood. The girls' conversation is heard in voice-over.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               ..you Heather. Deep down all teenagers
               are the same. Didn't you see The
               Breakfast Club?

     INT. CAFETERIA--BETTY FINN'S TABLE--DAY

     VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER set themselves down with BETTY
     FINN and her LOOK-ALIKE FRIENDS.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)
               Look at me. I look great. I'm the girl
               in the commercials and the videos.

     JOCKS' TABLE

     VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER warily stand at the outskirts of
     the JOCKS' bastion of vulgarity.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)
               I'm the blonde in the bikini on the
               horse holding a Pepsi can.

     INT. STONERS' HALLWAY--DAY

     In a dark, smoky hallway, VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER cough
     toward a batch of STONERS in tattered forms of dress.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)
               I'm the princess being spanked on the
               throne by Billy Idol's guitarist's guitar.

     INT. THE FOODLESS FUND STAND--DAY

     VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER accost PETER DAWSON at the
     Foodless Fund stand.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)
               What do I get out of being friends
               with losers. I give them a piece of
               a winner and they stain me with loserness.

     EXT. PARKING LOT--DAY

     Heavy Metaler MATT grins.

                             MATT
               You get five million dollars but
               some Martians are going to zap you
               in two days. You hear that, Clyde?
               That's got to be the most spooky-ass
               question I've ever heard.

     INT. CAFETERIA--BETTY FINN'S TABLE--DAY

     BETTY FINN daintily peeps up.

                             BETTY FINN
               I think we should use the money
               for an End-of-the-world get-together.
               We could invite <u>guys</u>.

     JOCKS' TABLE

     RAM sputters out some chicken to bellow.

                             RAM
               I'd pay Madonna one million dollars
               to ride my face like the Kentucky
               Derby. She should be paying me, though.

     INT. STONERS' HALLWAY--DAY

     A FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET starts to speak, then stops...

                             FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET
               What?

     INT. CAFETERIA--THE FOODLESS FUND STAND--DAY

     PETER DAWSON lashes out.

                             PETER DAWSON
               This is important. With taxes, I'd
               be only getting 3.5 million and....

     EXT. PARKING LOT--DAY

     Heavy Metaler CLYDE turns from his friend MATT.

                             CLYDE
               If you want a good way to go out
               before the aliens land, get a lion
               from the zoo. Put a remote control
               bomb up its butt. When the lion starts
               tearing you up, press the bomb button.
               You and the lion die like as one.

     Two Heavy Metal lovers, JACKIE and STEVE, intertwined against
     the windshield blankly respond.

                             JACKIE AND STEVE
               Cool.

     INT. CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE--DAY

     VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER continue their conversation
     chugging through another busy cafeteria lane.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Just imagine somebody like your
               quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty
               Finn doing a Crest commercial. No
               one would buy Crest.

                             VERONICA
               Don't tell me. Crest would be
               stained with loserness.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?

     HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE burst back between them.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Oh God, here we go...

     POV ON MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK

     MARTHA, with awkward apprehension, stumbles toward KURT and
     the JOCKS. VERONICA and the HEATHERS stop breathing.

     MARTHA mumbles something unintelligible from where the girls
     stand. KURT'S head detonates with a terrifying cackle. MARTHA
     flees the cafeteria in horror. VERONICA spins away from her
     mirthful friends in disgust and makes eye contact with the
     similarly disturbed JAMES DEANESQUE GUY.

     VERONICA lurches away. She brakes against the Foodless Fund
     stand where PETER DAWSON is hollering away.

                             PETER
               A dime increases the time! A buck
               brings good luck! Hi Veronica. A
               five keeps the neighborhood alive!
               A ten and you die without sen!

     HEATHER CHANDLER wings a twenty dollar bill into the cashbox.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
                       (to Veronica)
               You wanted to become a member of
               the most powerful clique in the
               school. If I wasn't already the
               head of it, I'd want the same thing.

                             VERONICA
               I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               That episode with the note back there
               was for all of us to enjoy, but you
               seem determined to ruin my day.

                             VERONICA
                       (slapping her knee)
               We made a girl want to consider
               suicide. What a scream. What a jest.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Come on you jerk. You know you used
               to have a sense of humor.

     INT. GIRLS BATHROOM--DAY

     Combing their hair in the bathroom mirror, the HEATHERS speak
     in comically whining-and-pathetic imitations of Martha
     Dumptruck as VERONICA shakes her head with a half-smile.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.

     HEATHER DUKE's gentle off-screen voice slices in.

                             HEATHER DUKE (O.S.)
               Veronica, could you come back here?

               HEATHER CHANDLER AND HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Gross!

                             VERONICA
               A true friend's work is never done.

     VERONICA reveals her right index finger is cut noticeably
     short, then walks over to the stalls.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Color me nauseous.

     THE STALL

     VERONICA stands in a tight stall with an ashamed HEATHER DUKE.

                             VERONICA
               Maybe you should see a doctor.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Yeah, maybe.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER (O.S.)
               Come on Heather. We want another
               look at today's lunch.

                             VERONICA
               Geez, don't listen to them.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA (O.S.)
               Did she have the pie or the ice
               cream for dessert?
                       (like a game show host)
               And the answer <u>is</u>.

     HEATHER DUKE holds up her copy of The Catcher in the Rye and
     makes a bizarrely defiant smile.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in
               the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put
               up with their bogus nonsense.

                             VERONICA
               Well, you better move Holden out
               of the way or he's going to get spewed.

     HEATHER DUKE puts down her book and opens her mouth. VERONICA
     sticks her finger in.

     CAFETERIA ENTRANCE

     A gnarly melange of chicken and potatoes is scraped off a
     plate into a cafeteria trashcan as VERONICA and the HEATHERS
     stroll by outside. VERONICA pauses to peer in at the JAMES
     DEANESQUE GUY.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               God Veronica, drool much? His name's
               Jason Dean. He's in my American History.

                             VERONICA
               Give me the clipboard.

     As VERONICA walks off, HEATHER MCNAMARA oinks out some amusing
     sexual noises.

     CAFETERIA/JASON DEAN'S TABLE

     VERONICA saunters to JASON DEAN.

                             VERONICA
               Hello Jason Dean.

                             JASON
               Greetings and salutations. Call me
               J.D. Are you a Heather?

                             VERONICA
               No, a Veronica. Sawyer. This may
               seem like a stupid question....

                             J.D.
               There are no stupid questions.

                             VERONICA
               If you inherit five million dollars
               the same day aliens tell the earth
               they're blowing us up in two days,
               what would you do?

                             J.D.
                       (suavely)
               That's the stupidest question I've
               ever heard.

     JOCKS' TABLE

     The JOCKS witness VERONICA and J.D.

                             RAM
               Who does that new kid think he is
               with that coat? Bo Diddley?

                             KURT
               Veronica is into his act. No doubt.

                             RAM
               Let's kick his ass.

                             KURT
               Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old
               for that crap. Let's give him a
               scare though.

     J.D.'S TABLE

     An intrigued J.D. laconically answers <u>the</u> question.

                             J.D.
               Probably just row on out to the
               middle of a lake. Bring along my
               sax, some tequila, and some Bach.

                             VERONICA
               How very.

     HEATHER CHANDLER breaks VERONICA's daze of admiration.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Come on.

                             VERONICA (to J.D.)
               Later.

                             J.D.
               Definitely.

     KURT and RAM move into the exiting VERONICA's place.
     RAM sticks his finger through a piece of pie on J.D.'s plate.

                             RAM
               You going to eat this?

                             KURT
               What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when
               you told him you were moving to
               Sherwood, Ohio?

                             RAM
               Answer him dick!

                             KURT
               Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria
               have a No Fags Allowed Rule?

                             J.D.
               It seems to have an open door policy
               for assholes though, doesn't it?

                             KURT
               What did you say dickweed?

                             J.D.
               I'll repeat myself.

     J.D. gracefully stands, reaches into his coat, and pulls out a
     .357 Magnum. He fires twice at the viewer.

     EXT. THE SAWYER BACKYARD--DAY

     Croquet wickets have been set up in standard form. VERONICA
     and the HEATHERS stand at various positions in the yard
     holding different colored mallets next to matching balls.
     HEATHER CHANDLER knocks her ball through the middle wicket.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               God, they won't expell him. They'll
               just suspend him for a week or something.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               He used a real gun. They should
               throw his ass in jail.

                             VERONICA
               No way. He used blanks. All J.D.
               really did was ruin two pairs of
               pants...Maybe not even that...
                       (giggling)
               Can you bleach out urine stains?

     HEATHER CHANDLER knocks her red ball into HEATHER DUKE'S green
     one.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought
               you were giving up on high school guys.

                             VERONICA
               Never say never.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               What are you going to do, Heather?
               Take the two shots or send me out?

     The Girls look to the doelike HEATHER DUKE with incredulous
     faces.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Did you have a brain tumor for
               breakfast? First you ask if you can
               be red, knowing that I'm <u>always</u> red...

     HEATHER CHANDLER places her foot on her red ball. She swings
     her mallet down hard on the red ball sending the adjacent
     green one rocketing into a flower bed.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Shit.

     HEATHER CHANDLER's next shot falls short of the next wicket.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
                       (to HEATHER DUKE)
               Damn. It's your turn Heather.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               No, it's Heather's turn.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA hits her ball through a wicket and squeals.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Anyway, I can say never to high
               school. I've got David.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               King David.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Maybe when you hit maturity you'll
               understand the diff between a Remington
               University man like David and a
               Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam-
               thank-you-maam" Sweeney.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA misses her next shot.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Ram's sweet. Yo Heather, you're up.

     HEATHER DUKE tries to navigate a shot from the flower bed.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               No way, no day!

                             VERONICA
               Give it up girl!

     As her friends howl, HEATHER DUKE slams her ball out of the
     flower bed. The ball bounces off a tree and amazingly goes
     through a wicket. HEATHER DUKE squeals in delight.

              VERONICA                      HEATHER MCNAMARA
         Holy <u>shit</u>!               God, that was unbelievable!

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
              What. A. Shot.

     HEATHER DUKE's next shot falls short of the next wicket.
     VERONICA begins setting up her shot.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               So tonight's the night. Are you
               two excited?

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her
               first Remington Party. Blow it tonight
               girl and it's keggers with kids all
               next year.

                             VERONICA
                       (missing her shot)
               Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've
               been set up with? Witty and urbane
               pre-lawyer or albino accountant?

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Don't worry. David says he's very
               so he's very.

     HEATHER CHANDLER again hits her ball into HEATHER DUKE'S.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Why?

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Why not?

     HEATHER CHANDLER slams HEATHER DUKE's ball back into the
     flower bed. VERONICA'S MOM calls out the back screen door.

                             MOM
               Heather, your Mother's here.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Come on whoever wants a ride.

     As the HEATHERS head into the house, VERONICA picks up HEATHER
     DUKE'S ball and exuberantly throws it back toward the wickets.

     Veronica's MOM, carrying a tray of pate, and DAD, carrying a
     Robert Ludlum book, place themselves around a patio table.

                             DAD
               Take a break Veronica, sit down.

                             VERONICA
               All right.

     VERONICA sinks into the empty middle deck chair.

                             DAD
               So what was the first week of
               Spring Vacation withdrawl like?

                             VERONICA
               I don't know, it was okay, I guess.

                             MOM
               Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?

                             VERONICA
               I guess.

                             MOM
               Any contestants worth mentioning?

                             VERONICA
               May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark
               horse now in the running.

                             DAD
                       (looking up)
               Goddamn. Will somebody please tell
               me why I read this spy crap.

                             VERONICA
                       (smiling)
               Because you're an idiot.

                             DAD
               Oh yeah, that's it.

     DAD immediately returns to reading with a wide grin.

                             MOM
                       (shaking her head)
               You two....

                             VERONICA
               Great pate, but I'm going to have
               to motor if I want to be ready for
               the party tonight.

     EXT. OUTSIDE 7-11--NIGHT

     A Volkswagen Cabriolet pulls up in front of a 7-11 with
     HEATHER CHANDLER at the wheel. VERONICA pops out of the
     car, into the store. HEATHER CHANDLER clamors to her.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Corn nuts!

     INT. 7-11--NIGHT

     Stylishly dressed-to-massacre, VERONICA reaches out to a bag
     of Corn Nuts as J.D.'s off-screen voice disarms her.

                             J.D. (O.S.)
               You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?

                             VERONICA
               No, but if you're nice I'll let
               you buy me a Slurpee. You know
               your 7-11speak pretty well.

                             J.D.
               I've been moved around all my life;
               Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood
               Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any
               town, any time, I can pop a Ham and
               Cheese in the microwave and feast on
               a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.

                             VERONICA
               Really? That thing in the caf
               today was pretty severe.

                             J.D.
               The extreme always makes an impression,
               but you're right, it was severe. Did
               you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?

                             VERONICA
               I didn't. Cherry.

     VERONICA smiles at her Coolness. J.D. returns the smile.

     EXT. 7-11 PARKING LOT--NIGHT

     VERONICA and J.D. slurp by J.D.'s ferocious motorcycle.

                             VERONICA
               Great bike.

     HEATHER CHANDLER sounds her car horn with a grimace. VERONICA
     glares at her then turns back to J.D.

                             J.D.
               Just a humble perk from my Dad's
               Construction company or should I
               say Deconstruction company?

                             VERONICA
               I don't know. Should you?

                             J.D.
               My father seems to enjoy tearing
               things down more than putting things up.
               Seen the commerical? "Bringing every
               State to a Higher State."

                             VERONICA
               Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's
               Big Bud Dean Construction. Must be
               rough. Moving place to place.

                             J.D.
               Everybody's life's got static. Is
               your life perfect?

                             VERONICA
                       (gently joking)
               Sure, I'm on my way to a party
               at Remington University.

     VERONICA grows serious as the car horn sounds again.

                             VERONICA
               It's not perfect. I don't really
               like my friends.

                             J.D.
               I don't really like your friends either.

                             VERONICA
               It's like they're just people I
               work with and our job is being
               popular and shit.

                             J.D.
               Maybe it's time for a vacation.

     The car horn blares again.

     INT. DORMITORY ROOM--NIGHT

     DAVID, Heather Chandler's fine looking college beau, leads
     VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER into a cramped, eclectically
     tacky dorm room. Music pounds the door.

     The semi-handsome BRAD chats atop a desk with BRAD'S FRIEND.

                             DAVID
               Throw your coats on the bed, girls.

                             BRAD
               That exam was so bogus.

                             BRAD'S FRIEND
               Oh I <u>know</u>. Which exam?

                             DAVID
               Veronica, this is Brad.

                             BRAD
               Excellent. Did you girls bring
               your partying slippers?

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Yeah, let's party.

                             DAVID
               She loves to party.

     As they head out the door, BRAD whispers something in BRAD'S
     FRIEND's ear causing the pair to snarl off a laugh.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     The viewer is taken back and forth from a shattered post-party
     VERONICA to the traumatic dormitory party itself. The sobbing
     monocoled VERONICA writes at her desk.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               Dear Diary, I want to kill and you
               have to believe.....damn pen!

     VERONICA frenziedly scribbles, trying to get her pen to
     write. She throws the pen across the room and pulls out
     another.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               You have to believe it's for more
               than selfish reasons. More than a
               spoke in my menstrual cycle. You
               have to believe me.

     INT. DORMITORY HALLWAY--NIGHT

     The chaotic hallway rumbles with beer cups and loud music.
     VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER's stylish garb clashes with the
     laid-back dress of the COLLEGE STUDENTS.

     BRAD anxiously hands VERONICA a cup of beer as he watches
     DAVID and HEATHER CHANDLER move through a staircase door.

                             BRAD
               So, are you a cheerleader?

                             VERONICA
                       (dealing with a jerk)
               No, not at all.
                             BRAD
               You're pretty enough to be one.

                             VERONICA
               Gee, thanks.

                             BRAD
               It's so great to be able to talk
               to a girl and not have to ask
               "What's your major?" I hate that.

     They uncomfortably sip their beers. A deadly pause ensues.

                             BRAD
               So when you go to college, what kind
               of subjects do you think you'll study?

     INT. DAVID'S DORM ROOM

     HEATHER CHANDLER and DAVID sit on the latter's bed, surrounded
     by a PC and a series of obnoxious Ferrari posters. They kiss.
     DAVID doing most of the work.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Come on David, let's go back to the party.

                             DAVID
                       (unzipping his pants)
               Don't worry, we will. You're just so
               hot tonight. I can't control myself.

     DAVID pushes HEATHER CHANDLER's head down.

     INT. DORM HALLWAY--NIGHT

     BRAD has given up on conversation.

                             BRAD
               So what do you say we head up to my
               room and have a real party. I've got the
               best Windham Hill C.D. collection
               in the dorm.

     BRAD'S FRIEND approaches before VERONICA can show disgust.

                             BRAD'S FRIEND
               Brad-ley, Hennesey's looking for
               you. He says he owes you for blow
               and he just got some product himself.

                             BRAD
               You're kidding. That pecker actually
               scored something on his own?

                             BRAD'S FRIEND
                       (ambling off)
               He's in Sheila's room, big guy. Party up.

                             BRAD
               Excellent. Veronica, ever do <u>cocaine</u>?

                             VERONICA
               Ever since Phil Collins did that anti-
               drug thing on MTV I refuse everything.

                             BRAD
               Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't
               drinking and driving?

                             VERONICA
               Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?

                             BRAD
               Right. Hey, don't run away now.

     With a wink, BRAD squirms off. VERONICA dashes into the room
     with the coats.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     VERONICA rampages through her diary.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               Seventeen is the last year Mom buys
               the Twinkies. When you make the
               jump from working weekends at Pizza
               Hut to thirty years at I.B.M., you
               lose something. Not innocence -- power.

     J.F.K. the cat jumps onto the Diary.

                             VERONICA
               J.F.K.!

     VERONICA flings the screeching cat off and continues.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               Christ, I can't explain it, but I'm
               allowed an understanding that my
               parents and these Remington University
               assholes have chosen to ignore. I
               understand I must stop Heather.

     INT. DORM "COAT" ROOM--NIGHT

     Panting, VERONICA collapses at a desk in the "coat" room. She
     draws a Vodka bottle from a stockpile of liquor and pours
     some in her beer cup, slouching down in her chair.

     VERONICA lights a match from a 7-11 matchbook. She eerily
     brings her hand closer and closer to the fire until it
     touches.

     With an eek of pain, she tosses the match away into the Vodka
     cup, setting it afire. VERONICA laughs to herself before
     tossing the flaming cup out the window.

     EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY--NIGHT

     The flaming cup lands in a large rusted garbage can filled
     with other cups and various refuse. The flames spread...

     INT. DORMITORY BATHROOM--NIGHT

     A dejected HEATHER CHANDLER walks into a multi-mirror-and-sink
     bathroom. Using a glass off one of the sinks, she gargles some
     water and then spits it at her own reflection.

     INT. THE DORM "COAT" ROOM--NIGHT

     VERONICA closes the window as BRAD opens the door.

                             BRAD
               How's my little cheerleader? Now I
               know everyone at your high school
               isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.

                             VERONICA
               Hey really, I don't feel so great.

                             BRAD
               Let's do it on the coats. It'll
               be excellent.

     BRAD plops down onto the bed of coats and begins bouncing.

                             VERONICA
               I have a little prepared speech I
               give when my suitor wants more
               than I'd like to give him....
               Gee Blank, I had a nice....

                             BRAD
               Save the speeches for Malcom X.
               I just wanna get laid.

                             VERONICA
               You don't deserve my fucking speech!

     VERONICA yanks up her coat from beneath BRAD on the bed
     causing him to slide off onto the floor.

     INT. DORM HALLWAY--NIGHT

     VERONICA storms into the hallway but slows down when she sees
     she's attracting attention. She notices an incited BRAD
     slither to the smiling DAVID who chats with some STUDENTS,
     HEATHER CHANDLER on his arm.

     BRAD causes DAVID's smile to ever-so-slightly diminish. DAVID
     whispers to HEATHER CHANDLER who proceeds to set down her beer
     and walk toward VERONICA.

     EXT. DORMITORY ALLEY--NIGHT

     The fire in the trashcan is raging.

     INT. DORM HALLWAY--NIGHT

     A steel faced HEATHER CHANDLER comes face-to-face with
     VERONICA.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               What's your damage? Brad says
               you're being a real cooze.

                             VERONICA
               Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going
               to throw up. Can we jam, please?

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               No. Hell no.

     VERONICA'S eyes fall shut in a near-faint. She flings herself
     down off-screen with some ugly wretching sounds.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     VERONICA savagely scrawls in her diary, tears burning fierce.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               Betty Finn was a true friend and I
               sold her out for a bunch of Swatchdogs
               and Diet Cokeheads. Killing Heather'd
               be like offing the Wicked Witch of the
               West. Or is it East? <u>West</u>! I sound
               like a psycho. Tomorrow I'll be kissing
               her aerobicized ass but tonight let me
               dream of a world without Heather. A
               world where I am free.

     INT. DORM HALLWAY--NIGHT

     VERONICA rises into view with tinges of vomit on her mouth. A
     smile breaks across HEATHER CHANDLER's granite puss. VERONICA
     runs off as STUDENTS laugh in the background.

     EXT. DORMITORY ALLEY--NIGHT

     VERONICA charges into the alley. She whips around to face a
     screeching HEATHER CHANDLER. In back of VERONICA, the trashcan
     bellows like Mt. Vesuvius.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               You stupid cunt!

                             VERONICA
               You goddamn bitch!

     The flickering flames cast HEATHER CHANDLER in a demonic
     light.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               You were nothing before you met me!
               You were playing Barbies with Betty
               Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a
               Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout
               Cookie! I got you into a Remington
               Party! What's my thanks? It's on the
               hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!

                             VERONICA
               Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
                       (totally in control)
               Monday morning, you're history. I'll
               tell everyone about tonight. Transfer
               to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson.
               No one at Westerburg's going to let
               you play their reindeer games.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     VERONICA flings her diary across the room where it hits the
     wall behind the stunning figure of J.D. VERONICA gasps.

                             J.D.
               Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.

                             VERONICA
                       (exhaling deeply)
               S'okay....

                             J.D.
               I saw the croquet set-up in the back.
               Up for a match?

     VERONICA is simultaneously dismayed and exhilarated. She seems
     ready to burst out all her anxieties but instead....

                             VERONICA
               Sure. But I'm Blue.

     EXT. THE SAWYER BACKYARD--LATE NIGHT

     The viewer's viewpoint glides through the grass of Veronica's
     backyard uncovering combinations of wickets and articles of
     clothing. A pair of girls shoes and a pair of guys shoes rest
     together by the first wicket.

                             J.D. (V.O.)
               Goddamn, no wonder you looked so
               mangled when I came through the window.

     Feminine socks and masculine socks lay crumpled by the next wicket.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               I've always treated Heather's teen
               queen power plays as bullshit.....

     As VERONICA quiveringly pauses, a stylish blouse and a rugged
     shirt are revealed mingling by another wicket.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               But I'm really scared. Who am I going
               to eat lunch with on Monday? I sound
               like an Afterschool Special.

     The viewer's viewpoint moves to a dress and a pair of jeans
     resting side by side at another wicket.

                             J.D. (V.O.)
               That was my first game of Strip
               Croquet, you know. I thank you.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               You're welcome. It's a lot more
               interesting than just flinging
               off your clothes and boning away
               on the neighbor's swing set.

     VERONICA'S blue mallet has been staked into the ground. Her
     panties hang on one end, J.D.'s underwear hangs on the other.

                             J.D. (O.S.)
               Well, I don't know. There's
               something to be said for...Ouch!

     VERONICA and J.D. are finally revealed, entangled in an artful
     pose upon J.D.'s gunslinger coat. They warmly kiss. VERONICA
     breaks off to uneasily giggle.

                             VERONICA
               What a night.

     J.D. gently bites in to VERONICA's neck. VERONICA grooves on
     it, closing her eyes tightly.

                             VERONICA
               What a life. I almost moved into high
               school out of sixth grade because I
               was some genius. We all decided to
               chuck the idea because I'd have
               trouble making friends, blah-blah-blah.

     VERONICA slides her head down against J.D.'s chest and
     gracefully rests on his lap. Gently fighting slumber, she
     murmurs up to J.D., who showers her face with slow kisses.

                             VERONICA
               Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use
               my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss
               to wear and how to hit three keggers
               before curfew. Some genius.

                             J.D.
               Heather Chandler is one bitch that
               deserves to die.

                             VERONICA
               Killing her won't solve anything.

                             J.D.
               A well-timed lightning bolt through
               her window and Monday morning, all
               the other heathers, shit, everybody
               would be cast fucking adrift.

                             VERONICA
               Well then, I'll pray for rain.

                             J.D.
               See the condoms in the grass over
               there. We killed tonight, Veronica.
               We murdered our baby.

                             VERONICA
               Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.

                             J.D.
               Just saying it's not hard to end a life.

                             VERONICA
               There's a big difference between
               the most popular girl in the school
               and dead sperm.

     They laugh. VERONICA maneuvers herself into a sitting position.

                             J.D.
               I guess I don't know what the hell
               I'm talking about.

                             VERONICA
               I know exactly what the hell you're
               talking about and you're right, you
               don't know what the hell you're
               talking about. Let's just grow up,
               be adults, and die.

                             J.D.
               Good plan.

                             VERONICA
               But before that, I'd like to see
               Heather Chandler puke her guts out.

     INT. HEATHER CHANDLER'S BEDROOM--DAY

     HEATHER CHANDLER's bedroom is lushly and expensively furnished
     with a glass coffee table as an eye-catching centerpiece.
     HEATHER CHANDLER half-sleeps in twisted bedsheets as MRS.
     CHANDLER'S VOICE attacks through the door.

                             MRS. CHANDLER (O.S.)
               We are leaving soon for your
               grandmother's. If you care to join us...

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Bag that.

                             MRS. CHANDLER (O.S.)
               Is that a "No" in your lingo?

     HEATHER CHANDLER gives the voice behind the door "the finger."

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Lingo this.

     INT. THE CHANDLER KITCHEN--DAY

     The sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before
     VERONICA and J.D. burst through the door.

                             VERONICA
                       (quietly)
               Trust me. She skips the Saturday
               morning trip to Grandma's even
               when she's not hungover.

                             J.D.
               Then let's just concoct ourselves a
               little hangover cure that'll induce
               her to spew red, white, and blue.

     VERONICA opens the refrigerator. J.D. opens the cupboard
     beneath the sink.

                             VERONICA
               What about orange juice and milk?
               What's the upchuck factor on that?

     J.D. holds up a bottle of cleaning fluid.

                             J.D.
               I'm a No Rust Build-up man, myself.

                             VERONICA
               Don't be a dick. That stuff'll
               kill her.

     VERONICA and J.D. make queasy eye-contact. VERONICA descends
     back into the refrigerator with some worked-up enthusiasm as
     J.D. suavely pours bits of various toxic containers
     (detergent, scouring powder) into a glass beer mug.

                             VERONICA
               O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put
               it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it
               be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?

                             J.D.
               Man Veronica, pull the plug on that
               shit. I say we go with Big Blue.

     J.D. raises the glass filled with what is now a strange blue
     liquid. VERONICA stares at the glass, scared by her own
     thoughts.

                             VERONICA
               What are you <u>doing</u>? You just
               can't go.....Besides, she'd never
               drink anything that looks like that.

                             J.D.
               Okay we'll use this. She won't be
               able to tell what she's drinking.

     J.D. pulls down a ceramic cup and triumphantly pours the
     poisonously blue beer glass contents into it. An eerie pause
     ensues. VERONICA takes out a milk carton and a container of
     orange juice. She struts back to the counter in anger, icily
     muttering.

                             VERONICA
               Just give me a cup, jerk.

     J.D. sheepishly pulls down an identical ceramic cup. VERONICA
     tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange
     juice into the cup.

                             VERONICA
               Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe
               we could cough a phlegm globber in
               it or something.

                             J.D.
               Yeah, great.

     They both start coughing harshly.

                             VERONICA
               No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll
               do quite nicely. Quite nicely.

                             J.D.
               Chick-en.

                             VERONICA
               You're not funny.

     J.D. turns on his heel and slinks away. VERONICA glares down
     at the mess of toxic containers.

     With both arms, VERONICA clumps the toxic containers together
     and drops beneath the sink to put them away. J.D. swaggers
     back into the kitchen as VERONICA bobs back into view.

                             J.D.
               I'm sorry.

     J.D. kisses the back of her neck. VERONICA closes her eyes
     with a grudging smile.

                             VERONICA
               Bonehead.

     VERONICA dreamily reaches out to one of the two ceramic cups.

     Not the one with milk and orange juice in it.

     INT. HEATHER CHANDLER'S BEDROOM--DAY

     HEATHER CHANDLER angelically sleeps as VERONICA and J.D.
     enter.

                             VERONICA
               Morning, Heather.

     Like a lion, HEATHER CHANDLER rouses herself up.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle
               surprise. Hear about Veronica's
               affection for regurgitation?

                             VERONICA
               We both said a lot of things we
               didn't mean, last night.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?

                             J.D.
               Veronica knew you'd have a hangover.
               So I whipped this up. Family recipe.

     J.D. holds out the ceramic cup. HEATHER CHANDLER snorts.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Did you put a phlegm globber in it
               or something? I'm not drinking that piss.

                             J.D.
               I knew this stuff would be too intense.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Intense? Grow up. You think I'll drink
               it just because you call me <u>chicken</u>.

     They do. They're right.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Just give me the cup, jerk.

     HEATHER CHANDLER rises from the bed and struts to J.D. in
     anger. She takes the cup, slams her head back and downs it
     all.

     She then launches her head forward, her face contorted in
     agony.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Corn nuts!

     HEATHER CHANDLER'S eyes slam shut and her limp body crashes
     through the glass coffee table. VERONICA and J.D. freeze.

                             J.D.
               Something tells me you picked up
               the wrong cup.

                             VERONICA
               No shit, sherlock. I can't believe
               it. I just killed my best friend.

                             J.D.
               And your worst enemy.

                             VERONICA
               Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...

     VERONICA staggers to a desk. J.D. laughs out of shock.

                             J.D.
               What are we going to tell the cops?
               "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."

                             VERONICA
               Stop kidding around. The police....oh
               no, oh God....I can't believe this is
               my life..I'm going to have to send my
               S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead
               of Stanford.

                             J.D.
               I'm just a little freaked, all right?
                       (a beat)
               You got what you wanted, you know.

                             VERONICA
               Don't say that! It's one thing to
               want somebody out of your life. It's
               another thing to serve them a wake-up
               cup of Liquid Drainer....Don't say....

     VERONICA stares off as J.D. paces like a caged animal. He
     scopes onto the rubble of the shattered coffee table and sees
     Cliff Notes for <u>The Bell Jar</u> plus a magazine proclaiming
     "THE FALL OF THE AMERICAN TEEN" under HEATHER CHANDLER's body.

                             J.D.
               We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime.
               But if this was like a suicide thing.....

                             VERONICA
               Like a suicide thing?

                             J.D.
               Adolescence is a period of life
               fraught with anxiety and confusion.

                             VERONICA
                       (calming down)
               I can do Heather's handwriting as
               well as my own.

     VERONICA takes some stationery from the desk and begins
     writing, calling out her words.

                             VERONICA
               "You might think what I've done is
               shocking..."

                             J.D.
               "To me though, suicide is the
               natural answer to the myriad
               of problems life has given me."

                             VERONICA
               That's good, but Heather would
               never use the word "myriad."

                             J.D.
               This is the last thing she'll ever
               write. She'll want to cash in on as
               many fifty-cent words as poss.

                             VERONICA
               She missed "myriad" on a vocab
               test two weeks ago, all right?

                             J.D.
               That only proves my point more. The word
               is a badge for her failures at school.

                             VERONICA
               You're probably right..."People think
               just because you're beautiful and
               popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody
               understood I had feelings too."

                             J.D.
               "I die knowing no one knew the real me."

                             VERONICA
               That's good. Have you done this before?

     VERONICA's smile dies as she looks to HEATHER CHANDLER'S corpse.

     INT. SCHOOL CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY

     At the head of a long conference table is the bearlike
     PRINCIPAL GOWAN. Circling the table is the gray-haired but
     savvy MRS. POPE, the yuppie black counselor PAUL HYDE, TWO
     large DISCIPLINARIAN-TYPES, and most noticeably, the
     eccentrically dressed MS. PAULINE FLEMING. Coats are in chairs
     and cigarette smoke is in the air, as the group batters their
     way through a morning mourning conference.

                             PRINCIPAL GOWAN
               Any other Principal would take the same
               position. Keep things business as usual.

                             COUNSELOR HYDE
               Heather Chandler's not your everyday
               suicide. She was <u>very</u> popular.

                             PRINCIPAL GOWAN
               Come on Paul, I let the kids go before
               lunch and the switchboard'll light up
               like a Christmas Tree.

                             COUNSELOR HYDE
               The parents will be sympathetic, sir.
               These are troubled times for the young.

                             MRS. POPE
               I must say I was impressed to see
               that she made proper use of the word
               "myriad" in her suicide note after
               brutalizing it in a vocabulary test.

                             PAULINE
                       (dramatically cutting in)
               I find it profoundly disturbing that
               we are told of a tragic destruction
               of youth and all we can talk about
               is adequate mourning times and
               misused vocabulary words.

     A collective sigh goes across the room.

                             PRINCIPAL GOWAN
               Oh Christ.

                             PAULINE
               The school, meaning both students
               and teachers, must revel in this
               revealing moment. I suggest we get
               everyone into the cafeteria and
               just talk. And feel. Together.

                             PRINCIPAL GOWAN
               Thank you, Ms. Fleming. Call me
               when the shuttle lands...Now is
               this Heather the cheerleader?

                             COUNSELOR HYDE
               That would be Heather Mcnamara.

                             PRINCIPAL GOWAN
               Damn. I'd be willing to go half a
               day for a cheerleader.

                             MRS. POPE
               Let's just pack it in an hour early.

                             PRINCIPAL GOWAN
               Done. I hate Mondays.

     INT. PAULINE FLEMING'S CLASSROOM--DAY

     The desks of the classroom have been maneuvered into an
     amusingly chaotic position by PAULINE'S PUPILS. She is
     furious.

                             PAULINE
               I said a circle you imbeciles! Forget
               it! Just sit down. I'm just so <u>thrilled</u>
               to be given an example of everything
               I've taught you. That example is
               Heather Chandler. I have the note!

     PAULINE melodramatically lifts the suicide note. The class AAAHS.

                             MALE STUDENT
               Awright!

                             PAULINE
               I'll pass the suicide note around
               the room so you can feel its tragic
               beauty for yourself. Let us share
               together the feelings the suicide has
               spurred in us all. Who wants to begin?

                             FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JAKET
               I heard it was really gnarly. She sucked
               down a bowl of multi-purpose deodorizing
               disinfectant then she smashed....

                             PAULINE
               Now, now, we're not here to rehash
               the coroner's report. Let's talk <u>emotions</u>.

                             ALL-OUT NERD
               Are we going to be tested on this?

     A stunned PAULINE glares until preppie PETER DAWSON speaks.
     The note continues to be breathlessly passed around.

                             PETER
               Heather and I used to go together,
               but she said I was boring. I realize
               now I wasn't really boring. She was
               just dissatisfied with her life.

                             PAULINE
               That's very good Peter.

     VERONICA lets out a laugh that she disguises as a sob by
     putting her hands over her face.

                             PAULINE
               Dear Veronica, Heather was your
               soulmate.....Share.

                             VERONICA
               Heather was cool, but cruel. The good
               looks and bad manners gave her power,
               but it could not give her happiness.

     The class stares to VERONICA as the suicide note is passed to
     her. She acknowledges it in horror, passes it on, then
     continues, realizing her ability to create truths for a
     captive audience.

                             VERONICA
               She realized the only way she could
               be happy was to give up her power and
               the only way she could do that was Death.

     PAULINE cries. The PUPILS applaud. VERONICA queasily smiles.

     INT. THE GIRLS LOCKER ROOM--DAY

     The GIRLS are finishing up putting on their clothes.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Oh God, it's so unfair. It's just so
               <u>unfair</u>! We should get a whole week
               off not just an hour.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Write the School Board.

     HEATHER DUKE gnaws on a chicken leg as she speaks.

                             VERONICA
               Watch it, Heather. You could actually
               be digesting food.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Yeah, where's your urge to purge?

                             HEATHER DUKE
                       (belching)
               Fuck it.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA pulls a Swatch from one of the lockers.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Look, heather left behind one of her
               Swatches. She'd want you to have it,
               Veronica. She always said you couldn't
               accessorize for shit.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA tosses the watch to a spooked VERONICA who
     stands up and solemnly puts it on. The FEMALE STONER IN ARMY
     JACKET stops next to their bench.

                             FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET
               I'm sorry about your friend. I thought
               she was your usual airhead bitch.
               Guess I was wrong. Lot of us were.

     HEATHER DUKE bobs up from the world's largest sno-cone.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               What a waste.

     VERONICA zombiesquely moves into the shower area.

                             HEATHER DUKE (V.O.)
               Oh the Humanity.

     INT. THE SHOWER--DAY

     VERONICA turns on a shower and lets the water spray against
     her clothes.

     INT. THE LOCKER ROOM--DAY

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Veronica, what are you doing?

                             SQUEALING GIRL (O.S.)
               Everyone in the shower!

     TWO GIGGLING GIRLS run into the shower fully clothed. THREE
     OTHERS follow suit. The HEATHERS look to each other, laugh,
     and run in.

     INT. THE GIRLS' COACH'S LOCKER ROOM OFFICE--DAY

     Heavy Metalers MATT, CLYDE, and STEVE plus Geek RODNEY sneak
     into a darkened room. Girls' laughter drifts in.

                             MATT
               Do I deliver or do I deliver?

                             RODNEY
               Hurry up, we're going to get caught.

                             MATT
               Mellow out Geek. Man, I never
               should have brought you.

                             CLYDE
               Let's see some <u>pussy</u>!

     MATT pulls a curtain revealing a semi-overhead view of the
     showering and clothed GIRLS.

     INT. THE SHOWER--DAY

     The GIRLS splash and spin in balletlike slow motion. VERONICA
     stands facing the viewer, the Swatch noticeably attached.

     INT. THE GIRLS' COACH'S LOCKER ROOM OFFICE--DAY

     Cautiously quiet pandemonium.

                             MATT
               Does this have something to do with
               menstrual cramps and shit?

                             CLYDE
                       (dazed)
               What the fuck?

                             RODNEY
               We're on Candid Camera, dudes. I
               can feel it.

                             CLYDE
               What the fuck?

     EXT. OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL--DAY

     Pulling their coats over their wet clothes, VERONICA and the
     HEATHERS come out of the school.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               That was seriously warped, Veronica.

                             VERONICA
               Uh-huh.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               T.V. cameras!

     In the distance, a T.V. CAMERA CREW is interviewing STUDENTS.
     HEATHER DUKE dashes toward them. HEATHER MCNAMARA freezes.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Oh God, Veronica. My hair! My clothes!

     HEATHER MCNAMARA moans, vibrates, then suddenly races toward
     the cameras. VERONICA looks down at the soaked, stopped Swatch
     on her arm. She takes it off and drops it in a neaby trashcan.

     INT. THE DEAN LIVING ROOM--LATE AFTERNOON

     A massive T.V. set shows the image of HEATHER DUKE posed by a
     tree, talking into a microphone.

                             HEATHER DUKE (T.V.)
               I choose to remember the good times.
               Like when we got our ears pierced
               at the mall.

     The image of HEATHER MCNAMARA sitting in the grass talking
     into a microphone supersedes HEATHER DUKE's.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA (T.V.)
               I can still hear those late night
               talks on the phone.

     The image of PETER DAWSON sitting on a rock comes on next.

                             PETER (T.V.)
               The day I won her that stuffed rhino
               at the 4-H Fair, she said to me....

                             VERONICA (O.S.)
               You're an asshole! Mute him!

     VERONICA and J.D. are seen to be crashed on a couch. J.D.
     pushes a button on the remote control, cutting the sound.

                             J.D.
               Mute!

                             VERONICA
               Next channel, darling.

     The silent image of HEATHER DUKE on a staircase talking into a
     microphone is on the screen.

                             VERONICA (O.S.)
               Heather, how many networks did
               you run to!

     Country Club Courtney appears wearing a T-shirt reading BIGFUN.
     VERONICA takes the remote and turns the sound on.

                             VERONICA
               Oh, I have to hear this.

                             COURTNEY (T.V.)
               In my heart, Heather's still alive.

                             VERONICA
                       (muting Courtney)
               What are you talking about? She
               hated you! You hated her!
                       (to J.D.)
               What are you smiling at?

                             J.D.
               Heather Chandler is more popular
               than ever now.

                             VERONICA
               Yeah. Scary stuff.

     J.D. suddenly looks away from VERONICA with a mischievous
     half-smile. He inexplicably calls out.

                             J.D.
               Why son, I didn't hear you come in.

     J.D.'s father BIG BUD DEAN, stands before them, handsome and
     threatening in a shirt and tie. He is rather malevolently
     holding a rowing machine.

                             BIG BUD DEAN
               Hey Dad, how was work today?

     BIG BUD slams down his rowing machine and straddles it before
     answering his own question. He rows as he speaks. <u>The</u> <u>Brady</u>
     <u>Bunch</u> sputters on the T.V. screen before him.

                             BIG BUD DEAN
               It was miserable. Some damn tribe of
               withered old bitches doesn't want us
               to terminate that fleabag hotel. All
               because Glenn Miller and his band once
               took a shit there. It's just like
               Kansas. Do you remember fucking Kansas?

                             J.D.
               That was the one with wheat right?

                             BIG BUD DEAN
               The Save the Memorial Oak Tree
               Society. Showed those fucks.

     J.D. turns to VERONICA with a bemused smile.

                             J.D.
               Thirty Fourth of July fireworks
               attached to the trunk. Arraigned
               but Acquitted.

                             BIG BUD DEAN
               Fucking Kansas. Gosh Pop, I almost
               forgot to introduce my girlfriend.

                             J.D.
               Veronica, Dad. Dad, Veronica.

                             VERONICA
               Hello.

     VERONICA, with a forced smile, reaches to shaked BUD's hand.
     He extends his hand but makes no effort to stop rowing
     hence his hand pulls away from VERONICA. Pop and son laugh.

                             J.D.
               Jason, why don't you ask your
               little friend to stay for dinner.

                             VERONICA
                       (awkwardly standing)
               My Mom's making my favorite meal
               tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.

                             J.D.
               Nice. The last time I saw my Mom,
               she was waving out the window of a
               library in Texas. Right, <u>Dad</u>?

     BIG BUD DEAN stops rowing to grin a You-Think-You're-
     Tougher-Than-Me-But-You're-Not smile to J.D.

                             BIG BUD DEAD
               Right, <u>son</u>.

                             VERONICA
                       (weakly)
               Right.

     EXT. THE SAWYER PATIO--DUSK

     Just as in the earlier patio scene, DAD and MOM SAWYER are
     seated at a patio table with an empty chair between them. Pate
     is on the table. DAD smokes a cigarette.

                             DAD
               Take a break Veronica, sit down.

     VERONICA walks into view and sits down.

                             VERONICA
               All right.

                             DAD
               So what was the first day after
               Heather's suicide like?

                             VERONICA
               I don't know, it was okay, I guess.

                             MOM
               Terrible thing. So will we get to
               meet this dark horse prom contender?

                             VERONICA
               May<u>be</u>.

                             DAD
                       (looking at his cigarette)
               Goddamn. Will somebody please tell
               me why I smoke these damn things?

                             VERONICA
                       (smiling)
               Because you're an idiot.

                             DAD
               Oh yeah, that's it.

     DAD immediately takes another drag with a wide grin.

                             MOM
                       (shaking her head)
               You two....

                             VERONICA
               Greate pate, but I'm going to have
               to motor if I want to be ready for
               the funeral tomorrow.

     INT. HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM--DAY

     A montage commences showing the HEATHERS preparing for the
     funeral. HEATHER MCNAMARA models an all-black outfit in front
     of a dressing table mirror. She storms away, pouting.

     INT. HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM--DAY

     Bobbing up from a fashion magazine whose cover story is
     FUNERAL CHIC, HEATHER DUKE finishes applying black lipstick. A
     look of horror passes over her face and she savagely scrubs
     her lips.

     INT. CHURCH--DAY

     A MORTICIAN puts the finishing touches on HEATHER CHANDLER,
     smoothing out her clothes and buffing her face. He gently
     kisses her forehead then quickly rebuffs the spot.

     INT. HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM--DAY

     HEATHER MCNAMARA models another black outfit. She responds
     this time with a satisfied smile.

     INT. HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM--DAY

     Traditionally made up, a smiling HEATHER DUKE brings a
     crucifix earring to her ear and attaches it.

     INT. CHURCH--DAY

     HEATHER CHANDLER serenely lies in a coffin as FATHER RIPPER
     bellows off-screen. A panorama of ADULTS and STUDENTS is
     revealed at this more social than spiritual event. VERONICA
     and J.D. watch from the back pew.

                             FATHER RIPPER (O.S.)
               I blame not Heather but rather a
               society that tells its youth that
               the answers are on the MTV video
               games. We must pray the other
               teenagers of Sherwood, Ohio, know
               the name of that "righteous dude"
               who can solve their problems....

     The bald FATHER RIPPER finally comes into view.

                             FATHER RIPPER
                       (cont'd)
               It's Jesus Christ and he's in the book.

     KNEELING PODIUM BEFORE COFFIN--LATER

     BETTY FINN is kneeling before HEATHER CHANDLER'S open coffin.
     The viewer hears what she is thinking.

                             BETTY (V.O.)
               May Heather Chandler rest in peace
               even though she committed suicide.
               For-the-kingdom-the-power-and-the-
               glory-are-yours-now-and-forever-Amen.

     BETTY FINN makes the sign of the cross, rises, and exits.
     HEATHER MCNAMARA takes her place on the kneeling podium.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA (V.O.)
               Oh God, this is a tragic thing and
               sometimes I have a hard time dealing
               with it and stuff. Please send Heather
               to heaven and all that. Thanks. I
               mean, Amen.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA exits and PETER DAWSON moves in her place.

                             PETER (V.O.)
               Dear God, make sure this never
               happens to me. I do not think I
               could handle suicide and that's
               the God's honest truth. Pardon
               the pun. Fast-early-acceptance-
               into-an-Ivy-League-school-and-
               please-let-it-be-Harvard. Amen.

     PETER flees and RAM uncomfortably takes his place.

                             RAM (V.O.)
               Jesus God in heaven, uh, why did
               you kill such hot snatch. That's
               a joke, man. People are so serious.
                       (a beat)
               Hail Mary, who aren't in heaven,
               pray for us sinners....so we don't
               get caught. Another joke, man.

     RAM clumsily exits. HEATHER DUKE solemnly kneels in his place.

                             HEATHER DUKE (V.O.)
               I prayed for the death of Heather
               Chandler many times and I felt bad
               every time I did, but I kept doing
               it anyway. Now I know you understood
               everything. Praise Jesus. Alleluia.

     HEATHER DUKE departs and VERONICA kneels in her place.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               Hi. I'm sorry. Technically I didn't
               kill Heather Chandler but hey, who
               am I trying to kid, right? I just
               want my high school to be a nice
               place. Amen. Did that sound bitchy?

     CHURCH LOBBY

     HEATHER MCNAMARA dips a big comb in the holy water basin and
     then combs out her hair. VERONICA breezes by.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Veronica. What are you doing tonight?

                             VERONICA
               Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Ram asked me out, but he wants to
               double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't
               have a date.

                             VERONICA
               Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something
               going with J.D.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on
               hold tonight, I'll never forget it.

     EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT--DAY

     KURT KELLY and RAM stand by RAM'S van.

                             KURT
               We on tonight, man?

                             RAM
               I still got to talk to Heather,
               dude. Weird funeral, huh?

                             KURT
               Pretty weird.

     Geeks RODNEY and BRACES thrust by KURT and RAM. BRACES
     obliviously steps on KURT's foot.

                             KURT
               That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.

                             RAM
               Let's kick his ass.

                             KURT
               Cool off, we're seniors.

                             RAM
               Goddamn Geek!

     BRACES gives them "the finger".

                             BRACES
                       (awkwardly defiant)    
               Sit and spin.

     KURT and RAM turn to each other more amused than angered.

                             KURT
               That little prick.

     The bolting Jocks effortlessly catch BRACES and put him into a
     hunched-over position. The other Geeks look on, ashamed.

                             KURT
               All right you piece of shit fag,
               do you like to suck big dicks?

                             BRACES
               Cut it out!

     RAM pushes BRACES down harder.

                             KURT
               Say it man. Say I like to suck big dicks.

                             RODNEY
               Leave him alone, Kurt.

     J.D. rides by on his motorcycle. He turns to watch KURT,
     wearing an overwhelmingly tinted motorcycle helmet that reads
     THE TRUE KILLER across the top. KURT is spooked.

                             RAM (O.S.)
               Say it!

                             BRACES
               Okay, okay, you like to suck big dicks.

     Unamused, RAM throws BRACES to the ground. BRACES semi-cries.

                             BRACES
               I like to suck big dicks. Mmm-<u>mm</u>!
               I can't get enough of them. Satisfied?

                             KURT
               I'm sure your friends are happy
               to hear that.
                       (with a lisp)
               Right, <u>guys</u>?

     ANOTHER PLACE IN THE PARKING LOT

     VERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA sashay through the parking lot.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Don't worry, Ram's been so sweet
               lately, consoling me and stuff.
               It'll be really very. Promise.

     Moving into the background, BRACES wipes dirt and blood off
     his face as his friends glumly watch on.

                             VERONICA
               All <u>right</u>, but I hope it isn't
               going to be one of those nights where
               they get shitfaced and take us to a
               pasture to tip cows.

     EXT. COW PASTURE--NIGHT

     A COW stands sleeping. Giggling and drunk, KURT and RAM
     scramble around the COW. Uncomfortable and sober, VERONICA and
     HEATHER MCNAMARA look on.

                             KURT
               Is it sleeping, dude?

                             RAM
               I think so, man.

                             KURT
               Then get over on my side. Oh shit,
               cowtipping is the fucking greatest.

                             RAM
               Punch it in!

     KURT and RAM slam their knuckles and then lean against the
     COW, poised to shove. HEATHER MCNAMARA manages a smile but
     VERONICA glares it away.

                             KURT
               Count of three, guy.

                             KURT AND RAM
               One. Two. Three!

     An O.S. Moo and the Jocks' laughter is heard as mud splashes
     against the mortified faces of VERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA.

     DEEPER IN THE PASTURE--LATER IN THE NIGHT

     KURT stumbles after a more annoyed than scared VERONICA.

                             KURT
               "When I get that feeling, I need
               sexual healing....."

                             VERONICA
               Yeah, right, asshole.

     VERONICA makes her way up a hill, pausing to compassionately
     stare at RAM on top of a dispirited HEATHER MCNAMARA. KURT's
     intoxicated brain has trouble dealing with the incline.
     Majestically, J.D. appears at the top of the hill. KURT
     squints up the hill and falls over backwards.

                             J.D.
               What is this shit?

                             VERONICA
               I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I
               tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.

                             KURT
                       (still face down)
               "Feel like making bah da dah bah da
               dah, feel like making love."

                             J.D.
               Another fucking Heather.
                       (harshly laughs)
               I'm sorry. I'm feeling kind of superior
               tonight. Seven high schools in seven
               states and the only thing different
               was my locker combination. We've broke
               through the peer pressure cooker. So
               what if we had to kill Miss Popularity..

     VERONICA clumsily high heels it up the hill.

                             VERONICA
               So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!

                             J.D.
               Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.

     J.D. solemnly reaches toward VERONICA. She, less solemn,
     takes his hand. Their bodies disappear over the hill.

                             KURT
               "And she's buying the stairway to heaven.."

     INT. NEWSPAPER/YEARBOOK WORKSHOP--DAY

     In a cluttered school workshop, Editor DENNIS and YEARBOOK GIRL
     ALISON confer over a layout sheet. Alison wears a walkman and
     BIG FUN T-shirt. PETER DAWSON pouts behind them.

                             DENNIS
               I'm not belittling the Foodless Fund,
               Peter, but we're talking teen suicide!
               Ask Alison here, the number one song
               right now is "Teenage Suicide (Don't Do
               It)" by BigFun. Jesus man, Westerburg
               finally got one of these things and I'm
               not going to blow it.

                             PETER
               Great. Heather gets the headline and I
               get crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon.

     VERONICA breezes in.

                             VERONICA
               Hi Guys. I came to check on this
               week's lunchtime poll topic.

                             DENNIS
               Don't worry about it, Veronica,
               sit down. That funeral yesterday
               must have been really rough.

                             VERONICA
               Oh. Sure.

                             DENNIS
               We were, uh, wondering if maybe you
               had some poems or artwork that
               Heather did that we could put in
               the Heather Chandler yearbook spread?

                             VERONICA
               The what?

                             DENNIS
               Take a look. We'll have a two page
               layout with her suicide note up
               here in the right hand corner. It's
               more tasteful than it sounds.

     Country Club COURTNEY and COURTNEY'S FRIEND come in giggling
     and whispering. Seeing VERONICA, they stop dead, then slide
     into chairs, laughing softly.

                             VERONICA
               I don't know. This thing leaves a
               bad taste in my mouth.

                             COURTNEY
               Like last night, Veronica?

     COURTNEY and COURTNEY'S FRIEND explode in laughter.

                             VERONICA
               I'm sorry? I don't get it.

                             COURTNEY
               You did last night. Kurt told us of
               your little date.

                             VERONICA
               Yeah. And? I left him drunk and
               flailing in cowshit.

                             COURTNEY
               I don't know. He was really detailed.

                             PETER
               Shut up, Courtney.

                             VERONICA
               Don't shut up. I'd like to know just
               what I did.

                             PETER
                       (gesturing to the door)
               Let me show you that lunchtime
               poll topic, Veronica.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE WORKSHOP--DAY

     PETER tells VERONICA.

                             PETER
               I <u>rarely</u> listen to Neanderthals like
               Kurt Kelly bu-ut he said you were
               bent over like a coffee table with
               Kurt going in one end and Ram coming
               in the other. Pardon the pun.

                             VERONICA
                       (dazed)
               Pardon the pun. Son-of-a-<u>bitch</u>.

     Dizzy, VERONICA hands a clump of dollar bills to PETER.

                             VERONICA
               Thanks Pete, for the Foodless Fund.

     PETER cheerfully pockets the cash as VERONICA drifts off.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     VERONICA arousingly speaks into her phone.

                             VERONICA
               Hi, Kurt? This is Veronica Sawyer. I
               didn't expect to be calling either. I
               guess my emotions took over. I was
               wondering if you wanted all those
               things you've been saying to really
               happen. It's always been a fantasy of
               mine to have two guys at once......
               Sure, you can write Penthouse Forum.

     Revealed to be lounging on her bed, J.D. laughs out loud.
     VERONICA throws a book at him.

                             VERONICA
               That's right. In the woods behind the
               school. At Dawn. And don't forget Ram.

     INT. THE KELLY KITCHEN--NIGHT

     KURT hangs up with an amazed expression on his face.

                             KURT
               Women.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     VERONICA and J.D. load guns on VERONICA's bed. VERONICA breaks
     into a laugh.

                             VERONICA
               I don't get the point of me writing
               a suicide note when we'll just be
               shooting them with blanks.

                             J.D.
               Get crucial. We won't be using
               blanks this time.

                             VERONICA
               You can't be serious? Hey listen,
               my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.

     VERONICA drops her gun in revulsion and launches off her bed.
     With a patient smile, J.D. pulls her back down.

                             J.D.
               Do you take German?

                             VERONICA
               French.

     J.D. flicks open his gun and pulls a bullet from the chamber.

                             J.D.
               These are Ich Luge bullets. My
               grandfather snared a shitload of
               them in W.W. Two. They're like
               tranquilizers only they break the
               surface of the skin, enough to
               cause blood, but not any real harm.

                             VERONICA
               So it looks like the person's been
               shot and killed when they're really
               just unconscious and bleeding.

     J.D. nods then stands to pace the room, his mind whirring.

                             J.D.
               We shoot Kurt and Ram. Make it look
               like they shot each other. By the time
               Kurt and Ram regain consciousness,
               they'll be the laughingstock's of the
               school. The note's the punchline.
               How'd it turn out?

     VERONICA clumsily extracts the note from her purse. She also
     plucks out the crumpled yellow sample of Kurt's handwriting of
     the opening note-forge scene. She proudly displays both
     papers.

                             VERONICA
               First tell me this similarity is
               not incredible.

                             J.D.
                       (warmly)
               Incredible similarity.

     VERONICA pulls back the note and reads.

                             VERONICA
               Ram and I died the day we realized
               we could never reveal our forbidden
               love to an uncaring and ununderstanding
               world. The joy we shared in each other's
               arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet
               we were forced to live the lie of Sexist-
               Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.

                             J.D.
               Exquisite, but I don't think
               ununderstanding is a word.

                             VERONICA
               We don't want to make them out to be
               too secretly eloquent. Why would the
               Germans invent a bullet that doesn't
               kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War
               Two, not a school play.

                             J.D.
                       (rapid-fire)
               They used them on themselves to
               make it look like they were dead.
               Really quite a brilliant device, but
               too flamboyant to seriously produce.

                             VERONICA
               Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.

     VERONICA swiftly picks up her gun and aims it at the lovable
     tabby entering the room. J.D. rips it away from her.

                             J.D.
               It doesn't work on small animals!

                             VERONICA
               Oh.

                             J.D.
               Uh well hey, let's take a look at the
               homosexual artifacts I dug up to plant
               at the scene. Now prepare to be a
               little disappointed.

     J.D. lifts up a feminine shopping bag and gently dumps the
     contents on the bed.

                             J.D.
               We've got an issue of Stud Puppy, a
               candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card,
               and some mascara.

                             VERONICA
               You must have had fun.

                             J.D.
               You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot.
               The one perfecto thing I picked up...

     J.D. reaches in both his coat pockets and triumphantly raises
     out two bottles of Perrier water.

                             J.D.
               Perrier water!

                             VERONICA
               Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink
               Perrier. It's come a long way.

                             J.D.
               This is Ohio. If you don't have a
               brewsky in your hand you might as
               well be wearing a dress.

                             VERONICA
                       (mock-seductively)
               Oh, you're so smart. How about a
               little heterosexuality before we go?

     J.D. laughs then climbs onto VERONICA for a hugging kiss.

     EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT--DAWN

     A tense KURT and an excited RAM, playing air guitar, walk
     through the misty parking lot toward the woods.

                             RAM
                       (singing)
               Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever
               need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello
               Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...

                             KURT
               Shut the fuck up, all right.

                             RAM
               Lighten up, dude. In those woods is
               some of the finest pussy in the school
               and we don't even have to buy it a
               hamburger and a Diet Coke. What a way
               to start the day! Punch it in!

     KURT feebly slams knuckles with RAM.

     EXT. CLEARING IN THE WOODS--DAWN

     VEONICA stands in the middle of a clearing in the woods. She
     nervously tucks the gun in the back of her dress as KURT and
     RAM emerge into the clearing from a path in the woods.

                             KURT
               Hi Veronica.

                             VERONICA
                       (forced cheerfulness)
               Hi Guys. Glad you could make it.

     RAM smacks his hands together.

                             RAM
               So do we just start fucking?

                             VERONICA
               I've made a circle on each end of
               the clearing. Ram, you come over here.

     KURT steps into the scratched-in-the-dirt circle next to him.
     A confused RAM walks past VERONICA and steps into a circle at
     the opposite end of the foggy clearing.

                             VERONICA


     The guys pause, then slowly start taking off their clothes.

                             RAM
               What about you?

                             VERONICA
               I was hoping you'd rip my clothes
               off me, sport.

                             RAM
               Oh. Good idea.

     KURT and RAM awkwardly stand at opposite ends in their undies.

                             VERONICA
               Count of three, guys.

     RAM giggles in anticipation.

                             VERONICA
               One.

     KURT finally cracks a smile.

                             VERONICA
               Two.

     J.D. suddenly moves next to VERONICA holding a gun in his
     right hand and the feminine shopping bag in his left.

                             J.D.
               Three.

     J.D. almost non-chalantly shoots RAM in the forehead. VERONICA
     rips out her gun and swings it toward KURT. Using both hands,
     she fires, but misses completely. KURT runs away onto the
     path. VERONICA throws down her gun with a smile.

                             VERONICA
               Shucks.

     J.D. races to VERONICA in a white sweat.

                             J.D.
               Did you miss him completely?

                             VERONICA
                       (giggling)
               Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth
               it just to see the look on....

                             J.D.
               Don't move! I'll get him back!

     VERONICA's laughter cuts off like a faucet. Suddenly trembling
     and confused, she watches J.D. bolt into the woods.

     THE PATH

     A panicked KURT runs on the path through the woods.

     OFF THE PATH

     J.D., with a cold efficiency, weaves through trees and fog.

     THE CLEARING

     VERONICA turns toward Ram's collapsed body.

     THE PATH

     KURT sees the opening at the end of the woods. J.D. suddenly
     moves into the opening and raises his gun. KURT runs back...

     THE CLEARING

     VERONICA approaches Ram's body with increasing shivers. He
     does not look bleeding and unconscious. He looks bleeding and
     dead, dead, dead.

     KURT barrels into the clearing as J.D. howls from the woods.

                             J.D.
               Now!

     In a burst of frightened, animal instinct, VERONICA whips
     around and fires her gun right into KURT's chest.

     INT. SQUAD CAR IN SCHOOL PARKING LOT--DAWN

     Two cops, MILNER and McCORD, smoke marijuana in a squad car
     already filled with smoke. After a coughing fit, MILNER
     shouts.

                             MILNER
               I heard it that time!

                             McCORD
               Wha?

                             MILNER
               Another gunshot! From the woods!

                             McCORD
               Shit, let's roll.

     The two officer explode out of the car.

     EXT. THE CLEARING--DAWN

     J.D. puts his gun in RAM's right hand while VERONICA
     zombiesquely does the same with KURT and her gun.

                             VERONICA
               Kurt doesn't look too good.

                             J.D.
               Remember he's left-handed.

     A quivering VERONICA puts the gun in KURT's left hand.

                             MILNER (O.S.)
               Keep going until you hit the clearing!

     J.D.'s head snaps forward. He yanks up VERONICA. They both run
     into the woods behind RAM's body as the two Cops charge into the
     clearing, guns raised. Seeing the Jocks, they stop.

                             McCORD
               Mother of Shit!

                             MILNER
               Call in!

     MILNER looks toward where VERONICA and J.D. ran out.

                             MILNER
               I heard something out there. I'm
               checking it out.

     MILNER runs off as McCORD shouts into a walkie-talkie. He is
     holding the pulse of KURT KELLY.

                             McCORD
               This is Officer McCord and I've got
               two dead bodies in the woods behind
               Westerburg High. Oh my God, one of
               them's Kurt Kelly, the quarterback.

     EXT. IN THE WOODS--DAWN

     VERONICA and J.D. flow through thick trees. An Owl hoos.

     EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS--DAWN

     MILNER blindly barrels through the dense, foggy woods.

     EXT. JUST OUTSIDE THE WOODS--DAWN

     VERONICA and J.D. come out of the woods and race up a dew
     drenched hill toward VERONICA's car which is parked on top.

                             J.D.
               Faster!

     EXT. IN THE WOODS--DAWN

     MILNER is jolted by an OWL-HOO, then continues moving.

     EXT. THE HILL--DAWN

     VERONICA and J.D. reach the car, panting.

     MILNER races out of the woods just as VERONICA and J.D. slam
     the car doors closed behind them. MILNER huffs up the hill.

     INT. THE SAWYER CAR--DAWN

     VERONICA and J.D. somersault into the backseat and begin
     taking off their clothes.

     EXT. THE HILL--DAWN

     MILNER continues to move up the hill.

     INT. THE SAWYER CAR--DAWN

     VERONICA and J.D., stripped down to their underwear, embrace.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAR--DAWN

     MILNER approaches the car and peers in. His crackling walkie-
     talkie startles him.

                             McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie)
               Milner, can you hear me? What's going down?

     MILNER moves away from the car, then speaks into his walkie-
     talkie.

                             MILNER
               Think what I heard was just a
               stinking owl. All I got is two kids
               making out in the backseat of a
               car. Should I pry them apart?

                             McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie)
               Forget it. I got all the answers
               back here, partner. Boy, kids today
               sure start in early. Hey, are they naked?

     MILNER sighs, and clicks off his walkie-talkie.

     INT. THE SAWYER CAR--DAWN

     Seeing the cop move away. VERONICA and J.D. stop kissing. They
     catch their breath, smile, then continue passionately necking.

     EXT. THE CLEARING--DAWN

     MILNER runs back into the clearing.

                             MILNER
               What's the deal?

                             McCORD
               Suicide. Double Suicide. They shot
               each other.

                             MILNER
               That's Kurt Kelly!

                             McCORD
               Yeah, and the linebacker, Ram Sweeney.

                             MILNER
               Oh my God, suicide? Why?

                             McCORD
               Does this answer your question?

     McCORD reaches in the feminine shopping bag and pulls out the
     bottles of Perrier water.

                             MILNER
               Oh man, they were <u>fags</u>!

                             McCORD
               Listen up, "We could never reveal our
               forbidden love to an uncaring and
               ununderstanding world."

                             MILNER
               Ah Jesus H. Fuck. Kurt was a Sherwood
               Sunday Insert Honorable Mention...

     MILNER shakes his head slowly then suddenly looks up.

                             MILNER
               Wait a second. How did they shoot
               each other if we heard two separate
               sets of gunshots?

                             McCORD
               I always hear gunshots when I'm high
               before noon. Life's a crazy bitch.
               Don't try to analyze it. The quarterback
               buggering the linebacker. What a waste.

                             MILNER
               Oh the humanity.

     INT. SCHOOL CONFERENCE ROOM--MORNING

     Another morning mourning conference. The participants look a
     little more frazzled. PAULINE sits at the head of the table.

                             COUNSELOR HYDE
                       (sotto voce to Mrs. Pope)
               After every touchdown or whatever,
               they give each other a little slap
               on the bottom. It seems innocent...

                             PAULINE (O.S.)
               Shut up.

     The elderly MRS. POPE shakes her head at the suicide note.

                             MRS. POPE
               Look at this. "Ununderstanding."

                             PAULINE
               Will you shut up! We were in a
               similar position Monday and I
               thoughtfully suggested that we get
               the students together for an
               unadulterated emotional outpouring.
               You took the suggestion as an
               opportunity to play yet another round
               of "Let's laugh at the Hippie."

                             COUNSELOR HYDE
               Pauline, if you want a tryout
               for the school play....

     PRINCIPAL GOWAN hoarsely breaks in.

                             PRINCIPAL GOWAN
               Shut up, Paul. I've seen a lot of
               bullshit--angel dust, switchblades,
               sexually perverse photography
               exhibits involving tennis racquets,
               but this suicide thing....I guess
               it's all on Pauline's wavelength.
               We're just going to write off today,
               and Friday she can do her little
               little love-in or whatever. Whatever.

     EXT. STUDENT PARKING LOT--MORNING

     VERONICA's car is the lone vehicle in the student parking lot.
     Slowly other cars begin to filter in, including a rumbling heap-
     ful of Heavy Metalers.

     INT. THE SAWYER CAR--MORNING

     The Heavy Metaler Heap's obnoxious muffler causes a sleeping
     VERONICA's eyes to snap open in bug-eyed sweat. Mentally
     wounded, she climbs into the front seat, pulling on her
     blazer. She presses in the car cigarette lighter. J.D.
     rumbles from the back as more cars begin to fill the lot.

                             VERONICA
               We killed them, didn't we?

                             J.D.
               Of course.

     VERONICA tugs out the car lighter and savagely brands the palm
     of her hand. J.D. hurdles into the front seat and bats the
     lighter away. He lights a cigarette off the scorched flesh of
     VERONICA's hand as she wails away.

                             VERONICA
               Ich Luge bullets! I'm an idiot!

     J.D. drags on his cigarette. School buses are pulling in
     outside of the parking lot, in front of the school.

                             J.D.
               You believed it because you wanted
               to believe it. Your true feelings were
               too gross and icky for you to face.

                             VERONICA
               I did not want them <u>dead</u>.

                             J.D.
               Did too.

                             VERONICA
               Did not.

                             J.D.
               Did too.

                             VERONICA
               Did not.

     J.D. launches into a rapid-fire rendition of "did-too's".
     VERONICA responds by holding her hands over her ears and
     singing "Mary had a Little Lamb." J.D.'s "Did-too's" get
     louder causing VERONICA to bang on the horn.

     EXT. PARKING LOT--DAY

     HEATHER DUKE and a vegged out HEATHER MCNAMARA stop sauntering
     through the parking lot to contemplate Veronica's hiccuping
     car and its sparring occupants.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Ah, young love.

     COURTNEY bounds up to the Heathers.

                             SQUEELING GIRL #1
               Did you hear? School's cancelled today
               because Kurt and Ram killed themselves in
               a repressed homosexual suicide pact.

                             HEATHER DUKE
                       (incredulous, but amused)
               No way!

     INT. THE SAWYER CAR--DAY

     J.D. pulls VERONICA off the horn and warmly places an unlit
     cigarette in her mouth. As he speaks, VERONICA wearily takes
     the cigarette from her mouth and puts it in her blazer pocket.

                             J.D.
               Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt
               and Ram had nothing to offer the school
               but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.

                             VERONICA
                       (looking to her burnt hand)
               Sure. Can we make an ice run
               before the funeral?

     STUDENTS head back to their cars and the Buses pull back out.

     INT. CHURCH--DAY

     A typically John Waynesque Jock's Father-type, MR. KELLY,
     stands over his son's open coffin. KURT wears a black football
     helmet. FATHER RIPPER watches on with various ADULTS,
     STUDENTS.

                             MR. KELLY
               If there's any way you can hear me,
               Kurt buddy, I don't care that you
               really were some pansy. You're my
               flesh-and-blood. You made me proud.
               I love my homosexual son. My son's
               gay and I love him!

     In dark sunglasses, VERONICA wearily leans over to J.D.

                             VERONICA
               Your son's dead and you love him.

                             J.D.
               How do you think Mr. Kelly would
               react to a son with a limp wrist
               with a pulse?

     They quietly laugh. VERONICA sees a LITTLE GIRL staring at
     her. She is wearing Kurt's football jersey and her face is
     soaked in tears. VERONICA's smile turns into a nauseated
     grimace.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM FLOOR--NIGHT

     VERONICA lies next to a Vodka bottle, drinking out of a Dixie
     cup. She turns off her blaring radio to speak on the phone.

                             D.J. (radio)
               As you know, the Sherwood Teen Suicide
               tote is up to three. Here's one for Kurt
               and Ram, BigFun with Teenage Suicide,
               Don't Do It....

                             VERONICA
               Hello J.D.? No, it's okay, I just kind
               of wanted to talk...Oh, a newsmagazine
               show on Channel 16. Really? On the
               suicides. No, sounds great. Bye.

     VERONICA hangs up and looks to her battered diary lying against
     the wall. She crawls to the diary and then reaches
     up to her night table to pull down her monocle and a pen.
     She sucks a cup of Vodka and begins writing.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               Dear Diary, my teen angst bullshit
               now has a body count.

     Sitting up against her bed, VERONICA continues writing as
     J.F.K. laps up Vodka from the Dixie cup.

                              VERONICA (V.O.)
               The most popular people in the school
               are dead. Everybody's sad, but it's a
               good kind of sad. Suicide gave Heather
               depth, Kurt a soul, Ram a brain. I
               gave J.D. shit about the Ich Luge thing
               but what really frightens me is that
               I'm not frightened by what J.D.'ll do
               next. It's God versus my boyfriend
               and God's losing....

     VERONICA drops her head back and closes her eyes, popping out
     her monocle. She swoons down against the bed onto the
     floor and curls into a fetal slumber.

     INT. THE CAFETERIA--DAY

     STUDENTS eat and buzz together in typical cacophony. All are
     wearing black armbands. A jukebox roars.

     PAULINE FLEMING and an entourage of STUDENTS such as PETER
     DAWSON and the HEATHERS invade the cafeteria, heads raised high.

                             PAULINE
               Peter, kill the jukebox.

     As the music amusingly grinds to a halt, PAULINE hoists up
     a bullhorn to her lips and crackles...

                             PAULINE
               Could I have your attention?

     A startled Geek RODNEY splatters milk all over himself.

     STUDENTS whip their heads around to the front of the cafeteria.
     MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK warily looks up from her plate.

     PAULINE FLEMING chants with soaring self-importance.

                             PAULINE
               Our school has been torn apart by
               tragedy. I'm here today to fuse it
               back together through Togetherness.
               I want everyone to clasp hands.
               We need to connect this cafeteria
               into one mighty circuit.

     A tableau of dumbfounded STUDENTS stare at the Bullhorn Woman.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CAFETERIA--SAME TIME--DAY

     Hungover in dark sunglasses, VERONICA bustles toward the
     cafeteria entrance clinging to an armful of books while trying
     to tie a black armband onto herself.

     INT. THE CAFETERIA--DAY

     PAULINE's Evita Peron-like composure is crumbling.

                             PAULINE
               Yo, what's the problem? I know you
               know how to hold hands. Ring-around-
               the-rosy-a-pocketful-of-posy...Forget it!
                       (looking to her watch then Peter)
               Where are they?

     Her back to the viewer, VERONICA enters the cafeteria. HEATHER
     DUKE floats into view and tightly knots VERONICA's armband.

                             VERONICA
               I see Ms. Phlegm's on another crusade.
               With usual success.

                             HEATHER DUKE
                       (looking to the viewer)
               I have a feeling this one'll work.

     VERONICA turns to the viewer and half-gasps.

     TWO 2-person video CAMERA CREWS and a STILL PHOTOGRAPHER burst
     into the cafeteria slightly battering the in-the-way VERONICA.

     PAULINE smiles in relief. She wields around, lifting the horn.

                             PAULINE
               The cameras are here! Lock your paws!

     Slightly confused but Awesomed, a table of Country Club Kids
     including COURTNEY stand and latch out to each other. A nearby
     table with BETTY FINN and friends follow suit.

     VERONICA looks on with a growing sense of queasiness.

     The Cafeteria swirls into a frenzy with members of more
     excitable cliques like the Jocks and the Heavy Metalers
     jumping over and onto tables anxiously bumbling into hand-
     holding constellations. CAMERA CREWS weave beside them.
     In a corner, the PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a shot of a thumbs-up
     PETER DAWSON with his arms around FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET.

     PAULINE runs ahead of a hustling CAMERA CREW and grabs hold of
     a chain of hand-holding Jocks. She pulls the chain until it
     connects up with a grateful chain of BETTY FINNS.

     A sleeping HEATHER MCNAMARA drearily awakens to the havoc around
     her. She takes off her black armband, ties it around her
     eyes, and droops her head back down on a table.

     VERONICA lets her books slide from her hands, shaking her head.

     MARTHA DUNNSTOCK nervously looks to her out-of-control peers.

     HEATHER DUKE slyly looks to VERONICA with an "If you can't
     beat em..." smile then saunters into the fray. She slides onto
     the lap of Heavy Metaler Matt. The PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a shot.

     PAULINE forces apart the handholding Heavy Metal lovers JACKIE
     and STEVE, sandwiches DENNIS in between them, and madly departs.

     The PHOTOGRAPHER now shoots a pic of a thumbs-up PETER DAWSON
     with his arms around an ALL OUT NERD.

     VERONICA stands before the chaos, back to the viewer, in much
     the same way Heather Chandler did in the opening scene.

     PAULINE and the Geek Squad look to MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK.

                             RODNEY
               I may be a geek, but I have my pride.

                             PAULINE
               Gotcha...Could I get some Stoners
               over here please!

     Frightened and flustered, MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK quakes
     for a moment then crawls underneath her table.

     A last panoramic view of the hustling CAMERA CREWS amid the
     panderingly anarchic STUDENTS unfolds.

     VERONICA suddenly finds herself flanked by J.D. The exiting
     CAMERA CREWS flow past them.

                             J.D.
               Was it as good for you as it was for me?

     A dumbfounded VERONICA watches PAULINE and PETER approach.

                             PETER
               I'm gonna need a VHS copy of all this by
               Monday for my Princeton application.

                             PAULINE
                       (looking to Veronica)
               Veronica, there you are! Wasn't it Fab?
               I've put peer pressure out to pasture!

                             VERONICA
               Oh come on, Pauline. What happens
               tomorrow, when the cameras aren't here?

     As they argue, J.D. looks out and sees MARTHA bob up from
     beneath her table then dart back under. He ambles away....

                             PAULINE
               Why are you dissing me, Veronica? I'm
               trying to redefine the high school
               experience.....

                             VERONICA
               You're ignoring the high school
               experience. People are dead and all
               you can think to do is whip up some
               warped Pity Party. If we're going to
               ever build respect for each other,
               it's gotta be something...something
               real. We can't be tricked into it.
               Back me up J.D...J.D.?

                             PAULINE
                       (moving off)
               Let's go Peter, some people are just
               unwilling to share the pain....

     MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE

     MARTHA slithers from under the table up into her seat, and
     head down, tries to finish off a bowl of soup. She slowly looks
     up and freezes. J.D. is revealed to be seated across from her,
     behind his Rebel Without a Cause lunch box. He smiles warmly.

                             J.D.
               Greetings and salutations.

     INT. J.D.'S LIVING ROOM--NIGHT

     VERONICA restlessly rocks on a couch with increasingly
     unguarded annoyance. Excitedly insensitive to her words, J.D.
     spins the tuner of his radio, headphones pressed to one ear.

                             VERONICA
               That thing this afternoon...I'm so
               angry! It was like "Boy, isn't death
               fun!" "Gee, I wonder who'll die next!"
               "I'll bet we get <u>four</u> camera crews
               next time." It was chaos. Fucking chaos.

     J.D. giddily pivots around, tearing the headphones from the
     radio and causing a blast of static to accompany his words.

                             J.D.
               What are you talking about? Today
               was great. Chaos is great. Chaos is
               what killed the dinosaurs, darling,
               and it's what's going to make
               Westerburg a purified place to get
               an education. Face it, our way is
               the way. We scare people into not
               being assholes.

                             VERONICA
                       (a ticking time bomb)
               Our way is not <u>our</u> way.

                             J.D.
               Tell that to the judge; "Your honor,
               I was led to believe there were Ich
               Luge bullets in the gun." Tell it to
               Kurt Kelly! "Don't shoot, Veronica,
               I'm the quarterback."

     J.D. goes into a Sonny-Corleone-at-the-Turnpike imitation.
     VERONICA throws the first thing she can get her hands on, a
     framed picture of a woman, at the vibrating J.D.

                             VERONICA
               I'm telling it to <u>you</u>! <u>You</u>! Nothing
               good can come from suicide, from murder,
               from death. Nothing! Nothing except more
               death and shit like that feeding frenzy
               this afternoon....Geez, what am I..who...
               Unnaah! You can be so immature!

                             J.D.
                       (looking off)
               You kids are making too much damn noise.

     BIG BUD DEAN is revealed to be standing in the front doorway,
     holding a chest exerciser and waving a videocassette.

                             BIG BUD DEAN
               We beat the bitches.

                             VERONICA
                       (mumbling)
               Oh beautiful. The Beaver's home.

                             BIG BUD DEAN
               Judge told em to slurp shit and die.

     BIG BUD moves to the Entertainment console, turns off the
     radio and turns on the V.C.R. He crams the cassette in and
     hefts up his chest exerciser. He begins pumping away as the
     image of a shabby building appears on the massive T.V.

                             BIG BUD DEAN
               I put a Norwegian in the boiler room.
               Masterful. When that blew, it set off
               a pack of thermals I'd stuck upstairs.

     The building blows up. BIG BUD cackles. J.D. politely
     applauds. BUD pops out the videocassette and bounces away.

                             BIG BUD DEAN
               It's great to be alive!

                             VERONICA
               Do you like your father?

                             J.D.
               Never given the matter much thought.
               Liked my mother.

     J.D. picks up the framed picture that Veronica threw.

                             J.D.
               They said her death was an accident.
               But she knew when the explosives were
               set to go off. She knew...

     VERONICA slowly sits down next to J.D. with dazed concern.

                             VERONICA
               In some sick way, we unclogged the
               sinuses of the school. But if we're
               going to keep the school healthy, it's
               gotta be through something having to
               do with life, not death.

                             J.D.
               Whoa, Metaphor Tennis anyone? Tell me,
               if you put a Nazi in a concentration
               camp, does that make you a Nazi?

                             VERONICA
               May<u>be</u>.

     J.D. exhales in frustration before bounding up from the couch
     to turn back on the radio.

                             D.J. (Radio)
               Dudes, if I get one more request for
               that BigFun song <u>I'm</u> going to
               committ suicide. Here it is......

                             J.D.
                       (malevolently)
               They're playing our song....

     As the "song" kicks in (a bunch of guys shouting over a drum
     machine), J.D. seductively moves toward VERONICA, semi-lip-
     syncing it. As a seethingly angry but not unaroused
     VERONICA watches, J.D. slithers onto the couch.

                             BIGFUN (Radio)
               TIMES ARE MEAN FOR A TEEN--WE KNOW!
               PARENTS IGNORE, TEACHERS BORE--WE KNOW!
               BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO GO!
               TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
               TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!

     J.D. stops his seduction and rips out a gun. He giddily fires
     into the radio, destroying it.

                             VERONICA
               That's it, we're breaking up.

                             J.D.
               Wha-a-at?

     J.D. playfully tackles the fleeing VERONICA. This calms rather
     than angers. She turns on her back. J.D. follows suit.

                             J.D.
               You can't bring them back. You
               must know that.

                             VERONICA
               I'm not trying to "bring back"
               anybody...except maybe myself.

     VERONICA sighs, then rolls over into a crawling position and
     eventually into a walking-out-the-door position.

                             VERONICA
               To think there was a time when I
               thought you were cool. If you can't
               deal with me now, just stay home and
               shoot your T.V., blow away a couple
               toasters or something. Just don't come
               to school and don't mess with me.

                             J.D.
               You'll be <u>back</u>!

     J.D. slowly sits up and with both hands, puts his gun in his
     mouth. He pauses, lets go of the gun, and then biting down on
     the barrel of the gun, J.D. proceeds to broodingly tie his
     shoes.

     INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM--DAY

     J.D. moves to an empty row of desks. He turns the first desk
     as to face the second. HEATHER DUKE warily lowers herself into
     the second desk as J.D. flops a manilla envelope onto it.
     HEATHER DUKE opens the envelope and pulls out a stack of 8x10's.

     The first shot shows a YOUNG HEATHER DUKE in a summer camp
     uniform that vibrantly reads HEATHER, She is holding one end
     of a large poster board drawing of two Eskimos rubbing noses.
     Holding the other end, in a summer camp uniform vibrantly
     reading MARTHA, is a YOUNG MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               What the.....

     With a harsh laugh, she takes in the next photograph. It has
     YOUNG HEATHER DUKE and YOUNG MARTHA eating toasted
     marshmallows off each other's sticks.

                             HEATHER DUKE
                       (queasily intrigued)
               Where did you get these?

                             J.D.
               Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with
               Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's
               scary how everyone's got a story to
               tell....Would you care to see the
               canoeing shots?

                             HEATHER DUKE
               What is this? Blackmail? So what. I
               once shared a bunk with the biggest
               loser in the state. I'm not running
               for president....
                       (narrowing her eyes at the photos)
               I'll give you a week's lunch money.

                             J.D.
               I don't want your money, I want your
               strength. Westerburg doesn't need
               mushy togetherness, it needs a leader.
               Heather Chandler was that leader but...

                             HEATHER DUKE
               But she couldn't handle it.

     J.D. laughs. She's on the ball.

                             J.D.
               I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye
               Holden says his ideal job'd be making
               sure some kids don't fall off a cliff.
               He doesn't realize if you pay too much
               attention to the kids, you'll back off
               the cliff yourself.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Very very. The photographs?

                             J.D.
               Don't worry. I'll ask you to do a favour,
               one you'll enjoy. You'll get the
               negatives and everything back then.

     J.D. launches away from his desk with a grin. He places a
     red ribbon on HEATHER DUKE's desk.

                             J.D.
               In the meantime, strength, And hey,
               there's a little gift.

     INT. THE GIRLS BATHROOM--DAY

     A spooked HEATHER DUKE splashes water on her face and looks up
     into the mirror. In a trance, she pulls her hair back Heather
     Chandler fashion and ties it with the ribbon J.D. gave her.

     A BETTY FINN-A-LIKE moves up to the sink beside her. Two CHIC
     BABES enter the bathroom with pouting expressions. Seemingly
     in a trance, HEATHER DUKE bends over and wipes off her wet hands
     using the oblivious BETTY FINN-A-LIKE's dress. HEATHER DUKE
     winks to the now-giggling CHIC BABES and saunters off.

     INT. HALLWAY--DAY

     HEATHER DUKE bursts through the bathroom door to wickedly
     strut down the hall. She scowls/smiles in perfect Heather
     Chandler fashion to various passers-by.

     ANOTHER HALLWAY--DAY

     Disoriented, VERONICA somnambulates down the hall. She suddenly
     brakes amid the flow of Student traffic to stare at a locker.
     The locker wears a POLICE LINE--DO NOT CROSS sticker. VERONICA
     pulls out a School Spirit Club I.D. Card and moves to the locker.

     With the card, she wrangles the locker open. It contains a
     coat, recognizably Heather Chandler's. On the inside door is a
     sizable mirror, a cute little "HEATHER" license plate, an
     Alexander Haig For President sticker, and a picture of VERONICA
     and the HEATHERS all wearing sunglasses and acting tough.

     VERONICA zeroes in on a three frame Photo Booth picture. In
     the first frame, VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER stare
     stonefaced. In the second frame, the two girls are screaming
     at the top of their lungs. In the third frame, they have
     returned to a stonefaced state. VERONICA touches the picture
     with a quivering smile as two hands flap around her eyes.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Guess who?

                             VERONICA
               Heather.

     VERONICA turns around, stunned. The Heather Chandleresque
     HEATHER DUKE can be seen in the locker mirror. VERONICA
     violently pushes HEATHER DUKE away and storms off.

     HEATHER DUKE peers in the open locker. A pair of red earrings
     flash out at her. Biting her lip, she reaches for them.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     Lying on the floor, VERONICA concentrates on her phone. With
     a deep sigh, she pushbuttons out a number. She pauses, then...

                             VERONICA
               Ouch. Your machine's got the most
               obnoxious beep. Heather, I'm sorry.

     INT. HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     VERONICA's voice drones through HEATHER DUKE's answering machine.

                             VERONICA (O.S./machine)
               I'm just calling to say you can
               wear your hair any way you want to.

     A Male hand picks up the phone. It's College boy DAVID.

                             DAVID
               Hey Veronica Sawyer, barf on
               anybody's carpet lately?

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     VERONICA cringes.

                             VERONICA
               Is this David? Heather's David?
               What are you doing....

     INT. HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

                             DAVID
               What can I say? I was pretty broken
               up by Heather C.'s suicide. I needed
               somebody super-sensitive like Heather D.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

                             VERONICA
               I'm delirious for the both of you.
               Can you put Heather on?

     INT. HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     DAVID proudly looks down off-screen to his lap.

                             DAVID
               She can't really talk right now.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     VERONICA slams down the receiver and pulls up a sleek leather
     address book. She severely scans through it. Tossing it away,
     VERONICA then descends into the sundry junk of her night
     table drawer and draws up another address book.
     This one is frayed and pink polka-dotted. She peruses it and
     dials.....

                             VERONICA
               Hello, Betty.....

     EXT. SAWYER BACKYARD--LATE AFTERNOON

     BETTY FINN hits her ball through a wicket and squeals in
     delight. VERONICA has a motherly smile on her face.

                             BETTY
               I don't believe it. I'm winning.

                             VERONICA
               Don't get cocky, girl.

     BETTY bends down to shoot then raises her body back up.

                             BETTY
               I missed you. I know I'm not as, as
               exciting as your other friends.

                             VERONICA
               That's bullshit. Just shoot.

     BETTY once again bends and raises.

                             BETTY
               Ronnie, I'm still a virgin. I french-
               kissed Al Springer once but he...

                             VERONICA
                       (warmly)
               Shoot.

     BETTY finally shoots. Feebly.

                             VERONICA
               Betty, your daydreams are a lot
               better than my realities, believe
               me. I'm afraid though it's time to die.

                             BETTY
               Ronnie!

     VEONCIA gigglingly shoots, but misses the wicket. And instead
     hits BETTY's ball. Disturbed by the sudden dilemma, she
     determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from BETTY's.

                             BETTY
               Hey, you're not settling for the two shots
               are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.

                             VERONICA
               It's not my style, okay?

                             BETTY
               Nice guys finish last. I should know.

     VERONICA sighs then knocks BETTY's adjacent ball sailing
     toward the porch and a statuesque Earring-wearing HEATHER
     DUKE, who does not budge as the ball whizzes past her.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Brav-<u>o</u>!

                             BETTY FINN
                       (nervously)
               I've got to get going, Veronica.

                             VERONICA
               Sure.

     HEATHER DUKE walks toward the girls followed by a meandering
     desultory HEATHER MCNAMARA, who picks up a green mallet and
     fragilely swings it; her early robustness a forgotten memory.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Croquet won't be the same without Heather.

                             HEATHER DUKE
                       (condescendingly to the passing Betty)
               Oh Betty, leaving so soon...HEY, I'M RED!

     LATER IN THE GAME

     Red ball underfoot, HEATHER DUKE savagely "sends" HEATHER
     MCNAMARA's green ball into the flower bed.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Shit.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               You know what really bites; when people
               watch that cafeteria stuff on TV and see
               all those Geeks and Metalheads jumping
               around, they're going to think Uncool
               is the Rule at Westerburg.....Damn!

     HEATHER DUKE's shot swerves wide of the wicket.

                             VERONICA
               You're so polluted. Talking down to
               people, making fake notes....

     VERONICA blows her shot.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               I don't see what gives you the right
               to lecture, <u>Ronnie</u>. You were
               soulmates with Betty Finn until you
               realized you're the cover of
               Seventeen magazine and she's the
               before half of a Scarsdale Diet ad.

     HEATHER DUKE bashes her ball into VERONICA's and prepares
     to send it.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Some people just don't matter. Why
               should those who do carry their
               weight? Am I right?

     As HEATHER DUKE swings down her mallet, VERONICA steps on her
     own ball. When HEATHER DUKE's mallet makes contact, the two
     balls slam against each other, unmoving, with a loud smack.

                             VERONICA
               No, you're wrong. It's not even
               your turn.

     The depressed and disoriented HEATHER MCNAMARA, laying
     against a tree, pipes in.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               She's right.....Boy, croquet's not
               the same without Heather.

                             HEATHER DUKE
                       (shaking out her wrist)
               I don't know what your damage is
               Veronica, but me and Heather are
               going to walk over to the Mall.
               Maybe by the time we head back,
               your tampon'll be flushed.

     As HEATHER DUKE and HEATHER MCNAMARA meander out the back of
     the yard, an annoyed VERONICA revolves back toward the house
     to see J.D. sitting comfortably at the patio table with a
     drink.

                             VERONICA
               Christ, doesn't anybody knock?

                             J.D.
               Mummy and Daddy let me in. So I'm a
               dark horse, huh? You make me blush...

     VERONICA reaches the patio, gently swinging her croquet mallet,
     excited with the thought that J.D. has come to change his ways.

                             VERONICA
               Did you come to tell me something?
               Something nice. Remotely apologetic.

                             J.D.
                       (oblivious)
               How about that Heather Duke, huh? I
               say it's about time we got down to
               doing what we do best.

                             VERONICA
                       (angrily blowing up at her bangs)
               Just finish your drink and get out.

     VERONICA storms to the patio door.

     INT. GYM--DUSK

     Wearing a BigFun T-shirt, MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK sits in
     the bleachers glumly sipping out of a cup of Coke. Cheers and
     shouts can be heard booming around her.

     As she places the cup down beside her, it is revealed MARTHA
     is completely alone in the gym; the others being sad workings
     of her embattled imagination.

     She lifts the cup back up to her mouth but the plastic lid
     pops off and a gush of Coke splashes onto her BigFun T-shirt.

     INT. THE SAWYER LIVING ROOM--DUSK

     With her croquet mallet, VERONICA comes into her house,
     sliding the patio door closed. MOM and DAD are watching a
     video image of PAULINE FLEMING at a cafeteria table.

                             MOM
               Jason's kinda cute for a dark horse.

                             PAULINE (T.V.)
               The Westerburg Suicides were tough on
               all of us, but we shared the pain of
               losing three very popular souls.

                             DAD
               I don't know about that coat he was
               wearing though. Hey, isn't that the
               flake we met at Open House.

     A zombie VERONICA floats past her parents to stare at the T.V.

                             PAULINE (T.V.)
               I came into the cafeteria and
               asked them to hold hands. The
               response was immediate.

     Footage of the frenzied handholding Students unfolds upon the
     screen with no evidence of the calculation behind it.
     PAULINE's sanctimoniously dulcet tones go over the image.

                             PAULINE (V.O./T.V.)
               My mere words liberated the students,
               causing them to open their petals and
               reveal their hopes and fears. By a
               stroke of luck, T.V. cameras were
               fortunate enough to happen to be on
               hand to capture this spontaneous,
               natural emotional outpouring of emotion.

                             VERONICA
               Happened to be on hand....spontaneous
               natural emotional outpouring!

     VERONICA clams up in anger as her parents babble.

                             DAD
               Look there's Heather.

                             MOM
               And there's Heather. Where are
               you, Veronica?

     The video image of PAULINE at a cafeteria table returns.

                             PAULINE (T.V.)
               Whether to commit suicide is the most
               important decision a teenager has to
               make. With supervision from people like
               myself, we can help young people make
               the right decision.

     With her croquet, VERONICA slams the on/off Button and
     turns to her parents.

                             VERONICA
               I'm right here.

     EXT. OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL--DUSK

     MARTHA trudges outside of the school, the coke stain still
     grotesquely encrusted to her BigFun T-shirt. She pins an
     illegible-except-for-the-words-DEAR-WESTERBURG note onto her
     shirt, over the stain. She continues moving toward a street
     of passing cars.

     INT. SAWYER FAMILY/T.V. ROOM--DUSK/NIGHT

     The Sawyer family is on fire. VERONICA yanks the television
     cord from its socket.

                             MOM
               Turn that back on!

                             VERONICA
               Can't you see, these little programs
               eat up suicide with a spoon. They make
               it seem like a cool thing to do.

                             DAD
               If we're not going to watch that
               program, can I put on the game?

                             VERONICA
               Hey kids, make your parents and
               teachers feel like shit! Get the
               respect in death you'll never get
               in life!

                             MOM
               Are you trying to tell me it is <u>not</u>
               a troubled time for the nation's youth?
               Get up off the floor, your dress is
               getting filthy.

                             VERONICA
               Everybody cares about <u>youth</u>, not the
               individual. All we want is to be treated
               like human beings, not like guinea pigs
               to be experimented on and not like
               bunny rabbits to be patronized.

                             DAD
               I do not patronize bunny rabbits.

                             MOM
               Treated like human beings? Is that
               what you said little Miss Voice of
               a Generation? Just how do you think
               adults act with other adults? You
               think it's all just Doubles Tennis.
               Adults can be horrible to other adults.
               When teenagers complain that they
               want to be treated like human beings,
               it's usually because they <u>are</u> being
               treated like human beings.

     VERONICA leans against the wall with a melancholy smile.

                             VERONICA
               I guess I picked the wrong time
               to be a human being.

     MOM is embarassed for getting so involved. She meekly gestures
     to a tray of pate with a compassionate smile.

                             MOM
               You'll live. Want some pate?

     HEATHER DUKE suddenly breezes in the room, out of breath,
     holding various shopping bags.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Hi everyone, door was open. Have you
               heard, Veronica? We were doing Chinese
               at the Food Fair, right, when they
               come over the radio and say Martha
               Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She
               bellyflopped in front of a car,
               wearing a suicide note.

                             VERONICA
                       (repulsed)
               Is she dead?

                             HEATHER DUKE
               That's the punchline. She's still
               alive, in stable condition. Another
               case of a geek trying to imitate the
               popular people of the school and
               failing miserably. Is that pate?

     VERONICA slaps HEATHER DUKE in the face.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     HEATHER DUKE paces the room holding an icepack to her jaw.
     VERONICA is glumly sprawled on the ground.

                             VERONICA
               I said I was sorry.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               You are out of control. Heather and
               Kurt were a shock, but Martha
               Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed
               suicide hotlines in her diapers.

                             VERONICA
               You're not funny. Turn on the radio.

                             HEATHER DUKE
                       (Heather Chandleresque)
               Martha couldn't take the heat so she
               got out of the kitchen. Just think
               what a better place the world would
               be if every nimrod followed her cue.

                             VERONICA
               Just shut up and turn on the radio.
               Hot Probs is on.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Oh shit, yeah.

     HEATHER DUKE hastens to the radio and flicks it on. Ripping
     open a bag of corn nuts, she sets herself down next to
     VERONICA as a TROUBLED MALE VOICE cuts the air.

                             TROUBLED MALE VOICE (Radio)
               I know it's supposed to be funny
               that they never get off the island,
               but still, sometimes I feel like <u>I'm</u>
               on that island and Gilligan can be just
               so <u>stupid</u> sometimes.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               This sounds like a good one.

     INT. RADIO STATION BOOTH--NIGHT 

     A slob D.J. cackles into a conference call-type box.

                             D.J.
               Dude, you've got to remember if it
               wasn't for the courage of the fearless
               crew, the Minnow would be lost. The
               Minnow would be lost! Next call!

                             TROUBLED MALE VOICE
               But Skipper hates me...

     The D.J. rudely clicks off the TROUBLED MALE VOICE.

                             D.J.
               Whoa, they're coming out early tonight.
               What ever happened to abortions and acne?
               You've got the Dogcatcher and you're
               listening to Hot Probs.

     INT. HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     HEATHER MCNAMARA is sitting clandestinely on her bedroom floor
     talking on the phone and through her radio. A dim lamp
     provides the room's only light.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               My name is Heather, I mean, not Heather.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA looks up at a Madonna poster on the wall.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               It's Madonna. Geez, no, not that.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA looks up to a knick-knack of little gold bird.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     VERONICA and HEATHER DUKE simultaneously move into stunned
     silence.

                             D.J. (radio)
               Hey babe, I need a name?

     INT. RADIO STATION BOOTH--NIGHT

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA (box)
               My name is Tweety.

                             D.J.
               Yo, Tweet, if you're going to tell
               me you just saw a puttycat....

     INT. HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     A broken-down HEATHER MCNAMARA sobs.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               God has cursed me, I think. The
               last time I had sex, the guy killed
               himself the next day. I'm failing Math.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     HEATHER DUKE excitedlly jumps up as HEATHER MCNAMARA drones on.

               HEATHER DUKE                 HEATHER MCNAMARA (radio)
          Holy shit, that's            My whole life is a mess.
          Heather! We'll               I was supposed to be
          crucify her!                 captain of the cheerleading
                                       team, but I probably won't
               VERONICA                because I miss practice when
          Oh man, she knows we         my Dad visits. My parents
          listen to this show!         are divorced and stuff and....

     INT. CLASSROOM--DAY

     A blackboard reads POOR LITTLE HEATHER.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               Heather told everyone about Heather.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA is revealed in the front row wearing her
     cheerleader uniform. To the left, HEATHER DUKE dishes with
     some dreamy GUYS. At the back of the classroom, VERONICA,
     monocle in eye, writes in her diary.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               Yes, Dear Diary, I've cut off Heather
               Chandler's head and Heather Duke's head
               has sprouted in its place like some
               mythological thing my eighth grade
               boyfriend would know about. Heather's
               even doing the old note trick.

     A HOMELY GIRL is seen reading a note, glancing to a TYPICAL JOCK.
     VERONICA takes in the wicked panorama of the classroom.

                             VERONICA (V.O.)
               I've seen J.D.'s way. I've seen Pauline's way.
               Nothing's changed. I guess that's Heather's
               way. And jesus, what about J.D.? I can't get
               him out of my head. Are we going to the Prom?
               Or to Hell? And where's Heather going?

     HEATHER MCNAMARA suddenly rises and walks out of the classroom,
     passing a GRUFF TEACHER in a trenchcoat, carrying a briefcase.

                             GRUFF TEACHER
               Where's Heather going?

                             HEATHER DUKE
               She's going to <u>cry-y-y</u>.

     INT. GIRLS BATHROOM--DAY

     HEATHER MCNAMARA struggles to open a bottle of sleeping pills.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Fucking child protector caps.

     INT. THE GRUFF TEACHER'S CLASSROOM--DAY

     GRUFF TEACHER writes a math problem on the board. A flustered
     VERONICA squirms in her seat then leaps up and runs to the door.

                             GRUFF TEACHER
               Now where's she going? Is somebody getting
               raped today on All My Children or what?

     INT. GIRLS BATHROOM--DAY


     INT. HALLWAY--DAY

     VERONICA races down the hall.

     INT. GIRLS BATHROOM--DAY

     HEATHER MCNAMARA is a chipmunk with a mouthful of pills.

     She pulls a glass from her purse and turns on a faucet, but no
     water comes out. She manages to mumble.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Give me a break.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA gets running water from another sink as
     VERONICA rushes in. VERONICA punches HEATHER MCNAMARA's face
     causing the pills to explode out of her mouth. HEATHER
     MCNAMARA slumps against a stall, onto the floor.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               What are you trying to do? Kill me?

     VERONICA jumps up and down on the pills on the floor.

                             VERONICA
               What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Suicide is a private thing.

     VERONICA lunges forward to strike her. HEATHER MCNAMARA
     recoils with a wail. Half-regaining her composure, VERONICA
     slides down next to HEATHER MCNAMARA.

                             VERONICA
               You're giving your life away to
               become a goddamn statistic in U.S.
               Fucking A Today. That's got to be
               the least private thing I can think of.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?

                             VERONICA
               If everyone jumped off a bridge,
               young lady, would you?

     HEATHER MCNAMARA wipes tears from her eyes and smiles weakly.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Probably....

                             VERONICA
               Hey now, if you were happy every day
               of your life, you wouldn't be a human
               being, you'd be a game show host.

                             HEATHER MCNAMARA
               Let's knock off early. Buy some shoes.
               Something lame like that.

                             VERONICA
               Sure.

     INT. THE EMPTY CLASSROOM--DAY

     Comfortably slouched at a desk, J.D. laconically rumbles.

                             J.D.
               So it's come to this.
                       (turning to the viewer)
               Heather Chandler did polls. I want you
               to do a Petition, as a favor, as <u>the</u>
               favor. You've heard the group Big Fun, right?

     HEATHER DUKE sits at the desk opposite him torching <u>the</u>
     manilla envelopes (photographs) with a butane lighter.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!

                             J.D.
                       (post-chortle)
               Some teenybopper rag said that Big Fun wants
               to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's
               if we can get everyone's John Hancock.

     J.D. flips across a stack of blank, connected computer
     printout sheets. At the top is a small paragraph and the word
     PETITION. HEATHER DUKE blows ashes off her desk and grabs it,
     giggling.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               I'll get right on it coach. And hey,
               a little gift. I won't be needing it.

     HEATHER DUKE twirls her copy of Catcher in the Rye to a
     pleased J.D.

     INT. STAIRCASE WINDOW--DAY

     HEATHER DUKE gothically ascends a staircase, holding the
     petition. She stops, arms raised high, to bathe in the
     sunlight blasting through the staircase window.

     INT. CAFETERIA--DAY

     HEATHER DUKE, petition in hand, sashays toward the Country
     Club Kids table.

                             COURTNEY
               Oh great. Here comes Heather.

                             KEITH
               Shit.

     INT. SCHOOL BUS--DAY

     HEATHER DUKE chirps to a schoolbusful of various STUDENTS.

     EXT. SCHOOL LAWN--DAY

     The provocatively dressed Petitioner charms a patch of Jocks.

     INT. STAIRCASE WINDOW--DAY

     HEATHER DUKE continues to bizarrely bathe in the sunlight of
     the staircase window.

     EXT. PARKING LOT--DAY

     Strategically wearing Heavy Metal accessories, HEATHER DUKE
     slams down the petition atop a car-hoodful of Metalheads.

     INT. STONERS' HALLWAY--DAY

     Decked out in denim, HEATHER DUKE vanishes into the Stoner
     Hallway smoke, with the petition.

     INT. THE STAIRCASE WINDOW--DAY

     HEATHER DUKE further writhes in the sunlight until VERONICA's
     perplexed voice cuts into her bliss.

                             VERONICA (O.S.)
               Heather?

     HEATHER DUKE brings down her arms and the petition and turns
     to VERONICA, revealed to be descending down the steps.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've
               gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition
               even the one who think BigFun are
               tuneless Eurofags. People love me!
                       (giggling)
               My God, you haven't signed!

                             VERONICA
               People love you but I know you.
               Jennifer Forbes told me the petition
               she signed was to put a hot tub in
               the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...

                             HEATHER DUKE
                       (verbally winking)
               So some people need different kinds
               of "convincing" than others....
                       (happiness evaporating)
               Hey, just sign the petition!

                             VERONICA


                             HEATHER DUKE
               It was J.D.'s idea! He made
               out the signature sheet and
               everything. Now will you sign it?

                             VERONICA
                       (queasy)
               No.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Jealous much?

     VERONICA slaps HEATHER DUKE with all her might.

                             VERONICA
               Heather, why can't you just be a
               friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Because I can be! The same fucking cheek,
               goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick?
               Do you think, do you really think, if
               Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u>
               Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with
               her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!

     HEATHER DUKE stumbles down the stairs.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Fuck me gently with a chainsaw...

     J.D.'s voice cuts into VERONICA's concentration.

                             J.D. (O.S.)
               Wanna go out tonight?

     VERONICA grimly turns to see a smirking, descending J.D.

                             J.D.
               Catch a movie? Some miniature Golf?

                             VERONICA
                       (jokingly but caustically)
               I was thinking more along the lines
               of slitting Heather Duke's wrists
               open and making it look like a suicide.

     J.D. seductively slides behind VERONICA and envelops her.

                             J.D.
               I could be up for that. I've already
               started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages
               in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye,
               if you know what I mean. This is great,
               Veronica. I knew you'd come back.

     As in the Chandler kitchen scene, J.D. kisses the back of
     VERONICA's neck and she closes her eyes. Suddenly she rifles
     her elbow into his stomach, doubling him over. She screams in
     his ear then bolts down the stairs as he gasps after her.

                             VERONICA
               It's over, J.D.  Over! Grow up!

                             J.D.
               I don't get it! You were wrong! I was
               right! Strength, damnit! Come back!

     INT. SAWYER LIVING ROOM--DUSK

     Intensely clutching her schoolbooks, VERONICA walks through
     the front door into the living room where MOM and DAD sit with
     aggressively compassionate faces. VERONICA is a bit confused.

                             VERONICA
               Yes?

     MOM and DAD glance at each other before MOM speaks.

                             MOM
               Your friend Jason Dean just stopped
               by. He seemed very concerned about
               you. He said he thinks you might
               try to kill yourself.

                             DAD
               You <u>have</u> been depressed lately. Oh,
               he said this is for you.

     DAD holds out an envelope. VERONICA nabs it and rips it open.
     The note reads, in feminine manuscript: RECOGNIZE THE
     HANDWRITING?

                             VERONICA
               Oh my God....

     VERONICA runs off, her mother's voice trailing behind her.

                             MOM (O.S.)
               He says we should keep you away from
               sharp objects, closed garages, toxic...

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DUSK

     VERONICA vaults through her bedroom door. A Barbieish doll
     wearing a BigFun T-shirt hangs from a noose. With a whimper,
     she swerves away from it, looks to her open window, and then
     dives onto her bed.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE SAWYER HOUSE--NIGHT

     J.D. laconically leans against his motorcycle with his legs
     suavely crossed. He looks uo to Veronica's bedroom window and
     hears another whimper emerge. He puts a cigarette in his mouth
     and lights it with a smile.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     VERONICA curls into a fetal position on her bed and closes her
     eyes.....tighter and tighter as J.D.'s voice.

                             J.D. (O.S.)
               "You can't ever find a place nice
               and peaceful because there isn't any."

     VERONICA flops around to see J.D. kneeling over her on her bed
     reading Heather Duke's copy of The Catcher in the Rye.

                             J.D.
               Nice. It's got that Catcher-in-the-Ryey-
               I-hate-the-world-and-the-world-hates-me-
               so-let's-commit-suicide ambience. Give
               it a try, underline something.

     J.D. giddily underlines words then slides into a prone
     position, tossing the book to an enraged VERONICA.

                             VERONICA
               Get off my bed, you sick psycho.
               You think you're a rebel. You're
               not a rebel. You're a sick psycho.
                       (increasing rage)
               Do you think you're a rebel? Do you
               think you're a rebel? I wanna know!

                             J.D.
               You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's
               call the whole thing off...Hold it!

     VERONICA freezes and J.D. reaches up to her hand where she
     holds the Catcher in the Rye. Her index finger is curled into
     the book. Sitting up, J.D. carefully opens the book at that
     place and peers in.

                             J.D.
               Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I
               love it. I usually go for whole
               sentences myself, but hey this is
               perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...

                             VERONICA
               Wait a....You're not listening! I'm
               not on your side....

     INT. THE DUKE KITCHEN--NIGHT

     The sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before
     VERONICA and J.D. burst through the door. J.D. moves to the
     dishwasher and opens it like a burglar opening a safe.

                             VERONICA
               You're still not listening! I'm not..

                             J.D.
                       (pulling out the knife)
               Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.

                             VERONICA
                       (taking the knife from him)
               This knife is filthy.

                             J.D.
               What in the hell do you think I'm
               doing? Taking out her tonsils?

                             VERONICA
               I think I know Heather a bit better
               than you, okay? If she was going to
               slash her wrists, the knife would
               be absolutely spotless.

     J.D. grabs a dishtowel and vigorously wipes off the knife.

                             J.D.
               How's this? Can you see your
               fucking reflection?

     She can and so can the viewer. Tears well in VERONICA's eyes.
     She begins to shudder, a shattered smile quaking on her face.

                             VERONICA
               Tomorrow someone else will move
               into her place. That person
               could be me.
                       (suddenly deliriously defiant)
               Ha, there's only one of us who knows
               Heather's handwriting and if you think
               I'm doing another suicide note.

                             J.D.
                       (laughing)
               You don't get it, do you? Society
               nods its head at any horror the
               American teenager can think to
               bring upon itself. We don't need
               gloves and does anyone really
               care about exact handwriting?

     J.D. tears his gloves off with a giggle. He takes a pen from the
     kitchen counter and paper from a cutesy memo pad. He shoves the
     pen in VERONICA's hand and grabbing her hand, forces her to
     scribble LIFE SUCKS on the paper.

                             J.D.
               Perfecto. Man, I've even got a
               marked-up Catcher in the Rye.
               What else does a suicide need?

     J.D. pulls out the copy of the Catcher in the Rye and opens a
     door revealing HEATHER DUKE, asleep in an artful pose on a
     couch, MTV images from the T.V. flashing against her.

                             J.D.
                       (raising the knife)
               If you'll excuse me......

                             VERONICA
               No-o!

     J.D. hos in the adjoinging room and slams the door. VERONICA
     races to the door wailing. She maniacally rattles the doorknob
     trying to open the locked door.

     INT. AN ANOYNYMOUS T.V./HEATHER DUKE'S ROOM--NIGHT

     The sound of the rattling doorknob subtly turns into wild
     African music thundering on the soundtrack as PAULINE FLEMING
     ethereally moves to a blackboard with three chalk strokes on
     it and makes a fourth chalk stroke.

     INT. NEWSPAPER/YEARBOOK WORKSHOP--DAY

     In speeded-up imagery, DENNIS, PETER, and the YEARBOOK GIRL
     maneuver pictures of HEATHER CHANDLER, KURT, RAM, and HEATHER
     DUKE in mind-bogglingly countless ways in order to accomodate
     them all on the same two page layout.

     INT. FRONT OF THE CAFETERIA--DAY

     With even more speeded-up imagery, four STUDENTS wearing "What
     a Waste, Oh the Humanity" T-shirts toss out tons of black
     armbands into a hungry crowd.

     INT. CHURCH--DAY

     The wild African music and the speeded up imagery slams to a
     halt at the sigh of HEATHER DUKE lying serenely in a coffin.
     FATHER RIPPER wearing dark sunglasses and a terrifying toupee,
     walks in front of her to address a sizable group of ADULTS and
     STUDENTS sitting in foldout chairs before him. FATHER RIPPER
     dramatically looks over the crowd before finally speaking.

                             FATHER RIPPER
               Eskimo.

     FATHER RIPPER lets the word hang in the air, then holds up <u>the</u>
     book.

                             FATHER RIPPER
               Heather Duke underlined a lot of
               things in this copy of The Catcher
               in the Rye, but I believe the word
               Eskimo, underlined all by itself is
               the key to understanding Heather's pain.

     VERONICA stands in a corner with an "Oh brother" look on her
     face.

                             FATHER RIPPER
               On the surface, Heather Duke was the
               vivacious young lady we all knew her
               to be. But her soul was in Antartica,
               freezing with the knowledge of the way
               fellow teenagers can be cruel, the way
               parents can be unresponsive, and as she
               writes so eloquently in her suicide note,
               the way life can suck. We'll all miss
               Sherwood's little Eskimo. Let's hope
               she's rubbing noses with Jesus.

     HEATHER <u>CHANDLER</u>  moves next to VERONICA holding a plate of
     steaming spaghetti. She is wearing nerdy glasses and
     something that looks like an intergalactic prison unifrom.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Is this turnout weak or what? I had
               <u>at least</u> seventy more people at
               my funeral.

                             VERONICA
               Heather? Wha...

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is
               s-o-o boring. If I have to sing
               "Kumbaya" one more time...

                             VERONICA
               What are you doing here?!

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               I made your favorite. Spaghetti.
               Lots of oregano.

     With a squeal, HEATHER CHANDLER plunges VERONICA's face into
     the plate of spaghetti.

                             HEATHER CHANDLER
               Dinner!

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     Uncurling from the fetal position that she had fallen asleep
     in, VERONICA's tightly closed eyes snap open in a sweat as her
     mother's voice continues to filter through the door. It's all
     been a dream...........

                             MOM (O.S.)
               Dinner! Veronica! Dinner!

     VERONICA closes her eyes and holds her heart. She suddenly
     launches to her desk, opens her diary, shoves on her
     monocle, catches her breath, and begins writing.

                             VERONICA (O.S.)
               Dear Diary, no one can stop J.D. Not
               the F.B.I., the C.I.A., or the P.T.A.
               That is to say, no one but me. I know
               where J.D. is coming from and where
               he is heading. He's wrong, but I'm going
               to teach him what's right. I'm going
               to stop J.D....If it's the last thing
               I do.

     VERONICA leans back in her chair, sweating. She reaches in the
     pocket of a blazer draped over the back of the chair and pulls
     out the cigarette J.D. had given her eariler in the film. She
     puts it in her mouth unlit then takes it out and puts it back
     in the blazer.

     EXT. OUTSIDE THE SAWYER HOME--NIGHT

     J.D. remains laconically leaning against his motorcycle with
     his legs suavely crossed as he was before Veronica began
     dreaming. J.D. finishes his cigarette and pulls out a gun. He
     checks the bullets, puts the gun back in his coat, and heads
     toward the house.

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     VERONICA hugs J.F.K. the cat then rips down the hanging doll.

     EXT. THE SAWYER FRONT YARD--NIGHT

     J.D. leans a ladder against the Sawyer house.

     INT. THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE--NIGHT

     MOM sets down three plates of spaghetti. DAD watches on.

                             MOM
               Does she want a written invitation?
                       (yelling upward)
               Veronica! Dinner!

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     J.D. crawls through VERONICA's window. Hanging from the
     rafter, neck in a noose of bedshoots, is VERONICA.

     INT. THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE--NIGHT

     MOM sets a glass of milk at VERONICA's place, distressed.

                             MOM
               Honey?

     INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     J.D. paces the room, sweating and ranting, waving a gun in
     one hand, the Barbieish doll in the other.

                             J.D.
               I can't believe you did it. I was
               teasing. I loved you. Sure, I climbed
               up here to kill you, but first I was
               going to try and get you back. With
               amazing petition.

     J.D. throws the gun on the bed and pulls from his coat the
     computer printout sheet petition, then savagely rolls it out
     on the floor. It is filled with signatures of different sizes,
     styles, and colors. J.F.K. blinks.

                             J.D.
               It's a shame you can't see what our
               fellow students really signed.

     J.D. flicks open a switchblade. He runs the blade beneath the
     typed paragraph at the top causing it to peel off, reavealing
     another typed paragraph.

                             J.D.
               Listen. "We students of Westerburg
               High will die. Today. Our burning
               bodies will be the ultimate protest
               to a society that degrades is. Fuck
               you all." Not that subtle but neither's
               blowing up the school. Talk about your
               suicide pacts. When our school explodes
               tomorrow, it's going to be the kind of
               thing that infects a generation. A
               Woodstock for the 80's. Damn, we
               coulda toasted marshmallows together.

                             MOM (O.S.)
               Honey, are you all right in there?

     J.D. swiftly picks up the petition and heads out the window.
     MOM enters the room and, seeing her hanging daughter, launches
     into frantic screams.

                             MOM
               Oh God, I knew it! No, no! I want my
               baby back! I should have let you keep
               that job at the mall. I was just afraid
               of you coming home alone at night!

     VERONICA opens her eyes.

                             MOM
               I made your favorite! Spaghetti!
               Lots of oregano!

     VERONICA undos the noose around her neck but still remains
     hanging for the rope runs all the way down her back beneath
     her blazer and is tied around her waist. She undos the waist-
     knot and lands on her bed. She quickly puts a small pillow over
     the left-behind gun, unnoticed by her dazed MOM.

                             VERONICA
               Hey Mom, why so tense?

     INT. THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE AREA--NIGHT

     Montage music plays as VERONICA rears up from her dinner plate
     to see her stonefaced PARENTS and her CAT staring at her.

     INT. J.D.'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

     J.D. tools with a bomb at his desk. A KNOCK on the door. J.D.
     turns down his stereo (and the Montage music).

                             BIG BUD DEAN (O.S.)
               I need some help with my homework...

                             J.D.
               Sorry tiger, I'm a little busy....

     J.D. turns back up his stereo (and the Montage music).

     EXT. FRONT OF WESTERBURG HIGH--MORNING

     The Montage music continues as school buses arrive in front of
     the school. STUDENTS pour out.

     EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT--MORNING

     STUDENTS come out of their cars.

     INT. HALLWAY--MORNING

     Typically hectic start-of-another-day-opening-and-slamming-of-
     locker-action. VERONICA darts through the thoroughfare to her
     locker.

     A passing PAULINE FLEMING screeches to a halt, grabbing
     VERONICA as she chokes on some styrofoam cup coffee.

                             PAULINE
               Veronica! J.D. told me you
               committed suicide last night!

                             VERONICA
               Where is he? Where's J.D.?

                             PAULINE
               We have to talk.  I've got some
               pamphlets in my office that will help
               you decide if suicide is really for
               you.  Come on, let's go take a look.

                             VERONICA
               Get a job.

     VERONICA storms to her nearby locker. She swirls her locker
     combination and opens it. She glances down the hall and
     freezes.

     In the distance, J.D. moves mechanically down the hallway
     carrying a large gym bag, wearing a Walkman.

     VERONICA climbs into her locker. She closes it until it is
     barely perceptibly ajar. J.D. strides past the locker and into
     the Boys bathroom.

     INT. BOYS BATHROOM--DAY

     J.D smoothly moves into a stall and closes the door. He
     turns off his Walkman and ends the Montage music.

     INT. THE HALLWAY--DAY

     The hallway slowly clears as STUDENTS go to class. The bell
     rings. A LATE STUDENT races through the empty hallway.

     VERONICA carefully hatches out of her locker. She treads down
     the hallway as if something were about to jump out at her.

     INT. THE GYM--DAY

     A group of cheerleaders including HEATHER MCNAMARA are lazily
     doing cartwheels on the gym floor. On a small stage set up
     beside them, other STUDENTS are putting up folding chairs.
     PRINCIPAL GOWAN says "Testing" into a microphone.

     J.D., toting the gym bag, slips through the gym door. He moves
     unnoticed to a position underneath the bleachers.

     INT. THE HALLWAY--DAY

     VERONICA peers around a corner to see an empty hallway.

     INT. GYM--UNDER THE BLEACHERS--DAY

     Using heavy black masking tape, J.D. tapes a thermal bomb to a
     steel support beneath the bleachers. Other thermal bombs can be
     discerned taped to other supports.

     INT. THE EMPTY HALLWAY--DAY

     VERONICA cautiously treads down the empty hallway, trying to
     keep in control. Suddenly, packs of STUDENTS burst from
     classroom doors behind VERONICA. The excited swarms of STUDENTS
     move toward and past VERONICA, who has braked her troubled
     treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers.  She latches
     onto Geek RODNEY in a panic. RODNEY looks down at his clutched
     arm with a nervous smile.

                             VERONICA
               Rodney, where's everybody going?

                             RODNEY
               It's Friday.....

                             VERONICA
               Oh my God, another damn pep assembly....

                             RODNEY
               Yeah, these things are pretty artificial,
               but at least we all get out of class...

     VERONICA ignores RODNEY's amiable attemots at conversation to
     inquisitively move forward through the crowd.

     INT. THE GYM--DAY

     J.D. darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors.
     He pops the doors open and sees the crowd of STUDENTS move
     toward the gym. He suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby set
     of stairs.

     INT. THE HALLWAY LEADING TO THE GYM--DAY

     VERONICA continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of STUDENTS
     heading for the gymnasium. She stops to watch her classmates
     file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of dread.
     She again latches onto a passing RODNEY.

                             VERONICA
               Rodney, what's underneath the gym?

     RODNEY (unconsciously) dramatically stops, turns to VERONICA.
     and says........

                             RODNEY
               The boiler room.

     VERONICA blanches then lunges through the crowd. She topples a
     couple disgruntled STUDENTS before careening down the staircase
     beside the gym.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE BOILER ROOM--DAY

     J.D. walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room, eyeing
     the pounding generators inside. He stops at a heavy steel door.
     Placing down his gym bag, J.D. proceeds to swiftly pick the
     lock. He swings open the steel door.

                             VERONICA (O.S.)
               May I see your hall pass?

     J.D. weilds around. A sweating VERONICA moves toward him,
     pointing the bedroom gun at him.

                             J.D.
               I knew that loose was too noose! I
               mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!

                             VERONICA
               Like father, like son. A serious-as-
               fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll
               set off a pack of thermals upstairs.
               Okay, so let's start by slowly putting
               the bomb down on the ground.

     J.D. looks down at the gym bag already on the ground. He folds
     his arms and smiles. VERONICA forcefully moves closer.

                             VERONICA
               Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that.
               Put your hands on your head.

                             J.D.
               You didn't say Simon Says.

     J.D. suddenly kicks out into VERONICA's stomach, doubling her
     over and causing her to drop the gun. J.D. gracefully retrieves
     it.

     INT. THE GYM--DAY

     The pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy STUDENTS in the
     bleachers earthily shouting, giggling cheerleaders making
     swaying pyramids, valiant band members struggling to be heard.
     Various Jocks, stand on the stage with PRINCIPAL GOWAN as a
     YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPHER flashes away.

     INT. THE HALLWAY BEFORE THE BOILER ROOM--DAY

     VERONICA bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs.
     J.D. raises the gun to her head.

                             J.D.
               Live by the sword...

     VERONICA swings her left arm up knocking J.D.'s gun hand
     upward. She then sails her right fist into his face. The blow
     annoys him more than it hurts him but J.D.'s momentary loss of
     composure allows VERONICA to come in with another much harder
     right hook. The blow sends J.D. stumbling back against the
     boiler room, jarring the gun loose.

     They simultaneously lunge for the gun. VERONICA, having the
     better grip, pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun
     from J.D., she loses control of it, flinging it down the hall.
     VERONICA pops up to retrieve it but J.D. moves his legs
     scissors-style around her and trips her.

     INT. GYM--THE PREP ASSEMBLY--DAY

     The assembly mindlessly blares on. Cheerleader HEATHER MCNAMARA
     rah-rah-rahs. RODNEY and the other Geeks pass around a pair of
     opera glasses, all intensely scoping out the cheerleaders. A
     group of STONERS toke away beneath the bleachers, one of them
     lackadaisically leaning against a thermal bomb.

     INT. THE BOILER ROOM HALLWAY--DAY

     A snarling J.D. stands up, pulling VERONICA with him.

                             J.D.
               You think just because you started
               this thing, you can end it?

     J.D. violently kisses/bites VERONICA. While kissing, VERONICA
     sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall. She closes her eyes then
     savagely knees J.D. in the groin. VERONICA bolts to the alarm
     and pulls it down. Nothing happens. J.D. gasps.

                             J.D.
               You, really didn't think I'd, forget,
               forget, to disconnect the....

     VERONICA rockets her body down and picks up the gun. J.D. grabs
     her and throws her against the steel boiler room door.

     A jostled VERONICA raises the gun. J.D. howls then bounds
     toward VERONICA, causing them both to careen down the steel
     steps of the boiler room. At the same time, he inadvertently
     kicks the gym bag/bomb down along with them. The gun spins from
     VERONICA's hand and slides away. The bomb flies out of the bag
     onto the boiler room floor. A digital clock on the bomb clicks
     on at 5:00....4:59....4:58...

     INT. GYM--THE PEP ASSEMBLY--DAY

     The frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing "The Wave". BETTY
     FINN and her similar co-horts deliriously get into the act, all
     sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers, pouting as
     STUDENTS bounce up and down around them. Jocks stand on the
     stage grinning and preening before the crowd.

     INT. THE BOILER ROOM--DAY

     VERONICA and J.D. are in a heap at the bottom of the boiler
     room steps. VERONICA faintly works into a semi-sitting position
     and gives an astonished glance to the bomb, its digital clock
     clicking to 3:04. VERONICA crawls to the gun and levels it at a
     rousing-up J.D.

                             VERONICA
               The bomb's gone on, J.D.! How do
               you turn it off? Tell me!

     Fully standing, J.D. flicks open his switchblade. He gives
     VERONICA "the finger," screaming in exploded saliva...

                             J.D.
               Fuck you!

     Seething, VERONICA shoots up at J.D. blowing off "the finger."
     Shrieking in pain, J.D. drops the knife to hold this sudden
     geyser of blood. VERONICA achingly stands, pointing the gun.
     The bomb clicks down to 2:25.

                             VERONICA
               It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.

                             J.D.
               You want to wipe the slate clean as
               much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am
               killing everyone in the school
               because nobody loves me. You have a
               purpose though! Remember? Let's face
               it, the only place different social
               types can genuinely get along with
               each other is in heaven.

     VERONICA fires the gun at J.D.'s feet. The bomb clicks to 1:49.
     She focuses her eyes on three red buttons on the bomb.

                             VERONICA
               Which button do I press to turn it
               off? Tell me!

                             J.D.
               Try the red one, but seriously, people
               are going to look at the ashes of
               Westerburg and say there's a school
               that self-destructed not because
               society didn't care, but because
               that school <u>was</u> society. Is that
               deep or what? I'll let you put it in
               your diary, babe. Free of charge.

                             VERONICA
               Which red button, asshole?

                             J.D.
               Press the middle one to turn it off.
               If that's what you want babe.....

     VERONICA picks up the bomb and puts it on a steel drum,
     speaking with her back turned.

                             VERONICA
               You know what I want, babe?

                             J.D.
                       (crouching)
               What?

     J.D. snatches up his switchblade and lunges toward VERONICA.
     She springs away, causing him to bring the knife down past her
     and onto the middle red button, stopping the clock on the bomb
     at 00:17.

                             VERONICA
               Cool guys like you out of my life.

     VERONICA fires the gun twice into J.D.'s stomach. Coughing and
     moaning, he splatters against a generator.

                             VERONICA
               But don't worry, these here
               were Ich Luge bullets.

     J.D. closes his eyes and slumps to the ground. VERONICA wearily
     regards the image of the knife stuck in the stopped bomb.

     INT. GYM--THE PEP ASSEMBLY--DAY

     A cheerleader does a cartwheel in slow motion as eerie music
     plays. The manic crowd in the bleachers vibrates in slow motion
     as well. At normal speed, a smiling VERONICA walks to the doors
     of the gym and peers in.

     The panorama of roaring students, posing jocks, and prancing
     cheerleaders continues to unfold in slow motion. VERONICA walks
     away......

     EXT. THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL--DAY

     VERONICA wearily pushes open the front door and emerges outside
     of the school. She closes her eyes to therapeutically bask in
     the sun's rays. A slight smile trembles onto her face. A
     strange voice kills it.

                             J.D. (O.S.)
               Color me impressed.

     J.D. stands starkly in the distance before her, blood spurting
     from his mouth onto his gunslinger coat.

                             J.D.
               You really fucked me up, Veronica.

                             VERONICA
               I thought I...you..I...

                             J.D.
               You've got power, Veronica. Power I
               didn't think you had. The slate is clean.

     J.D. pulls open his coat revealing that the bomb is attached to
     his torso. The green light is on and the clock says
     00:10..00:09.

                             J.D.
               Pretend I did blow up the school. All
               the schools. Now that you're dead,
               what are you gonna do with your life?

     VERONICA takes the unlit cigrette from her blazer pocket and
     puts it in her mouth. She then folds her arms.

                             VERONICA
               Perfecto.

     J.D. raises his arms in a crucifixion pose as the bomb clicks
     to 0:00. Nothing happens. An annoyed J.D. breaks out of his
     crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm.

     INT. GYM--THE PEP ASSEMBLY--DAY

     The sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering up-and-down
     pep assembly into chaos. Wailing students pour out of the bleachers
     screaming less out of fear than a "Whoa Dude" sense of excitement.

     EXT. THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL--DAY

     VERONICA stands in the same position in front of the school
     with her arms still folded. Only now her cigarette is lit and
     her face and clothes are blackened in ash. Flames flicker in
     bushes behind her. VERONICA drags on the cigarette and turns
     to go inside.

     INT. THE FRONT HALLWAY--DAY

     VERONICA strolls into the school and into a hallway of howling
     students, some of whom are tearing down Prom banners for the
     thrill of it. HEATHER DUKE rushes up to VERONICA and grimaces.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               Veronica, you look like hell.

                             VERONICA
               Yeah, I just got back.

     VERONICA tosses away the cigarette. She then grabs HEATHER DUKE
     by the shoulders and forcibly turns her around.

                             HEATHER DUKE
               What are you doing?

                             VERONICA
               Heather, my love, there's a
               new sheriff in town.

     VERONICA takes off HEATHER DUKE's red ribbon and ties it around
     the hair of her own head. She kisses HEATHER DUKE on the cheek,
     leaving a black stain. VERONICA calls off.

                             VERONICA
               Hey, Martha, wait up.

     MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK revealed to be in a wheelchair,
     brakes to a stop and looks to Veronica, confused. VERONICA
     walks up beside her. MARTHA starts up her wheelchair and
     accompanies VERONICA away into a deserted hallway.

                             VERONICA
               My date for the prom kind of flaked
               out on me, so I thought if you
               weren't doing anything that night
               we could go to the video store and
               rent some new releases or something.
               Maybe pop some popcorn.

                             MARTHA
               I'd like that.

                             VERONICA
               So would I.

     VERONICA and MARTHA continue gliding Bogart/Rains style.
