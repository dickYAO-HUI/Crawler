</p><p><p ID="act">FADE IN:
</p><p><p ID="act">WIDE ANGLE MED. LONG SHOT
</p><p><p ID="act">WE SEE a palm-lined richly attractive street in a Los Angeles suburb. The houses are set back from the street; the street itself is quiet, empty -- except for a few cars parked in front of the houses. While the camera takes no notice, the tires are down on the parked cars, the lawns of the houses are uncut. A Ford experimental model convertible turns corner INTO VIEW. It drives at a medium speed.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR - HEAD ON
</p><p><p ID="act">ROBERT NEVILLE is driving car. He wears sunglasses, a sport shirt, a neckerchief, and looks altogether like a wealthy man out for a drive. CAMERA ALLOWS CAR TO PULL ABREAST, so that SHOT BECOMES SIDE ANGLE. As the CAMERA ENTERS passenger space of the car, we HEAR MUSIC, "Everybody's Out Of Town." Neville hums along with it. He seems at ease, unconcerned. We SEE the houses on his right side passing by. Then his humming stops, his jaw tightens. The car stops with vicious suddenness, and CAMERA PULLS BACK to MED. SHOT, as if aghast at the sight to follow. Neville, in a single motion of astonishing speed, comes up with a stun gun in his right hand, fires directly INTO CAMERA.
</p><p><p ID="act">REVERSE SHOT - DARKENED BALCONY WINDOW OF HOUSE
</p><p><p ID="act">CAMERA ZOOMS IN from MED. LONG to MED. CLOSE SHOT of a deeply shadowed window in one of the houses. Bullets smash into the frame of the window, tear out chunks of the stucco. We SEE, barely, a figure fall backward. We cannot see any details of the figure. Its presence is more intuited than seen.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE
</p><p><p ID="act">IN F.G. is Neville’s stun gun, almost obscuring his features. FREEZE-FRAME.

</p><p><p ID="act">At edge, we begin to SEE RADAR-STYLE BLIPS approaching North American continent from East.

Repeat, abort firings. Do not intercept. Non-nuclear attack underway ... Repeat, non-nuclear attack underway.
</p><p><p ID="act">PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES EXPLODING
</p><p><p ID="act">Color of explosions should be geared to the color of water in the plaza fountain, which is perhaps illuminated by CAMERA orange and red and yellow spots under the water. IMAGE BLURS at explosion.
</p><p><p ID="act">CAMERA MOVES DOWNWARD from explosion, picking up earth far below, keeps going down more and more rapidly, finally BLURRING In speed.
</p><p><p ID="act">VERY HIGH SHOT - SHOPPING CENTER
</p><p><p ID="act">CAMERA is still going DOWN, less rapidly. This SHOT seems to follow out of preceding one. At first, we SEE the shopping center, then SHOT CENTERS at the sidewalk In front of a single store. It is a Saturday afternoon, hundreds of people milling about, many oars moving. SHOT-finally NARROWS down on a single man walking out of store. CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE SHOT. Man looks vaguely troubled, then panicked, grabs his eyes, his head CAMERA MOVES IN for a VERY CLOSE SHOT of his face, then his mouth alone as he opens It to give a blood curdling HOWL of agony and fear.
</p><p><p ID="act">VERY CLOSE SHOT - CAR STRIKING POLE

<P ID="dia">so now the question is survival. Is this the end of technological man? Is this the conclusion of all our yesterdays, the boasts of science, the superhuman conquests of space and time... the age of the wheel?
</p><p><p ID="act">Neville grimaces, shakes his head. At the end of next speech PHONE RINGS.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">MATTHIAS

</p><p><p ID="act">FADE IN:
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. LONG SHOT - INT. DARK TRAVEL AGENCY
</p><p><p ID="act">from rear of office. There are posters on the walls: "See Mexico." "Visit London," "TWA to Hong Kong," etc. Dust is over everything, the floors are filthy and-, littered with paper. CAMERA points out OPEN DOOR to street. Suddenly we SEE Neville FLASH by in his car.

</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - TIRE GOING FLAT
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - NEVILLE GETTING OUT OF CAR
</p><p><p ID="act">He is irritated, looks around as if seeking a filling station attendant in order to get tire fixed. Glances down. He has run over a broken steel box, with US Mint markings. Its torn hinges have shredded the tire, and the gold ingots it contained are scattered under the wheels. He glances across street. A Brink's truck sits crashed into a fire hydrant, its rear doors open, swinging useless in breeze. Mint boxes and gold bullion lying unguarded.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE
</p><p><p ID="act">His expression is one of total disgust. He speaks sardonically.

</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - NEVILLE
</p><p><p ID="act">He unloads car, hangs gun over his back, puts a few grenades in his belt, lifts gas can. As he walks away from car, he muses.

</p><p><p ID="act">WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR
</p><p><p ID="act">We see Neville speeding down an empty main thoroughfare, the car accelerating faster and faster. He makes an impossible turn, the car bottoming, righting itself, fishtailing, straightening out and zooming on.

</p><p><p ID="act">A long DOWN SHOT, which shows the car reaching speeds of over a hundred miles an hour.

</p><p><p ID="act">This is HEAD ON. Neville’s concentration, his tension must show. He looks like a master-driver in the ultimate test of his career. Meanwhile, it is getting darker, closer to night.
</p><p><p ID="act">CUT TO:
</p><p><p ID="act">WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR
</p><p><p ID="act">CAMERA RUSHES IN as SHOT OPENS, to MED. SHOT of the car careening down a deserted street in absolute recklessness. As Neville nears the end of the street, he slightly sideswipes a car parked out from the curb.
</p><p><p ID="act">VERY CLOSE SHOT - TIRES AND LOWER SECTION OF CAR
</p><p><p ID="act">Tires squeal as Neville turns corner. CAMERA MOVES OUT TO MEDIUM SHOT as car rights itself and shoots away.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR
</p><p><p ID="act">The car lights are on now, and as Neville slows down, it is deep twilight. He turns into drive in front of a tall apartment building. CAMERA MOVES IN TO MED. CLOSE SHOT of Neville in car. He presses remote-control button and WE SEE garage door open ahead of him. CAMERA SWIEEPS to Neville's face. He shows relief, as if he has made, It through a very tough race indeed.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - DOWN ANGLE FROM BEHIND CAR
</p><p><p ID="act">As Neville guns motor and starts into garage, a figure detaches itself from growing darkness and leaps onto him. The figure seems simply to materialize) and it leaps high, landing almost in the car. Neville tries to fight back as the car drifts down the drive into garage.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - INT. GARAGE
</p><p><p ID="act">from within the garage. WE SEE the car drifting down the ramp into garage, Neville and the black-clad figure wrestle as the car, at low speed, crashes into a pillar or another car. Neville pushes the black figure away, hits him, hits him again, jumps from the car with his stun gun and fires a burst into the black figure. CAMERA RUSHES IN FOR CLOSE SHOT OF NEVILLE as he turns from the fallen figure. He looks outward at the still-open garage door, his face reflecting fear, horror.
</p><p><p ID="act">REVERSE SHOT - GARAGE DOOR AREA
</p><p><p ID="act">Two more black-clad figures are rushing in armed with clubs or spears.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE

</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - GARAGE DOOR AREA
</p><p><p ID="act">The door is lowering now. There is a body lying in a dark heap-just inside. WE can SEE one or two others scurrying away outside in the dark as the door closes4
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - NEVILLE
</p><p><p ID="act">He has lowered his gun, holds the remote-control box, pressing the button to lower the door. He is exhausted, shoulders slumped. He walks through the garage stopping to check a large gasoline-powered generator that has been jury-rigged to a panel to distribute current. There are shelves full of oil and batteries and similar supplies. He walks through the low-lighted garage. There are several rows of bright automobiles, sports cars, jeeps, a few pick-up trucks, a single armored car. All are kept in good condition, brightly polished.
</p><p><p ID="act">Neville walks back out into the open area of the garage, surveying the damage to the Mercedes, shaking his head.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">That's a shame. So hard to get a repairman these days, too.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AT ELEVATOR
</p><p><p ID="act">Neville unlocks an elevator, gets in and pushes the button for the top floor.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">Penthouse, Robert. He's probably anxious to get on with the game.
</p><p><p ID="act">He leans back against the side of the elevator, eyes closed, exhausted, but still on the verge of laughter.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">Some game...
</p><p><p ID="act">CUT TO:
</p><p><p ID="act">LONG SHOT - ELEVATOR DOOR OPENING - NEVILLE
</p><p><p ID="act">The elevator opens directly into penthouse. Neville coming OUT into his fortress-apartment. In left F.G. of SHOT is silhouette of profile of what appears to be a man in a military--cap. Neville drops stun gun slowly to the floor, looks around room, his eyes light on figure.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">Okay, Okay, I’m ready.
</p><p><p ID="act">CAMERA MOVES PAST SILHOUETTE, MOVES ACROSS LARGE ORNATE CHESSBOARD in middle F.G. to MED. SHOT on Neville-. He pulls off dirty shirt, tosses it aside, walks to his left. CAMERA STAYS ON HIM.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">Go ahead ... move.
</p><p><p ID="act">Neville walks into what seems another world, as CAMERA TURNS to FOLLOW HIM. It is a very long gallery-like room with many mahogany bookcases, walls covered with major paintings, pieces of sculpture here and there. He walks to a beautiful and ornate bar-liquor-cabinet, takes down a bottle of fine scotch. He pauses and studies the label as he twists off the cap. He speaks back over his shoulder.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">Why don’t you have a belt? It might improve your game.
</p><p><p ID="act">He takes a long pull from the bottle, then moves on to the far end of the room where we can SEE a beautiful bed, armoire, old fashioned wash-basin, mirror, etc. These are perhaps screened off from the rest of the long gallery area by some bookcases set at right angles to the wall, forming a small chamber behind. CAMERA STAYS at ENTRANCE to SMALL CHAMBER. Neville rummages for a clean shirt, slips it on.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">But tonight you're going to lose. Luck over skill...
</p><p><p ID="act">CAMERA MOVES IN QUICKLY FOR CLOSE SHOT showing that beneath is sardonic humor, Neville’s loneliness and isolation tell on him.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE
</p><p><p ID="act">He still carries glass, and is rummaging again, this time in a storage cabinet. It is white, antiseptic, very large. It contains a multitude of canned goods. Neville gets out a can of beans. He moves to stainless steel refrigerator, also large, gets out a summer sausage, and ice cubes and a chilled glass for scotch.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">You hear all that downstairs? I let sundown catch me out. So he took the gambit and threw away a few pawns. I was lucky...
</p><p><p ID="act">Neville opens can, cuts casing off one end of sausage. CAMERA moves OUT to MED. SHOT, showing this opposite end of apartment. It is as stark, barren and utilitarian as the other end is cultivated and civilized. In it are kitchen facilities, laboratory equipment, and a massive arsenal. (See Appendix for more on apartment)
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">From time to time he gets nervous. He smells the end game coming...
</p><p><p ID="act">Neville is looking toward center of room as he talks. CAMERA MOVES BACK so as to place chessboard once more in middle F.G.
</p><p><p ID="act">Neville is walking toward board, scotch bottle and glass In one hand, beans (with spoon in can) in other. Summer sausage Is slang across his shoulder, held by string looped over finger of hand holding beans. He saunters to board, looks down studying situation. We now have time to SEE that the board, and its pieces, are both large and superb: a museum-quality set.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">But end games are fall of surprises, aren’t they? Ummm. My move, and discovered ... check!
</p><p><p ID="act">He puts down beans and sausage on edge of table, and moves knight, revealing check from his queen on opponent's king. Neville smiles and sits down.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - ACROSS BOARD - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW
</p><p><p ID="act">We find that his partner is a bust of Caesar propped in the chair with an old and badly battered garrison cap on it. Cap bears eagle Insignia of colonel. CAMERA MOVES TO TWO SHOT. Neville studies board, absently presses a switch located under the table. After a moment, we HEAR MUSIC. It is Frankie Laine singing "We'll Be Together Again."
</p><p><P ID="speaker">RECORD
<P ID="dia">No tears, no fears, we both have a lifetime before us... So what if we have to part, we'll be together again...
</p><p><p ID="act">Neville hits reject switch. Another tune, instrumental COMES ON. "Harlem Nocturne," Ted Heath's orchestra; alto sax solo.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT -NEVILLE AT CHESS BOARD
</p><p><p ID="act">Neville makes a move on board. As he does, we HEAR NOISE, COMMOTION outside. Breaking glass, yells. Neville stands, studying board Intently. As the noise INCREASES, CAMERA MOVES to CLOSE SHOT of his FACE. His jaw tightens at he tries to Ignore the SOUNDS.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ZACHARY (O.S.)
<P ID="dia">Come out, Neville
</p><p><p ID="act">Neville sighs, smiles at bust.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">Excuse me, won't you. Just for a moment.
</p><p><p ID="act">He walks quietly to window, reaches down and picks up a Springfield 1903 rifle with a Sniperscope attached. He steps to the window. The windows are full-length and open onto a narrow balcony. All along the balcony rail, spaced every thirty feet or so, are floodlights pointed down into plaza in front of building. Neville has knocked out partitions between portions of balcony so as to have access to flood lights all along building. Down below In plaza or courtyard, there Is a large and brightly illuminated fountain, water bubbling In it, cascading from level to another. Neville stares out over darkened city. In far distance, perhaps a mile away, we SEE a fire start up, blaze higher.
</p><p><p ID="act">REVERSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S SILHOUETTE IN WINDOW
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">They're at It again. Burning, wrecking. I wonder what tonight? A library? A laboratory? Maybe they've found the Museum of Fine Art. Goddamn those crazy bastards...
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE AT WINDOW
</p><p><p ID="act">He raises the rifle.
</p><p><p ID="act">LONG SHOT - INFRA-RED TELESCOPIC SHOT
</p><p><p ID="act">PANNING weird and unreal area outside range of floodlights. Passes a hunched, squatting figure. Stops, moves back Crosshairs glow as sight is given fine adjustment. IMAGE RECOILS as we HEAR REPEAT OF RIFLE. Figure slumps. MORE NOISE, CONFUSION, CRIES.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE
</p><p><p ID="act">SHOT is across chessboard, through pieces from busts POINT OF VIEW. Neville is grinning sardonically. He raises the rifle in salute.

</p><p><p ID="act">SHOT is from outside window. CAMERA IMMEDIATELY PULLS BACK farther and farther until we SEE Neville's penthouse, a circle of brilliant light in an ocean of surrounding darkened buildings, no street lights. CAMERA HOLDS when penthouse is only a small glimmer of light. (Matte)
</p><p><p ID="act">DISSOLVE TO:
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - FIRE IN FOG.
</p><p><p ID="act">Fire flickers as CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that it Is made 'up of burning books. CAMERA PANS titles: Molecular Biology, Astrophysics, etc. In B.G. we see many members of the Family systematically wrecking scientific and computer equipment.

<P ID="dia">Go tell him. Brother. He sees good enough, dark or light.
</p><p><p ID="act">Matthias walks in the glare of flames, wrecking continues In B.G. His dialogue is delivered sadly, reasonably at first.

</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - ZACHARY
</p><p><p ID="act">He is agitated, tired of hearing this. He has told them before that he can bring Neville down. He tries again.

</p><p><p ID="act">We SEE that a group of five or six others who are like Matthias have gathered around while others continue destruction in B.G. The group mumble amongst themselves, shake their heads. Matthias answers him, as if he were explaining to a child.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">MATTHIAS
<P ID="dia">Oh, yes, Brother, you could do that. Any one of us could. But if we did, the curse would begin once more, don't you see that?

</p><p><p ID="act">The street is one of those with many apartment-hotels, etc., as on portions of Wilshire Blvd. SHOT is through trees, grass is tall in the-lawns, etc. We HEAR NOTHING at first but BIRDS. Then we HEAR the SOUND of someone RUNNING. CAMERA TURNS, finds a LONE FIGURE RUNNING TOWARD IT. SHOT. should be made INTO RISING SUN, sun rays refracted and diffused around dark silhouette of figure.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING
</p><p><p ID="act">He is in sweat suit, the shirt has JOHNS HOPKINS in large letters on front, his stun gun is on sling over shoulder, canteen and pouches in utility belt at waist. Flashlight, knife, etc. There is also a small tape recorder hung on belt. Neville continues to run, looking from time to time at numbers on buildings. At last he stops in front of a building, inspects it. He is breathing hard.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">...And Big Bob Neville shakes off the last of the tacklers and scores with fifty thousand fans tearing up the stands... Another six for Hopkins...yea. Neville.

<P ID="dia">You'd think prices would keep them in the super markets.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE
</p><p><p ID="act">He unlimbers stun gun, checks it, sets it down, checks flashlight. Then he opens canteen, squats and drinks. Assumption is, it's whiskey. He gargles a little, spits it out, studies the building narrow-eyed. Talks into recorder.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">You've got to hand it to the bastards. They cover their tracks. It's been a damn year now.

</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - INT. ROOM
</p><p><p ID="act">Dark, dusty, light falling through half-closed blind. SHOT is ACROSS BED. Neville kicks open door, sees bed. There is someone or something apparently in it. Neville jerks back sheet, stun gun ready.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - CORPSE IN BED
</p><p><p ID="act">The body, left from plague-time, is not a skeleton, but simply a decayed and desiccated ruin, disgusting and piteous.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLETS REACTION
</p><p><p ID="act">He is sickened, his raised adrenaline draining away.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN BASEMENT

</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - WASTE BASKET
</p><p><p ID="act">In it are empty bottles, trash. It is not dusty or old looking.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AT DOOR OF OFFICE
</p><p><p ID="act">Door is large, paneled. Obviously the entrance to very plush executive office. Neville puts ear against door, listens, stands back, kicks door open.
</p><p><p ID="act">LONG SHOT - OFFICE - PAST NEVILLETS SHOULDER
</p><p><p ID="act">It is paneled. drapes, dark furniture, thick carpets, etc. It is very long with a huge ornate desk at the far end. Behind the desk, sitting in a large high-backed swivel chair is a body. Neville studies the figure in the chair for a moment. The figure wears a hood, and it is this which keys Neville’s response. CAMERA DRIFTS DOWN ROOM toward figure. CAMERA now in Neville's POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA GLANCES FROM SIDE TO SIDE as it approaches figure, making sure there are no others lurking in corners. CAMERA STOPS on MED. SHOT, figure in chair, it stirs.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE (O.S.),

</p><p><p ID="act">As Neville finishes speech, he pokes figure with barrel of gun. It falls forward, hood coming off. It Is dead and Disintegrating. SHOT HOLDS. We HEAR Neville's VOICE into tape recorder.

</p><p><p ID="act">LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING ALONG STREET
</p><p><p ID="act">He walks, one hand in pocket, a stun gun In the other, window-shopping. Some of the windows in the stores are broken. Behind others, the displays are askew, dusty. A liquor store Is almost demolished. He reaches an expensive looking clothing store, pauses, walks inside. Dialogue Is VOICE OVER. He palls off sweatshirt, drops it on floor.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">You dumb bastard, why did you ever bother to wash these things? You’re the only consumer left in town.

</p><p><p ID="act">He takes a garment from the rack, looks at it, drops it then frowns, picks it up and re-hangs it on the rack. He draws out a beautiful brocade tuxedo jacket, turns it, smiles, hangs it back.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE

</p><p><p ID="act">Away from windows, it is shadowy in-the store, and we watch Neville walking, some clothes over his arm. SHOT is PAST HEAD AND SHOULDER OF A MANNIKIN.
</p><p><p ID="act">CUT TO:
</p><p><p ID="act">LONG SHOT - THE SAME - ANOTHER ANGLE
</p><p><p ID="act">Again POINT OF VIEW of a manikin -- as if those inert figures are watching Neville's progress past them. He seems unconcerned, but his stun gun is in his right hand.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE
</p><p><p ID="act">THIS SHOT is from between the upraised arms of a manikin.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - FACE OF MALE MANIKIN
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER MANIKIN
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE
</p><p><p ID="act">He has stopped in relatively light portion of store. He is looking up, face filled almost with reverence.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. UP ANGLE SHOT - FEMALE MANIKIN
</p><p><p ID="act">This manikin wears a very brief bikini. She is remarkably life-like. Her hips jut forward provocatively, her eyes point down toward Neville, and her long brown hair falls about her tanned shoulders. She wears the smallest of smiles.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING UP AT MANIKIN
</p><p><p ID="act">This SHOT is past the head and shoulder of another manikin across the aisle from where Neville stands.
</p><p><p ID="act">It is as if his moment of passion and remembrance is overseen.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE - SIDE VIEW
</p><p><p ID="act">He is I still looking upward. He puts out his hand to touch the almost-flesh of the manikin. Then, suddenly, there
</p><p><p ID="act">Is a small indefinite SOUND. He pauses, his jaw tightens. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO MED. LONG SHOT
</p><p><p ID="act">as Neville whirls, stun gun up, clothing dropped. He is about to fire.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - GROUP OF MANNIKINS AND LISA
</p><p><p ID="act">These are female manikins including some with Negro features, In various dress, various poses. CAMERA FINDS LISA AMONG THEM, MOVES IN SUDDENLY TO MED. CLOSE SHOT.  WE SEE the "manikins" mouth open In horror.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW - LISA
</p><p><p ID="act">Lisa turns suddenly and vanishes into the shadows of the store.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE
</p><p><p ID="act">He is petrified. He cannot believe what he has seen. The gun hangs useless in his hand.
</p><p><p ID="act">He stands thus for a long moment, then, finding his voice, he calls after her.

<P ID="dia">Wait...come back...wait... You’re real! You’re not...
</p><p><p ID="act">LONG SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH STORE

</p><p><p ID="act">MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEVILLE RUNNING
</p><p><p ID="act">He gets another glimpse of the girl as she runs out a side door of the store.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT EXT. STORE
</p><p><p ID="act">This store is across the street from a large park. Neville pauses outside the store, looking up and down. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO VERY LONG SHOT, still focused on Neville. When CAMERA STOPS, the SHOT is FRAMED by the girl's hair and one shoulder. We do not see her face, but we can tell she is looking back at Neville from within the park. CAMERA ZOOMS IN on Neville again as he sees the girl. He begins running across the deserted street toward her.
</p><p><p ID="act">SEQUENCE OF SHOTS - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH PARK
</p><p><p ID="act">In none of these shots do we see the girl again. We see Neville running through trees, past a lake or stream; pausing to get his breath ' looking in all directions. He is almost frenzied. It has been almost two years since he has seen a normal human being alive -- much less a lovely girl. As the sequence ends, he is obviously exhausted. The shadows are much longer now. It is afternoon.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE SEATED ON BENCH
</p><p><p ID="act">He sits, head down, his gun beside him. He is beginning to wonder if he has hallucinated the girl, if at last he is slipping toward insanity.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">Does it begin this way? Is two years alone too much?
</p><p><p ID="act">Then his head comes up. He has control again.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">No. you silly bastard, it doesn't begin this way, and two years alone is all right. The way it begins is asking yourself idiot questions. Now, let's find a drink before it's time to go home.
</p><p><p ID="act">He stands up, stretches, looks refreshed.
</p><p><p ID="act">DISSOLVE TO:
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - CANDLE GUTTERING IN HOLDER
</p><p><p ID="act">CAMERA PULLS BACK, showing Neville in bar mirror. He drinks from glass, pours a little more from bottle, turns from-the bar. The room Is dark, light coming only from candle and from windows at front. The door is open. Neville, stun gun in left hand, drink in right, walks through tables, stands at door. Across the street is a federal court building. His eyes go up its height as CAMERA TURNS for LONG SHOT of BUILDING, Neville In RIGHT SIDE of FRAME.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE BACK INSIDE
</p><p><p ID="act">He puts down empty glass, starts to pick 'up his equipment. Suddenly pauses as he HEARS a CRASH from a breaking bottle. His jaw tightens, he becomes tense and turns toward sound.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - WINE KEG DISPLAY
</p><p><p ID="act">Sign reads "Visit Our Wine Cellar -- For the Experience of a Lifetime"
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - NEVILLE
</p><p><p ID="act">He squints at sigh, heads for the stairway with candle.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED, SHOT - NEVILLE GOING DOWN STAIRS WITH CANDLE
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CELLAR
</p><p><p ID="act">This should be a spooky and generally tense atmosphere. The cellar, like much contemporary commercial architecture is made to look like an "authentic" wine cellar, and two years' dust and cobwebs have improved on art. SHOT is from BEHIND wine rack, over bottles, showing Neville at foot of steps, looking about cautiously. He puts candle on hogshead for general lighting, pulls out flashlight to examine
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. REVERSE SHOT - WINE RACKS, NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING AT WINE RACKS
</p><p><p ID="act">His flashlight probes here and there along walls. Stops on a. particular area of one of the racks.
</p><p><p ID="act">VERY CLOSE SHOT SIDE VIEW OF WINE BOTTLES IN RACK
</p><p><p ID="act">Neville's light falls on bottle. Behind rack we SEE another HAND at back. CAMERA HOLDS. The hand is still when light first strikes it, then it comes to life, moves, clenches.
</p><p><p ID="act">MEDIUM SHOT - BEHIND RACK OF BOTTLES
</p><p><p ID="act">We SEE a FAMILY MEMBER who has apparently been sleeping in cellar and has knocked wine bottle over in sleep. He comes awake fully as Neville enters cellar.
</p><p><p ID="act">NEVILLE - CLOSE SHOT
</p><p><p ID="act">From the shadows to his left rear. Also made from behind wine rack. CAMERA RISES from near floor level to five feet or so, following POINT OF VIEW of Family member.

</p><p><p ID="act">FADE OUT.
</p><p><p ID="act">SLOW FADE IN:
</p><p><p ID="act">As light begins to fill the SCREEN again, BLURRY, without FOCUS, WE HEAR, as from a great distance, TINY in sound, the VOICE of Matthias once more. He is preaching in away not much different from his last TV appearance in the credit montage. His voice has a peculiar mixture of the comforting and the sinister in it. As he goes on, his voice RISES, moves toward HYSTERIA.

</p><p><p ID="act">WE SEE the vague image of someone in robes in a high pulpit, behind a high bench. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY, APPEARING TO SEEK FOCUS. THEN IT SNAPS INTO FOCUS IN ZOOM - VERY CLOSE SHOT of large reflective sunglasses. It is Matthias. His hood is pushed back, and the rooms illumination is quite low.
</p><p><p ID="act">He seems to float in the darkness with candle-flames flickering around and behind him.
</p><p><p ID="act">LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE TIED ON FLOOR MATTHIAS POINT OF VIEW

</p><p><p ID="act">Its former function should still be evident, but it-now serves as the place where the Sacred Society governs the Family. It is courtroom, meetinghouse, church of the group. It is dark, hung with black cloth. The room is full of the hooded creatures that we have seen before. Only Matthias and perhaps half a dozen of his immediate followers do not wear hoods. Their hair and skin is dead white, their eyes are covered by an assortment of shields.

Again, if it is done tastefully, it will gather still another fragment of the past which haunts us. Neville is bound in the small cart. It is pulled by members of the Family. HOWLING members of the Family throw rubbish at him -- scientific debris -- and curse him. The cart is in the midst of a dense crowd, each member of which carries a candle.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUTCH
<P ID="dia">When it hit, the older people either died outright or went to the third stage pretty fast. You know: blindness in light, albinism, psychotic delusions, occasional stages of torpor: like Matthias and his gang.

Pupil is still visible. Neville leans down over him, studying him. This is our first chance to see Neville as Doctor.

</p><p><p ID="act">She pushes aside some tall weeds and stands before a place relatively cleared, where someone has put gravel to keep down the weeds and has carefully outlined a large grave-site with coke and seven-up bottles by burying them in the ground neck down. There is a faded plaque of wood, probably the bottom of an orange-crate or something more substantial. On it are the names and dates of her parents:

</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - UP ANGLE - MATTHIAS
</p><p><p ID="act">Matthias looks about, discovers the ZULU SPEAR, cast aside on balcony by Zachary earlier. He picks it up, raises It above his head, his face twisted with hatred.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS FROM BEHIND
</p><p><p ID="act">This is down angle shot from behind Matthias with Lisa, Neville below. Matthias, In F.G. throws spear with all his strength.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - SPEAR INTO CAMERA
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE
</p><p><p ID="act">The spear strikes him In chest. He falls backward into fountain, the bottle of plasma falling from his coverall.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - TOP OF FOUNTAIN
</p><p><p ID="act">We see Matthias across jet of water at top of fountain. As Matthias speaks, the water at top of jet turns red,
</p><p><P ID="speaker">MATTHIAS
<P ID="dia">The bad dream is over, Neville.
</p><p><p ID="act">Now we can sleep in peace.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE
</p><p><p ID="act">He has fallen against pillar In center of fountain, bleeding profusely, but still alive. Then he HEARS A VOICE O.S.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">LISA (O.S.)
<P ID="dia">Robert...Robert...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEVILLE
<P ID="dia">Lisa, where are you?
</p><p><p ID="act">Her voice is odd, quaky. It is not the voice we know. She Lurks at the edge of the FRAME.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">LISA
<P ID="dia">I came to Matthias, he knows...
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. LONG SHOT - LISA IN SHADOW
</p><p><p ID="act">The SUN Is now beginning to come ONTO PLAZAI Lisa must retreat as It gradually narrows the area of the plaza still In shadow.

</p><p><p ID="act">the Family, I have to have...
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE - NEVILLE
</p><p><p ID="act">His head Is back as the sun strikes the fountain. His eyes are open. When the sun reaches his face, his eyes do not blink. He is dead still, we HEAR Lisa’s voice going on and on.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">LISA (O.S.)
<P ID="dia">have to have The Family, Robert, do you understand? You understand, don't you, Robert?
</p><p><p ID="act">We HEAR SOUND of GENERATOR, which has been In B.G. all during this sequence. It COUGHS, CUTS OUT, COMES.BACK ON.
</p><p><p ID="act">LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE - PLAZA WITH FOUNTAIN CENTERED
</p><p><p ID="act">Neville is motionless In center. Lisa flits along the edge of the receding shadow as the sun eats away the area. She retreats back toward the smoking building.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">LISA (O.S.)
<P ID="dia">The Family is everything, Robert  ...I came back to the ... Family...
</p><p><p ID="act">Her voice gets more and more distant as It FADES completely.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - TOP OF FOUNTAIN
</p><p><p ID="act">Again we HEAR GENERATOR CUT OUTO COUGH, COME ON, AND STOP. Water In fountain matches this rhythm, stopping at last, lights go out.
</p><p><p ID="act">CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY ON NEVILLE - HOLDS
</p><p><p ID="act">In SOUND TRACK WE HEAR LOUDLY the SOUND of the MOTOR. It becomes quite LOUD. While CAMERA DRIFTS AROUND FOMUTAIN SLOWLY. We HEAR SOUNDS of people getting out of the truck. We HEAR VOICES. CAMERA COMPLETES ITS CIRCUIT OF FOUNTAIN. In B.G. beyond fountain and Neville’s body, we SEE the YOUNG PEOPLE HE HAS FREED. They wear protective clothing, sunglasses. They see him, walk slowly toward the fountain.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - YOUNG PEOPLE IN GROUP
</p><p><p ID="act">They stand in mourning around him. Then Dutch steps forward, sees something in fountain.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - HANDS REACHING INTO FOUNTAIN
</p><p><p ID="act">Dutch reaches down into the red waters of the fountain, lifts from it the bottle of blood, holds it up so that the sun stands just behind it.
</p><p><p ID="act">MED. SHOT - GROUP OF YOUNGSTERS
</p><p><p ID="act">They look at the bottle.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE - DUTCH
</p><p><p ID="act">He is obviously the leader now. He turns to the others.
</p><p><p ID="act">SLOW ZOOM SHOT - LISA
</p><p><p ID="act">She sits huddled in the shadows next to the garage somewhere at the edge of the plaza. She looks helpless and very old. Broken. She tries to cover her eyes and face.
</p><p><p ID="act">GROUP SHOT DUTCH IN B.G. NEVILLES BODY IN F.G.
</p><p><p ID="act">Neville’s body is OUT OF FOCUS.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUTCH
<P ID="dia">It's Lisa! Go get her!
</p><p><p ID="act">Several of the youngsters go to her while the test move to the silent fountain and untie Neville’s body. CAMERA MOVES to SHOOT OVER Shoulder-shoulder.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE SHOT - DUTCH
</p><p><p ID="act">We see In Dutch's face the same confidence and determination we knew in Neville. He watches impassively as they take Neville’s body to the shadowed area and arrange it.
</p><p><p ID="act">CAMERA BEGINS SLOW RISING SHOT
</p><p><p ID="act">Dutch in F.G. One of the youngsters has driven the old truck up into the plaza. Lisa kneels beside Neville’s body, touching his face, arranging his hands, mumbling confusedly, recalling the tomb scene of mother with stillborn baby. Neville’s body is carefully wrapped in a blanket. Lisa CRIES OUT.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUTCH
<P ID="dia">All right, lets move. We’ve got a long way to go.
</p><p><p ID="act">CAMERA RISES TO LONG SHOT DOWN ANGLE OF PLAZA as Neville and Lisa are put in back of truck with youngsters all-around them. Dutch takes one final look around, climbs in truck. CAMERA NOW COVERS ENTIRE PLAZA AREA. Truck STARTS, PULLS AWAY. Plaza is now empty. We HEAR trucks MOTOR FADING in distance. HOLD SHOT. Then title appears on screen:
