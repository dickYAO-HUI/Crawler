For more than a year, ominous rumors have been privately circulating among 
high level western leaders, that the Soviet Union had been at work on what 
was darkly hinted to be the ultimate weapon, a doomsday device.  
Intelligence sources traced the site of the top secret Russian project to 
the perpetually fog shrouded wasteland below the arctic peaks of the Zokov 
islands.  What they were building, or why it should be located in a such a 
remote and desolate place, no one could say.

<i>Cut to:  Burpleson AFB, night, int, computer room.  A phone buzzes.</i>
<P>
<I>Petty officer:</I>
<P>
General Ripper, sir.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
<i>to phone on his desk</i> Group Captain Mandrake speaking...
<P>


<P>
<i>Ripper sits at his desk, cigar smoke wafting up through the light of 
his desk lamp.</i>
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
<i>to phone</i> This is General Ripper speaking.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Yes, sir.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
You recognize my voice, Mandrake?
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
I do sir, why do you ask?
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Why do you think I asked?
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Well I don't know , sir.  We spoke just a few moments ago on the phone, 
didn't we?
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
You don't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was pretty 
damned important do you, Mandrake?
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
No, I don't, sir.  No.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Alright, let's see if we stay on the ball.  Has the wing confirmed holding 
at their failsafe points?
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Yes, sir.  The confirmations have all just come in.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Very well, now, listen to me carefully. The base is being put on condition 
red.  I want this flashed to all sections immediately.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Condition red, sir.  Yes.  Jolly good idea, keeps the men on their toes.

<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Group Captain, I'm afraid this is not a exercise.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Not an exercise, sir?
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
I shouldn't tell you this, Mandrake, but you're a good officer and you 
have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Oh, hell.  Are the Russians involved sir?
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Mandrake, that's all I've been told.  It just came in on the Red Phone.   
My orders are for this base to be sealed tight, and that's what I mean to 
do:  seal it tight.  Now, I want you to transmit plan R, R for Robert, to 
the wing.  Plan R for Robert.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Is it that bad sir?
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
It looks like it's pretty hairy.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Yes sir.   Plan R for Robert, sir.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Now, last, and possibly most important, I want all privately owned radios 
to be immediately impounded.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Yes sir.
 
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
They might be used to issue instructions to saboteurs.  As I have 
previously arranged, Air Police will have lists of all owners and I want 
every single one of them collected without exception.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Yes sir.

<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
And after you've done that, report back to me.
<P>
<i>LS Ripper in his office, closing the blinds on wall of windows looking 
out at the base.  Outside, a siren sounds.</i>
<P>
<i>Cut to:  ext.  Airborne B-52's with escorts.</i>
<P>
<i>Wildtrack:</i>
<P>
In order to guard against surprise nuclear attack, America's Strategic Air 
Command maintains a large force of B-52 bombers airborne 24 hours a day.  
Each B-52 can deliver a nuclear bombload of 50 megatons, equal to 16 times 
the total explosive force of all the bombs and shells used by all the 
armies in World War Two.  Based in America, the Airborne alert force is 
deployed from the Persian Gulf to the Arctic Ocean, but they have one 
geographical factor in common:  they are all two hours from their targets 
inside Russia.
<P>
<i>Cut to:  int.  B-52.  Machines spring to life as a transmission 
arrives.</i>
<P>
<i>Goldie:</i>
<P>
Major Kong,  I know you're gonna think this a crazy but I just got a 
message from base over the CRM 114.  It decodes as Wing Attack plan R.  R 
for Romeo.
<P>
<i>Kong:</i>
<P>
Goldie, did you say Wing Attack, plan R?
<P>
<i>Goldie:</i>
<P>
Yes Sir, I have.
<P>
<i>Kong:</i>
<P>
Goldie, how many times have I told you guys that I don't want no horsin' 
around on the airplane?
<P>
<i>Goldie:</i>
<P>
I'm not horsin' around, sir, that's how it decodes.
<P>
<i>Kong:</i>
<P>
Well I've been to one world fair a picnic and a rodeo and that's the 
stupidest thing I ever heard come over a set of earphones.  You sure you 
got today's code?
<P>
<i>Goldie:</i>
<P>
Yes sir, it is.
<P>
<i>Kong:</i>
<P>
Ah, there's just gotta be something wrong.  Wait just a second, I'm comin' 
back.
<P>
<i>Kong examines the decoded message and the code book.</i>
<P>
<i>Kong:</i>
<P>
Maybe you better get a confirmation from base.
<P>
<i>Goldie:</i>
<P>
Yes sir.
<P>
<i>Bombardier:</i>
<P>
Major Kong, is it possible that this is some kind of loyalty test.  You 
know, give the go code and then recall to see who would actually go?
<P>
<i>Kong:</i>
<P>
Ain't nobody ever got the go code yet.  And old Ripper wouldn't be giving 
us plan R unless them Russkies had already clobbered Washington and alot 
of other towns with a sneak attack.
<P>
<i>Bombardier:</i>
<P>
Yes sir.
<P>
<i>Goldie:</i>
<P>
Major Kong, message from base confirmed.
<P>
<i>Kong:</i>
<P>
Well boys, I reckon this is it: nuclear combat, toe to toe with the 
Russkies.
<P>
<i>Kong climbs back into the cockpit.  Soundtrack:  Battle Hymn of the 
Republic.</i>
<P>
<i>Kong:</i>
<P>
Now look boys, I ain't much of a hand at makin' speeches.  But I got a 
pretty fair idea that something doggoned important's going on back there.  
And I got a fair idea of the kind of personal emotions that some of you 
fella's may be thinking.  Heck, I reckon you wouldn't even be human beings 
if you didn't have some pretty strong personal feelings about nuclear 
combat.  But I want you to remember one thing, the folks back home is a 
countin' on ya, and by golly we ain't about to let 'em down.  Tell you 
somethin' else.  This thing turns out to be half as important is I figure 
it just might be, I'd say that you're all in line for some important 
promotions and personal citations when this thing's over with.  That goes 
for every last one of you, regardless of your race, color, or your creed.  
Now, let's get this thing on the hump.  We got some flying to do.
<P>
<i>Cut to:  int.  General Turgidson's studio.  Phone rings.</i>
<P>
<i>Miss Scott:</i>
<P>
<i>Shouting</i> Buck, should I get it?
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
<i>Muffled, OF</i>  Yeah.  You have to.
<P>
<i>Miss Scott:</i>
<P>
<i>to phone</i> Hello?  Oh, yes, General Turgidson is here, but I'm afraid 
he can't come to the phone at the moment.
<P>
Well, this is his secretary, Miss Scott.
<P>
<i>softly</i> Freddie, how are you?  Fine and you?  Oh, we were just 
catching up on some of the General's paperwork.  Well, look Freddie, he's 
very tied up at the moment.  I'm afraid he can't come to the phone.  Well, 
just a minute.  <i>shouts to Tuirgidson, OF</i> General Turgidson, a 
General Puntridge calling.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Tell him to call back.
<P>
<i>Miss Scott:</i>
<P>
<i>to phone</i> Freddie, the General says could you call back in a minute 
or two?  Oh.  <i>shouting</i> He says it can't wait.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Ah, for Pete... well...   Find out what he wants.
<P>
<i>Miss Scott:</i>
<P>
Freddie, the thing is, the General is in the powder room right now.  Could 
you tell me what it's about?  Just a second...
<P>
<i>shouting</i> Apparently they monitored a transmission about eight 
minutes ago from Burpleson Air Force Base.
<P>
<i>to phone</i> Right.
<P>
<i>shouting</i> It was directed to the 843'rd bomb wing on airborne 
alert.  <i>to phone</I> Yeah.
<P>
<i>shouting</i> It decoded as Wing Attack, Plan R.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>

<P>
Um ah, tell him to call uh what's his name.  Base commander.  Ripper.  I 
have to think of everything?
<P>
<i>Miss Scott:</i>
<P>
<i>to phone</i> The General suggests you call General Ripper, the 843rd 
base commander.  Oh.
<P>
<i>shouting</i> All communications are dead.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Bull!  Tell him to do it himself.
<P>
<i>Miss Scott:</i>
<P>
Freddie, the General asks if you could possibly try again yourself.
<P>
I see.
<P>
<i>shouting</i> He says he's tried personally several times, but 
everything is dead.  Even the normal phone lines are shut down.
<P>
<i>Turgidson emerges from the bathroom, grumbling.</i>
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
<i>to phone</i> Fred.  Buck.  What's it look like?  Yeah.  Waa...  are you 
sure it's plan R?  Huh.  What's cookin' on the threat board.?  Nothin?  
Nothin at all?  I don't like the look of this, Fred.  Alright, I tell you 
what you better do, old buddy.  <i>slaps his belly</i>  You better give 
Elmo and Charlie a blast, and bump everything up to condition red and 
stand by the blower, I'll get back to you.  <i>hangs up</i>
<P>
<i>Miss Scott:</i>
<P>
What's up?
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Nothing.  Nothing.  Where's my shorts?
<P>
<i>Miss Scott:</i>
<P>
On the floor.  Where are you going?
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
No place.   No... no place...  I just thought I might mosey over to the 
War room for a few minutes.  See what's doing over there.
<P>
<i>Miss Scott:</i>
<P>
It's three o'clock in the morning.

<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
<i>laughs</i>  The Air Force never sleeps.
<P>
<i>Miss Scott:</i>
<P>
Buck, honey... I'm not sleepy either.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
I know how it is, baby.  Tell you what you do.  You just start your 
countdown, and old Bucky'll be back here before you can say... Blast Off!
<P>

<i>Cut to:  ext.  Burpleson AFB.  Night.  Ripper's voice booms over the 
PA.  Ready soldiers stand listening.</i>
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Your commie has no regard for human life, not even his own.  And for this 
reason, men, I want to impress upon you the need for extreme 
watchfulness.  The enemy may come individually, or he may come in 
strength.  He may even come in the uniform of our own troops.  But however 
he comes we must stop him.  We must not allow him to gain entrance to this 
base.  Now, I am going to give you three simple rules.  First, trust no 
one, whatever his uniform or rank, unless he is known to you personally.  
Second, anyone or anything that approaches within 200 yards of the 
perimeter is to be fired upon.  Third, if in doubt, shoot first, and ask 
questions afterwards.  I would sooner accept a few casualties through 
accident than lose the entire base and its personnel through 
carelessness.  Any variation on these rules must come from me personally.  
Now, men, in conclusion, I would like to say that, in the two years it has 
been my privilege to be your commanding officer, I have always expected 
the best from you, and you have never given me anything less than that.
<P>
<i>Cut to:  int.  Burpleson AFB, omputer room.  Mandrake, who has been

<P>
<i>Kong:</i>
<P>
<i>announcing through headset intercom</i> This is your attack profile:  
to insure that the enemy cannot monitor voice transmission or plant false 
transmission, the CRM114 is to be switched into all the receiver circuits.

<i>Cut to:  int.  Burpleson AFB.  Mandrake walks hurredly through the 
halls with the portable radio producing another jazz tune, now upbeat. 
Mandrake enters Ripper's office</i>
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Excuse me sir, something rather interesting's just cropped up.  Listen to 
that.  Music.  Civilian broadcasting.  I think those fellows in the 
Pentagon have given us some sort of exercise to test our readiness.  
Personally, I think it's taking it a bit too far; our fellows will be 
inside Russian radar cover in about twenty minutes.  You listen to that.  
Traffic block full of stations all churning it out.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Mandrake,
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Yes sir?
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
I thought I issued instructions for all radios on this base to be 
impounded.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
<i>follows Ripper as he rises from his chair to lock his office door</i> 
Well you did indeed sir and I was in the process of impounding this very 
one when I happened to switch it on.  I thought to myself our fellows 
hitting Russian radar cover in twenty minutes, dropping all their stuff, 
I'd better tell you, because if they do, it'll cause a bit of a stink, 
won't it?
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Group Captain, the officer exchange program does not give you any special 
prerogatives to question my orders.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Well I realize that sir, but I thought you'd be rather pleased to hear the 
news.  I mean after all, well let's face it we... we don't want to start a 
nuclear war unless we really have to, do we?
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Please sit down.  And turn that thing off.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Yes sir.  Ah, what about the planes, sir?  Surely you must issue the 
recall code immediately.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>

<P>
Group Captain, the planes are not going to be recalled.  My attack orders 
have been issued and the orders stand.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Well, if you'll excuse me saying so, sir.  That would be, to my way of 
thinking, rather... well rather an odd way of looking at it.  You see, if 
a Russian attack was in progress we would certainly not be hearing 
civilian broadcasting.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Are you certain of that, Mandrake?
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
I'm absolutely positive about that, sir, yes.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
And what if it is true?
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Well I'm afraid I'm still not with you, sir.  Because, I mean, if a 
Russian attack was not in progress then your use of plan R, in fact your 
orders to the entire wing... oh.  Well I would say, sir, that there was 
something dreadfully wrong somewhere.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Now, why don't you just take it easy Group Captain.  And please make me a 
drink of grain alcohol and rain water, and help yourself to whatever you'd 
like.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
<i>salutes</i> General Ripper, sir, as an officer in Her Majesty's Air 
Force, it is my clear duty, under the present circumstances, to issue the 
recall code, upon my own authority, and bring back the wing.  If you'll 
excuse me sir.  <i>Mandrake tries all exits and finds them locked</i>  I'm 
afraid sir, I must ask you for the key and the recall code.  Have you got 
them handy sir?
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
I told you to take it easy, Group Captain.  There's nothing anybody can do 
about this thing now.  I'm the only person who knows the three letter code 
group.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
<i>voice cracking</i> Then I must insist, sir, that you give them to me.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>

<P>
<i>lifts a folder off of his desk and tosses it aside, revealing a blued, 
pearl handled .45 automatic.</i>
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Do I take it, sir, that you are threatening a brother officer with a gun?
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Mandrake, I suppose it never occurred to you that while we're chatting 
here so enjoyably, a decision is being made by the President and the Joint 
Chiefs in the war room at the Pentagon.  And when they realize there is no 
possibility of recalling the wing, there will be only one course of action 
open:  total committment.
<P>
Mandrake, do you recall what Clemenzo once said about war?
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
No.  I don't think I do sir, no.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
He said war was to important to be left to the Generals.  When he said 
that, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too 
important to be left to politicians.  They have neither the time, the 
training, nor the inclination for strategic thought.  I can no longer sit 
back and allow Communist infiltration, Communist indoctrination, communist 
subversion, and the international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify 
all of our precious bodily fluids.
<P>
<i>Cut to:  int. War room, Pentagon.</i>
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Sam, is everybody here?
<P>
<i>Stains:</i>
<P>
Mr. President, the Secretary of State is in Vietnam, the Secretary of 
Defense is in Laos, and the Vice President is in Mexico City.  We can 
establish contact with them at any time if it's necessary.  The 
undersecretaries are all here, of course.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Right.  Now, General Turgidson, what's going on here?
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Mr. President, about thirty-five minutes ago, General Jack Ripper, the 
commanding General of Burpleson Air Force Base, issued an order to the 34 
B-52's of his wing which were airborne at the time as part of a special 
exercise we were holding called Operation Dropkick.  Now, it appears that 
the order called for the planes to attack their targets inside Russia.  
The planes are fully armed with nuclear weapons with an average load of 40 
megatons each.  Now the central display of Russia will indicate the 
position of the planes.  The triangles are their primary targets, the 
squares are their secondary targets.  The aircraft will begin penetrating 
Russian radar cover within 25 minutes.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
General Turgidson, I find this very difficult to understand.  I was under 
the impression that I was the only one in authority to order the use of 
nuclear weapons.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
That's right sir.  You are the only person authorized to do so.  And 
although I hate to judge before all the facts are in, it's beginning to 
look like General Ripper exceeded his authority.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
It certainly does.  Far beyond the point I would have imagined possible.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Well perhaps you're forgetting the provisions of plan R, sir.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Plan R?
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Plan R is an emergency war plan in which a lower echelon commander may 
order nuclear retaliation after a sneak attack if the normal chain of 
command is disrupted.  You approved it, sir.  You must remember.  Surely 
you must recall, sir, when Senator Buford made that big hassle about our 
deterrent lacking credibility.  The idea was for plan R to be a sort of 
retaliatory safeguard.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
A safeguard.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
I admit the human element seems to have failed us here.  But the idea was 
to discourage the Russkies from any hope that they could knock out 
Washington, and yourself, sir, as part of a general sneak attack, and 
escape retaliation because of lack of proper command and control.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Well I assume then, that the planes will return automatically once they 
reach their failsafe points.

<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Well, sir, I'm afraid not.  You see the planes were holding at their 
failsafe points when the go code was issued. Now, once they fly beyond 
failsafe they do not require a second order to proceed.  They will fly 
until they reach their targets.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Then why haven't you radioed the planes countermanding the go code?
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Well, I'm afraid we're unable to communicate with any of the aircraft.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Why?
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
As you may recall, sir, one of the provisions of plan R provides that once 
the go code is received the normal SSB radios in the aircraft are switched 
into a special coded device, which I believe is designated as CRM114.  
Now, in order to prevent the enemy from issuing fake or confusing orders, 
CRM114 is designed not to receive at all, unless the message is preceded 
by the correct three letter code group prefix.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Then do you mean to tell me, General Turgidson, that you will be unable to 
recall the aircraft?
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
That's about the size of it.  However, we are plowing through every 
possible three letter combination of the code.  But since there are 
seventeen thousand permutations it's going to take us about two and a half 
days to transmit them all.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
How soon did you say the planes would penetrate Russian radar cover?
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
About eighteen minutes from now, sir.
<P>
Mu<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Are you in contact with General Ripper?
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Ah.. No sir, no, General Ripper sealed off the base and cut off all 
communications.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Where did you get all this information?
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
General Ripper called Strategic Air Command headquarters shortly after he 
issued the go code.  I have a partial transcript of that conversation if 
you'd like me to read it.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Read it.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
The duty officer asked General Ripper to confirm the fact the he had 
issued the go code and he said, "Yes gentlemen, they are on their way in 
and no one can bring them back.  For the sake of our country and our way 
of life, I suggest you get the rest of SAC in after them, otherwise we 
will be totally destroyed by red retaliation.  My boys will give you the 
best kind of start, fourteen hundred megatons worth, and you sure as hell 
won't stop them now.  So let's get going.  There's no other choice.  God 
willing, we will prevail in peace and freedom from fear and in true health 
through the purity and essence of our natural fluids.  God bless you 
all."  Then he hung up.  We're still trying to figure out the meaning of 
that last phrase, sir.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
There's nothing to figure out General Turgidson.  This man is obviously a 
psychotic.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Well, I'd like to hold off judgment on a thing like that, sir, until all 
the facts are in.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
<i>anger rising</i> General Turgidson, when you instituted the human 
reliability tests, you assured me there was no possibility of such a thing 
ever occurring.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Well I don't think it's quite fair to condemn a whole program because of a 
single slip up sir.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
I want to speak to General Ripper on the telephone, personally.

<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
I'm afraid that's impossible, sir.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
General Turgidson, I am becoming less and less interested in your 
estimates of what is possible and impossible.  General Faceman.
<P>
<i>Faceman:</i>
<P>
Yes, sir.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Are there any army units stationed anywhere near Burpleson?
<P>
<i>Faceman:</i>
<P>
Well ah, I'll just check, sir.
<P>
<i>Turgidson's phone beeps</i>
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Hello.  <i>pause, then whispering</i>  I told you never to call me here; 
don't you know where I am?  <i>pause</i>  Well look, baby, I can't talk to 
you now.  My president needs me.  Of course Bucky would rather be there 
with you.  <i>pause</i>  Of course it isn't only physical.  I deeply

Turgidson.  <i>pause</i>  Listen, you go back to sleep.  Bucky'll be back 
there just as soon as he can.  Alright.  Listen, sug', don't forget to say 
your prayers.  <i>hangs up and composes himself</i>
<P>
<i>Faceman:</i>
<P>
Apparently, the 23rd airborne division is stationed seven miles away at 
Alvarado.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
General Faceman, I want them to enter the base, locate General Ripper, and 
put him in immediate telephone contact with me.
<P>
<i>Faceman:</i>
<P>
Yes, sir.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Mr. President, if I may advise, under condition red it is standard 
procedure that the base be sealed off, and the base be defended by base 
security troops.  Any force  trying to enter there would certainly 
encounter very heavy casualties.

<P>
<i>Faceman:</i>
<P>
General Turgidson, with all due respect for your defense team, my boys can 
brush 'em aside without too much trouble.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Mr. President, there are one or two points I'd like to make, if I may.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Go ahead, General.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
One, our hopes for recalling the 843rd bomb wing are quickly being reduced 
to a very low order of probability.  Two, in less than fifteen minutes 
from now the Russkies will be making radar contact with the planes.  
Three, when the do, they are going to go absolutely ape, and they're gonna 
strike back with everything they've got.  Four, if prior to this time, we 
have done nothing further to suppress their retaliatory capabilities, we 
will suffer virtual annihilation.  Now, five, if on the other hand, we 
were to immediately launch an all out and coordinated attack on all their 
airfields and missile bases we'd stand a damn good chance of catching 'em 
with their pants down.  Hell, we got a five to one missile superiority as 
it is.  We could easily assign three missiles to every target, and still 
have a very effective reserve force for any other contingency.  Now, six, 
an unofficial study which we undertook of this eventuality, indicated that 
we would destroy ninety percent of their nuclear capabilities.  We would 
therefore prevail, and suffer only modest and acceptable civilian 
casualties from their remaining force which would be badly damaged and 
uncoordinated.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
General, it is the avowed policy of our country never to strike first with 
nuclear weapons.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Well, Mr. President, I would say that General Ripper has already 
invalidated that policy. <i>laughs</i>
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
That was not an act of national policy and there are still alternatives 
left open to us.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Mr. President, we are rapidly approaching a moment of truth both for 
ourselves as human beings and for the life of our nation.  Now, the truth 
is not always a pleasant thing, but it is necessary now make a choice, to 
choose between two admittedly regrettable, but nevertheless, 
distinguishable post-war environments:  one where you got twenty million 
people killed, and the other where you got a hundred and fifty million 
people killed.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
You're talking about mass murder, General, not war.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed.  But I do 
say... no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops.   Uh... depended 
on the breaks.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
I will not go down in history as the greatest mass murderer since Adolph 
Hitler!
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Perhaps it might be better, Mr. President, if you were more concerned with 
the American people, than with your image in the history books.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
General Turgidson, I think I've heard quite sufficient from you, thank you 
very much!
<P>
<i>Stains:</i>
<P>
Mr. President, they have the ambassador waiting upstairs.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Oh, good.  Any difficulty?
<P>
<i>Stains:</i>
<P>
They say he's having a fit about that squad of MPs.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Yes, that can't be helped.  Have him brought down here straight away.
<P>
<i>Stains:</i>
<P>
Yes, sir.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Is that the Russian Ambassador you're talking about?
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Yes, it is, General.

<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Ahh, am I to understand the Russian Ambassador is to be admitted entrance 
to the War Room?
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
That is correct.  He is here on my orders.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
I... I don't know exactly how to put this, sir, but are you aware of what 
a serious breach of security that would be?   I mean... <i>begins closing 
his notebooks</i> he'll see everything.  He'll see the big board!

of something going wrong with the bomb.  The bomb, Dimitri.  The hydrogen 
bomb.  Well now what happened is, one of our base commanders, he had a 
sort of, well he went a little funny in the head.  You know.  Just a 
little... funny.  And uh, he went and did a silly thing.  Well, I'll tell 
you what he did, he ordered his planes... to attack your country.  Well 
let me finish, Dimitri.  Let me finish, Dimitri.  Well, listen, how do you 
think I feel about it?  Can you imagine how I feel about it, Dimitri?  Why 
do you think I'm calling you?  Just to say hello?  Of course I like to 
speak to you.  Of course I like to say hello.  Not now, but any time, 
Dimitri.  I'm just calling up to tell you something terrible has 
happened.  It's a friendly call.  Of course it's a friendly call.  Listen, 
if it wasn't friendly, ... you probably wouldn't have even got it.  They 
will not reach their targets for at least another hour.  I am... I am 
positive, Dimitri.  Listen, I've been all over this with your ambassador.  
It is not a trick.  Well I'll tell you.  We'd like to give your air staff 
a complete run down on the targets, the flight plans, and the defensive 
systems of the planes.  Yes!  I mean, if we're unable to recall the 
planes, then I'd say that, uh, well, we're just going to have to help you 
destroy them, Dimitri.  I know they're our boys.  Alright, well, listen... 
who should we call?  Who should we call, Dimitri?  The people...?  Sorry, 
you faded away there.  The People's Central Air Defense Headquarters.  
Where is that, Dimitri?  In Omsk.  Right.  Yes.  Oh, you'll call them 
first, will you?  Uh huh.  Listen, do you happen to have the phone number 
on you, Dimitri?  What?  I see, just ask for Omsk Information.  I'm sorry 
too, Dimitri.  I'm very sorry.  Alright!  You're sorrier than I am!  But I 
am sorry as well.  I am as sorry as you are, Dimitri.  Don't say that you 
are more sorry than I am, because I am capable of being just as sorry as 
you are.  So we're both sorry, alright?  Alright.  Yes he's right here.  
Yes, he wants to talk to you.  Just a second.

such a thing?
<P>
<i>DeSadeski:</i>
<P>
There are those of us who fought against it, but in the end we could not 
keep up with the expense involved in the arms race, the space race, and 
the peace race.  And at the same time our people grumbled for more nylons 
and washing machines.  Our doomsday scheme cost us just a small fraction 
of what we'd been spending on defense in a single year.  But the deciding 
factor was when we learned that your country was working along similar 
lines, and we were afraid of a doomsday gap.
<P>

<P>
This is preposterous.  I've never approved of anything like that.
<P>

<i>in wheelchair</i> A moment please, Mr. President.  <i>stomps one foot 
on the tile floor, pushes back from the table and begins wheeling towards 
the discussion between Muffley and DeSadeski.</i>  Under the authority 
granted me as director of weapons research and development, I commissioned 
last year a study of this project by the Bland corporation.  Based on the 
findings of the report, my conclusion was that this idea was not a 
practical deterrent, for reasons which, at this moment, must be all too 
obvious.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Then you mean it is possible for them to have built such a thing?
<P>
<i>Strangelove:</i>
<P>
<i>carefully plucks cigarette from his shaking right hand, which is in a 
black glove</i>  Mr. President, the technology required is easily within 
the means of even the smallest nuclear power.  It requires only the will 
to do so.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
But, how is it possible for this thing to be triggered automatically, and 
at the same time impossible to untrigger?
<P>
<i>Strangelove:</i>
<P>
Mr. President, it is not only possible, it is essential.  That is the 
whole idea of this machine, you know.  Deterrence is the art of producing 
in the mind of the enemy... the <I>fear</I> to attack.  And so, because of 
the automated and irrevocable decision making process which rules out 
human meddling, the doomsday machine is terrifying.  It's simple to 
understand.  And completely credible, and convincing.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Gee, I wish we had one of them doomsday machines, Stainsy.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
But this is fantastic, Strangelove.  How can it be triggered automatically?
<P>
<i>Strangelove:</i>
<P>
Well, it's remarkably simple to do that.  When you merely wish to bury 
bombs, there is no limit to the size.  After that they are connected to a 
gigantic complex of computers.  Now then, a specific and clearly defined 
set of circumstances, under which the bombs are to be exploded, is 
programmed into a tape memory bank.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Strangelove.  What kind of a name is that?  That ain't no kraut name, is 
it, Stainsy?
<P>
<i>Stains:</i>
<P>
He changed it when he became a citizen.  It used to be Merkwurkdigliebe.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Hmm.  A kraut, by any other name, huh, Stainsy?
<P>
<i>Strangelove:</i>

<P>
Yes, but the... whole point of the doomsday machine... is lost... if you 
keep it a secret!  Why didn't you tell the world, eh?
<P>

that coincide with your postwar commie conspiracy, huh?  It's incredibly 
obvious, isn't it?  A foreign substance is introduced into our precious 
bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual, and certainly 
without any choice.  That's the way your hard core commie works.

act of love.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>

<P>

<P>
Yes a profound sense of fatigue, a feeling of emptiness followed.  Luckily 
I was able to interpret these feelings correctly:  loss of essence.

<P>
Yes...
<P>
Ri<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
I can assure you it has not recurred, Mandrake.  Women... women sense my

<P>

<P>
No no, Jack.  Not a bit of it.  No, I'm sure they all gave you their very 
best.  And I'm equally sure they all died thinking of you, every man jack 
of them, heh, Jack.  Supposing a bit of water has gone off, eh?  And 
certainly one can never be too sure about those sort of things.  Would you 
look at me now.  Do I look all rancid and clotted?    You look at me, 
Jack, eh?  Look, eh?  And I drink a lot of water, you know.  I'm what you 
might call a water man, Jack.  That's what I am.  And I can swear to you, 
my boy, swear to you, that there's nothing wrong with my bodily fluids.  
Not a thing, Jackie.

Mandrake, were you ever a prisoner of war?

<P>
Were you ever a prisoner of war?
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Ah yes I was.  Matter of fact, Jack, I was.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Did they torture you?
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Ah... yes, they did.  I was tortured by the Japanese, Jack, if you must 
know.  Not a pretty story.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
Well what happened?
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Oh... well... I don't know, Jack.  Difficult to think of under these 
conditions.  But, well, what happened was they got me on the old Rangoon 
HNRR railway.  I was laying train mines for the bloody Japanese puff puffs.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
No, I mean when they tortured you, did you talk?
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Ah, oh no, I ah... I don't think they wanted me to talk, really.  I don't 
think they wanted me to say anything.  It was just their way of having... 
a bit of  fun, the swines.  Strange thing is they make such bloody good 
cameras.
<P>

quite a point there, Jack.
<P>
<i>Ripper:</i>
<P>
I don't know how well I could stand up under torture.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Well of course the answer to that is, boy, no one ever <I>does</I>.  And 
my advice to you, Jack, is to give me the code now.  And if those devils 
come back and try any rough stuff, we'll fight them together, boy, like we 
did just now, on the floor, eh?  You with the old gun, and me with the 
belt and the ammo, feeding you, Jack!  Feed me, you said, and I was 
feeding you, Jack.  <i>pats Ripper on the shoulder</i>

I'll have to answer for what I've done.  And I think I can.
<P>
<i>Mandrake:</i>
<P>
Yes, well of course you can, Jack, of course you can.  You can!  I'm a

What a good idea.  Always did wonders for a man, that, Jack.  A little

marvelous.  That's what we need, Jack!  Water on the back of the neck and 
the code.  Now, ... now supposing I play a little guessing game with you, 
Jack, boy.  <i>Ripper shuts washroom door.</i>  I'll try and guess...

Sir, if we continue to lose fuel at the present rate, I estimate we only 
have thirty-eight minutes flying time which will not even take us as far 
as the primary.
<P>

<P>
Dog gonnit, Sweets, you told me that you'd get me to the primary!
<P>

I'm sorry, Sir.  That estimate was based on the original loss rate factor,

I'm sorry Sir, but those are the figures.  We'll be luck to reach weather

Well... shoot.  We ain't come this far just to dump this thing in the 
drink.  What's the nearest target opportunity?
<P>

<P>
Sir, if the rate of loss does not increase, we have a chance to reach 
target three eight four, grid coordinate zero zero three six nine one, and 
possibly make it from there to the tango delta weather ship.
<P>

General Turgidson, is there really a chance for that plane to get through?
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Mr. President, if I may speak freely, the Russkie talks big, but frankly, 
we think he's short of know how.  I mean, you just can't expect a bunch of 
ignorant peons to understand a machine like some of our boys.  And that's 
not meant as an insult, Mr. Ambassador, I mean, you take your average 
Russkie, we all know how much guts he's got.  Hell, lookit look at all 
them them Nazis killed off and they still wouldn't quit.

<i>Executes an about face from the big board to face the camera.</i>  Mr. 
President, I would not rule out the chance to preserve a nucleus of human 
specimens.  It would be quite easy... heh heh... <i>rolls forward into the 
light</i> at the bottom of ah ... some of our deeper mineshafts.  The 
radioactivity would never penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.  
And in a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements in dwelling space could 
easily be provided.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
How long would you have to stay down there?
<P>
<i>Strangelove:</i>
<P>
Well let's see now ah, <i>searches within his lapel</i> cobalt thorium G.  
<i>notices circular slide rule in his gloved hand</i> aa...  nn... 
Radioactive halflife of uh,...   hmm.. I would think that uh... possibly 
uh... one hundred years.  <i>On finishing his calculations, he pulls the 
slide rule roughly from his gloved hand, and returns it to within his 
jacket.</i>
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
You mean, people could actually stay down there for a hundred years?
<P>
<i>Strangelove:</i>
<P>
It would not be difficult mein Fuhrer!  Nuclear reactors could, heh...  
I'm sorry.  Mr. President.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost 
indefinitely.  Greenhouses could maintain plantlife.  Animals could be 
bred and <I>slaughtered</I>.  A quick survey would have to be made of all 
the available mine sites in the country.  But I would guess... that ah, 
dwelling space for several hundred thousands of our people could easily be 
provided.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
Well I... I would hate to have to decide.. who stays up and.. who goes 
down.
<P>
<i>Strangelove:</i>
<P>
Well, that would not be necessary Mr. President.   It could easily be 
accomplished with a computer.  And a computer could be set and programmed 
to accept factors from youth, health, sexual fertility,  intelligence, and 
a cross section of necessary skills.  Of course it would be absolutely 
vital that our top government and military men be included to foster and 
impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.  <i>Slams down 
left fist.  Right arm rises in stiff Nazi salute.</i>  Arrrrr!  
<i>Restrains right arm with left.</i>  Naturally, they would breed 
prodigiously, eh?  There would be much time, and little to do.  But  ah 
with the proper breeding techniques and a ratio of say, ten females to 
each male, I would guess that they could then work their way back to the 
present gross national product within say, twenty years.
<P>
<i>Muffley:</i>
<P>
But look here doctor, wouldn't  this nucleus of survivors be so grief 
stricken and anguished that they'd, well, envy the dead and not want to go 
on living?
<P>
<i>Strangelove:</i>
<P>
No sir...   <i>Right arm rolls his wheelchair backwards.</i>  Excuse me.  
<i>Struggles with wayward right arm, ultimately subduing it with a beating 
from his left.</i>
<P>


<P>
Also when... when they go down into the mine everyone would still be 
alive.  There would be no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion 
will be one of nostalgia for those left behind, combined with a spirit of 
bold curiosity for the adventure ahead!   Ahhhh!  <i>Right are reflexes 
into Nazi salute.  He pulls it back into his lap and beats it again.

<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Doctor, you mentioned the ration of ten women to each man.  Now, wouldn't 
that necessitate the abandonment of the so called monogamous sexual 
relationship, I mean, as far as men were concerned?
<P>
<i>Strangelove:</i>
<P>
Regrettably, yes.  But it is, you know, a sacrifice required for the 
future of the human race.  I hasten to add that since each man will be 
required to do prodigious... <I>service</I> along these lines, the women 
will have to be selected for their sexual characteristics which will have 
to be of a highly stimulating nature.
<P>
<i>DeSadeski:</i>
<P>
I must confess, you have an astonishingly good idea there, Doctor.
<P>
<i>Strangelove:</i>
<P>
Thank you, sir.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
<i>to Muffley</i>  I think we should look at this from the military point 
of view.  I mean, supposing the Russkies stashes away some big bomb, see.  
When they come out in a hundred years they could take over!
<P>
<i>DeSadeski begins walking away from the crowd around Strangelove and the 
President, toward the banquet table.</i>
<P>
<i>General:</i>
<P>
I agree, Mr. President.  In fact, they might even try an immediate sneak 
attack so they could take over our mineshaft space.
<P>
<i>Turgidson:</i>
<P>
Yeah.  I think it would be extremely naive of us, Mr. President, to 
imagine that these new developments are going to cause any change in 
Soviet expansionist policy.  <i>DeSadeski kneels, unseen, and begins 
photographing the big board with a secret camera within a pocket 
watch.</i>  I mean, we must be... increasingly on the alert to prevent 
them from taking over other mineshaft space, in order to breed more 
prodigiously than we do, thus, knocking us out in superior numbers when we 
emerge!  Mr. President, we must not allow... a mine shaft gap!
<P>
<i>Strangelove:</i>
<P>
...sir!  <i>stands up out of his wheelchair</i> I have a plan.  Heh.
