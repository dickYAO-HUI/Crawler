INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY

BLACK.

WE HEAR the sounds of a woman in labor.

				DOCTOR O.S.
		Push... That's it.

The darkness slowly gives way to light as we reveal a smallish 60's
style delivery room.

SUPER TITLE: RHODE ISLAND 1969.

				DOCTOR
		Okay... Mrs. Dunne you're doing
		great. There's the head... I can
		see it now... Congratulations, uhh,
		it's... gone back in.

MRS. DUNNE is confused, as are the doctors and nurses. The DOCTOR makes
another attempt.

The doctor reaches towards camera and we pull back into the blackness.
Fade up on white letters: H A R R Y. A small baby hand REACHES IN and
turns the second "R" backwards!

				DOCTOR V.O.
		You're going to need to push
		harder.

				MRS. DUNNE V.O.
		It feels like he's holding on.

The doctor reaches in and pulls out a tiny foot. A tug-ofwar ensues
between the baby foot and the large doctor hand, and it looks like the
baby's winning.

				DOCTOR
		You got a shy one here.

The doctor reaches back in and pulls out another foot. The feet kick
their way out of the doctor's hand.

				DOCTOR (cont'd)
		Come out you little bastard!

				MRS. DUNNE
			 (gasping)
		I think it's holding onto my lungsungs-
		ungs- ungs.

We see her chest shaking. The doctor reaches in, yes - way in and feels
around.

				DOCTOR
		It's a boy! Ow, he bit me.
			 (to nurses)
		A little help.

EXT. DUNNE HOUSE Ð MOMENTS LATER

A Police car pulls to a stop and the two patrolmen rush out.

EXT. DUNNE HOUSE BACKYARD Ð DAY

EIGHT YEAR OLD HARRY, standing over a old well in the backyard. The
Police approach as Harry pulls up the end of a rope.

				TEN-YEAR OLD HARRY
		Captain Rob fell in the well! Help
		him! Captain Rob, can you hear
		me!?

The Cops look anxiously down into the well bur see that it's not a real
'well' at all.

				OFFICER DAVE
		Now Harry we can't keep coming out
		here getting your... friend out of
		trouble. You see it's keeping us
		from chasing the real bad guys.

				TEN-YEAR OLD HARRY
		Thanks for saving Captain Rob.
			(hears O.S.)
		Okay - wait for me!

HARRY runs off, leaving the policeman a bit bewildered as

MRS. DUNNE approaches.

				MRS. DUNNE
		I'm sorry David, He just gets a
		little mixed up sometimes.

				OFFICER DAVE
		Oh that's okay. Harry's a fine boy,
		overly active imagination is all.

				TEN-YEAR OLD HARRY O.S.
		Lay off the breaks, Captain Rob.

PAN TO see Harry push an empty go-cart to the front yard.

EXT. DUNNE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - TEN YEARS LATER

HARRY stands in the front yard looking around for Captain Rob. A beat
later Mrs. Dunne appears in the doorway holding a rolled up scroll.

				HARRY
		Is it true what you said to Captain
		Rob?

				MRS. DUNNE
		Yes, Harry. I can't home school
		you anymore. So maybe it's time to
		make some new friends, some friends
		your own age...

				HARRY
		I'm just not ready.

Dejected, Harry starts back inside. Mrs. Dunne stops him.

				MRS. DUNNE
		Oh, I almost forgot. Captain Rob
		left this behind for you, he said
		count your steps very carefully.

She hands him a rolled-up scroll. Harry brightens, his dream again
alive. He unrolls the scroll and we see his mother has drawn a crude
map, with an "X" marking the school.

				HARRY
			(impressed)
		Wow, a treasure map! What's the
		treasure?

				MRS. DUNNE
		It could be anything. You're going
		to discover a whole new world when
		you get to school.

				HARRY
		Wow just like Marco Polo.

				MRS. DUNNE
		I don't follow.

				HARRY
		 You know Mom, like in the pool.

She acts like she gets it. They have a deep heart-felt hug.

				MRS. DUNNE
		You're going to be just fine,
		HARRY.

				HARRY
		I know I am, Mom.

				MRS. DUNNE
		Here's your lunch. And an apple
		and banana for extra energy.

				HARRY
			(excited)
		Maybe the treasure's a chest full
		of apples and bananas!
		

				MRS. DUNNE
		Could be. Sweet boy.

She tries to comb Harry's hair, but the COMB GETS STUCK.

				HARRY
		Mom, you know that never works.

				MRS. DUNNE
		Right.

She pats down his hair with her hands. Harry puts the banana in his
pants pocket and starts walking right.

				MRS. DUNNE (cont'd)
		Other left. And now it's nine
		hundred sixty seven. Bye Harry!
		I love you!

INT. SCHOOL BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Angle on LLOYD CHRISTMAS, getting his hair trimmed by his father, RAY.

				RAY
			(chokes up)
		Senior year. My little boy. Who
		woulda thunk it?
			(as he cuts)
		You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't
		say it enough, but I'm proud of you
		son.

				LLOYD
			(in the bowl, echoes)
		Thanks, Pop.

RAY pulls the bowl off his head and dusts him off.

				RAY
		Here's for not crying.

RAY hands him a lollipop from the pile of chewed gum.

				RAY (cont'd)
		School's gonna open soon. Go get
		cleaned up.

				LLOYD
		Keys, please.

RAY throws him a huge ring of keys. Lloyd catches it and does a quick
spin with them, like a ninja-locksmith.

MUSIC/TITLES BEGIN (or) CONTINUE

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING

Exiting a door that reads 'CUSTODIAN CLOSET', Lloyd dances along to a
fast paced rhythm. He walks past the gymnasium (and a sign reading
"Boy's Showers").

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

LLOYD enters a door that reads, "Chemistry Lab".

INT. CHEMISTRY CLASS - MOMENTS LATER

A poster on the wall reads: 'Chemical Shower - For Use In Case of
Contamination only!' And a drawing of a man pulling a chain over his
head.

LLOYD still sings as he pulls the chain, which starts the extremely
brief fire extinguisher-like chemical shower. He pulls again and again
while soaping up. He shakes himself off, refreshed.

INT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

TIGHT SHOT on napkin dispenser, Lloyd's hand delicately pulls one
napkin out - the last one. Still singing, we reveal,

LLOYD, his wet naked body plastered with hundreds of paper napkins he's
been using to dry himself. He walks off doing an impression of a mummy.

INT. AUTO SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

LLOYD, still covered in napkins, presses a button and a massive paint
drying fan fires up. All the napkins fly off him, as Lloyd backs up,
stepping on a FLOOR-CREEPER which rolls quickly out of frame.

SFX: Crash

Reveal Lloyd has landed in a spill-barrel of transmission fluid.

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. CHEMISTRY CLASS - MOMENTS LATER Once again Lloyd showers, and
shakes himself off, refreshed.

INT. HALLWAY/LOST &amp; FOUND - MOMENTS LATER

LLOYD walks out of the closet wearing an assortment of odd clothing.

RAY exits another classroom at the same time.

				RAY
			(full of pride)
		You sure are looking sharp there in
		your back to school outfit.

RAY pulls out an old camera from lost and found.

				RAY (cont'd)
		Let me take your picture.

				LLOYD
		No can do. Gotta catch my bus.
		See ya, Pop!!

We HOLD ON Ray as he watches Lloyd run off.

				RAY
		But you're already at school!
			(to himself)
		We go through this every year.

He picks up and eats an old sandwich from the lost and found.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - SECONDS LATER

LLOYD rushes out the school's front doors, going against the flow of
people entering. Books and papers fly as he runs away from the school.

				LLOYD
		Out of my way! Can't miss my bus!
		Gotta get to school!

Then he tears off down the street. Some students look back at him.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

HARRY, with his combed hair, is reading his map as he finishes the
apple.

				HARRY
			(counting steps, eating
			 his apple)
		Seven hundred thirty two... bite
		number six... Follow the map, find
		a friend - how does the apple work
		into this.
			(he stops)
		This is distracting. One of these
		has to go.

He looks at the map, he looks at the apple, then the map, than the
apple.

				HARRY (cont'd)
		I sure hope I'm making the right
		decision.

He looks at the apple again.

				HARRY (cont'd)
		Now take your seeds and grow into a
		beautiful pie.

He tosses the apple.

It lands in a yard where it hits a MEAN LOOKING DOG in the head. The
dog looks up, growls when he sees Harry and begins the chase in full
attack mode.

HARRY hears the growling dog, turns and after a swallowed cry starts
running.

The dog's overly long chain unravels as he gains on Harry.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL STREET - CONTINUOUS

We see Lloyd running towards camera in the opposite direction.

				LLOYD
		Must catch bus...

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

Back on Harry as the dog is about to bite his ass.

Then very quickly we see the chain stop the dog in mid-air with a yelp,
just as Harry rounds the corner and SMASHES HEAD FIRST INTO LLOYD. It
looks very painful as they both fall to the ground.

LLOYD shakes it off and holds his mouth. Harry's once combed hair is
now permanently disheveled.

				LLOYD
		Somebody chipped my tooth.

REVEAL his trademarked chipped tooth.

				HARRY
		How do you think I feel? Someone
		bit me in the forehead.

REVEAL the piece of tooth is stuck in his forehead. Harry plucks it out
and tosses it away.

				LLOYD
		You could've saved that for the
		tooth fairy!

				HARRY
		That's stupid! I happen to know my
		mom is the tooth fairy.

				LLOYD
		Your mom is the tooth fairy? That
		is so cool!

				HARRY
		Yeah, she must do all the flying
		around when I'm asleep.
			(extends his hand)
		HARRY Dunne.

				LLOYD
		No thanks, not hungry. Harry
		Dunne. Why does that name not
		sound familiar?

				HARRY
		Probably because we've never met.

				LLOYD
		No, that's not it. Anyway -
			(extends his hand)
		LLOYD Christmas.

				HARRY
		Here I am bragging my Mom is the
		tooth fairy, and I'm talking to
		Santa's kid!

				LLOYD
		I haven't seen you around here
		before.

				HARRY
		Home school. Til today.

				LLOYD
		Home school? What's that?

				HARRY
		I go to school where I live.

				LLOYD
		Me too!

LLOYD sees his school bus pass.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		Aw, I missed it. Now I gotta walk.

				HARRY
			(hold up map)
		I think it's just over there.

				LLOYD
		Is that what I think it is?

				HARRY
		No, it's a treasure map.

				LLOYD
		Cool.

				HARRY
		My mom says the treasure's
		somewhere in the school.

				LLOYD
		I don't know. I'm pretty familiar
		with the school and I've never seen
		that "X". But... I do know
		something.

				HARRY
			(leans in)
		What?

				LLOYD
			(he tags him)
		You're it.

LLOYD takes off.

				HARRY
			(calls after him)
		I'm "it"? What's "it"?

LLOYD stops.

				LLOYD
		I don't really know. But whatever
		it is, it's something you don't
		want to be. And, right now, you
		are.

He walks away. Harry catches up to him, and as they walk away we watch
them tag back and forth.

EXT. SCHOOL QUAD - MOMENTS LATER

They walk through the crowd. Harry is pleasantly overwhelmed by all the
attractive girls.

				LLOYD
		High school is all about looking
		cool. So stick with me.

They see a group of CHEERLEADERS.

				HARRY
			(ga-ga)
		Wow. Are those cheerleaders, just
		like on TV?

LLOYD turns Harry away from the girls as if avoiding homeless people.

				LLOYD
		Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make
		eye contact or they might talk to
		you.

				HARRY
		Don't we want them to talk to us?

				LLOYD
			(confidently)
		No no no no no.

				HARRY
		Why not?

				LLOYD
		Well, besides cooties and other
		medical reasons, they're not in the
		cool crowd. Which I am, and you
		want to be. Know what I mean?

				HARRY
		No.

HARRY turns and sees JESSICA, a beautiful seventeen-year-old.

DRAMATIC MUSIC comes up, Harry is entirely in love. He spends a few
very uncomfortable moments trying to remember how to breathe.

				HARRY (cont'd)
		What about her?

				LLOYD
		She's a total dork. Just look how
		she dresses.

LLOYD points to Jessica in her short, sexy skirt.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		Check out her skirt, it's so short.
		I mean, where's the flood?

He points at her tight shirt and ample cleavage.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		And look at her shirt, it's not
		even buttoned right. Her milk
		bubbles are popping out! Loser!

JESSICA drops something and picks it up.

				HARRY
		Oh my gosh, I don't think she's
		even wearing underwear!

				LLOYD
		How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two
		pairs right now.

				HARRY
		Me too!

LLOYD raises his hand to high five. Harry doesn't know what he's doing
and in self defense, punches Lloyd in the chest.

LLOYD goes in to poke him in the eye.

They are about to (playfully) get into it when, suddenly, LLOYD is
bumped from behind, as we reveal TURK, a LOST BOYS type with a SHITTY
TOUGH GUY HAIRCUT. He reaches up and GRABS LLOYD by the neck.

				LLOYD
			(choked)
		This is my Injun friend, Turk. He's
		part of the cool crowd.
			(to Turk)
		Hey Kimosabe!

				TURK
		Shut up, ass face.

				LLOYD
			(proud)
		That's the Iroquois name he's given
		me because I have the strong face
		of an ass.

TURK drags Lloyd away.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		See ya, Harry! Gotta have a little
		pow wow.

HARRY is left alone for a moment. Looking down, he turns away, running
headfirst into JESSICA.

				JESSICA
			(to Harry)
		Hi.

				HARRY
			(stumbling for something
			 to say)
		Well I hope the carpet matches the
		drapes.

				JESSICA
		Excuse me.

				HARRY
			(points to her newspaper)
		In the new library there.

				JESSICA
		Oh, yeah. I don't think they do.
		You're new here, right?

				HARRY
		Depends how you define 'new'...

				JESSICA
		You're the kid who was home
		schooled.

				HARRY
		Yeah. How'd you know?

				JESSICA
		I've been assigned to write an
		article about you for the school
		paper. It was either a feature on
		you or the new four-color ink pens
		at the student store.

				HARRY
		Four colors? Neato!

				JESSICA
		Yeah, well, I'd much rather write
		an expose or a hard hitting
		investigative piece, but nothing
		really ever happens around here.
		But, I chose you and that's fine.
			(she extends her hand)
		I'm Jessica Matthews.

				HARRY
		HARRY Dunne.

HARRY has never had a part of a girl so close to him so he just stares
in awe of her hand for a long beat. Finally Harry gathers the courage
to shake her hand and just as they're about to touch, Turk comes over
with Lloyd in tow.

				TURK
			(laughs to Harry)
		Hey, freak show, did Jessica give
		you that banana in your pants?

HARRY does in fact have a banana in his front pocket.

				HARRY
			(looks down)
		Naw, my Mom did.

				TURK
			(grimacing)
		Gross!

				HARRY
			(pull's out his banana)
		Wanna bite?

				JESSICA
		TURK, leave him alone.

				TURK
			(mimicking Jessica)
		TURK, leave him alone.
			(to Harry)
		You're coming too.

He pushes Harry away from Jessica.

				LLOYD
			(to Harry)
		Hey, Turk rescued you from the
		nerd. You're in!

				JESSICA
			(to Harry)
		I'll talk to you later.

TURK leads Lloyd away with Harry.

				TURK
			(to Harry)
		So have you been held back two
		years like Lloyd?

				HARRY
			(as if)
		No. I've been held back three.

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

PRINCIPAL COLLINS, the forty-something headmaster of this painfully
below average school, is there with the attractive, albeit overly done
head lunch lady, MS. HELLER.

				MS. HELLER
		... and, Principal Collins, you'll
		be pleased to know that this year
		Wednesdays are "South of the
		Border" days. We'll serve a spicy
		tuna tamale along with a cheese
		quesadilla.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Good. Good. Good. Well, that's
		good.

PRINCIPAL COLLINS gets up.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (cont'd)
		Well it sounds like it's going to
		be another hot year in the kitchen.

They lunge at each other. They pull at each others clothes, bang into
walls, fall to the floor and as Heller goes down.

				MS. HELLER
		God, I've missed you.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		And I you.

More kissing.

				MS. HELLER
		Yes.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS V.O
			(passionately)
		Yes. Yes. Oh yes.

They hotly embrace and fall back behind the desk (Heller opens the
center drawer on the way down). There's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. A PREPPY
FEMALE student, TALIA, enters and stands in the doorway, looks around
at the empty room.

				TALIA
		PRINCIPAL COLLINS? Hello?

Still on his knees, he shoves Ms. Heller under the desk and pushes in
the center drawer - this SLAMS INTO HELLER'S HEAD.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS O.S.
		Yes, what is it?

Collins doesn't appear.

				TALIA
			(slightly confused)
		Uhh, Sir it's time for morning
		announcements.

Collins POPS UP, still on his knees, looking a little disheveled,
glasses askew.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Yes, I know dear. Well, why don't
		you do the announcements this
		morning.

				TALIA
		But what do I announce?

He pops back up.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		You announce the most important
		news of the day.

				TALIA
		Which is?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
			(snaps)
		Make something up.

She WALKS AWAY a bit confused.

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Collins comes out from behind the desk. Heller follows, zipping up her
dress.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		You know honey, I've finally
		figured out a way of bilking enough
		money from the school to get us
		that condo in Waikiki.

				MS. HELLER
		How baby-cakes? You've done it
		all.

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Small potatoes. This one is big
		time. This is visionary. This
		idea is genius.

She nuzzles up to him.

				MS. HELLER
		It's the big potato.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Yes, it's the big potato. Just
		have a look at this.

He picks up a TATTERED GRANT BOOK.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (cont'd)
		The Richard Moffit Special Needs
		Grant. Unbelievable. This kid was
		in a Special Needs program, learned
		how to string a couple of sentences
		together and now he's some
		successful hot shot.

				MS. HELLER
		Like you.

INSERT: There's a PHOTOGRAPH OF A MAN over the LISTING.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Anyway, the state is giving a
		hundred thousand dollars in his
		name to every school that has a
		Special Needs class.

				MS. HELLER
		Oh, this is fantastic. So all we
		have to do is kill this Moffit guy
		and we get all the money!

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		No. No. That's not it. We don't
		kill him. We don't kill anybody.
		But I like the way you're thinking.
		You're focused and you're trying to
		follow. No, what we need to do is
		start a fake Special Needs class.

				MS. HELLER
		We start our own class?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather,
		aloha hot weather.

MS. HELLER looks confused.

				MS. HELLER
		You said "aloha" twice.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Aloha means hello and goodbye.

				MS. HELLER
		Oh wow. Look at you.

They hug.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Now, the problem is where do we
		find kids we can pass off as
		"special"?

Out the window they see the back of Harry and Lloyd rise into frame,
being hoisted up the flagpole by their underwear.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (cont'd)
		Bingo.

				MS. HELLER
		Times two.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
			(sneaky)
		I think you'll make a good teacher.

MS. HELLER looks at him.

				MS. HELLER
		Me?

Collins puts his arm around her and strokes her head. Ms. Heller looks
at him, he's not quite sure if she gets it.

EXT. SCHOOL FLAG POLE - CONTINUOUS

HARRY and Lloyd look down at the school crowd below.

				LLOYD
		You know Harry, this is my favorite
		time of day.

				HARRY
		Yeah, it's nice. And your friend
		TURK is totally great.

				LLOYD
		Yeah, he's aces.
			(calling down)
		Thanks, Turk!

HARRY sees Jessica in the crowd below looking up at them.

				HARRY
		God, she's beautiful. My wiener's
		all tingly.

				LLOYD
			(re: wedgie)
		Shift to your left.

INT. MAKESHIFT CLASSROOM/ KITCHEN - LATER

MS. HELLER is addressing the class.

				MS. HELLER
		Welcome to Special Needs
		orientation. I'm Ms. Heller, the
		lunch lady, er, I mean your new
		teacher.

Reveal Harry and Lloyd, beaming with pride, are the only two students
there, and the classroom is actually just a corner of the kitchen. As
he talks Lloyd takes notes, Harry copies.

				MS. HELLER (CONT'D) (cont'd)
		And the reason you two are here
		before the class officially starts
		is because you're 'extra' special.
		And were personally selected by
		PRINCIPAL COLLINS.

				HARRY
			(to Lloyd)
		Who's Principal Collins?

				LLOYD
		The principal.

				HARRY
		Wow.

				MS. HELLER
		Your assignment is to pick the
		class. Find some other students
		just as special as you.

				LLOYD
		Will that be on the midterm?

				MS. HELLER
		No.

LLOYD furiously erases all his notes, Harry follows.

INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

HARRY and Lloyd, with a TRAY OF FOOD, walk along a bad 70's MURAL of
the PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT.

				LLOYD
		You know, you're the first person
		I've brought here.

				HARRY
		Oh, is this your special place?

				LLOYD
		No, I just usually eat my lunch on
		the crapper. Saves time. Out with
		the old, in with the new.

				HARRY
		Can we eat there tomorrow?

				LLOYD
		Sure, but first we have to find
		kids special, needy and classy
		enough to be in Special Needs.

				HARRY
		It'll be like taking candy from a
		stranger.

They sit and Harry picks up a clipboard with a sign-up sheet that says
"Special Needs". We see Harry and Lloyd's childish scrawl on the first
and second lines.

				LLOYD
			(sounding it out)
		H A R R Y...

				HARRY
		The second R is silent.

				LLOYD
		Oh, of course.

Just then a SKATER PUNK limps by.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		Look, a little crippled boy.

				HARRY
		His curse is our blessing.

They walk over to Toby, a seventeen year old student on crutches. He
looks perfectly healthy except for a CAST on both his leg and hand.

				LLOYD
			(speaking slowly)
		Hello, little orphan boy. What
		happened to you?

				TOBY
		Skateboard.

				HARRY
		One day they'll find a cure.

				LLOYD
		You brave soldier.

				TOBY
		What? It's nothing, the cast comes
		off in six weeks.

				LLOYD
			(patronizing)
		Of course it does.
			(sotto to Harry)
		Obviously in denial.
			(to Toby)
		Maybe we can help.

				HARRY
		We're part of a special class
		taught by the lunch lady, er, I
		mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like
		to join us, it doesn't require any
		walking.

				LLOYD
		And nobody will make fun of your
		horrible deformity.

				TOBY
		How much homework is there?

				LLOYD
		That's the downside. There is
		none.

				TOBY
		Wait a minute. I can spend the
		whole year in a class taught by the
		lunch lady? Can I bring my
		girlfriend?

				LLOYD
			(with great pity)
		You can bring whatever you want,
		little friend.

Music: An inexpensive genre defining discovery... Recruiting montage
begins.

HARRY holds the clip board as Lloyd hands Toby a pen. He signs his name
like a three year old because of his cast.

The 'O' in TOBY dissolves through to:

INT. GIRL'S LOCKER ROOM - DAY

A CUT-OUT HOLE POV in the locker room. PUSH CLOSER IN to see girls
walking around in various stages of undress. One girl stops, bends
down, looks right at the camera and screams. She shoots her shampoo
bottle TOWARDS CAMERA.

ANGLE ON: what she's looking at.

It's a small hole in the wall with an eyeball looking in.

INT. HALLWAY - SHORT TIME LATER

Covering his eye, Turk is being hauled away by a UNIFORMED SECURITY
GUARD, some of the girls (wrapped in towels) stand in the background).

HARRY and Lloyd approach, take out wallet badges reading "Special
Needs" and wave them at the security guard. The guard shrugs and leaves
Turk with Harry and Lloyd.

				TURK
		Okay. I owe you this one.

HARRY BENDS OVER as Lloyd puts the clipboard on his back so TURK can
sign. As he messily scribbles his name, we see HARRY's BUTT CRACK.

The 'T' in Turk DISSOLVES through to:

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

Tight on football T-SHAPED GOAL POST. TILT to reveal a practice game in
progress. A player, CARL catches a pass, screams as he crashes through
blockers and runs head on into the goal post!

He's on the ground. Teammates crowd around as the couch eases his
helmet off. Harry and Lloyd push their way through, see how dazed he
is, gives each other a thumbs up.

TWO OTHER PLAYERS put him on a stretcher. They start to carry him away
when Lloyd taps the guy at the head of the stretcher on the shoulder a
la "We'll take it from here." Then Harry takes lead on the stretcher as
Lloyd puts a pen in Carl's hand and helps him scrawl his name on the
class list.

His entire name - 'Carl', DISSOLVES through to:

EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL GRASS AREA - DAY

TIGHT ON NOODLES in a bowl that spell 'CARL'. CHOPSTICKS ENTER FRAME
and mixes then up. CUT WIDE to reveal:

HARRY is with an attractive Asian girl eating the noodles from the
bowl. Lloyd walks in with Toby, Turk and Carl who leans on him for
support.

				HARRY
		...oh also, we even have a slogan.
		'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special
		People', which is the kind of kids
		we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't
		Zeros' because that is less then
		one, and when you put it all
		together it spells...

				LLOYD
			(listens then interrupts)
		HARRY, what are you doing? She's a
		foreign exchange student. She
		doesn't speak the English.
			(to girl)
		CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy
		chong chong.

She sees Turk standing there. They share a flirtatious glance then she
looks back at Lloyd, signs her name on their list in Asian characters.
DISSOLVE the bottom character through to:

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

CLOSE ON the exact Asian character, it's on a small flyer with more
writing including a header: 'The Goeku School of Fancy Writing'.

WATER SPRAYS into frame and we REVEAL that the flyer is under a
windshield wiper and we are at a WET T-SHIRT CONTEST/CHEERLEADER CAR
WASH.

A horse runs up, actually a BOY IN A WELL-USED HORSE COSTUME (his feet
are the horses front legs). He wears a sign that reads "Support the
Stallions Car Wash!" As the cheerleaders wash cars, he lopes around.

HARRY, Lloyd, Toby, Turk, Carl and Ching Chong are watching from the
side.

				TOBY
		How about Lewis?

				HARRY
		Which one's Lewis.

				TOBY
		The horse.

				LLOYD
		A horse? I don't think so, pal.

The horse nudges a cheerleader - who removes his head. REVEAL LEWIS, is
the boy in the costume. His arm's are locked in to the suit so the
cheerleader hold's a bottle of water for him.

				HARRY
		Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse.
		The boys walk up to him, impressed.

				LLOYD
		Now that's more of what we're
		looking for.

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

LEWIS HOLDS the clipboard with his front horse hooves.

				LEWIS
		Well I need to get a job and you're
		telling me that if I join up - I
		can really come and go whenever I
		want?

				LLOYD
		You were born free and free you
		should remain.

LEWIS signs, hoof-signature is barely legible. Harry pops a sugar cube
in his mouth. Lewis reacts and spits it out.

HARRY tries to calm the beast--

				HARRY
		Whoa, Nellie!

LLOYD holds up the clipboard to check out the list.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

				LLOYD V.O.
		Special Needs class 1986.

				HARRY V.O.
		We are the chosen ones.

TIGHT on Harry and Lloyd.

HEROIC MUSIC PLAYS as we PULL BACK to see our Seven Samurai each
DRAMATICALLY SILHOUETTED in the hallway. There's the half-horse, half-
boy, a kid on crutches, a football player holding a helmet, a girl with
Chinese pig-tails, a kid with a spikey mohawk and of course - Harry and
Lloyd. Bored, the group slowly stops, except for Harry and Lloyd.

TURK stops first, Ching Chong runs to him, then Lewis and TOBY stop to
chill, while Carl collapses against the lockers.

INT. GIRL'S LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The girls shower and soap themselves, also IN SILHOUETTE. The Blackness
of a girl in silhouette wipes us to:

EXT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Our ANGLE crashes down from the night sky to establish.

INT. HARRY'S DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

HARRY and Lloyd are sitting at the dining room table, finishing off
their bowls of food.

				HARRY
		Maybe we should ask Jessica to join
		the class.

				LLOYD
		JESSICA? Please hold for my
		reaction.

With determination he drinks a mouthful of red HAWAIIAN PUNCH, makes a
"wait for it" gesture then does a huge spit take.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		No nerds!

				HARRY
		Right, I forgot.

MRS. DUNNE enters with dessert as Lloyd is licking the bottom of his
bowl.

				LLOYD
		Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D.
		Where's Mr. D?

				MRS. DUNNE
		He passed away three years ago.

				LLOYD
			(chipper)
		Well he missed a great pot of stew!

				MRS. DUNNE
		It was meatloaf. You just put
		everything in your soup.

				LLOYD
		I liked it a lot.

MRS. DUNNE leans down to Harry.

				MRS. DUNNE
		Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you
		making a real friend.

				HARRY
		Is it okay if he spends the night?

				MRS. DUNNE
			(to Lloyd)
		LLOYD, did you ask your parents?

				LLOYD
		Yeah, I left my dad a note.

WHIP PAN TO:

INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY

CLOSE ON: NOTE

"Pop, I'm sleeping at Harry's tonight. Love, Lloyd. P.S. Out of
Ketchup".

PULL BACK TO REVEAL the note is actually GIGANTIC, as it has been
written on the gymnasium floor in ketchup. The last "u" and "p" are
written in mustard. Ray chuckles and starts mopping, quickly realizing
he's made a discovery with the ketchup/mustard combo wax.

				RAY
		Huh! Who woulda' thought the
		combination of these condiments
		would leave such a shine...

WHIP BACK TO:

INT. HARRY'S DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Mrs Dunne sits with them and dishes up apple pie.

				MRS. DUNNE
		Then a sleep-over is okay by me.
		Okay boys, eat up.

				HARRY
		Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's
		pie!

				MRS. DUNNE
		So boys, how was your first day?

HARRY and Lloyd talk at the same time interrupting each other excitedly
eating while talking, spraying food all over their table. Mrs. Dunne
patiently listens to their gibberish as food flies out of their mouth.

EXT. HARRY'S HOUSE ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

A light is on in the upstairs window.

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

HARRY and Lloyd are in cowboy and spaceman pajamas. Harry is leaning
over his bed playing cards with Lloyd who is lying on the floor.

LLOYD holds up his hand.

				LLOYD
		Got any crazy eights?

				HARRY
		Go fish.

LLOYD pulls a card off the top of the deck and looks at it. It's a
King. We see he already has two in his hand. He throws it down, face
up.

				LLOYD
		Nothin'.

HARRY places a two down beside it.

				HARRY
		War!

LLOYD hands him a dice. Harry rolls a four.

				LLOYD
		Ha! Now move your peg seven spaces
		and put your shirt on backwards.
		Boy, you really suck at this game.

HARRY's shirt is already on backwards. He turns it the right side
around and Lloyd cracks up.

				HARRY
		Oh, yeah. Well I almost always
		beat Captain Rob.

				LLOYD
		Who's Captain Rob?

				HARRY
		Just a guy I hang out with.

				LLOYD
		I know the type. Lives in the
		basement, smells like a sponge...

				HARRY
		No! Captain Rob is seven feet
		tall, wears an eye patch, got a
		hook for a hand...

				LLOYD
		Sounds like a pirate.

				HARRY
		What? No no. He's got a parrot on
		his shoulder, buries treasure...

				LLOYD
		Yeah, he's a pirate.

				HARRY
		I don't think so. This guy drinks
		rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho"
		has a peg leg...

				LLOYD
		Peg leg?

				HARRY
		Yeah, go-cart accident.

				LLOYD
		Exactly! A pirate!

				HARRY
		If he heard you talking like that
		he'd make you walk the plank.
			(moving dice)
		Three, two, one. Now it's your
		turn, spin.

				LLOYD
		A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now
		swallow it!

LLOYD tosses the monopoly game piece into Harry's mouth. He chokes it
down.

				HARRY
		Mmm, that's good top hat.

MRS. DUNNE enters.

				MRS. DUNNE
		Hey you two. Lights out.

				LLOYD
		Hey can be on top?

				HARRY
		Only If I can be on the bottom

They jump into the top and bottom of Harry's bunk-beds.

MRS. DUNNEr gives harry a kiss as he tucks himself in.

				HARRY (cont'd)
		`Night, mom.

				LLOYD
		`Night, Mrs. D.

She leans up to Lloyd and gives him a peck on the forehead.

				MRS. DUNNE
		Thank you, for being a friend to my
		HARRY.

She turns off the light and exits. Lloyd is a little taken aback from
the kiss. He leans down to Harry.

				LLOYD
		Whoa. What was that?

				HARRY
		What?

				LLOYD
		Your mom made a move on me.

				HARRY
		She did not.

				LLOYD
		Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be
		your new daddy.

				HARRY
		LLOYD, she's my mom.

				LLOYD
		I can't help my heart. And when
		I'm your dad, you'll have to do as
		I say.

				HARRY
		Will not.

				LLOYD
		Don't use that tone with me, young
		man.

				HARRY
		Shut up!

				LLOYD
		I will stop this car right now.

				HARRY
		You're not my real dad.

				LLOYD
		You take that back!

				HARRY
		Shut Up! Buttlick!

				LLOYD
		Where did you learn that word?

				HARRY
			(breaking down)
		I learned it from listening to you!
		I hate you!

				LLOYD
		Kids.

INT. HALLWAY - THE - NEXT DAY

A group of NERDY, COMPUTER STUDENTS are being shuffled out of the class
by Collins.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. No
		class today. Take a lunch, a long
		lunch.

Collins looks the other way and then motions for Heller to usher in the
Special Needs Class.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (cont'd)
		Hurry! Now! Now!

INT. COMPUTER CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

Everyone enters and gathers round.

				MS. HELLER
		Everyone thank Principal Collins
		for creating our very own Special
		Needs class.

				CLASS
			(disjointed)
		Thank you Principal Collins blah
		blah for the new blah blah blah...

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
			(sotto to Heller)
		They're perfect.
			(to the class)
		You are pioneers of Providence Hill
		High. The first special needs
		class.

Collins starts changing the sign. Over a COMPUTER STUDIES sign, he adds
a banner that says "SPECIAL NEEDS CLASS".

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (cont'd)
		To commemorate this occasion, we'll
		now take a class picture. Come on!
		Come on! Gather around!

MS. HELLER stands next to Collins. He looks at her and then takes
Heller step to the side.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (cont'd)
		You do remember why we're here?

				MS. HELLER
		To take a picture for
		Superintendent Zimmer?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Yes!

Collins gets back into the picture.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (cont'd)
			(to the class)
		Okay smile.

Heller takes a photo.

				MS. HELLER
		My god, what stinks?

LLOYD raises his hand.

				LLOYD
		That would be me, sir. The wife
		made stew last night.

				HARRY
		Shut up Lloyd. You're not married
		yet.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
			(interrupts them)
		Well I hope you enjoy your new
		classroom. This isn't it. You'll
		be going to a new wing behind the
		school built especially for you.

				LLOYD
		Cool! A new wing!

				MS. HELLER
		Okay, kids, let's go.

The kids start filling out.

				HARRY
		What about the crippled boy?

				TOBY
		Dude, I can walk.

				LLOYD
		You brave, beautiful, naive
		bastard.

LLOYD picks up Toby and carries him out, bumping his head on the door
as he exits.

				HARRY
			(to Lloyd)
		Collins is a great man!

				LLOYD
		Now you see why he was elected
		principal?

They exit as Heller smiles at Collins.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		So far so good. We'll need more
		pictures. Why don't you take them
		on a field trip tomorrow.

				MS. HELLER
		And...?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
			(biting his lip)
		And, take some more pictures.

				MS. HELLER
		Wow, you are smart.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		And you are great in bed.

They kiss.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (cont'd)
		Don't you have a phony class to
		teach?

				MS. HELLER O.S.
		I put in for a sub.

They go at it.

CUT TO:

EXT. SPECIAL NEEDS BUILDING - DAY

PAN from the school to a weathered tin building that sits behind the
school's antiquated heating ducts and trash bins.

				LLOYD (V.O.)
		Hello, students.

INT. SPECIAL NEEDS BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

LLOYD turns and writes as he's talking.

				LLOYD
		... I'm Mr. Christmas and I've been
		assigned as your substitute teacher
		for today. I think you'll find me
		tough but fair. And, I imagine
		I'll learn as much.. from you.. as
		you will from.. me.

He chuckles.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		First question.
			(turns to class)
		Does anyone know how to get Magic
		Marker off a wall?

Reveal he's written everything he's said on the wall.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		It may take a while for me to learn
		everyone's name, so bear with me.

HARRY waves his hand wildly.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		Yes, you.

				HARRY
		HARRY.

				LLOYD
		You look familiar. Did I have your
		brother?

				HARRY
		No.

				LLOYD
		Okay. Anyone else have any
		questions?

Pan the room and see nobody's listening but Harry. TOBY, "the cripple"
is making out with TERRI his girlfriend. CARL, the football player,
seems to be drifting into a coma, TURK, the hood is hitting on CHING
CHONG, the Asian student, and LEWIS, the once horse mascot, is now
dressed in a FOAM CARTOON-Y SUN: WEARING A SASH THAT READS: "UNLIMITED
TANNING: $19.95."

				HARRY
		What's with horse-boy, now he's a
		bright shiny sun?

				LLOYD
		Don't look directly at him.

RAY sticks his head in.

				RAY
		LLOYD, may I see you a minute?

				LLOYD
			(embarrassed)
		Class, please study on your own.
		There seems to be a family
		emergency because there's no other
		reason why my father would
		interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!

				HARRY
			(impressed)
		That's your dad?

HARRY follows Lloyd outside.

EXT. SPECIAL NEEDS BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

				HARRY
			(noticing coveralls)
		You must be in the Air Force.

				RAY
		I'm a custodian.

				HARRY
		Well then...

HARRY salutes Ray.

				RAY
		What are you crazy kids doing in my
		tool shed?

				LLOYD
		We're not crazy. We're "special".
		PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have
		our own classroom!

				RAY
			(proudly)
		My boy's special, well how about
		that. I knew you were different.

				LLOYD
		So I guess you'll need a new spot
		for your moonshine.

				RAY
		I reckon so.

RAY slides out a cracked cinder block and pulls out a couple of dusty
bottles.

				RAY (cont'd)
			(re: bottle)
		Chateau Lafite Rothchild '61.
		That's good firewater.

HARRY leans over him as he reaches into a WINE BOTTLE rack for more.

INT. SPECIAL NEEDS BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

LEWIS is now addressing the other students.

				LEWIS
		Can someone tell me why we're in a
		tool shed?

				TURK
		Who cares Lewis? It's better than
		real school. If we don't mess this
		up, we can go the whole year
		without doing any real work at all.

				TOBY
		We can do anything we want.

				TERRI
			(sexy to Toby)
		Anything.

TOBY nods.

				LEWIS
		So if I had a girlfriend like
		TERRI, I could like, bring her
		here, and do stuff?

				TURK
		You got it, jerk-off.

				CHING CHONG
		But I came here to learn about
		America.

				TURK
		Baby listen, there's nothing more
		American than not doing anything
		and getting away with it.

				CHING CHONG
		Then I'm in. Just like Jerk-Off.

CARL finally starts to shake off the effects of the concussion.

				CARL
			(still cloudy)
		Wha-wha-what am I doing here? I'm
		supposed to be in A.P. Biology.

TURK throws a look to Toby. They both "huddle" around Carl.

				TOBY
		Come on kid! It's fourth and goal!
		Ten seconds left on the clock!

				TURK
		We need you now! Get it together!

TURK slaps him across the face like a coach would, but much harder.
This gets him going.

				CARL
		Let's get 'em!

CARL runs full steam across the room and CRASHES through a wall and
runs off. Toby and Turk HIGH FIVE.

				TOBY
		He's in.

				TURK
		If he comes back.

SFX: school bell ring - end of day

EXT. BIG 'A' GAS N' STUFF - AFTERNOON

HARRY and Lloyd walk past the GAS PUMPS in front of this rural
convenience store that has a GIANT "A" on the roof.

				HARRY
		...and who was Benjamin Franklin
		again?

				LLOYD
		The pilgrim who used penicillin to
		kill Godzilla.

				HARRY
		I didn't know that.

				LLOYD
		Welcome to public school, my
		friend.

				HARRY
		Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?

				LLOYD
		When you live in the basement of
		the school, you breathe in a lot of
		chalk dust. It writes out all the
		answers on your brain.
			(then)
		Now how about a slushee?

				HARRY
		A. Slushee. Don't tell me.
			(remembering)
		Abraham Slushee. Third president
		of the United States.

				LLOYD
			(nodding)
		And he invented fire.

INT. BIG 'A' GAS N' STUFF - CONTINUOUS

LLOYD points to a big two-banger 'ICE-BOOM' slushee machine.

				LLOYD
		And this is the frozen delicious
		treat he was named after.

HARRY and Lloyd approach the slushee machine and fill up their big gulp
cups. As it's filling up, Harry notices an ADJACENT MAGAZINE RACK JUST
AS BEAUTIFUL GIRL WITH NICE... JUGS WALKS BY.

				HARRY
		Nice jugs.

				LLOYD
			(see's it too)
		They can't be real.

HARRY picks up the magazine, it's 'POTTERY MONTHLY'.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		Oh, Harry. I just realized
		something!?

				HARRY
			(worried)
		What!?

LLOYD tags him.

				LLOYD
		You're it.

				HARRY
		Oh, no. You're not gettin' me
		again.

This goes on for awhile until, finally ending near the register as
Lloyd walks over to pay for the drinks.

CALE CLARK, the CLERK, is a LONG-HAIRED METAL-HEAD wearing an 'ANTHRAX'
t-shirt. He looks up from a VICTORIA SECRET lingerie catalog.

				LLOYD
			(re: magazine)
		Hey. Fella. Victoria's Secret
		huh? Ya know those clothes are for
		chicks.

CALE hits the register.

				CALE
		Two fifty.

HARRY approaches and tags Lloyd.

				HARRY
		You're it.

				LLOYD
		Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?

LLOYD tags Harry with purpose.

				CALE
		That's two fifty.

They don't even notice him.

				LLOYD
		You're it.

LLOYD and Harry tag back and forth a half dozen times.

				CALE
		Please pay me two fifty.

LLOYD TAGS Cale.

				LLOYD
		You're it.

They both stare at him for a long beat. He doesn't move.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		You're it.

				CALE
		No, I'm not it.

				HARRY
		Yeah, you are. He touched you.
		You're "it" until you touch someone
		else.

				CALE
		I have five kids at home, I know
		how it works. I'm just not "it".
		Okay guys? Two fifty.

LLOYD grabs the Cale's arm and makes it touch Harry.

				LLOYD
			(to Harry)
		You're it.

HARRY immediately tags the store employee back.

				HARRY
		You're it.

				CALE
		Guys. Give me the two fifty and go
		away.

HARRY grabs his other arm and tags Lloyd with it.

				HARRY
			(to Lloyd)
		You're it.

LLOYD immediately tags the store employee back.

				LLOYD
		You're it.

Then Lloyd grabs the guy's arm and tags Harry.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
			(to Harry)
		You're it.

This goes back and forth almost impossibly fast. Harry with one arm and
Lloyd with the other. They say, "You're it" with each tag. Cale's arms
are now flailing.

He finally erupts.

				CALE
		Enough!!

He tags Lloyd. Hard.

				CALE (cont'd)
			(building anger)
		You're it!

				CALE(cont'd)
		No touch backs, no do overs, no
		erasees, stamped to infinity plus
		one and THIS WHOLE STORE IS HOME
		FREE!!

HARRY and Lloyd look impressed.

				HARRY
		Can he do that?

				LLOYD
			(staring at the clerk)
		HARRY, he can and he did. And now
		it's on like Donkey Kong.

LLOYD and the Cale glare at each other.

EXT. BIG 'A' GAS N' STUFF - MOMENTS LATER

HARRY and Lloyd walk out of the store sipping their drinks.

				HARRY
		These are really cold, huh?

				LLOYD
		That's why you have to drink it
		fast, trust me.

They both take huge fast sips.

Our angle follows the icy liquid INTO THE STRAW and then we move (in a
stylized way) into Harry's brain to see BLOOD VESSELS STOP and the
brain get FROSTED OVER.

Then PULL OUT from Harry's head to see a quick half-dissolve that shows
three-quarters of his brain with a layer of white frost.

They both continue to get brain freezes as the scene goes on but they
don't realize it's from the drink.

				HARRY
		Owww... refreshing.

				LLOYD
		Ow... What do you want to do,
		HARRY?

LLOYD gets a brain freeze. Harry keeps slurping.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		Owww.

				HARRY
		I don't know. Owwww.

				LLOYD
		Maybe I should go home and grade
		papers. Owwww.

They sip harder. Their eyes twitch as the pain sears through their
heads.

				HARRY
		My head is suddenly killing me.
		Maybe it's from all the learning
		today.

				LLOYD
		Put some ice on it.

He sips some more.

				HARRY
		Owww.

				LLOYD
		And my mouph is frozen.

JESSICA jogs over. She's wearing tight running shorts and a jogging-
bikini top.

				JESSICA
		Hey guys.

				HARRY
		Heddo Jeth-ica.

Because of the brain freeze, Harry and Lloyd both talk to her with very
slurred speech and drooling a little. Jessica talks to them sweetly,
like they're slow.

				JESSICA
		HARRY, I heard Collins has you in
		some kind of special class.

				LLOYD
		If dou're trying to get in, dou're
		doo late.

				JESSICA
		Oh no, I know that class isn't for
		me. But I'm happy for you guys.

				HARRY
		Do you thill want to do an arwticle
		on me, Jethica?

				JESSICA
		Yes, you and the whole Special
		Needs class.

				LLOYD
		Why ith dat newth?

				JESSICA
		This school's never had one before.
		I'd like to talk to you and all
		your special friends.

				HARRY
		Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee-
		wald twrip.

				JESSICA
		A field trip? Maybe I'll join you.
		See you tomorrow.

She jogs off, her tight shorts and top bouncing as she goes.

				HARRY
		There she goes, now wearing nothing
		but her underwear.

				LLOYD
		What a nerd. I don't know where
		that girl's ever gonna find a
		husband.

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - NIGHT

PRINCIPAL COLLINS and Ms. Heller are in his office. It's the only light
on in the building. Don Ho's "Tiny Bubbles" plays on a record player.
Ms. Heller wears a coconut bra and a grass skirt. She does a hula for
Collins. He sips his tenth umbrella'd drink and snaps a Polaroid.

				MS. HELLER
		Knock knock.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Who's there?

				MS. HELLER
			(modelling)
		Guess what"s under these coconuts.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		What?

				MS. HELLER
		It's a surprise.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Well I've got a little surprise for
		you.

				MS. HELLER
		You got the Extender?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		No. No. I heard from Superintendent
		ZIMMER this morning and evidently
		he's so impressed with our Special
		Needs class, he's bringing Richard
		MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving
		Day parade- check in hand.

				MS. HELLER
		Monkey, this is too exciting! I
		can't believe our dream is coming
		true.

Collins picks up a POLAROID CAMERA.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Smile sweetheart.

He snaps a shot of Ms. Heller's chest. He waves it dry.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (cont'd)
		More pictures for the chest.

He opens a chest by his desk and drops the photos into it.

				MS. HELLER
		So what do you keep in there?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I
		tape everything that goes on in
		this office.

				MS. HELLER
		Everything?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Everything. Just for the record.

He hits the stop button on small tape recorder in an open drawer of his
desk. He ejects the tape and puts it into the wooden chest.

				MS. HELLER
		Oh, just like the President.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Just like the President.

Angle holds on the chest, which Collins has left unlocked.

EXT. BIG 'A' GAS N' STUFF - A LITTLE LATER

LLOYD runs up and sees Harry, who's dressed like a QUEEN, complete with
tiara and flowing gown made from a drape.

				HARRY
		LLOYD, where've you been? I've
		been waiting forever. I'm so
		embarrassed.

				LLOYD
		Sorry. Why are you dressed like a
		Queen!?

				HARRY
		...cause you said...

				LLOYD
		HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a
		Queen'!

				HARRY
			(getting it)
		Oh... that makes much more sense. I
		had a heck of time getting these
		drapes from my mom. You don't want
		to know where I put the cord.

				LLOYD
			(interrupting)
		HARRY! Here he comes.

We see Cale the clerk closing up the store. Lloyd and Harry sneak over.
Cale turns and sees Lloyd the Ninja and Harry the Queen.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		So you're out of the store, huh?

				CALE
		Yeah, we're closed. So go away.

				HARRY
			(holding back the
			 urprise)
		Actually we have something for you.

LLOYD taps him lightly on the shoulder.

				LLOYD
		You're it!

The Ninja and the Queen run away laughing maniacally. Cale looks
confused and hurt.

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

JESSICA, carrying a camera, approaches Ms. Heller getting out of her
car.

				JESSICA
		MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on
		your field trip? I'm thinking of
		doing a story on your special needs
		class.

				MS. HELLER
		I'm not interested. Not after the
		smear story you did on my chicken
		sushi.

				JESSICA
		Well, when 200 students are
		hospitalized with stomach cramps I
		think it's newsworthy.

				MS. HELLER
		Nevertheless, you could have
		mentioned the sauce.
			(noticing camera)
		Well, I see you have a camera.

				JESSICA
		So can I come along?

				MS. HELLER
			(grabs the camera)
		No.

JESSICA notices something under Ms. Heller's shirt.

				JESSICA
		Are you wearing a coconut bra?

				MS. HELLER
		Oh, you're good.

				JESSICA
		Why are you teaching Special Needs?
		You're the lunch lady.

				MS. HELLER
		Dietician! This interview is over.
		You can have the camera back
		tomorrow. Come by the classroom.
		Heller heads off.

				JESSICA
		You mean the lunch room?

Heller stops and turns back to her.

				MS. HELLER
		Well played.

MS. HELLER storms away, leaving a confused Jessica.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

LLOYD unrolls the map. Behind them there is a 'SLOW CHILDREN CROSSING'
sign.

				LLOYD
		According to the map, we're just
		about at school.

				HARRY
		Yeah, but we still haven't found
		any treasure.

A long yellow school bus is parked in front of the school. TURK, Ching
Chong and Carl stand next to the front door.

				LLOYD
		I think we may have found something
		even better.

The bus now appears to be GETTING LONGER! Then we see that it was
actually a long bus PARKED BEHIND a SUPER-SHORT BUS.

SFX: Majestic chorus.

They look like they've seen the Holy Grail (if they knew what that
was).

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		Look! Look!

The short bus is even shorter than a regular short bus. It's custom
suited to the Special Needs class, as it only has three rows of seats.
Harry and Lloyd run up to it.

				HARRY
		What?

				LLOYD
		Our own special bus.

				HARRY
		How do you know it's for us?

				LLOYD
		Duh. The cool kids sit in the back
		of the bus. Here, every row is in
		the back. We're all cool!

LLOYD and Harry run in. Lloyd runs as fast as he can down the tiny
aisle, and smacks into the back of the bus.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
			(brings head up - giddy)
		It's even shorter than I imagined!

HARRY runs smack into the back of the bus.

				HARRY
		Are you sure? It feels about right
		to me.

LLOYD gets up and again runs into the back of the bus.

				LLOYD
		Nope. I was right.

				HARRY
		Wanna bet?

EXT. SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

In the parking lot, Jessica approaches the Special needs kids
congregating outside the short bus. Over the following, we continue to
hear the thumping of Harry and Lloyd smash into the back of the bus.

				JESSICA
		TURK, what are you doing here?

				TURK
		Special Needs class.

				JESSICA
		Being a jerk doesn't make you
		special.

				TURK
		You're just jealous.

				JESSICA
		And, Ching Chong, you're not a
		Special Needs kid. You're just a
		foreign exchange student.

				CHING CHONG
			(defiant)
		I ride with my man.

She hugs Turk and buries her face in his chest.

				TURK
			(to Jessica)
		This is the greatest class ever,
		don't ruin it.

They start to board the bus as Ms. Heller approaches.

				MS. HELLER
			(to Jessica)
		I thought I told you to get lost.

				JESSICA
		Look Ms. Heller, there's something
		fishy here, and I don't think it's
		Friday's special.

				MS. HELLER
		I wouldn't know. Being that I'm
		just the teacher and all.

MARGIE, the BUS DRIVER, a crotchety old matron in her early sixties,
passes Ms. Heller and boards the bus.

				MARGIE
		You ever have one of those days
		when you just want to drive the bus
		into a wall and end it all?
			(then)
		Okay, everyone in.

MS. HELLER follows her on and slams the door in Jessica's face. Jessica
looks determined. She's found her story!

INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

MS. HELLER sits behind Margie as she starts the engine.

				MS. HELLER
		Let's go Margie. The museum ain't
		going to teach itself.

				MARGIE
		Museum huh, haven't been there
		since my husband left me. I love
		art.

She throws it in gear and pulls away.

EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

As the bus heads up the street, Jessica hops into her PARENT'S STATION
WAGON, which is actually three or four feet LONGER than the short bus!

				JESSICA
		This is a much bigger story than
		four color pens.

EXT. STREET CORNER - MOMENTS LATER

The bus pulls to a stop. On the corner is a NEBBISH GUY carrying a fish
tank. He waits - then Margie waves him to go across. Then she honks the
horn, LOUD. He jumps - throwing the fish tank in the air.

				MARGIE
			(laughs)
		Fun stuff.

She drives on - BURNING RUBBER! We see that Jessica is following.

INT. BUS - MOMENTS LATER

MS. HELLER looks out the back window and sees Jessica following in her
station wagon.

				MS. HELLER
		Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll
		give you a scoop... of short bus.
			(to Margie)
		Lose her!

				MARGIE
		Loser... oh yeah he was a loser
		alright. A big loser.

				MS. HELLER
		What?

				MARGIE
		He was a big loser! What are you
		deaf!?

				MS. HELLER
		Uh, no and I don't
		appreciate...turn down here!

MARGIE yanks the wheel, making a sharp turn to the left. We CRANE down
as it passes. And pick it up further down the street. Our ANGLE is
inside a RECORD STORE as we see the bus make a hard right turn -
followed by Jessica.

EXT. CITY STREET HILLS - CONTINUOUS

The bus careens down the street followed by Jessica's station wagon.
Jessica is almost along side them.

				MS. HELLER
		Don't let her pass!

Heller leans forward and hits the 'NO PASSING' TOGGLE.

EXT. SHORT BUS - CONTINUOUS

SIDE OF THE BUS as the big 'No Passing' SIGN FLIPS OUT, close to
Jessica's windshield. She almost HITS IT then slows.

				

				MARGIE O.S.
		Yeah it started with a pass...

INT. SHORT BUS - CONTINUOUS

				MARGIE
		..."hi cutie, nice knockers", then
		same old same old.

				MS. HELLER
			(to Margie)
		That's great, now make a left, then
		straight!

				MARGIE
		Oh, yeah he was straight all right,
		just wasn't very good in the sack.
		I used to give him directions.
		Higher, lower, faster, harder,
		small circles, do the alphabet.
		Useless.

EXT. SHORT BUS - CONTINUOUS

REAR OF THE BUS, red lights flash, sign reads: 'No Passing When Red
Lights Flash'. The road narrows so Jessica must again fall in line
behind her.

INT. SHORT BUS - CONTINUOUS

MS. HELLER sees a street up ahead.

				MS. HELLER
		Left here! Left!

				MARGIE
		You bet I left him, took the dog
		and we was history.

MS. HELLER sees a tiny alley between two buildings. They turn left,
power-sliding down an alley, Jessica misses the turn and makes a one-
eighty.

				MS. HELLER
			(looking behind them)
		Ha! Too big to make the turn!

				MARGIE
		No, it actually fit quite nicely.
			(then)
		Well, except for the fact that it
		wasn't really as long as it was
		wide.

INT. SHORT BUS - CONTINUOUS

They do a rough turn and exit the alley. Ms. Heller looks around for
Jessica.

				MS. HELLER
		I think you did it.

				MARGIE
		Damn right I did it. Went back and
		set the house on fire, his little
		floozy testified in court - and I
		ended up doing ten years at Rikers,
		got my teeth knocked out by Mike
		the Dyke.

				MS. HELLER
			(now paying attention)
		What the hell are you talking
		about?

ANGLE ON: Lloyd, Harry and Carl. Once again, Carl is starting to get
better, he notices his surroundings.

				CARL
		Hey, I'm not supposed to be on the
		short bus. I've got a Calculus
		class.

				LLOYD
			(to Harry, whimsical)
		He's a dreamer.

				CARL
		No, actually I think I'm all
		better.

ANGLE ON: Heller. IN THE MIRROR, she sees Jessica pull up behind them.

				MS. HELLER
		Turn here! Go, go, go!

And she SLAMS her foot on Margie's gas pedal, as Margie makes a turn
through a DIRT CONSTRUCTION SITE.

EXT. SHORT BUS - CONTINUOUS

In the lot, the bus leaves a trail of dust as Jessica's car follows.

EXT. SHORT STEEP STREET - MOMENTS LATER

A serene moment before a far away scream is heard, then the SHORT BUS
CRASHES THROUGH A FENCE, fully launched in the air!

While in the air, our angle FLOWS INTO the bus.

INT. SHORT BUS SLOW-MO - CONTINUOUS

In ULTRA-SLOW MOTION, it's ZERO GRAVITY as we TRACK through the bus to
see:

MARGIE'S UNFAZED, but her dentures FLOAT OUT OF HER MOUTH. MS. HELLER,
frozen in a scream, legs in the air. As CARL floats past TOBY, then
past LEWIS, CHING CHONG and TURK who are in a jumble of arms and legs.
CARL continues on to HARRY and LLOYD who act as if they are on Apollo
13, tongue's out both chasing the same FREEZE-DRIED ICE CREAM, come
together almost for a KISS, then grossed out, break apart. Other food
from their lunch bags is floating around.

EXT. SHORT BUS - CONTINUOUS

We BURST OUT of the bus as it LANDS ROUGHLY ON THE STREET, SLAMMING
CARL hard against the back window, followed by a mess of food stuffs
and Margie's dentures that get slammed against the window and
sandwiched by half of a peanut butter sandwich. The Short Bus ambles
on.

				HARRY (O.S.)
			(re: bus ride)
		Again, again!
		Everyone shouts "Again!".

EXT. JESSICA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

She lands even more roughly, and must LOCK UP HER BRAKES as a BIG TRUCK
backs into her path. Beyond the truck she sees the Short Bus driving
away. She's defeated.

INT. MUSEUM LOBBY - LATER - DAY

WE SEE the bus on the street outside the glass doors.

				MS. HELLER (O.S.)
		Here we are.

The kids file inside. They are disheveled, covered in food, drooling,
tripping, Carl's back to his old, cloudy way - you get the picture.

TWO PASSERSBY, a MAN and a WOMAN, notice the motley crew.

				MAN
			(sympathetic)
		Special needs.

				WOMAN
		Well, aren't they just so sweet.

				MS. HELLER
		Everyone find a partner. You're
		not any good to me dead.

The class ad-libs partnering up: Turk with Ching Chong, Toby with
Terri, Lewis with Carl. Harry and Lloyd look around nervously for a
partner.

				HARRY
		Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been
		my partner.

				LLOYD
		Sucks for you.

				HARRY
		Who's your partner?

				LLOYD
			(looks around at the
			 obviously partnered class)
		I don't know. I haven't decided
		yet.

				HARRY
		Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can
		I say this... you and I
		could...perhaps ...maybe...uh...
		partner up?

				LLOYD
		You and me? Dream on, desperado.

				HARRY
		Oh. Sorry. You're right, field
		trip partner is a big commitment.

				LLOYD
		I'm kidding! Of course I'll be
		your partner.

LLOYD puts his arm around Harry and they head into the museum.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		You have some serious self-worth
		issues, my ugly, stupid, pudgy
		little friend.

				HARRY
		Stop it, you're embarrassing me.

INT. MUSEUM - LATER

CLOSE ON a giant white polar bear in menacing pose, arms up, teeth
bared.

				HARRY (V.O.)
		I've always wanted to be a polar
		bear. Tall, strong, six stomachs.
		He's the most beautiful creature in
		the forest.

REVEAL Harry and Lloyd looking up at the polar bear. Harry's in awe.

				LLOYD
		That's a cow, Harry.

				HARRY
		Well, I could go for a tall glass
		of polar bear milk right now.

MS. HELLER ENTERS and corrals Harry, Lloyd, and the rest of the Special
Needs class.

				MS. HELLER
		Okay, class, everyone gather round.
		Mr. Collins wants a picture to
		prove you were here.
			(catching herself)
		And to cherish.

She unfurls a banner, and hands it to Turk and Ching Chong to hold. It
reads "SPECIAL NEEDS CLASS FIELD TRIP 1986".

She spots a nearby MUSEUM DOCENT.

				MS. HELLER (cont'd)
		Excuse me, Do you mind?

She hands her camera to the Docent who snaps their photo.

				MS. HELLER (cont'd)
		Good, got it.
			(to docent)
		How long is the average field trip
		here?

				DOCENT
		To fully experience all we have to
		offer? Maybe two hours.

				MS. HELLER
		Alright. I'll be back in four.
		Give them the tour twice and talk
		slowly.

She puts the camera away and walks off.

				DOCENT
			(to class)
		Okay, okay, listen up everybody.
		Welcome to the Shea Museum of
		Natural History. Where your
		journey into the past comes alive!
		She turns and faces the polar bear.

				DOCENT (cont'd)
			(bad acting polar bear)
		Grrr. Roar. Grrr. My name is
		Ursus Maritmus and I live in parts
		of Northern Canada and the
		Antarctic. Grr. Roar. Grr. I
		rely on a keen sense of a smell to
		sniff out prey. My long neck helps
		me view my habitat and pluck fish
		from the sea. Roar. Glub glub.
		Roar.

She turns back around in a menacing polar bear pose and sees everyone's
gone except for Harry and Lloyd.

				DOCENT (cont'd)
		Uh-oh scared them away. Too many
		"Roars."

The young boy raises his hand.

				YOUNG BOY
			(points)
		What's his name?

				DOCENT
			(impatient)
		Like I said, Ursus Maritimus.

				LLOYD
			(to boy with authority)
		That's not a real name. His
		parents called him "Snowy".

				YOUNG BOY
		What's his name?

He points to a Snow Fox.

				LLOYD
		Also Snowy.

				YOUNG BOY
		I like his answers better.

				LLOYD
			(to the Docent)
		LLOYD Christmas - Special Needs.
		I'll take over from here ma'am.

She just eyes him passively then walks away.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
			(to kid)
		You see, the animal kingdom is
		actually very simple. Everything
		is named Snowy, at least in cold
		climates. On the other hand,
		"Scorchy" over here...

LLOYD points to a camel in a desert exhibit and leads the kid off,
leaving Harry alone, entranced by the polar bear.

INT. MUSEUM LOBBY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

JESSICA ENTERS, we see out the doors that her car is parked behind the
bus.

INT. MUSEUM GALLERY - MOMENTS LATER

JESSICA enters the gallery. She approaches Harry who is standing alone
staring at the polar bear.

				JESSICA
		HARRY!

				HARRY
		MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.

				JESSICA
		That's because Ms. Heller doesn't
		want you to know this whole thing
		is a scam.

				HARRY
		A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a
		fake.

				JESSICA
		You did?

				HARRY
		Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It
		hasn't moved in half an hour. And
		those Eskimos over there...I'm sure
		at least one of them is a
		mannequin.

				JESSICA
		Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I
		have something that's kind of
		delicate...

				HARRY
		Oh, you want to talk about your
		delicates?

				JESSICA
		Are you trying to be funny? Or are
		you actually re--, re...special

				HARRY
		We're all special. Everyone Lloyd
		and I chose for the class is
		special.

				JESSICA
		You and Lloyd chose the class!?

JESSICA, thinks a moment as she figures things out.

				JESSICA (cont'd)
		This is starting to make more
		sense.

Just then, Jessica sees Turk walking down a corridor towards them -
he's goofing around with Lewis and Ching Chong.

				JESSICA (cont'd)
		We can't really talk here. Can you
		come to my house tonight?

				HARRY
			(stunned)
		Excuse me?

				JESSICA
		Come over around seven.

				HARRY
		O'clock?

				JESSICA
		Yeah...

				HARRY
		Gotcha.

JESSICA walks off.

				HARRY (cont'd)
			(sotto)
		A date.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER

ANGLE ON the empty hallway. WE HEAR muffled voices from above. Some
dust falls into frame then ABRUPTLY, Harry and LLOYD fall directly in
front of us from above. With some plaster ceiling following. Harry
loved the fall, Lloyd doesn't much care.

				LLOYD
		Sorry about that Harry, first time
		I've brought a friend up there. You
		okay?

				HARRY
		Yea!

LLOYD throws a ceiling piece back up and they walk on.

				HARRY (cont'd)
		So Lloyd, you gotta help me. A
		real live date with a real live
		girl.

				LLOYD
		Who cares? Chicks are for fags.

				HARRY
		I think she wants me to come over
		to put me into the right position
		to check out her delicates, what
		ever that means.

				LLOYD
		Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get
		"some".

				HARRY
		Some what?

				LLOYD
		You know... She's gonna be all over
		you like a barrel of monkeys, with
		her tight shirt and short skirt...
		Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even
		talk about it.

				HARRY
		Come on, Lloyd. You must know
		someone I can talk to.

				LLOYD
		Sure I do. On one condition.

				HARRY
		You can't marry my mom.

				LLOYD
		It's really not up to you, Harry.
		But we just want you to feel like
		you're part of the decision.

				HARRY
		Shut up!

				LLOYD
		Alright, if you really want to go
		down this road, well girl's like
		chocolate.

CUT TO:

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER

Tight on a candy vending machine. HARRY sees CHOCOLATE BARS for sale
behind the glass, among other edible goodies including CLEAR PACKAGES
OF PEANUTS called: SONNIE JEWEL PEANUTS, and next to it - VIOLET
CRUMBLE He puts in some coins and presses what he thinks the code for
chocolate is. But he's off by one and the peanuts next to the chocolate
drops down. He tries again. And the Violet Crumble drops down. Again,
some lifesavers fall. He tries again. Nope. Baked apple pie. He puts in
more coins...

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The vending machine is almost completely empty -- except for the
chocolate bars. Snack goods fill the dispenser tray and spill out onto
the floor around Harry. He reaches in and is out of coins. Frustrated,
he reaches up into the candy return at the bottom. After a few beats,
the look on his face tells us he's stuck. Maybe forever.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - ABOUT A HALF-HOUR LATER

HARRY's arm is now incredibly jammed half-way up INTO THE MACHINE. He's
twisted into a pretzel, and just as he's about to grab a HANDFUL of the
chocolate bars from the rack inside. Then the whole machine CRASHES
DOWN ON HIM.

CLOSE ON: His hand reaching out, grabs some of the prized chocolate
bars and Sonnie Jewel Peanuts that have spilled on the floor.

EXT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON Harry outside her front door.

				HARRY
			(practicing)
		Hello, Jessica. It's nice to see
		you, Jessica. No that's not right.
		JESSICA, hi. It's Harry, remember
		me from before? No, that's stupid.
		JESSICA, hello. Hello, Jessica.
		JESSICA Jessica Jessica. Mrs.
		HARRY Jessica. Mr. Harry Jessica.
		J-e-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i--

				JESSICA O.S.
		HARRY!

Reveal Harry has actually been standing in front of Jessica the whole
time. She's putting a stop to this. But handles it with kid gloves,
still not sure if he's mentally challenged.

				JESSICA
			(carefully)
		HARRY, let's go inside.

INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

JESSICA ushers Harry inside.

				JESSICA
		Wipe your feet. My parents are
		totally anal.

				HARRY
		Ooh gross.

				JESSICA
		Would you like something to drink?

				HARRY
		Yeah, but I'm buying.

He giggles, clearly nervous beyond belief.

JESSICA HARRY, I have a lot of questions to ask you so let's just do it
upstairs? HARRY Good plan. I'm not ready for "downstairs."

INT. JESSICA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

JESSICA sits on the bed, going over notes.

				JESSICA
		Okay, there's a lot for us to go
		over, so it may get hard for you.

				HARRY
		Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard
		for me? Hard for me?
			(then)
		You had questions?

				JESSICA
		I checked with the school board,
		she's not an accredited teacher.

				HARRY
		That's okay. Lloyd's really the
		one teaching the class.

				JESSICA
		LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?

				HARRY
		She says that she's got more
		important things to do now that the
		new mall opened.

				JESSICA
		Sit down, I have something to tell
		you.

				HARRY
			(sits on radiator)
		I'm fine.

				JESSICA
		Well, I'll tell you what I think.
		I think she and Principal Collins
		are embezzling money from the
		school, and I think they've been
		doing it for years.

CLOSE UP on Harry's face as she continues to lay out her theory. He's
hasn't paid any attention to her.

				HARRY (V.O.)
		Wow, She's really making me feel
		hot. Must be those feelings Lloyd
		was talking about.

As she prattles on, Harry doesn't realize the "small bench" he sat on
is actually a radiator.

CLOSE UP on Harry's butt as steam wafts up.

				JESSICA
		And if that's not bad enough, I
		think your so-called 'Special Needs
		class' is all a scam! But I just
		need proof.

HARRY's not really hearing any of this.

				HARRY (V.O.)
		I don't know how long I can sit
		here. I didn't think the first time
		would hurt so much...
			(out loud)
		Especially in the ass.

She goes to him, puts hand on his shoulder.

				JESSICA
		What? Well now I'm in a position
		where I may just heed your help.

				HARRY
		Po, po, position...? Hey, here's
		thought, have you a bathroom?

				JESSICA
		Just down the hall.

				HARRY
		Very good. Back in a jiff.

He does a little bow and exits the bedroom slowly so Jessica doesn't
see his scalded butt.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

HARRY walks down the hallway in utter pain. He can't make any noise,
but is face looks like he's about to burst. WE SEE SMOKE drifting up
from his hot ass.

INT. JESSICA'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

HARRY backs into the bathroom and slowly closes the door. He carefully
locks it, then--

				HARRY
		Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

Three minutes of scalding ass comes out in a primal cry. He jumps up
and down in pain and grabs his butt in a desperate attempt to cool it
off. Then he looks at his hand. It's brown with peanuts in it.

				HARRY (cont'd)
		Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

Could the heat have possibly compromised his sphincter control? He
brings his hand up and inspects it. Then he smells it. Then he tastes
it (not bad). Then he examines his stained hand a little closer, picks
off a coagulated CHUNK OF PEANUT, pops that in his mouth and begins
eating it.

				HARRY (cont'd)
		Yummy.

He reaches back down into his pants and this time pulls out the Sonnie
Day Peanuts bag and chocolate bar wrapper. A huge wave of relief wafts
over his face. He takes another lick as he grabs a white towel off the
rack and starts to wipe off the chocolate. He makes grunting noises as
he wipes.

				HARRY (cont'd)
		Oh, what a mess.

In trying to clean-up he only make its worse. Chocolate is quickly
everywhere: On his hands, face, shirt, towels, all over his pants, the
sink, the mirrors, etc. He panics.

				JESSICA (O.S.)
		HARRY? Are you okay?

				HARRY
		Are you kidding? I couldn't be
		more okay.

				JESSICA (O.S.)
		My mom wants to know if you can
		stay for dinner.

				HARRY
		Are you kidding? I'll be down in a
		"I-crapped-my-pants."

				JESSICA (O.S.)
		What?

				HARRY
		Coming.

EXT. TOWN MAIN STREET - SAME TIME

LLOYD cruises down the sidewalk on Ray's floor waxer. The "WAX ON"
lever is accidentally activated from the jostling and wax starts to
spray out behind him. HEAD ON shot of Lloyd driving down the sidewalk
as pedestrians behind him slip and fall on the steaming wax.

INT. JESSICA'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The place is now a disaster! Harry tries to hide the chocolate covered
towels in the cabinets, spreading the mess everywhere.

				JESSICA O.S.
		HARRY, are you coming down?

				HARRY
		Just... cleaning up.

He surveys the disaster and realizes there is only thing to do. He
climbs out the window.

INT. JESSICA'S ROOF/FRONT YARD- CONTINUOUS

He climbs out on the roof to escape.

				LLOYD O.S.
		HARRY!

HARRY jumps - almost falls off. Looks, sees Lloyd down below.

HARRY'S POV:

				HARRY
		Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?

				LLOYD
		Just wanted to see how your doing.

				HARRY
		I kinda screwed things up.

				LLOYD
		I'm sure you're overreacting.

				HARRY
		I don't think so.

				LLOYD
		You're always your harshest critic.

				HARRY
		She wants me to stay for dinner, I
		don't know what to say to her.

				LLOYD
		Okay, I saw this in a movie once.
		Open the dining room window and
		follow my lead. Say what I say.

				HARRY
		Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you
		downstairs, I gotta find some
		clothes.

HARRY glances in a different window and sees some dry cleaning that
looks like a looks like a man's blue suit hanging on a hook.

INT. JESSICA'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

HARRY walks down the stairs wearing the suit.

TILT TO REVEAL it's actually a woman's pant suit with shoulder pads and
a very blousy cut jacket a la Nancy Regan circa 1985.

				JESSICA
		What are you wearing?

				HARRY
		I, uh... changed for dinner. I get
		dressed for all my meals. Except
		breakfast and bath-meal.
			(then, bad acting)
		Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I
		open a window?

He opens the window.

ANGLE ON - LLOYD sneaks up under the window. We CUT BACK AND FORTH.

				LLOYD
			(loud whisper)
		HARRY, can you hear me?

				HARRY
		Yes.

				JESSICA
		Yes, what?

				LLOYD
		Don't answer me. Say what I say.

				HARRY
		Okay.

				JESSICA
		Okay, what?

				LLOYD
		You have beautiful eyes.

				HARRY
		You have beautiful eyes.

				JESSICA
		Thank you.

LLOYD looks down to see the family dog on his leg.

				LLOYD
		Hey, where did you come from?

				HARRY
		Hey, where did you come from?

				JESSICA
		Well I was born in St. Louis.

				LLOYD
		Do you want me to pet your head?

				HARRY
		Do you want me to pet your head?

				LLOYD
		I bet you want your head scratched.

				HARRY
		I bet you want your head scratched.

				JESSICA
		No, why? I think we still have
		more to talk about.

LLOYD goes to pet the dog's head and it growls at him.

				LLOYD
		Don't snap at me like that. You're
		lucky I don't punch you right in
		the face.

				HARRY
		Don't snap at me like that. You're
		lucky I don't punch you right in
		the face.

She is hurt and takes a step back.

				LLOYD
		Now what are you staring at, you
		ugly monkey?

				HARRY
		What are you staring at, you ugly
		monkey?

We see Jessica's WASPY father now standing there with her.

				JESSICA'S DAD
		Uh... not a great first
		impression... Dinner's ready.

				HARRY
		Then what are we doing sitting
		around yapping? Let's eat!

He puts his arm around Jessica's father and leads him into the dining
room.

				HARRY (cont'd)
		So what business are you in,
		Charlie?

				JESSICA'S DAD
		The name's Walter.

				HARRY
		Well la de da.

				LLOYD
			(whispers)
		Hey? Hello? It's me?

JESSICA hears this and goes to the window. She sees Lloyd.

				JESSICA
		LLOYD?

EXT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

JESSICA opens the door.

				JESSICA
		What are you doing here?

				LLOYD
		Checking up on my friend, Harry.

				JESSICA
		Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's
		just about to open up.

INT. JESSICA'S DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

HARRY is now at the table with Jessica's dad, who watches him cut and
eat pads of butter.

				JESSICA'S DAD
		We've got some margarine too if
		you'd like to scoop it out of the
		tub.

				HARRY
		No, I'm fine thanks.

				JESSICA'S DAD
		Well save room for Mrs. Matthews
		famous baked brisket.

				HARRY
		Famous? I've never heard of it.

JESSICA's mom enters and puts the food on the table. She notices
Harry's suit.

				JESSICA'S MOM
		You know, they make that suit for
		women, too.

HARRY's now stuffing a roll in his mouth - he nods.

				JESSICA'S MOM (cont'd)
		So I see you like my rolls.

				HARRY
			(mouth full)
		Sure, I like a woman with some meat
		on her bones.

EXT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

				LLOYD
		So, have you given him "some" yet?
			(he winks)

				JESSICA
		What?

				LLOYD
		You know, "some". The fag stuff.

				JESSICA
		HARRY and I have been talking about
		school. In fact, I want to ask you
		something.

				LLOYD
		I know, you want go for a ride.

He points to his waxer gyrating around on the lawn, with a trail of
smashed flowers behind it.

				JESSICA
		Where'd that come from?
		He holds up a giant key chain.

				LLOYD
		Come on, I live with the janitor.
		I have a key to every room in the
		school.

				JESSICA
		So could you get us into the
		principal's office?

				LLOYD
		Principal's office? Yeah, I guess
		I can swing that.

With expert Ninja-like agility, Lloyd grabs the key.

				JESSICA
		Oh, Lloyd! That's it. Maybe I'll
		get my story after all!

In a fit of exhilaration, she takes Lloyd's face and kisses him on the
lips.

INT. JESSICA'S DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

JESSICA's Dad is now calming down.

				JESSICA'S DAD
		...now let's just have a quiet
		dinner, and forget this ever
		happened.

Over this, Harry sees Jessica kissing Lloyd out the door behind
Jessica's Dad. He drops his glass of grape juice and it explodes in a
mess on the white carpet.

				JESSICA'S MOM/ JESSICA'S DAD
		Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

				HARRY
			(reacting to kiss and
			 then)
		Ooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

				JESSICA'S MOM
		I'll get the carpet cleaner.

				JESSICA'S DAD
		I'll get some towels!

Her father runs upstairs as Harry runs to the front door.

EXT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

JESSICA pulls away from Lloyd. He's never felt this feeling before.
Instant love. Jessica, isn't aware of her impact. Just then Harry
bursts out.

				HARRY
			(to Lloyd)
		Two-timing slut!

				HARRY(cont'd)
			(to Jessica)
		And you! I thought you were from
		St. Louis!
			(back to Lloyd)
		I never want to see you again.
		Captain Rob was right. You are an
		arrrrrs-hole.

LLOYD ignores Harry. He can't keep his eyes off his new love, Jessica.

				HARRY (cont'd)
		I'm going home. After I thank your
		parents for a wonderful evening.

HARRY goes back into the house and shuts the door.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

JESSICA's father enters and sees the room covered with brown stains.

				JESSICA'S DAD
		Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Oh my god!

EXT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

				JESSICA'S DAD (O.S.)
		Oh my God, he shit everywhere!
		There's shit everywhere! Oh my
		God. Get up here. There's shit on
		the window. Son of a bitch. He
		shit all over my bathroom. Shit.
		Shit- shit- shit.

				JESSICA'S MOM (O.S.)
		Aaaahh. Shit! Oh my God. It's all
		poo. There's poo everywhere.

The front door opens and Harry walks out trying to look dignified for
Lloyd's benefit. After a few steps, he starts to run down the sidewalk
at full speed.

				JESSICA
		So, when can we do it?

				LLOYD
		Tomorrow night?

				JESSICA'S MOM O.S.
		Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

				JESSICA'S DAD O.S.
		Look!! It's all shit! He shit all
		over! There's shit everywhere!!

				JESSICA'S MOM (O.S.)
		Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

JESSICA runs in, leaving Lloyd happy to be in love.

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

HARRY sits on his bed and tears up the treasure map his mom made for
him.

				HARRY
		I was an idiot to ever leave the
		house, go to school, meet new
		friends. That won't happen again,
		will it, Captain?
			(beat)
		And you know why...

He pushes a wall unit book shelf over to block the window.

				HARRY (cont'd)
		... because you're never gonna jump
		ship on me again.

He pushes a book shelf in front of the window, it gives way falling
apart - spilling it's contents to the floor.

				HARRY (cont'd)
			(to Captain Rob)
		You did not know that was going to
		happen!

EXT. SCHOOL MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT

LLOYD is sitting on the front steps with flowers and a casette tape. He
looks up at the school's clock, it reads 7:55. Then looks at his palm -
where he's drawn a pocket watch. It also says 7:55.

				LLOYD
		Won't be long now.

He looks off and we see his POV, a DATE FANTASY:

EXT. PLAYBOY MANSION GROTTO - NIGHT

LLOYD sits in a hot tub surrounded by a bevy of Playmates. He has them
captivated.

				LLOYD
		... And that, ladies, is why God
		gave women two breasts instead of
		three. Although you're OK.

He points at one beautiful girl who has three beautiful breasts. They
all laugh and giggle.

One heretofore unseen Jessica EMERGES FROM THE WATER, god knows what
she's been doing. Wink wink.

				JESSICA
		Oh, baby, you're the bestest.

				LLOYD
		Oh, go on.

				JESSICA laughs.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		No seriously, go on.

And HE PUSHES HER BACK UNDERWATER.

				MRS. DUNNE O.S.
		Oh, Lloyd...

He looks and we pan to see the beautiful Mrs. Dunne who removes the
same Mom-pajamas she wore in Harry's bedroom, revealing a bathing suit
as she steps into the pool.

				LLOYD
		Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.

				MRS. DUNNE
		Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for
		the world.

				LLOYD
		Have you got what I want?

				MRS. DUNNE
		You know I do!

				LLOYD
		Oh yeah, give it to me.

MRS. DUNNE takes Lloyd's face and virtually EATS HIS FACE in a kiss
that will stop time.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		Not what I had in mind but much
		better than the meatloaf stew.

JESSICA interrupts them as she comes up from the under the water
holding wet papers.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
			(to Mrs. Dunne)
		I meant 'give me some pie'...

				JESSICA
		LLOYD, I finished all of your
		homework.

MRS. DUNNE approaches Jessica.

				MRS. DUNNE
		Get lost sister he's mine!

				JESSICA
		In your dreams! I saw him first!

				MRS. DUNNE
		You only want him for his hot rack.

				JESSICA
		Well you only want him because he's
		a genius like Albert Frankenstein.

This starts a pushing match and water slap fight.

				LLOYD
		Girls! Girls! Please.

They both stop.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		There's only one, fair way to
		settle this. Make-out contest!

SMASH CUT TO:

SFX: DING DING DING Both girls square off the come together to kiss
EACH OTHER. LLOYD's the referee, he walks around them to make sure
there's no cheating. He wears a ref's shirt and bow tie.

SFX: BUZZER

The girls turn to Lloyd so he can announce the winner.

				MRS. DUNNE
		How was that?

				LLOYD
		It's too close to call.
			(off their looks)
		Okay next contest, now lets...

HARRY SUDDENLY APPEARS from above RIDING A JET PACK and wearing a bad
helmet. He lands on the side of the jacuzzi.

				HARRY
		LLOYD, what are you doing? That's
		JESSICA and... my mom.

				LLOYD
		HARRY, this is my fantasy! I
		suggest you leave - before I
		imagine something horrible.

				HARRY
		But-

				LLOYD
		HARRY!

				HARRY
		You're right. Hey, thanks for the
		jet pack. Your fantasies are so
		much cooler than mine. Bye Mom.

MRS. DUNNE smile and waves. Harry flies out of frame he goes by a
bikini beauty who DIVES into the pool. We see her UNDERWATER. As she
swims by Lloyd a BURST of FART BUBBLES come from his shorts.

SFX: Underwater bubbles.

The bubbles rise to the surface and we see Lloyd.

				LLOYD
			(guilty)
		Oopsy-daisy.

JESSICA and Mrs. Dunne stare at Lloyd.

				JESSICA
		LLOYD, did you just fart?

CLOSE ON Lloyd.

				LLOYD
			(flirty)
		Maybe.

EXT. SCHOOL MAIN ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

REVEAL Jessica is standing in front of Lloyd at the school and has just
really asked Lloyd if he farted.

				JESSICA
		Well, something stinks.

				LLOYD
		Maybe it's this mix tape I made
		you. Or maybe these flowers.
		He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.

				JESSICA
		Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited!
		So, are you ready to take me to the
		principal's office?
		He whips out the key, she takes it.

				LLOYD
		So no small talk? Good, 'cause I
		don't know how to make that. Yep.
		Small talk. Not for me. Not a
		fan.
			(beat)
		Got any hobbies? How 'bout this
		weather?

LLOYD looks around and she's gone.

INT. COLLINS OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

JESSICA's frantically looking for something- opening drawers, throwing
books off shelves, scattering papers. She sees a chest, opens it and
continues searching- unsuccessfully.

				JESSICA
		Nothing.

LLOYD enters, seductively sliding onto Collins' desk.

				JESSICA (cont'd)
		What are you doing?

				LLOYD
		What are you doing?

				JESSICA
		Let's just do it and get out of
		here.

She goes back to searching the office. Loyd watches her.

				LLOYD
		Oh, wow. Straight to the business.
		But okay, I'll get ready.

LLOYD lifts his leg up to take off a shoe. He hops around on the other
leg, struggling and jumping up and down.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		I just can't get it off.

				JESSICA
		I'm so close I can feel it.

				LLOYD
		Me too. I'm almost there.

				JESSICA
		That's it. I'm done.

				LLOYD
		That was fast. Well, did you at
		least enjoy it?

				JESSICA
		No, it was a complete waste of
		time.

				LLOYD
		This is so embarrassing, it's never
		happened before. Well, maybe a
		couple of times, but I was alone.

SFX: Horn honks.

She looks out the window to see a handsome guy sitting in a car.

				JESSICA
		That's my boyfriend.

				LLOYD
		Boyfriend? What about all that
		talk about riding my waxer?

				JESSICA
		Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find
		what I was looking for. Oh can you
		do me a favor and clean up?
		Collins can't know we were here.

She exits.

				LLOYD
		Don't worry! I don't kiss and tell.
			(then)
		Ooh, messy.

LLOYD starts to clean up.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. COLLINS' OFFICE - LATER

The office is back to normal. Lloyd is just finishing when he picks a
lamp off the ground and spies a steel chest with a padlock sitting
under a table in the center of the room.

				LLOYD
		Oh. My. God. The treasure chest.
		This must be the chest Harry's been
		looking for. This is it. I found
		HARRY's treasure! Harry! Harry!

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

LLOYD is dragging the very heavy treasure chest.

				LLOYD
			(yelling)
		HARRY! Harry!
			(to himself)
		I should probably do this yelling
		at Harry's house.

INT. SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

LLOYD pushes the chest and it bounces down the stairs.

INT. HARRY'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

HARRY sits in a chair NOT watching an episode of LAVERNE AND SHIRLEY in
fact he hates that show. He hears the sounds of pebbles hitting the
window. After a beat we see Lloyd's head slowly appear in the window
straining as hard as a face possibly could to look over the ledge. It
can't hold the position any more and drops out of frame. A second
later, a huge amount of gravel and stones pelt the window. Then a
gigantic cinder block comes flying through the glass. The window
explodes. Harry looks at the cinder block. There is a note attached:
"LOOK OUT WINDOW. I'M TRYING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION."

EXT. HARRY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Reveal Harry's on the first floor, and Lloyd is inches away outside the
window. Harry's head pokes out.

				LLOYD
		HARRY! I found the treasure!

				HARRY
		Go away, assface.

				LLOYD
		Did you hear what I said? The
		treasure! Like on your map!

				HARRY
		Yeah, right. Why don't you show it
		to your "girlfriend"?

				LLOYD
		JESSICA and I are through. I
		couldn't stand being with her
		knowing you liked her. It wasn't
		worth our friendship. Oh, and she
		also has a boyfriend.

				HARRY
		Do you hear something, Captain Rob?

				LLOYD
		Captain Rob came back?

				HARRY
			(to Captain Rob)
		Yeah, he does sound like a rat
		fink.

				LLOYD
		Hey, there's no reason to use that
		kind of language!

				HARRY
			(beat, then laughs)
		Good one, Captain Rob. He does
		look like a you-know-what.

				LLOYD
		Oh, telling inside jokes now, are
		we? That's it. You're out of the
		cool crowd. Next time Turk's
		passing out wedgies, you ain't
		gettin' one.

HARRY slams the window. An angry Lloyd storms away.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		We're through, pal. Finito. No
		mas. Auf Weinerschnitzel. The
		end.

HARRY sadly watches him go.

He picks up his gallon of ice cream and "Tiger Beat" magazine, and
sulks.

As we begin a sad Harry-Lloyd montage...

INT. RAY'S BASEMENT APARTMENT

LLOYD has stuffed pillows and blankets and has built a stuffed Harry.
His head is the mound of chewed gum from earlier with chemistry goggles
and crazy-mop hair attached. LLOYD falls asleep on the bed and Harry's
gum-ball head sticks to Lloyd. Lloyd wakes up and has a Siamese twin
Harry stuck to him.

INT. SPECIAL NEEDS CLASSROOM - NEXT MORNING

LLOYD is in front of the class, teaching. Harry is whispering to the
empty desk next to him and starts giggling.

				LLOYD
		HARRY, would you like to share with
		the rest of us what's so funny?

				HARRY
		You wouldn't get it. Just a
		private joke between best friends.

LLOYD snaps a piece of chalk in jealous rage.

				LLOYD
		Okay, class. Who can tell me who
		painted the Declaration of
		Independence?

The class ignores him, but Harry shoots his hand in the air.

				HARRY
		Ooh, ooh. Call on me!

LLOYD looks around the class, pretending not to see Harry. TURK and
Ching Chong are making out, Terri is painting her nails, Toby is asleep
on her lap. Carl is near a black-board that has the 'x's and 'o's of a
football play, he's scribbling circles around one of the 'x's ,
mumbling to himself. Lewis is engrossed in a book- "Getting that Mascot
Scholarship."

				LLOYD
		No one knows?

				HARRY
		Me, me, me!

				LLOYD
		The answer is George Jefferson.

HARRY slams his fist on the desk in frustration.

				HARRY
		I knew that!

LLOYD snickers.

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

HARRY, spitting food out talking. The kids across from him leave,
disgusted. Directly BEHIND him, Lloyd is doing the same thing. The
people across from him leave. Harry and Lloyd both turn and see each
other, almost have a moment - then get mad again and turn back. Harry
finally decides to make amends and turns back around - but Lloyd's
gone.

EXT. PETE'S FISH SHANTY - NIGHT

Out in front of this fish-theme restaurant, Lewis - dressed in a
pirate's costume, is talking to the owner.

				LEWIS
		I have a lot of experience wearing
		mascot suits and I can start most
		mornings at eleven. Except for
		Thursdays, when I can start at ten.

				OWNER
		Don't you have school?

				LEWIS
		Kind of. Not really.

				OWNER
		Alright, just don't piss anyone off
		and you've got the job.

				LEWIS
		I won't let you down, sir.

LEWIS puts on a giant foam pirate head.

EXT. PETE'S FISH SHANTY - LATER - NIGHT

LLOYD walks by the restaurant as Lewis, now in the foam head, stands
outside passing out coupons.

				LEWIS
		Hey, Lloyd.

LLOYD stops dead in his track and turns around.

				LLOYD
		Do I know you?

				LEWIS
		Duh. I'm in your class at school.

				LLOYD
		Oh my God, it's really you. You're
		HARRY's friend, right?

				LEWIS
		I don't know if you'd call us
		"friends"...

				LLOYD
		You really are a pirate.

				LEWIS
		Can you believe it?

				LLOYD
		So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh
		Captain Rob?

				LEWIS
		What are you talking about?

LLOYD exits frame. We hold a beat, as Lewis hands out a flyer then
Lloyd comes FLYING through frame, TACKLING Lewis. On the ground he
slugs him through the eye-patch in his Pirate head.

				LLOYD
		I want my friend back!

LLOYD storms off. Lewis POV: From the hole in the head, he sees the
owner come outside and stand over him. Lewis takes his pirate head off.

				OWNER
		I think I have to let you go. And
		you gotta pay for the busted head.

INT. HARRY'S LIVING ROOM Ñ NEXT MORNING There is STATIC on the TV,
Harry's fallen asleep on the couch. Pebbles hit his now taped up
window, it wakes him up. HARRY looks and sees Lloyd's head popping up
and down as if jumping up from a lower floor. He walks over revealing
they are on the first floor, and Lloyd's outside doing push-ups.

				HARRY
		LLOYD, doing girlie push-ups is not
		going to impress me.

LLOYD stands up.

				LLOYD

				Well how about this.

LLOYD points to the gigantic polar bear from the museum standing on the
side of the house behind him.

				HARRY
		You took the polar bear out of it's
		natural habitat?

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS

A mom and her little girl stand in front of the Arctic exhibit. Little
baby polar bears surround the place where the big polar bear used to
be. A LITTLE GIRL is with her MOM.

										LITTLE GIRL
		Mommy, where's the Daddy polar
		bear?

				MOM
		He was shot by a hunter. Just like
		your father.

BACK TO:

EXT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

HARRY leans out his upstairs window.

				HARRY
			(angry)
		LLOYD! I can't believe you! Just
		when I thought I couldn't get any
		madder at you, you do something
		like this...

LLOYD's face falls.

				HARRY (cont'd)
			(ecstatic)
		... And I can't even remember why I
		was mad at you! Get that polar
		bear off my lawn, and bring it up
		to my room!

LLOYD's look tells us it'll never fit through the door.

INT. HARRY'S STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

LLOYD and Harry drag the polar bear up the stairs, knocking pictures
off the wall.

				LLOYD
		By the way, did Captain Rob mention
		how I beat the crap out of him this
		afternoon?

				HARRY
		No. What happened?

				LLOYD
			(covering)
		Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MONDAY MORNING

Kids arriving at school. Lloyd and Harry walk up, one wearing a polar
bear jacket and the other in polar bear pants. They see Lewis with a
black eye.

				LLOYD
		Hey buddy, what happened to you?

Seeing Lloyd, Lewis runs off in the other direction.

				HARRY
		Must be jealous of our polar wear.

INT. PRINCIPAL COLLINS'S OFFICE - LATER

Collins frantically looking around the office. Ms. Heller enters.

				MS. HELLER
		Baby, I'm going to spend the
		morning at the mall. You know,
		shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are
		you looking for?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		The chest! The chest that I put my
		papers in.

				MS. HELLER
		What papers?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		The documents. The photos! The
		tapes! The evidence.

				MS. HELLER
		The evidence of what?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Sweetheart keep up with me for half
		a minute. The evidence of every
		scam we ever pulled. The evidence
		that's going to put us away for
		twenty years.

Now Ms. Heller starts to panic.

				MS. HELLER
		Where is it?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		I don't know where it is. It's not
		here. It's been stolen.

				MS. HELLER
		Wait a minute, I think I know who
		stole it.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		No you don't know who stole it.
		Just let me do the thinking.

Collins paces for beat.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (cont'd)
		Okay, what have you got?

				MS. HELLER
		It was Jessica. That girl who
		tried to follow me on the field
		trip.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		JESSICA. Are you sure?

				MS. HELLER
		She's been snooping around a lot,
		asking questions.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.

				MS. HELLER
		Are you going to kill her?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
			(exasperated to the nth
		degree)
		Why don't you see to it the kids
		are ready for the parade tomorrow.
		I have to pay somebody a little
		visit.

EXT. SPECIAL NEEDS CLASSROOM

An establishing angle on the dilapidated building

INT. SPECIAL NEEDS CLASS - LATER

MS. HELLER is addressing the class. We see on the blackboard behind
her, she has written 'Special Needs Parade float project' and a poor
CHALK-SKETCH of a float.

				MS. HELLER
		So, any ideas for a float?

HARRY and Lloyd, best friends once again, sit near the front.

				LLOYD
		A raft.

				HARRY
		A blimp.

				LLOYD
		A turd.

				MS. HELLER
		Not things that float. Ideas for a
		float. Can we hear from anyone
		else?

The class ignores her. As Toby flirts with Terri, Lewis lifts his
wallet from his back pocket.

				LLOYD
		Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're
		used to me teaching.

				MS. HELLER
			(to others)
		People! Come on. "Parade" float.

CHING CHONG nods her head like she gets it and stands up next to Turk.

				CHING CHONG
		Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka
		powww.

				TURK
			(overlaps with a
		stereotypical Asian
		accent)
		She's saying... a beautiful swan...

				CHING CHONG
		Sleeeeew sheek baw...

				TURK
		... flying gracefully... over the
		rice fields.

CHING CHONG looks very lovingly at Turk.

				CHING CHONG
		Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah
		oh che.

				TURK
		... to the tune of "Only the
		Lonely" by Roy Orbison.

				MS. HELLER
			(getting impatient)
		Focus. This is for Thanksgiving.
		Now think hard - what are you all
		thankful for?

Nobody really cares - except for Lloyd and Harry who think hard. Lewis
has Toby's wallet and takes cash out.

				LLOYD
			(calls out)
		George Washington!

				HARRY
		Who?

				LLOYD
			(pointing to the dollar
		bill that Lewis has)
		Hello, he only invented money!

TOBY takes his wallet back and SMACKS Lewis.

				MS. HELLER
		That's not bad. How about a float
		of George Washington crossing the
		Delaware?

				LLOYD
		Or maybe crossing a river!

				HARRY
		Like the Atlantic!

				MS. HELLER
		So it's settled.

				TOBY
		You mean we have to parade around
		in front of everyone?

				TURK
		On a float of George Washington?

				LLOYD
		This is gonna be the best
		Thanksgiving ever!

				TERRI
		We're gonna look like idiots.

				MS. HELLER
		Exactly.

				TOBY
		No way.

				MS. HELLER
		Did I mention if you don't make a
		float, there'll be no Special Needs
		class next semester?

LLOYD and Harry look horrified.

				MS. HELLER (cont'd)
		Which means back to homework, real
		grades and actually having to
		attend class.

This sinks in for a beat, then as one they all run out.

EXT. FLOAT BUILDING MONTAGE - DAY

We hear the theme from the "A-Team" re-mixed with an Eban Schletter
brass section. We see some quick smash cuts of the individual kids
grabbing the pieces that will make up the float. They include: HANDS
grab tools off of the tractor shed's wall.

EXTREME CLOSE-UP of a hammer driving nails.

EXTREME ANGLE on a wood saw cutting through wood. TURK rips out some
heating duct, hands it down to Ching Chong.

EXTREME CLOSE-UP of a paint brush painting on wood. LLOYD carrying
rolls of toilet paper from a supply room - trailing a piece from his
pants, err - I mean, poophole. CARL does a rush towards a chicken wire
fence - pulling it out around him. LEWIS, TOBY and TERRI roll him up in
it like it's a rug and sneakily walk away.

CLOSE ON the famous painting, "Washington Crossing the Delaware". Lewis
lowers the print TO REVEAL a pretty decent replica of the picture - now
done as a parade float. The whole class congratulates themselves.

INT. PRINCIPAL COLLINS' CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Collins is driving with Jessica in his snazzy Olds Cutlass.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		You had some questions.

				JESSICA
		Last year Toby was in A.P. English.
		And Lewis won the Science Fair.
		What are they doing in Special
		Needs?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Poor question. Too wordy. A good
		question gets right to the point.
		Example, where's my chest?

				JESSICA
		I don't know what you're talking
		about.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Oh I think you do.

He clicks the automatic locks click as the car makes a turn.

				JESSICA
			(scared)
		My parents are going to wonder
		where I am.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		One phone call from the principal
		will take care of that, my dear.

EXT. BIG 'A' GAS N' STUFF - MOMENTS LATER

PRINCIPAL COLLINS is on a pay-phone while Jessica sits in his car
outside.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
			(doing a high- pitched
		girl's voice)
		Hello? It's me, Brenda. Jessica's
		friend. She wanted me to call you
		and tell you we're going to the
		liberry... yes - Brenda...

INT. BIG 'A' GAS N' STUFF - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON slushee machine.

EXT. BIG 'A' GAS N' STUFF - CONTINUOUS

HARRY and Lloyd stand outside the store, eyeing the slushee machine
inside. They're drooling like dogs.

				LLOYD
		Wow, we built a whole float in one
		afternoon. And now the reward.

				HARRY
		What do you mean? We can't go in
		there or we'll be "it".

CALE, appears next to the slushee machine and looks out at HARRY and
Lloyd. He rubs the machine sexily and gives them a "you want it? Come
and get it" look.

				HARRY (cont'd)
		What's so bad about being "it"?

				LLOYD
		If you have to ask, you don't know.

				HARRY
		Yeah, that's why I asked.

				LLOYD
		You certainly did.

				HARRY
		I know I did.

				LLOYD
		Sorry, no further questions.

A TEN YEAR-OLD KID walks out of the store.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		Hey, kid, you wanna make two
		dollars?

				TEN YEAR-OLD KID
		Sure.

				LLOYD
		Go in there and get us two
		slushees.

				TEN YEAR-OLD KID
		Okay.

				LLOYD
		Do we have a deal?

				TEN YEAR-OLD KID
		Yeah, deal. Give me the two
		dollars.

				LLOYD
		Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych!
		But a deal's a deal, my friend. In
		you go.

				TEN YEAR-OLD KID
		Fine. Give me the doll hairs.

				LLOYD
		Uh-oh. Harry?

HARRY shakes his head.

				TEN YEAR-OLD KID
		A deal's a deal.

				HARRY
		Would you take five bucks instead?

HARRY hands him five bucks and the kid runs inside. Harry and Lloyd
high-five. They watch as the kid walks into the store and ask for two
slushees.

EXT. BIG 'A' GAS N' STUFF - MOMENTS LATER

PRINCIPAL COLLINS is still on the pay-phone while Jessica sits in his
car outside.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
			(still doing the high-
		pitched girl's voice)
		Yes Mrs. Matthews, we have lots of
		studying to do so we're going to
		pull an all nighter... No, we're
		not meeting boys. If only.

EXT. BIG 'A' GAS N' STUFF - CONTINUOUS

The kid comes out holding two slushees. He hands them to HARRY and
Lloyd.

				HARRY/LLOYD
		Slushee!/ Yum!

LLOYD and Harry look at Cale through the glass and make a big scene to
let him know they got slushees from him without having to go inside.
They do a big "we-have-slushees-and-wedidn't- have-to-go-inside" dance.

				TEN YEAR-OLD KID
		That guy told me to give you this.

He tags Harry.

				TEN YEAR-OLD KID (cont'd)
		You're it.

				HARRY/LLOYD
		Awww./ Nooo.

CALE laughs at them from inside. He gives them the famous "you're-it-
now-buttheads" dance.

				TEN YEAR-OLD KID
		And grow up.

The kid starts to walk off.

				LLOYD
		He said that?

Over his shoulder--

				TEN YEAR-OLD KID
		No, that's from me.

And he's gone. Harry and Lloyd watch him go for a beat. Then, Harry
tags Lloyd.

				HARRY
		You're it.

				LLOYD
		Am not.

				HARRY
		Are, too.

				LLOYD
		D2.

HARRY's about to take a big drink. Lloyd stops him.

				HARRY
		It's okay. I want the rush.

				LLOYD
		No. Look.

LLOYD points to Jessica, sitting alone in Collins' parked car.

				HARRY
		Hey, it's Jessica.

				LLOYD
		That must be her boyfriend's car.

They see Principal Collins hang up the phone, walk over to the car and
get in.

LLOYD (cont'd) Look, it's Principal Collins!

HARRY and Lloyd look at each other.

				HARRY
		PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!

				LLOYD
		Now it makes total sense why she
		didn't want him to know we were in
		his office the other night.

Collins starts up the car.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		Don't let him see us.

HARRY and Lloyd run over to the gas pumps and try to hide by looking
nonchalant.

Over the following, Harry pumps gas into a side window of a car while
Lloyd actually sprays gas all over the windshield.

				HARRY
		No wonder we both struck out with
		her. Who can compete with the
		sexual power of the man who
		occupies the highest office in the
		land?

				LLOYD
		He's like the Pope. Like we're
		gonna snake a girl away from the
		Pope.

				HARRY
		Hey, let's go spy on them.

Collins backs out of the gas station. Harry and Lloyd put the gas pumps
back. Lloyd jumps in a shopping cart and Harry starts pushing. Cale
comes out of the store, takes a drag of his cigarette and gets in his
car (the car Harry and Lloyd gassed up and in).

EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

HARRY and Lloyd have wheeled after Collins, when a huge explosion
erupts. The gas pumps are now a ball of fire.

HARRY and Lloyd stop, look back and stare. From above, Cale flies into
frame, landing right in front of them.

				HARRY
		Oh my god, are you alright?

				CALE
		Yeah, I think.

LLOYD leans down and pokes him.

				LLOYD
		You're it!
			(to Harry)
		Come on Harry, let's go.

				CALE
		Hey! That's my shopping cart!

The boys race off in the cart, down the street, following Collins.

INT. PRINCIPAL COLLINS CAR - CONTINUOUS

They are oblivious to the explosion behind them.

				JESSICA
		So what did you say to my parents
		on the phone?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Not to expect you tonight.

Through the rear window WE SEE Harry and Lloyd roll up in the cart and
crouch down.

EXT. CITY STREET - SAME TIME

HARRY and Lloyd grab on to the rear bumper of the car and hang on as
Collins drives on.

EXT CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER

HARRY and Lloyd riding Collins' car through the streets. They swing out
into the street and almost crash head-on into a FIRE TRUCK with a
DALMATION riding on top. They turn back and watch it go away.

				HARRY
		Cute puppy.

				LLOYD
		He must be on his way to pee out a
		fire.

Up ahead, they see a 'MR. SOFTEE' ICE CREAM TRUCK with a softserve cone
on top.

				HARRY
		Hey, look. Ice cream.

				LLOYD
		You thinking what I'm thinking?

As Collins' car stops for a red light, the boys race through the
intersection and grab a hold of the ice cream truck.

INT. MR. SOFTEE ICE CREAM TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

We see that the DRIVER has no idea what's going on.

EXT. ANOTHER CITY STREET - A LITTLE LATER

The boys are at the side window of the ice cream truck, now each
holding ice cream cones.

				LLOYD
		Hey Harry, want dessert!

They SPLIT OFF from the ice cream truck. CUT TO:

INT./EXT. COLEY DOG - HOT DOG CAR - CONTINUOUS TIGHT ON the Hot Dog
ship's Captain then BOOM OUT to see it's actually a Hot Dog car and the
Boy's are at the back eating dogs that are covered in ketchup and
mustard. Happy as can be they all motor off down the road.

INT. COLLINS'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		I'm going to ask you one last time
		and if I don't get an answer, I
		don't even want to think about the
		consequences which would be
		frightening to say the least.
		Where's my chest, Jessica?

				JESSICA
		I don't know what you're talking
		about.

Collins empties out Jessica's backpack. He holds up a tape.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Well, what have we here? It
		appears be a tape.

				JESSICA
		That's not your tape.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Then where did you get this not my
		tape.

				JESSICA
		THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Don't play with me dear, you're way
		out of your league.

Collins exits with the tape.

EXT. COLLINS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

HARRY and Lloyd road weary and wind blown, approach the house. They
peek in a window and see the back of Jessica's head. She's alone in the
room. Harry taps on the window.

				HARRY
		JESSICA!

JESSICA turns, sees Harry and Lloyd outside the window. They are a mess
- covered in ice cream, ketchup and mustard.

				JESSICA
		HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.

				LLOYD
			(debonair)
		Looks like the best man won.

				HARRY
		Why didn't you tell us your
		boyfriend was Principal Collins?

				JESSICA
		What? No! Look.

She holds up her hand which is handcuffed to the table.

				HARRY/LLOYD
		Kinky!

Suddenly they hear the sound of Lloyd's mix tape.

				LLOYD
		Hey, that's my mix tape! You're
		using it for your seduction? I'm
		flattered.

INT. COLLINS STUDY - CONTINUOUS

Collins is at a tape recorder, looking very confused at LLOYD's
singing. He presses fast forward and is annoyed when all he hears is
Lloyd's rambling.

				LLOYD
		... If I may quote the twentieth
		century poet
			(mispronounces 'Piscopo')
		- Joe Piscahpo:
			(Like Billy Crystal)
		You look Marvelous...

INT. COLLINS LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

				JESSICA
		LLOYD, when we were in Principal
		Collins's office, did you see any
		kind of chest?

				LLOYD
		HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I
		know where that is.

				HARRY
		You found my treasure? Why didn't
		you tell me.

				LLOYD
		Three words. I did. But you were
		all mad at me and wouldn't listen.

				HARRY
		Well, I'm listening now.

				LLOYD
		Me, too. This is my favorite part
		of the tape.

LLOYD bops along as he listens to his mix tape.

				JESSICA
		HARRY, Lloyd, listen to me. I only
		have time to say this once.
		Collins is a criminal. He's
		kidnapped me. The evidence you
		need to convict him is in that
		chest. You've got to take what's
		in that chest and make sure people
		know about it before the parade
		tomorrow and Collins and Heller get
		their money and leave town...

The boys hear none of this. We hear their thoughts as their minds
wander.

				LLOYD (V.O.)
		God she's cute. Look at her teeth.
		I bet she could bite through
		anything. Yes, yes she could.

JESSICA sees Lloyd nodding like he's paying attention. She looks at
Harry, who's also nodding.

				HARRY (V.O.)
		I wonder what Lloyd's thinking
		about?

			(Harry glances over at

				LLOYD, then back at

				JESSICA)
		Look at all that hair. She must
		have millions of tiny holes in her
		head. Otherwise it would just
		bunch all up on her brain...

				JESSICA
		So guys, you listening to me?

				HARRY/LLOYD
		Yeah./ Sure.

				JESSICA
		Remember, before the parade.

				HARRY/LLOYD
		Right, right. The parade.

Just then Ms. Heller ENTERS in the background with some SUITCASES.

				HARRY
		Hey look, it's our teacher.

				JESSICA
		Of course, she's in on it too.
		Don't let her see you. Just go get
		that chest and show the world what
		Collins has been doing. I'm staying
		here.

				LLOYD
			(lewdly)
		Obviously.

				MS. HELLER
			(calls out to Jessica)
		So miss snoopy reporter girl, it
		appears that you've snooped
		yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed
		yourself to a desk. Whose
		wearing the Coconut bra now?

JESSICA just stares at her.

				MRS. HELLER
		Well I just have one word for you.
		Aloha. The one that means goodbye!

With confidence, Heller heads off down the hallway.

				JESSICA
			(to Harry and Lloyd)
		Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
		I can take care of myself and I'm
		getting the story every high school
		reporter dreams of.

				LLOYD
			(to Harry)
		"My dream date with Principal
		Collins."

				HARRY
		I wish I was the one writing that
		story.

INT. SPECIAL NEEDS CLASSROOM - DAY

TIGHT ON the lock as Lloyd is about to break it. Harry stops him.

				HARRY
		You know Lloyd, the real treasure
		is our friendship.

				LLOYD
		How true. But I still feel I
		deserve more than you do of this
		treasure. I mean, I found it.

				HARRY
		But my mom gave me the map.

				LLOYD
		I lugged it all over town!

				HARRY
		I made the polar bear pants.

				LLOYD
		But I ate your Mom's pie.

				HARRY
			(struggling)
		I... found that rock.

				LLOYD
		It was a diamond and you swallowed
		it.

				HARRY

		We were all out of top hats.

				LLOYD
		Enough! Look what this cursed
		chest is doing to us.

				HARRY
		I don't know who we are anymore.

TIGHT ON the trunk. Lloyd breaks the lock. They open the chest, MUSIC
SWELLS. WE SEE a shot of Collins' incriminating files, photos, etc.

				HARRY (cont'd)
		What is all this?

				LLOYD
		I have no idea - it's full of files
		and documents and tapes.

				HARRY
		Do you know what this means?

				HARRY/LLOYD
			(ecstatic)
		We're rich!

They take the chest contents and throw it like gold coins.

				LLOYD
		Buddy, we hit the jackpot!

INT. SPECIAL NEEDS CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

HARRY and Lloyd rolling around in the papers and rubbing them all over
their bodies. Harry picks up a casette tape.

				HARRY
		Hey Lloyd. This looks like
		another one of your mix tapes.

				LLOYD
		Maybe the pirate who buried this
		treasure chest made it. Put it on.

HARRY sticks the tape in a player.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (O.S.)
		Principal's log, September twenty
		third. Check, check, sound check,
		check.

				HARRY
		Hey, it's Principal Collins.

				LLOYD
		That makes total sense. The
		treasure chest was in his office.
		Which means Principal Collins is a
		pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob
		never mentioned him.

				HARRY
		That's because Captain Rob is not a
		pirate. We've been through this.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (O.S.)
		Testing, testing, one two three...

				HARRY
		Boy, his mix tape really isn't as
		good as yours, Lloyd.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (O.S.)
		Check, check, check, check...

				HARRY
		Although he speaks pretty good
		Chinese.

				LLOYD
		That's not Chinese.

LLOYD fast forwards the tape. We hear FAST FORWARD NOISE.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		That's Chinese.

LLOYD presses play again.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (O.S.)
		... Find idiots for phony Special
		Needs class, take the Moffit grant
		money and deposit it in an illegal
		personal account...

				LLOYD
		Hmm, I don't get it.

				HARRY
		What was it Jessica wanted us to do
		with this chest again?

				LLOYD
		Something about showing the world
		what Principal Collins has done.

				HARRY
		Right. She's so proud of her
		boyfriend.

LLOYD fast forwards a little more.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS (O.S.)
		... And that is how I, Principal
		Collins, became the mastermind
		behind this glorious plan. And the
		Special Needs brats don't know
		anything about it. It's the crime
		of the century.

				LLOYD
		He's right. We have committed the
		crime of the century.

				HARRY
		What? What did we do?

				LLOYD
		We never thanked him for giving us
		our Special Needs class.

				HARRY
			(eureka!)
		That's what Jessica was talking
		about!

				LLOYD
		She wants us to show the world what
		a great guy Principal Collins is.

				HARRY
		And like she said, do it before the
		parade.

LLOYD sees the poor chalk drawing of a float on the blackboard that
Heller left.

				LLOYD
		A float!

				HARRY
		That's it. Build him a float for
		the Thanksgiving Day parade!

LLOYD starts's modifying the float-sketch - it's scribble.

				LLOYD
		HARRY, we found the real thing to
		be thankful for. Screw George
		Washington!

				HARRY
		Yes. Screw George Washington. Just
		like Marilyn Monroe did.

INT. TRACTOR SHED - THAT NIGHT

The doors open to REVEAL we're inside the darkened room as the overhead
door slides open revealing Harry and Lloyd, hands on hips, ready to
work.

				HARRY
		Ready Lloyd?

				LLOYD
		Put a fork in me Harry, lets get
		started.

LLOYD hits the lights to REVEAL the float of George Washington built by
the Special Needs class. Lloyd picks up a sledgehammer.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		Good bye, George Washington, hello
		PRINCIPAL COLLINS.

HARRY stops him.

				HARRY
		Wait a minute! Have you ever
		noticed Principal Collins looks a
		little like George Washington?

HARRY holds us a photo of Collins.

				LLOYD
		No. I think he looks a lot like
		George Washington.

LLOYD starts to swing his hammer. Harry stops him.

				HARRY
		Wait, wait!

				LLOYD
		HARRY, are we gonna build this
		thing or not?

				HARRY
		LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may
		already have what we want.

LLOYD takes a long look at Collins' photo, then at Washington's head.
He smiles at Harry.

				LLOYD
		Oh. I get it now.

Once again he raises his hammer to take another swing, and HARRY
restrains him, the two share an awkward moment.

EXT. SCHOOL STADIUM - NEXT MORNING

We start CLOSE ON a small aquarium that has been all taped together
(from the bus chase), the NEBBISH GUY stands nearby as we BOOM UP past
a MIDWAY CARNIVAL to see the High School's Thanksgiving Day parade is
in progress. The bleachers are full of students and townspeople
watching. Cheerleaders carry a banner reading, "PROVIDENCE HILL HIGH
SCHOOL THANKSGIVING 1986".

EXT. BLEACHERS - CONTINUOUS

PRINCIPAL COLLINS is nervously watching. Heller approaches and sits
down next to him.

				MS. HELLER
		So the chest is still out there
		somewhere.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows
		up, we'll get our check and blow
		this pop stand before anyone finds
		out anything.

				MS. HELLER
			(looking at parade)
		This band sounds terrible.

We see the marching band playing instruments that are old, damaged or
home made.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		I sold all the wind instruments.
			(holds up tickets)
		Hawaiian Air, business class. And
		you like that new fur coat?

				MS. HELLER
		Love it!

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Well there's a reason why that
		mascot isn't a stallion anymore.

In front of a MARCHING BAND is a boy leading a goat, holding a flag
reading "GO STALLIONS!"

				MS. HELLER
		This is horse?

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		No... no it's not horse, you see I
		sold the horse.

Behind the boy, Ray is driving a Cadillac convertible, waving at the
crowd. A sign on the car reads "Custodian of the Year". And an ad that
READS: 'Buy Original Ray's WAX - made from real ketchup and mustard!'

EXT. TRACTOR SHED - CONTINUOUS

				TOBY (O.S.)
		What the hell?

INT. TRACTOR SHED - CONTINUOUS

We HEAR THE MARCHING BAND in the distance, as the Special needs
students, Toby, Terri, Carl, Turk, Ching Chong and LEWIS are looking up
in disbelief.

				TURK
		What'd you morons do? Where's
		George Washington?

				TERRI
		Yeah, why'd you give him a
		makeover?

REVEAL Harry and Lloyd putting the finishing touches on the NEW FLOAT.
They've RE-SCULPTED "Washington crossing the Delaware" into "Principal
Collins the Pirate". With his statue now on a PIRATE SHIP.

This is all made from found objects that were in the Special Needs
class and tractor shed. The statue's glasses are made from shovels and
George Washington's white hair is now black and he has bushy black
eyebrows matching Collins. Just then Lewis enters wearing the tattered
old horse mascot uniform and carrying the head. Half his hair is cut
close and tattered.

				LEWIS
		Sorry I'm late but I woke up tied
		to the bed and...

He see's Washington/Collins eyebrows.

				LEWIS (cont'd)
		Hey - that's my hair! Someone cut
		it while I slept!

HARRY and Lloyd 'act casual' whistle and look around. The kids walk
closer in towards the float and we see: Washington's/Collins'
outstretched hand has been replaced with a pirate's hook fashioned from
the heating duct. There's a large sign that reads, "PRINCIPAL = PIRATE"
and the original treasure chest is now prominently displayed as part of
the float. The whole thing is attached to Lloyd's waxer with a rope.
Harry and Lloyd walk to the side of the boat

				HARRY
		Guys, this is much better.

				LLOYD
		PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater
		American than George Washington
		will ever be.

				TURK
		I don't get it. Why'd you make him
		a pirate?

				CHING CHONG (O.S.)
			(breaks the silence)
		I'll tell you why!

Reveal Ching Chong at the treasure chest looking through it. For the
first time Ching Chong speaks in a perfect American Accent.

				CHING CHONG (cont'd)
		You won't believe these documents.
		They provide evidence of a long
		history of fraud and embezzlement
		from the school by Principal
		Collins and Ms. Heller, a.k.a. the
		Lunch Lady.

				HARRY
		Oh my god. Can you believe your
		ears?

				LLOYD
		Yeah! No more clicks and whistles!
		Now she speaks perfect English!

				HARRY
		You're a great teacher, Lloyd.

TURK approaches Ching Chong.

				TURK
			(saddened)
		CHING CHONG, What happened to your
		beautiful Asian accent?

				CHING CHONG
			(no accent)
		Actually, my name is Cindy, the
		accent just helps me meet boys.

She notices Turk's sad face.

				CHING CHONG (cont'd)
		You want it back - you got it Joe!

TURK brightens and hugs her as they join the others who are now
examining the documents.

				TOBY
		We got state money for a ski club?
		We never had a ski club.

				TERRI
		Collins took two thousand dollars
		that was supposed to go to a new
		state of the art stallion mascot
		uniform.

				LEWIS
		I never saw that. Why have I been
		wearing this one with puke in the
		head?

				TURK
		We've gotta tell people about
		Collins.

EXT. SCHOOL BUILDING - STREET ADJACENT - DAY

A small GROUP of students rush by as Police Detective Moffit (Dana
Gould) gets out of his UNMARKED POLICE CAR. School Superintendent
ZIMMER APPROACHES.

				ZIMMER
		I'm not sure if I can do this.

				MOFFIT
		Sure you can. We gotta nail this
		guy. You'll be fine.

				ZIMMER
		Collins can be a pretty crafty guy,
		what do I do if he smells the trap.

				MOFFIT
			(as he hides his badge)
		I don't think he'll smell anything -
		just make sure he takes the check.
		I've been through this a hundred
		times.

				ZIMMER
		Well you know Detective, he's
		expecting
			(fingers in quotes)
		'Moffit' to be someone who has...
		certain... well...

				MOFFIT
			(interrupts him)
		Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I
		studied acting at the police
		academy just let me do the talking
		and you'll be fine.

ZIMMER walks off and is followed by Moffit.

EXT. BLEACHERS CONTINUOUS - DAY

SUPERINTENDENT ROGER ZIMMER approaches Principal Collins.

				SUPERINTENDANT ZIMMER
		PRINCIPAL COLLINS.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Ah, Superintendent Zimmer, hello.

			(MORE)

				SUPERINTENDANT ZIMMER
		I'd like to introduce you to
		Richard Moffit - former Special
		Needs student and now American
		success story.

He gestures to MR. MOFFIT, who is mid 30's. Collins notices that he's
only wearing one shoe, the other foot is bare.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
			(to Zimmer)
		It seems Mr. Moffit has forgotten
		his shoe.

				SUPERINTENDANT ZIMMER
			(shrugs, then quietly)
		What're you gonna do. At least
		today he remembered his pants.
			(then, to Moffit)
		Richard, this is Principal Collins.

PRINCIPAL COLLINS takes Moffit's hand and shakes it - doesn't let go -
Collins sees a folded paper in his pocket (check?).

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Mr. Moffit, it's a great pleasure
		to meet you sir. And is that what I
		think it is...?

MOFFIT pulls the paper out of his pocket, it is a CHILD LIKE DRAWING OF
AN AIRPLANE.

				MOFFIT
		Yes! I drew this.

Collins looks at Zimmer. Zimmer puts hands in air as 'quotes'.

				ZIMMER
			(whispers)
		Special Needs.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Aren't you going to present to the
		grant check today.

				MOFFIT
			(interrupting)
		I am strong!

				ZIMMER
			(to Moffit)
		Yes you are.
			(to Collins)

				ZIMMER(cont'd)
		I think Mr. Moffit is looking
		forward to seeing the float from
		your Special Needs class first.

He pats an envelope in his breast pocket. Principal Collins stares at
the envelope.

				MOFFIT
		I can turn on all the faucets in my
		house.
			(close to Collins)
		Even the hose.

				ZIMMER
			(to Moffit)
		But we don't drink from the house
		do we.

Collins reacts uncomfortably to all this...

ANGLE ON a few other floats and a band pass.

CLOSE-ON MARGIE the bus driver.

				MARGIE
			(leaning out window)
		Move it will ya! C'mon I got better
		things to do.

REVEAL she's driving the SPECIAL NEEDS BUS that is now PULLING the
SPECIAL NEEDS FLOAT - with the ENTIRE CLASS riding it. She's yelling at
the band ahead of her.

				MS. HELLER
		Oh, here it comes. You're gonna
		love what the children have done.

CLOSE ON Harry and Lloyd on the float.

				HARRY
		Start the tape, Lloyd.

				LLOYD
		Roger that, Wilco.

HARRY grabs two rods which are attached to the Collins float head and
operates the mouth. Lloyd hits a tape recorder button and Collins'
voice comes booming out of speakers.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS VOICE (O.S.)
		I found a way to bilk enough money
		from the school to put us over the
		top.

ANGLE ON: Principal Collins and the others in the bleachers.

				MOFFIT
			(pulls his jacket)
		That sounds like you!

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		Oh my God. They got the chest!

				SUPERINTENDANT ZIMMER
		Is that a float of you, Collins?
		Why are you a pirate?

BACK TO FLOAT where we continue to hear Collins' voice blare from the
speakers that ARE ATTACHED TO THE FLOAT.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS VOICE (O.S.)
		We've done it all. Trilingual
		education... twelve hundred dollars
		for fake mock government... twelve
		hundred charging tuition...

Just then police cars zoom up and screech to a halt. TWO POLICE
OFFICERS jump out with Jessica.

				HARRY
		Oh, good. There's Jessica.

				LLOYD
		How could she miss this? This
		whole salute to Collins was her
		idea.

ANGLE ON bleachers again.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
		I don't know what those kids are
		doing. Nothing they do makes any
		sense. That's why we started the
		Special Needs class.
			(sees police)
		And that's why we need that check!

Collins grabs the check...

ANGLE ON The float. Harry and Lloyd see Collins running away.

				HARRY
		Hey there goes Principal Collins!

				LLOYD
		He's so modest. Probably
		embarrassed by all the attention.

				HARRY
		Well, that's too bad, this is his
		day.

Collins sees the police coming from the other direction, so he turns
around and starts running back - towards the float.

				HARRY (cont'd)
		Oh, good, he's reconsidered.

HARRY waves at Jessica, dropping the hydraulic rod connected to the
pirate hook. Just then, Collins runs by, and get's caught up on the
hook. HARRY resumes his rod motion - which raises Collins into the air.
Held only by the back of his jacket. REVEAL Collins - now DANGLING FROM
THE HOOK of the Pirate Collins float. HELLER SEES this and tries to
make a hasty retreat out the back, turns face to face with Jessica and
a BURLY POLICEMAN.

				HELLER
			(casually)
		Oh, hello Jessica.

				JESSICA
		Now who's going to be handcuffed?

Heller makes a feeble attempt to run, but the Cop easily picks her up,
as Jessica heads towards the boys.

ANGLE back on Collins still struggling on the hook.

				PRINCIPAL COLLINS
			(yelling)
		I did it all for the children...

The crowd laughs and points. Moffit acts as if he got free pickles in
his ice cream.

				MOFFIT
		This is the best parade ever!

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. POLICE CAR - A HALF HOUR LATER

JESSICA and all of the SPECIAL NEEDS KIDS watch as a handcuffed Collins
and Ms. Heller are put in a police car.

				JESSICA
		He's going to be in jail for a long
		time.

				LLOYD
		Principal of jail. Wow. What a
		promotion.

				HARRY
		Those inmates are lucky!

				JESSICA'S BOYFRIEND O.S.
		JESSICA!

JESSICA turns and see's her boyfriend.

				JESSICA
			(to Harry and Lloyd)
		See you guys later.

She runs off to her great-looking jock boyfriend.

				HARRY
		Oh my God! She's two-timing
		PRINCIPAL COLLINS!

				LLOYD
		And with that complete loser

JESSICA and her boyfriend run off.

EXT. STREET/SCHOOL ADJACENT - MOMENTS LATER

The boy's walk away from a school parking lot.

				LLOYD
		Ya know Harry, I think this whole
		experience has soured me on women.

				HARRY
		Yeah, we should never let a woman
		come between us again.

				LLOYD
		I don't think that'll happen.
		We've learned a valuable lesson we
		won't ever forget.

They hear a loud honk, turn to see a COOL 4 SEATER SPORTS CAR with TWO
HOT IDENTICAL TWIN GIRLS in matching sexy outfits.

				FRIEDA
		Excuse us... You're Harry and Lloyd
		right?

				HARRY
		Actually, I'm Harry and he's Lloyd.

				FRIEDA
		Well, we're the Felchers. My
		name's Freida and this is Rita.

				RITA
		We're going to go check out the all
		girl's college. Do you guys want
		to come?

				HARRY
		Sure!

HARRY steps forward, but is quickly stopped by Lloyd.

				LLOYD
			(whispers to Harry)
		Hold up. First, we have to decide
		who gets who, remember? No more
		competition?

				HARRY
			(steps back)
		Right.

				LLOYD
		Okay. Which one do you want?

HARRY checks out the IDENTICAL twin hotties.

				HARRY
		The one on the left.

				LLOYD
		Damn! What are the odds?

				HARRY
		What?

				LLOYD
		That's the one I wanted.

They both look at the girls, as WE PAN from one to another. There's not
a difference between them.

				HARRY
		She's one of a kind.

				LLOYD
		Try one in a million!

				HARRY
		Well, what should we do?

LLOYD takes a beat figuring it out.

				LLOYD
		You take her.

				HARRY
			(firm)
		No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm
		not going to do it.

LLOYD takes a moment to figure it all out. Then makes the decision.

				LLOYD
			(to the girls)
		Look, why don't you girls go on
		without us okay?

HARRY smiles. The girls look confused. LLOYD walks closer to the girl
on the left (in the passenger seat).

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		You may find a great guy like Harry
		someday - but I wouldn't count on
		it.
			(glance at the other girl -
		quickly)
		Oh, and I'm sure you're friend here
		is real sweet too.

Hearing this, the girls are miffed, and speed away. The back tire spins
up the GUTTER FULL OF MUD.

				HARRY
		Thanks Lloyd. You're always
		looking out for me.

LLOYD sees the mud coming his way.

				LLOYD
		Look out!

LLOYD jumps out of the way PULLING HARRY IN FRONT of him.

HARRY's upper body get's soaked in the MUDDY, POO-LIKE COATING. LLOYD
peeks out from behind muddy Harry.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		Phew, that was close...

HARRY - turns away, stepping into the street to wipe the mud from his
face.

HARRY starts to reply when he is HIT BY A CAR! Knocked out of frame.

SMASH CUT TO:

HARRY screaming - seen through the windshield of the car that hit him.
The car comes to a rapid stop, as Harry holds on to the windshield
wipers - his face pressed up tightly against the glass. Still covered
in wet mud - He open's his eyes.

				HARRY
		Charlie?

REVEAL it's JESSICA'S DAD (Bob Saget)! Who can't help but be freaked
out by the shit covered loser attached to his windshield. So HE
SCREAMS.

				JESSICA'S DAD
		Not you! Not again! Look what
		you've done! There's shit all over
		my car!

HARRY gets off the car as Lloyd APPROACHES.

				HARRY
		Sorry, Charlie.

				LLOYD
		Hey, where'd you go?

They see Jessica's Dad freaking out in the car as they start to walk
away.

				LLOYD (cont'd)
		What's with him?

				HARRY
		Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she
		said he's really anal.

				LLOYD
		That's gross.

				HARRY
		I know.

As we fade out, Jessica's Dad continues to scream about his shit-
covered car.

THE END
