</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. TRAINING GROUND/ WESTMINSTER barracks/ LONDON - Day.
</p><p><p ID="act">Through a veil of dust we see two lines of uniformed cavalry, stretched out across the parade ground. There's a tense silence except for the occasional flourish of hooves. A horseman steps out of each line. 
</p><p><p ID="act">LIEUTENANTS HARRY FEVERSHAM and JOHN DURRANCE face each other across the wide expanse. Already we feel the keen sense of competition between them. DURRANCE raises his sabre first. His horse sets off at a slow trot. His troops follow in perfect time. HARRY waits a moment, then raises his own sword. A sea of sabres rises up in response. 
</p><p><p ID="act">The two lines approach each other at a steady canter. A smile of anticipation lights up DURRANCE's face. He's a born soldier, enjoying himself. HARRY looks more nervous. He's not as easy as Durrance in the saddle. It's a skill he's acquired over the years rather than been born to.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE seems to sense Harry's doubt. With a loud whoop he kicks his horse into a gallop and points his sabre forwards. His troops echo his war cry and descend on the opposing line at speed. HARRY checks his troops and responds. The two lines bear down on each other, hooves thundering, sabres pointed. 
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE charges recklessly. His eyes are fixed on Harry all the time. HARRY holds his gaze, but doesn't look as sure of himself. He's thinking too much, trying too hard. His horse senses it and slows a fraction. The troops behind him lose their cohesion as they draw level. 
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE sees the momentary lapse and waves his men on at full tilt. They pass through HARRY's troops in a perfect line, panicking their mounts, cheering triumphantly. HARRY's formation loses its shape. There's no doubt who's won the drill. DURRANCE wheels his horse around and grins at HARRY through the clouds of dust.
</p><p><p ID="act">CREDITS ROLL. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. Changing room/ WESTMINSTER BARRACKS - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">Moving through clouds of steam we see the CAVALRY OFFICERS washing themselves in wooden bathtubs. There's a din of voices, soldiers re-living the day's drill, those on Durrance's side still crowing over their victory.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE walks with his arm around HARRY. With them is another friend, LIEUTENANT TRENCH, a squat bull of a man.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">...How many does that make it Harry?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">It's not something I count.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">How many Trench?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">Trench can't count.
</p><p><p ID="act">TRENCH grabs HARRY in a neck hold. He lets go as he spots another friend of theirs, LIEUTENANT CASTELTON, sitting in a bathtub, staring out. TRENCH sneaks up on CASTELTON, and ducks his head under the water. CASTELTON comes up, spluttering. He reaches for a bar of soap and hurls it after TRENCH.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CASTELTON
<P ID="dia">...Idiot.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. WILLOUGHBY's rooms/ barracks - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">A fifth friend, LIEUTENANT WILLOUGHBY, stares at himself in the mirror. His hair like his uniform is perfect. There's a loud knocking on his door.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">trench o/s
<P ID="dia">...Miss Willoughby, Miss Willoughby we're waiting.
</p><p><p ID="act">WILLOUGHBY finally stops preening himself as he hears his friends picking the lock. He gets up reluctantly, taking one last look at his reflection in the mirror.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. BARRACK GATES/ LONDON STREET - DAY.                                                 
</p><p><p ID="act">The OFFICERS pour out of the barrack gates in full regimental unifom, a sea of gleaming red. We pick out HARRY, DURRANCE, TRENCH, WILLOUGHBY, and CASTELTON, laughing amongst themselves, taking turns to tease each other, inseperable. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. carriage/ HAnsom cab/ london streets - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">The friends share a flask of whisky as they sit in the back of the carriage. WILLOUGHBY passes it on without taking a sip.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">Who are you planning to impress tonight?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">trench
<P ID="spkdir">(Grinning)
<P ID="dia">Anna What's-her-name.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Anna What's-her-name's father more like. Don't think we're going to take you any more seriously when you're promoted.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">wILLOUGHBY
<P ID="spkdir">(Quietly confident)
<P ID="dia">We'll see about that.
</p><p><p ID="act">A chorus of mocking 'ooohs' from the others. TRENCH notices CASTLETON staring out of the window. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">trench
<P ID="dia">What's so interesting about a London street?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CASTELTON
<P ID="spkdir">(Reflecting)
<P ID="dia">Ask me that when we're in Bombay.
</p><p><p ID="act">TRENCH rolls his eyes and turns to DURRANCE.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">treNCH
<P ID="dia">Is Ethne going to be there?
</p><p><p ID="act">We catch a hint of shyness in DURRANCE at the mention of Ethne's name.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I think so. 
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY watches DURRANCE, a little uncomfortably, as if he's holding something back.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. PARTY/ india office building/ london - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">CARRIAGES line the entrance to the India Office. INDIAN VALETS in turbans and robes escort the GUESTS to the entrance, holding umbrellas over them. 
</p><p><p ID="act">The five friends crowd under a single umbrella. WILLOUGHBY makes sure he's in the middle, he doesn't want to get his uniform wet. TRENCH nudges him into the rain.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. The Durbar court/ party/ INDIA office - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">Palm trees and fountains dominate the room. The ladies are dressed in ballgowns, the Officers in regimental colours. The full pomp and ceremony of Empire is on display. HARRY, DURRANCE, WILLOUGHBY, CASTELTON and TRENCH have  gathered by the bar, a little overawed by the occasion.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">trench
<P ID="spkdir">(Admiring the passing women)
<P ID="dia">I'm going to ask someone to dance.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">willoughby
<P ID="spkdir">(Admiring the passing Generals)
<P ID="dia">You said that ten minutes ago.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">trench
<P ID="dia">I'm waiting for Castelton.
</p><p><p ID="act">CASTELTON stares at the ARISTOCRATIC WOMEN, paralysed with shyness.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">trench 
<P ID="spkdir">(Pouring him another drink)
<P ID="dia">...Just look dreamy. I'll do the talking.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE smiles as he listens to them. He turns to HARRY.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Can you see Ethne?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">Not yet.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY seems uneasy again. We sense there's something on his mind, something he wants to tell Durrance. DURRANCE doesn't pick up on it. He finishes his whisky and looks back into the throng.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">WILLOUGHBY
<P ID="dia">Harry, your father...
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY looks away from DURRANCE. He sees his father, GENERAL FEVERSHAM, shaking hands with some COLLEAGUES across the room.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. seating area/ durbar court/ india office - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">GENERAL FEVERSHAM is deep in conversation with his friend, COLONEL SUTCH, a fellow veteran of the Crimean war. HARRY moves discreetly into their field of vision.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GENERAL FEVERSHAM
<P ID="spkdir">(His face lighting up)
<P ID="dia">Harry...
</p><p><p ID="act">Immediately we feel the bond between father and son. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="spkdir">(Greeting Colonel Sutch)
<P ID="dia">How are you Colonel?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH
<P ID="dia">Fine Harry. Relieved to see a few familiar faces. When are you boys shipping out?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">Next month.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH
<P ID="dia">Your father and I served in Bombay.  There are worse places they could have sent you.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">Yes Sir.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY smiles politely. SUTCH is sensitive enough to see that his mind is on other things. He lets father and son talk. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GENERAL FEVERSHAM
<P ID="dia">Is Ethne here?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">HARRY
<P ID="dia">Not yet.
</p><p><p ID="act">They both smile, as if they share a secret. GENERAL FEVERSHAM reaches out and straightens his son's collar, trying to make him look as presentable as possible.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. dance area/ the durbar court/ india office - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">TRENCH and CASTELTON are dancing with two GIRLS: TRENCH waltzing boisterously, CASTELTON taking it all very seriously. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. another area/ durbar court/ india office - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">WILLOUGHBY has found a place amongst a group of SENIOR OFFICERS. He stands next to COLONEL HAMILTON, the Commander of their regiment.  
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL HAMILTON
<P ID="dia">...If I had a choice we'd be on our way to the Sudan. Deal with this Dervish uprising once and for all.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">2nd colonel
<P ID="dia">You prefer a tour in the Sudan to India Willoughby?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">wILLOUGHBY
<P ID="dia">I don't know about that Sir, but I agree with Colonel Hamilton, we're going to have to fight the Mahdi sooner or later.  
</p><p><p ID="act">WILLOUGHBY trails off, leaving COLONEL HAMILTON to continue.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE downs another whisky. He looks less sure of himself in this social whirl than he did in the barracks. A few WOMEN cast admiring glances in his direction but he doesn't notice them. His eyes keep searching the crowd for Ethne.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. seating area/ durbar court/ india office - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY gazes through the crowd at DURRANCE. DURRANCE catches him staring and raises a glass. The two friends smile at each other.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. STAIRWAY/ india office - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">A group of late arrivals hurry up the stairs towards the party. ETHNE EUSTACE, is several steps ahead of her father DERMOD, and her friend, CAROLINE ADAIR, a young widow in her 30's. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ENTRANCE/ durbar court/ india office - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE's eyes search the crowd as soon as she walks through. She stops as she sees DURRANCE at the bar. Her eyes stay on him a moment, but it's only to see if Harry's nearby. When she realises he isn't she looks away. Finally she sees him, standing with GENERAL FEVERSHAM and COLONEL SUTCH. She takes her father DERMOD's hand, and leads him in their direction.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">CASTELTON and TRENCH are back at the bar, arguing.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CASTELTON
<P ID="dia">Your sole purpose in life is to annoy me.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">trench
<P ID="dia">She couldn't see me.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CASTELTON
<P ID="dia">I could see you. I can see you everywhere I look. Pulling those stupid faces at me.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">willoughby
<P ID="dia">Now Ladies.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE joins in the laughter but he seems distracted. He takes another gulp of whisky and looks around the crowd. His eyes stop as he sees ETHNE. A smile lights up his face, but it's short lived.
</p><p><p ID="act">Across the courtyard HARRY appears, greeting ETHNE. Their hands touch briefly.
</p><p><p ID="act">The noise fades in DURRANCE's head. He stares in silence. 
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY shakes DERMOD's hand warmly. DERMOD slaps him on the back, as if he's congratulating him. 
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE's eyes take in the smallest details now. Even though he can't hear a word, the scene before him reveals itself more and more clearly.
</p><p><p ID="act">COLONEL SUTCH raises his glass. GENERAL FEVERSHAM, DERMOD, and CAROLINE ADAIR respond. HARRY and ETHNE move closer, a little coyly, as if the toast is for them.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE looks pale. We feel the disappointment in his eyes as he realises what's happened. HARRY's arm moves around Ethne's waist, a libery that can only mean they're engaged. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. fountain area/ durbar court/ india office - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY and ETHNE glance at each other tenderly.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Did you tell them?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">I was waiting for you.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Not even Jack?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">Not even Jack.
</p><p><p ID="act">The two of them look towards DURRANCE for the first time.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE looks up as ETHNE and HARRY make their way through the crowd. He gathers himself, and walks towards them, concealing his feelings:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Congratulations. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">How did you know?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Nothing escapes me Harry...
<P ID="spkdir">(Kissing ETHNE on both cheeks)
<P ID="dia">I'm delighted for you both.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Harry wanted to tell you before anyone else. It's my fault. I asked him to wait.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I'll still blame him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="spkdir">(Relieved that his friend's taking it so well)
<P ID="dia">You were the one who introduced us.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Did I? I'll be more careful next time.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE takes HARRY in his arms, slapping him on the back. WILLOUGHBY, TRENCH, and CASTLETON appear behind them, realising something's up. DURRANCE turns to them, beaming:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Three guesses for Trench, one for everyone else.
</p><p><p ID="act">The friends let out a cheer as they realise what's happened. They crowd HARRY and ETHNE, congratulating them. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. DANCE area/ the durbar court/ india office - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">TRENCH sweeps HARRY and ETHNE towards the dancefloor.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">trench
<P ID="spkdir">(As if they have to dance in public as a punishment)
<P ID="dia">...Over there. Where we can see you. And remember you're not married yet.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY takes ETHNE in his arms. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="spkdir">(Smiling ironically)
<P ID="dia">Alone at last.
</p><p><p ID="act">TRENCH claps loudly as they dance. CASTLETON looks embarrassed by his friend. Behind them WILLOUGHBY congratulates DERMOD and GENERAL FEVERSHAM.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE watches the celebrations from the bar. He's smiling to himself, but it's the glazed smile of someone who's forcing himself to be happy. A quiet voice interrupts him:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CAROLINE o/s
<P ID="dia">Wonderful news isn't it?
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE turns around to see CAROLINE, Ethne's friend, gazing at him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(Smiling automatically)
<P ID="dia">Yes it is. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CAROLINE
<P ID="dia">Had Harry told you?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I knew it was just a matter of time.
<P ID="spkdir">(Changing the conversation)
<P ID="dia">What can I get you to drink?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CAROLINE
<P ID="dia">Nothing thank you. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(Nervous under her gaze)
<P ID="dia">I'd ask you to dance, only I'm not sure how steady I am on my feet. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CAROLINE
<P ID="spkdir">(With the quiet confidence of an older woman)
<P ID="dia">I'd love to dance.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE grins sheepishly, at a loss, as he is with most women.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. DANCE area/ the durbar court/ india office - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">The waltz is in full swing. All the friends are out on the dance floor. TRENCH spins his GIRL around energetically, exchanging glances with other women as they pass. CASTELTON stares into his partner's eyes, already in love. WILLOUGHBY dances with an elderly WOMAN, probably some General's wife. DURRANCE waltzes with CAROLINE, avoiding her meaningful glances, looking over her shoulder for Harry and Ethne.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. PARTY/ india office building/ london - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">The rain pours in torrents. HARRY and ETHNE stand in the shadows of the building. Harry tries to kiss her and hold an umbrella over her at the same time. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">What if I hold the umbrella?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">I'd have to kneel.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Nothing wrong with that.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY hands her the umbrella, bending under it. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="spkdir">(With irony as he kisses her more and more passionately)
<P ID="dia">You're very distant tonight.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harrY
<P ID="dia">I'm locked in a barracks room all day. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">What are you going to do in India?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harrY
<P ID="dia">Take you with me.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">A Hindu wedding?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">Why not.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Not on your life.
</p><p><p ID="act">She walks away with the umbrella, leaving him exposed in the rain. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">I want the full works. The Church near my home. A long speech from you. An entire regiment crossing swords. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="spkdir">(Drenched)
<P ID="dia">Done.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">I don't believe you.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY makes a rush and grabs her, eneveloping her in his arms.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">You're soaking wet.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">HARRY
<P ID="dia">Whose fault is that.
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE squirms but loses herself in his embrace. As they start to kiss they're suddenly interrupted by TRENCH's braying voice in the distance.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">trench o/s
<P ID="spkdir">(A regimental song)
<P ID="dia">Goodnight, Ladies...goodnight, Ladies...goodnight, Ladies, we hate to see you go...
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY shakes his head in despair. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">TRENCH, castelton, willoughby and durrance together o/s
<P ID="dia">Merrily we roll along, roll along, roll along...Merrily we roll along, until the morning comes...
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE smiles.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Duty calls. 
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY feels the quiet regret in her voice.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">We've two days leave before we sail. Once I tell them we're engaged I'm sure they'll give me more. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">As long as you promise to make me miserable. Argue with me all the time so I don't miss you a bit.
</p><p><p ID="act">Her lightness is forced. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harrY
<P ID="dia">You'll be fine.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">You don't have to reassure me. I'm a soldier's daughter. Everything under control. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">I've never kissed a stiff upper lip before.
</p><p><p ID="act">TRENCH's VOICE bellows out again as they kiss:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">trench o/s
<P ID="dia">Goodnight, Ethne's...goodnight, Harry's...Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight...
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRRY and ETHNE ignore him, the rain falling all around them.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. REGIMENTAL HALL/ WESTMINSTER BARRACKS - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">The regimental song turns into a deafening roar. All around the mess hall, OFFICERS are laughing and banging on tables. HARRY and DURRANCE stand on wobbly stools, downing pints of beer. As soon as their glasses are empty they set off down the hall at a sprint. It's an obstacle course. The two friends duck under two long tables, and crawl on their bellies, towards two more glasses. 
</p><p><p ID="act">TRENCH and CASTELTON are busy laying bets on who'll win. DURRANCE and HARRY step over a bridge of chairs. They have to find a pint of beer hidden under one of them. DURRANCE finds his first. TRENCH looks at CASTELTON smugly, convinced he's going to win.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY and DURRANCE step-walk over two long benches. DURRANCE falls off. HARRY overtakes him. He throws his head back and finishes off another pint. CASTELTON stands up, cheering. 
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY and DURRANCE are level as they reach the last glass.  As they start to drink HARRY stops, spluttering.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">This isn't beer, it's whisky.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">trench
<P ID="dia">Down in one!
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY drinks again, but he's fallen behind. The pint of whisky disappears down DURRANCE's throat. Grinning, he makes his way towards the finish line. HARRY pours the whisky over his head, conceding defeat.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. TRAINING GROUND/ WESTMINSTER barracks/ LONDON - Day.
</p><p><p ID="act">An obstacle course of a different kind. The CAVALRY are training, galloping at full tilt, HARRY and DURRANCE bringing up the front. At the sound of a bugle, they dismount their horses, and sprint towards a row of bayonets. They snatch up the weapons and charge a row of dummies.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DRILL INSTRUCTOR
<P ID="dia">...In. Out. On guard...
</p><p><p ID="act">The blades tear into the dummies, exposing soft leaves and hard wood.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DRILL INSTRUCTOR
<P ID="dia">...Hold the line...and charge...
</p><p><p ID="act">The OFFICERS charge towards a second set of targets. Teeth bared, they drive their bayonets into the stuffed dummies. CASTELTON's blade sticks in a chunk of wood.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DRILL INSTRUCTOR
<P ID="dia">...In and out, Castelton, in and out...
</p><p><p ID="act">CASTELTON pulls in frustation. He can't get the bayonet loose.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DRILL INSTRUCTOR
<P ID="dia">...They're coming at you boy. Rip it out or they'll stick you first.
</p><p><p ID="act">CASTELTON puts his foot on the dummy's head and tries to wrench the blade free. Even though it's only a training exercise, his panic is real. TRENCH slows down as he watches his friend struggling in vain.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DRILL INSTRUCTOR
<P ID="dia">...Move on Trench. Castelton's dead. Enemy spear through his throat.
</p><p><p ID="act">The OFFICERS continue, bayonets thrust forward, leaving the struggling CASTELTON behind.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. STABLES/ training ground/ westminster barracks - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">The men are washing up after exercises, dousing themselves with cold water.  Everyone's teasing CASTELTON, except for TRENCH. For once he keeps quiet, knowing how hard his friend's taking it. A SEARGENT-MAJOR enters and salutes.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SERGEANT-MAJOR
<P ID="dia">Gentlemen... fifteen minutes, in the briefing room.
</p><p><p ID="act">As he leaves, the MEN look at each other curiously.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. BRIEFING ROOM/ westminster barracks - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">The Officers are assembled.  HARRY, DURRANCE, TRENCH, WILLOUGHBY, and CASTELTON, take their places on the wooden benches. As he sits HARRY notices a map of Africa behind Colonel Hamilton.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL HAMILTON
<P ID="dia">...Gentlemen... 
<P ID="spkdir">(when the room settles down)
<P ID="dia">The 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards have been ordered to forego their posting to India...
<P ID="spkdir">(Off murmurs of surprise)
<P ID="dia">...We ship out in three days, to establish a forward garrison in the Sudan...

<P ID="dia">...General Holmby, Sir.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GENERAL HOLMBY
<P ID="dia">...I'd like to apologise for not giving you men more notice. I know many of you will find it hard to see your families now. Unfortunately we had no alternative...

</p><p><P ID="speaker">gENERAL HOLMBY 
<P ID="dia">...Three days ago, an army of Egyptian reserves led by General Hicks, was ambushed at Tashgil by the Mahdi's forces. Upoun attack the Egyptians fled, leaving General Hicks and the British Officers with him, to fight a heroic, but in the end hopeless rearguard action. All of them died, sword in hand... 
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY stares out silently, his whole world turned upside down.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">geNERAL HOLMBY 
<P ID="dia">...I hesitate to call this a mission of vengeance, but the honour of our country is at stake. This Government has finally seen fit to send its own troops to war...

<P ID="dia">...I listen to them laugh, and I can't help wondering which ones won't be coming back. The worse part is I think I even know who they are.

<P ID="dia">Of course not Harry. You're one of the lucky ones. Always have been.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">I know what he'll say: 'It's not for us to question.'
<P ID="spkdir">(A beat)
<P ID="dia">Do you ever ask yourself why you're going?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Not for the Queen. I hardly know her. 
<P ID="spkdir">(He smiles softly)
<P ID="dia">Nor for the regiment. There isn't much of a military tradition in my family...
<P ID="spkdir">(A beat)
<P ID="dia">I suppose I'm going because you're going. You, and Trench, and Castelton, and Willoughby... 
<P ID="spkdir">(A big grin)
<P ID="dia">Not much of a reason I know, but it reassures me.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY smiles, but Durrance's words only make him feel more ashamed of the fear he feels inside. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">Is there anything that frightens you, Jack?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I'm frightened of not coming back in one piece. Much more than dying. I wouldn't know what to do with myself in a wheel chair. And I couldn't stand to be pitied.
</p><p><p ID="act">He puts the thought out of his head and grins.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">There's a Church near our house. Next to the pub. Every night at ten the drunks spill out, shouting at the top of their voices. That's where I want to be buried. Where I can hear them.

</p><p><p ID="act">He's interrupted as the AIDE-DE-CAMP walks back in.

</p><p><p ID="act">HAMILTON stares at HARRY for what seems an eternity. He's struggling to make sense of something beyond his comprehension. Slowly he gathers himself and lowers his eyes, looking down at Harry's papers:

<P ID="dia">Why didn't you tell me? Was it because of me?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">Yes. I would have resigned. I wouldn't have gone to war for anything.
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE stares at him a moment, then removes her engagement ring from her finger, and holds it out to him.  
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">I've no right to call you a coward, but you are a liar. Please take this back.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY takes the ring without protest. ETHNE turns and walks away. As she leaves she sets the feathers on the table, and closes the door behind her.  
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY listens to her footsteps fade. He walks towards the table. As he looks down he sees four feathers. Ethne has snapped the fourth from her fan. 
</p><p><p ID="act">Very carefully, as if they were the most precious objects in the world, HARRY gathers them, his eyes shining with tears.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. HANSOM CABS/ LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT.
</p><p><p ID="act">GENERAL FEVERSHAM and COLONEL SUTCH wait in line for a hansom cab. The two old soldiers look frail in the falling rain. As they're about to climb onto a carriage, a voice calls out:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">HARRY (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">Father...?
</p><p><p ID="act">The General turns around. His eyes fill with emotion as his son approaches.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">HARRY
<P ID="dia">...I need to talk to you, Sir.
</p><p><p ID="act">There's a long silence as GENERAL FEVERSHAM gazes at his son. HARRY looks as if he hasn't slept in days. His eyes are swollen and bloodshot, full of heartbreak and shame. For a moment it seems as if the old man will take him in his arms and comfort him, but instead he averts his eyes, and climbs into the carriage. COLONEL SUTCH looks at HARRY regrettably, as if to say there's nothing he can do.

HARRY gets off the floor and walks over. As he does so we see the piles of newspapers that have gathered on his floor over the past few weeks. 
</p><p><p ID="act">The regimental guns boom outside. HARRY opens the window. He wants to hear them more clearly. He wants to be reminded of his shame.
</p><p><p ID="act">He walks back to the day's newspapers and kneels down amongst the mess. We see headlines of massacres and slaughters, beneath them artist's impressions of the Mahdist atrocities. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. LONDON STREETS - day.

</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY hurries down the corridor towards an area where the names of British casualties have been pinned to a notice board. PEOPLE swarm past him in the other direction. Some of them look relieved, others are overwhelmed by grief. HARRY hurries on, his heart pounding.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. CASUALTY LIST/ war office BUILDING/ LONDON - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY pushes through the CROWD of peering heads. As he finally elbows his way to the front he glimpses the long list of casualties. His eyes look through the D's first. Durrance's name isn't there. No sign of Castelton under the C's. HARRY is jostled backwards as he searches for the other names. With a fierce effort he gets to the front again. No Trench under T, no Willoughby under W. They're all safe. HARRY's body slackens with relief.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. harry's appartment block/ LONDON STREET - day.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">I don't need money, Sir. 
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY turns away. SUTCH looks torn. As a soldier he disapproves of what Harry's done, but as a family friend he can't help feeling sorry for the boy.

<P ID="dia">Was it that obvious?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH

<P ID="dia">How did you know I didn't have it in me?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH
<P ID="dia">What difference does it make?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harrY

</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH
<P ID="spkdir">(Losing patience)
<P ID="dia">That's enough Harry. Get on a grip on yourself. You're no use to anyone, sitting here all day, driving yourself mad...
</p><p><p ID="act">The outburst seems to release SUTCH from his soldier's reserve. He's all concern now.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH
<P ID="dia">What's done, is done.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harrY
<P ID="spkdir">(Quietly)
<P ID="dia">No Sir, it isn't.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small white box. He opens it in front of SUTCH. There are four white feathers inside. SUTCH stares at the names on the cards. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH
<P ID="spkdir">(Stunned)
<P ID="dia">Who sent you the fourth? Jack?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harrY
<P ID="dia">Ethne.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH
<P ID="dia">Throw them away. They don't mean a thing.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">HARRY
<P ID="dia">They do to me, Sir. They're all I have left of my friends.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH
<P ID="dia">Harry, this is morbid.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harrY
<P ID="dia">I don't mean it that way...
<P ID="spkdir">(Trying to make him understand)
<P ID="dia">You see, if there was something I could do, something so undeniable...I'm not saying it would change anything, it's too late for that...but if the feathers can be given, then they can be taken back.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH
<P ID="dia">Harry, your friends are in Egypt.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">HARRY
<P ID="dia">Yes Sir. In Alexandria. They transfer to Suakin in a fortnight.
</p><p><p ID="act">SUTCH doesn't understand at first. Then he looks at the newspapers and maps spread out across the floor, and begins to see the method in Harry's madness.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH
<P ID="spkdir">(In disbelief)
<P ID="dia">...You're a civilian. Even if you find them, there's nothing you can do.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH
<P ID="dia">Then what's the point!? 
<P ID="spkdir">(Staring at him in dismay)
<P ID="dia">You think Ethne will take you back? Is that what you think?!
</p><p><p ID="act">From the look in his eyes it's clear the thought had entered his head. Sutch's words bring him back down to earth. His voice is quieter now, resigned.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harrY
<P ID="dia">I don't have any choice... 
<P ID="spkdir">(With a terrible honesty)
<P ID="dia">I'm not sure how much longer I can live with myself, here, like this...

</p><p><P ID="speaker">haRRY 
<P ID="dia">I'm leaving for Egypt tomorrow.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH
<P ID="spkdir">(He realises there's no point trying to dissuade him)
<P ID="dia">Do you want me to tell your father?  
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">Only if something should happen to me. I'll write and let you know how I am, as often as I can.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH
<P ID="dia">What about Ethne?
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY has to think long and hard about this. The thought of her fills him with sadness.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">I'd rather you didn't tell her anything. After all I've put her through the least I can do is let her forget me in peace. 
</p><p><p ID="act">COLONEL SUTCH looks moved by his predicament, and impressed by these first, grasping signs of nobility. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harrY
<P ID="dia">Maybe I'll come back sooner than I think -- hear the guns booming off the African coast, and take the first ship home.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL SUTCH

</p><p><p ID="act">COLONEL SUTCH smiles weakly.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. HARRY's POV. VIEW OF THE AFRICAN COAST - day.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. port of ALEXANDRIA - DAY.
</p><p><p ID="act">The same veil of dust blows through the crowded port. HARRY covers his eyes. His hair is longer now, his face gaunt and bearded. Clutching his suitcase, he moves through the throng.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. streets of ALEXANDRIA - DAY.
</p><p><p ID="act">The alleyways look almost dreamlike through the shimmering heat. It's as if we're in Harry's head, reflecting his state of mind. A crowd of URCHIN BOYS are following his every step, imitating his langorous walk. HARRY doesn't notice them. His gaze is riveted by the sights around him: the MERCHANTS beckoning him into their shops; the BRITISH SOLDIERS on leave, sheltering in the cool hollows of the cafes and whorehouses; the BEGGARS, hunched up against the stone walls, their faces covered with flies.
</p><p><p ID="act">Through the arches of the Souk, a wedding procession appears. The BRIDE and GROOM sit on brightly painted donkeys. All around them WOMEN and CHILDREN clap and shrill. HARRY catches a glimpse of the bride's face. She gazes at him for a moment, then looks away.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. COLONIAL HOTEL/ ALEXANDRIA - DAY.
</p><p><p ID="act">The colours of the Souk give way to the cool white emptiness of a colonial hotel. ENGLISH GUESTS talk in hushed whispers as EGYPTIAN WAITERS serve them tea. HARRY sits in a corner of the lobby, nursing his drink, observing a group of ENGLISH OFFICERS, laughing amongst themselves.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY looks thoughtful, wondering how to approach them. Suddenly he hears a commotion. A drunk BRITISH CORPORAL is escorted out of the hotel by a group of SENIOR OFFICERS. He shouts and swears, but they ignore him, throwing him out of the door. HARRY gets up as he sees his chance.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. EGYPTIAN bar - brothel/ BAZAAR/ ALEXANDRIA - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">The rhythmic beating of drums. Tattooed WOMEN dance on a makeshift stage, mesmerising the crowd of eager SOLDIERS. HARRY sits with the drunken BRITISH CORPORAL. The man's eyes keep drifting longingly towards the stage, as if he hasn't seen a woman in months. HARRY fills his glass.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BRITISH CORPORAL
<P ID="spkdir">(Resuming their conversation)

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BRITISH CORPORAL

<P ID="dia">Does the Prime Minister read your paper?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harrY
<P ID="dia">I imagine so.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BRITISH CORPORAL
<P ID="dia">Then tell him from me we're on a losing wicket here. These bastards aren't scared of anything. If they saw death walking down the street they'd hide in an alleyway and try to pick him off with a stone. How do you fight people like that...
</p><p><p ID="act">He tries to drain the last few drops from his empty glass, then looks over longingly, at the tattooed DANCERS. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. SAND STORM/ desert near SUAKIN/ sudan - DAY. 
</p><p><p ID="act">Thick gusts of sand blow at us. As the swirling clouds settle we see a group of misshapen figures, huddled together. As they finally rise and start to move, we realise they're BRITISH SOLDIERS, on camels. Amongst the dust caked faces we see TRENCH, CASTELTON, WILLOUGHBY and DURRANCE.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. DESERT near SUAKIN/ SUDAN - DAY. 
</p><p><p ID="act">The sand storm has cleared, and in its place a harsh desert sun beats down. The COLUMN OF BRITISH SCOUTS trudges forward. DURRANCE rides at the front, looking as if he were born here, eyes alert to every shimmer and nuance.  
</p><p><p ID="act">Up ahead he sees a large mound of stones standing out amongst the mud flat. He drives his camel forward. As he approaches he sees that it's a dervish burial mound. Skulls and skeletons are splayed across the rocks. WILLOUGHBY rides up through the ranks and joins him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">WILLOUGHBY
<P ID="dia">What do you think?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I think they're trying to frighten us off. We should keep pressing forward.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. courtyard/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">All that's left of the fortress is a grim skeleton. The Union Jack lies ripped to shreds, halfway down its flagpole. The BRITISH SOLDIERS gaze at the destruction.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">trench

<P ID="dia">I don't know about you lot, but I'm going to grab a drink before Mustapha does.

<P ID="dia">Mustapha, be my guest.
</p><p><p ID="act">There's more laughter. DURRANCE smiles but his eyes are still alert. Above the fortress tower he sees a flock of birds taking flight, rising up gracefully towards the desert sun. Suddenly amidst the laughter and chatter, one of the SOLDIERS topples off his camel. His FRIENDS laugh:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">friendS
<P ID="dia">...Capshaw you dosy bastard...
<P ID="dia">...Camilla's tired him out...
</p><p><p ID="act">CAPSHAW doesn't move. CASTELTON's the first to realise something's wrong. He jumps off his camel and turns CAPSHAW over. Half the soldier's face has been blown off. Raw bone glistens underneath. CASTELTON rears back in horror. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CASTELTON
<P ID="dia">Sniper!
</p><p><p ID="act">Panic erupts. The SOLDIERS leap off their camels, using them as shields. 
</p><p><p ID="act">The sniper's bullet rings out and sends one of the animals crashing to the dirt. The men start to run now, seeking shelter in the surrounding hutments. The sniper's gun rings out repeatedly.

</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE raises his head cautiously. At the tower window he sees the DERVISH SNIPER firing his rifle. DURRANCE hesitates. He could kill the man easily, but it would mean shooting him in the back. He can't bring himself to do it:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Drop it!
</p><p><p ID="act">The DERVISH SNIPER stops still. He turns around slowly and looks DURRANCE in the eye. A contemptuous smile flickers across his face. Very slowly, he takes a bullet from his pocket and slips it in the rifle. He doesn't even look at DURRANCE. There's a terrifying, suicidal calm about him.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE studies his enemy, admiring his utter contempt for death, and then fires two bullets into his head.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. TENTS/ THE BRITISH CAMP/ suakin/ sudan - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">Bonfires flicker across the British camp. DURRANCE sits outside his tent, bathed in firelight, watching some BEDU DANCERS performing for the BRITISH TROOPS. He seems far away, as if he's thinking about the day's kill. TRENCH's braying voice snaps him out of his reverie.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. COLONEL HAMILTON's TENT/ BRITISH CAMP/ suakin - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">COLONEL HAMILTON sits at a fold-up table, eating his dinner by candlelight. He turns around as DURRANCE walks in. He wipes his face with his knapkin and gestures for DURRANCE to sit.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL HAMILTON
<P ID="dia">...Congratulations, it seems you had another successful day.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(Too honest to accept the complement)
<P ID="dia">We killed one Dervish sniper, Sir.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL HAMILTON
<P ID="dia">I'm giving you three weeks leave.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE looks surprised.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I really don't need, or deserve any leave.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL HAMILTON
<P ID="dia">You certainly deserve it, every report I receive singles you out for praise.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">With your permission, I'd like to stay here with the rest of the regiment.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL HAMILTON
<P ID="dia">Permission refused.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE is too disciplined a soldier to protest.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL HAMILTON
<P ID="dia">...Anyway the rest of the regiment is stuck here in Suakin until the Government agrees to send us to Khartoum... 
<P ID="spkdir">(Containing his frustration)
<P ID="dia">You and several other Officers will be going to London, to convince parliament, and more importantly public opinion, that it is necessary to pursue this campaign with the utmost vigour. Do you have any questions?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Yes Sir, why me?
</p><p><p ID="act">HAMILTON pauses. Then almost mischievously:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL HAMILTON
<P ID="dia">Because you're a hero.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">With all due respect Sir, I don't think we've been fighting long enough to have any heroes in this campaign.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL HAMILTON
<P ID="dia">That's my point. It's all about perception.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE sees there's no point discussing it further. He salutes and turns to leave.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL HAMILTON
<P ID="dia">A question Lieutenant?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Yes Sir?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL HAMILTON
<P ID="dia">What is it you like about this place?
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE chooses his words carefully.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">The freedom Sir. The fact that one is reduced to what one really is.
</p><p><p ID="act">COLONEL HAMILTON smiles softly, wondering if Durrance is insulting him, not giving a damn.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. desert between EGYPT and sudan - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">A searing white sun hangs over the desert. Somewhere amidst the rolling dunes and floating dust we see a caravan of camels, winding its way through the plateau.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. caravan/ desert between egypt and sudan - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY rides at the front of the caravan with GUSTAVE, a sun blackened french slave-driver. Behind them ride SAADI, his Dinka assistant, and three beautiful DINKA SLAVEGIRLS. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">gustave
<P ID="dia">...The British soldiers rent my girls off me for three dhirrams an hour. Well worth the trip to Suakin. 
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY smiles distractedly. His eyes are fixed on the majestic landscape before him, miles and miles of rolling desert.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">gustave
<P ID="spkdir">(Recognising the first time awe one feels for the desert)
<P ID="dia">Don't fall in love too quickly. Nothing turns on you like the sand.
</p><p><p ID="act">He looks back at the DINKA SLAVEGIRLS, who are whispering amongst themselves.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">gustave 
<P ID="dia">Shut up!!... 
<P ID="spkdir">(To Saadi)
<P ID="dia">Keep them quiet! What do I pay you for?!
</p><p><p ID="act">SAADI says something to the SLAVEGIRLS in their native Dinka tongue. From the deference in his voice it's clear the women are from a higher caste than him.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. desert between EGYPT and sudan - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">A breeze blows sand-drifts across the desert floor. As a veil of dust clears, HARRY sees the bones of a camel, forming a perfect skeleton on the floor.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">gustAVE
<P ID="dia">Bones are a good sign. We must be near a well.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. well/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">The skeletons lie thick around the well: six or seven men in Bedu Robes, sprawled within yards of the precious water. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">gustave
<P ID="spkdir">(As Harry stares at the bones)
<P ID="dia">What else is there to fight for in a desert. At least it makes sense of war.
</p><p><p ID="act">SAADI hoists some water up in a goatskin canteen.  He offers the canteen to GUSTAVE. The French slave-driver is about to take a drink when he hears one of the DINKA SLAVEGIRLS murmuring in her native tongue. He wheels his camel around angrily.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">gUSTAVE 
<P ID="spkdir">(To Saadi)
<P ID="dia">What did she say?
</p><p><p ID="act">Before SAADI can make an excuse  for her, the DINKA SLAVEGIRL starts cursing in her native tongue, her eyes fixed on GUSTAVE. 
</p><p><p ID="act">GUSTAVE lashes out with his whip. The SLAVEGIRL's camel rears, throwing her to the floor. GUSTAVE rides towards her, raising his whip, ready to beat her.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY's camel suddenly lurches between them. At first it looks like he's lost control of the animal, but as he steadies his mount, it becomes clear he's put himself in Gustave's way.
</p><p><p ID="act">GUSTAVE sneers. With inch perfect skill, he starts to circle HARRY, trying to get a clear view of the girl. With equal skill, HARRY twists his own camel round, keeping her blocked from him at every turn. 
</p><p><p ID="act">GUSTAVE grows impatient. He raises his whip, threatening Harry. HARRY doesn't flinch. His eyes are fixed on Gustave the whole time. Finally GUSTAVE backs down, intimidated by the mysterious stranger. He stares at HARRY, half in anger, half in admiration.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">gustave
<P ID="dia">You ride well.
</p><p><p ID="act">With that he rides his camel back to the well. The DINKA SLAVEGIRL doesn't look at HARRY. She's too proud to acknowledge his help.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. cave/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">A howling sandstorm blows outside the cave. The camels screech in the night, terrified by the wind. SAADI and the DINKA GIRLS shelter in the furthest corner of the cave. HARRY and GUSTAVE sit by a flickering fire. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">gUSTAVE
<P ID="dia">...What's your secret? Anyone who talks as little as you do must be hiding something? Did you kill a man? 
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY prods the fire, ignoring him. GUSTAVE turns around as he hears SAADI and one of the DINKA GIRLS whispering.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">guSTAVE 
<P ID="dia">Taiser vouz!
</p><p><p ID="act">Silence. GUSTAVE turns back to HARRY, looking pleased with himself.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">guSTAVE
<P ID="dia">You have to break them. For their own good. They'll only be happy again when they forget what it's like to be free.
<P ID="spkdir">(He looks at Harry mischievously)
<P ID="dia">It's like a man who's been thrown over by a woman. At first he's defiant, then he's determined, but finally he longs to forget.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY gets up and walks to the other side of the cave. He hears GUSTAVE chuckling behind him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">gUSTAVE
<P ID="dia">...Any secrets you have, the desert will find you out.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. PASS/ CLIFFS/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">A screaming gale howls through the desert pass.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. cave/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">It isn't the storm that wakes HARRY up, but the sound of whispering. GUSTAVE is snoring by the fire.  HARRY looks past him. He sees SAADI and the DINKA SLAVEGIRL he rescued earlier, lying in each other's arms, making love as quietly as they can. 
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY can't help staring. Their act seems to represent the ultimate defiance, he ultimate affirmation of their freedom. He feels a spark of hope in their hope. 
</p><p><p ID="act">SAADI and the DINKA SLAVEGIRL finally come to rest in each other's arms. HARRY listens as they continue to whisper in their native tongue. He's about to close his eyes when suddenly the DINKA SLAVEGIRL gets up.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY watches curiously as she walks across the cave. She picks something off the floor. As she walks towards GUSTAVE HARRY suddenly sees that it's a sharp jagged rock. 
</p><p><p ID="act">Before HARRY can say anything the girl falls to her knees and buries the rock deep into GUSTAVE's face. Almost simultaneously HARRY feels a sharp crack on the back of his head. He rolls away instinctively, but to no avail. 
</p><p><p ID="act">The blows rain down. As he tries to protect his face, HARRY sees SAADI, holding a thick wooden club over him. The club hammers down, splitting Harry's fingers, tearing into his face, knocking any resistance out of him. 
</p><p><p ID="act">As he stares up listlessly, HARRY sees SAADI standing over him, ready to finish him off. Suddenly a voice rings out, a woman's voice, calling Saadi off.  HARRY's eyes drift away.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ARMY/NAVY CLUB - LONDON - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">We see ETHNE's face now, staring out. For a moment we think she's part of Harry's dream, but then the familiar noises of reality fade in, and we realise she's amongst a crowd of OFFICERS and JOURNALISTS, listening to DURRANCE lecturing about the Sudan:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(Aware she's in the audience)
<P ID="dia">...Each moment we delay, we imperil General Gordon's life. The Mahdi is concentrating all his forces on Khartoum. At most the garrison can hold out for a few more weeks...
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. ARMY/NAVY CLUB - LONDON - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE stands at the club entrance with ETHNE and her friend, CAROLINE ADAIR. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">...Caroline read about your lecture in the Times. We're both very proud of you.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I'm glad you came. 
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE tries not to stare at ETHNE too hard. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CAROLINE
<P ID="dia">...We have to be somewhere this afternoon, but if you're free this evening Lieutenant Durrance...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I'm afraid I have to give another talk.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="spkdir">(Suddenly)
<P ID="dia">Would you mind if I didn't come with you Caroline? I don't know the Gilby's all that well...
</p><p><p ID="act">CAROLINE hesitates. We see the reluctance in her eyes, but she's far too dignified to show it.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CAROLINE
<P ID="dia">You can do whatever you like, darling.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. LONDON/ STREET - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE and ETHNE walk along a crowded street. Passing WOMEN glance admiringly at DURRANCE in his uniform.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">That's six I've counted.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Six what?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Six married women, gawping at you.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE smiles shyly, wondering if she's flirting with him. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. tea shop/ LONDON - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">A tinkle of china and cutlery. ETHNE and DURRANCE sit in a tea shop. ETHNE can't help sending up the place. She dabs her lips with her napkin, pretending to be all prim and proper.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Do you want to go somewhere else?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">No, it's lovely here. I'm teasing.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE looks out of place in the surroundings, and nervous around ETHNE.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="spkdir">(Trying to put him at ease)
<P ID="dia">I want to hear all about the desert?
</p><p><p ID="act">She leans towards him, like a child waiting to hear a tale. DURRANCE isn't sure if she's aware of the effect on him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">It grows on you. There's something about all that emptiness that concentrates the mind.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="spkdir">(Looking into his eyes)
<P ID="dia">On what?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(He hesitates)
<P ID="dia">You spend a lot of time thinking about the people you miss -- especially at night -- You have the most vivid dreams, it's hard to believe they're not real...
</p><p><p ID="act">He stops as he sees the sadness in her eyes, reminded of the barrier between them.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Have you heard from Harry?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="spkdir">(A beat)
<P ID="dia">No. Have you?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I went to see General Feversham. He refused to discuss it with me. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">I know they had a falling out. 
</p><p><p ID="act">She tries to sound casual, but DURRANCE feels how much the thought of Harry still pains her.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(Testing her, almost in spite of himself)
<P ID="dia">He's one of the people I think about all the time.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="spkdir">(Very deliberately)
<P ID="dia">I don't as much as I used to.
<P ID="spkdir">(Looking up at Durrance)
<P ID="dia">I certainly wasn't until you brought him up.
</p><p><p ID="act">There's a touch of reproach in her eyes, but also something flirtatious. It's as if she's forcing herself to put Durrance above Harry in her thoughts. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">When do you go back?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Friday.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">So soon?
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE isn't sure how to read her disappointment. He feels conflicted about Harry, but he can't help being drawn to her.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(Awkwardly)
<P ID="dia">Are you sure I can't persuade you to stay in London a few more days? Listen to more of my boring lectures...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">I thought the talk was fascinating.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(Steeling himself)
<P ID="dia">I really would like to see you again before I leave.
</p><p><p ID="act">There's something touching about Durrance's shyness: a contradiction between the fearless warrior and the tentative lover. ETHNE feels torn, but she wills herself on:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="spkdir">(Lightly, but acknowledging his invitation nevertheless)
<P ID="dia">You could always visit us in Bintree. 
</p><p><p ID="act">She feels her eyes drifting away from him, but she forces herself to look back, and holds his gaze.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. cave/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY opens his eyes painfully. His face is still battered and swollen from Saadi's beating. As he picks himself up he sees Gustave's body, lying exactly where the Dinka slavegirl killed him, the jagged rock still embedded in his face. HARRY looks away as he hears a camel whinnying outside.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. cave/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">The camel is tied by some rope to a jutting rock, a goatskin canteen slung over its back. HARRY realises the Dinka girl he rescued has left them for him. He looks over the horizon. There's no sign of the Dinkas, only the vast desert waste.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. DUNES/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY urges his camel up the steep slope of a crescent dune. His battered face is burnt raw by the sun, his skin covered in blisters. He looks out hopefully as his camel finally conquers the sandy peak, but all he sees in its place are miles and miles of rolling dunes. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. water trough/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">Harry's camel noses its way into a shallow water trough. HARRY almost drops off the animal in his haste to drink. He digs his hands into the mud and cups some of the precious liquid in his palms. It's only after he's drunk that he realises there are dozens of tics, stuck to his arms, and face. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. desert between EGYPT and sudan - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY shivers in the cold night air, partly from the wind, but also from the fever he's caught off the tics. Hands trembling, he burns the blood gorged insects off his arm with a glowing stick from the camp-fire.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. shingles/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY's camel rears as it treads over the searing shingles. He topples off. Eyes half shut, he grabs the reins, making sure the camel doesn't run off. He takes a knife from his pocket.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">...I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
</p><p><p ID="act">He cuts a slash in the camel's hide and puts his mouth to it. He sucks up what little blood he can, and rolls the liquid around his mouth.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. desert between EGYPT and sudan - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY talks to himself in the dark. His face is all puffed up with fever, his hair chalked with dust. Above him the stars glimmer, promising another day of relentless sun.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. DESERT HILLS/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY lies unconscious on the camel's back, roped to the animal. The CAMEL noses it's way through the desert floor, coming across a few shrubs. It tears them out of the earth, and starts up the hill, in search of more nourishment. HARRY slides precariously down the camel's back. Only the ropes hold him tight. As the camel finally reaches the top we see a vast plateau open up before us. The earth is still desert brown, but there are patches of green now -- and somewhere in the distance, the sky is blackening with rain.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. STREETS OF SUAKIN/ SUDAN - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">A torrential downpour floods the narrow streets of Suakin. A group of excited BEGGAR BOYS lead HARRY and his camel through the rain swept alleyways.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. LOCAL HOTEL/ SUAKIN/ SUDAN - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY lies shivering on a bunk bed, overwhelmed by fever. An ARAB DOCTOR treats his ravaged skin with balm. Behind them the BEGGAR BOYS argue with the ARAB HOTELIER, demanding more money for bringing the foreigner here. 
</p><p><p ID="speaker">ARAB DOCTOR
<p ID="dia">English?
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY shakes his head no.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. marketplace/ STREETS OF SUAKIN/ SUDAN - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">Sunlight dries out the previous night's storm. HARRY wanders through the marketplace, wearing long Bedu robes now, limping from his desert ordeal. PASSERSBY pull away as they see his face, mistaking the open blisters for leprosy. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. RIVERBANK NEAR THE BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN/ SUDAN - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">A crocodile rears out of the water and tears a lump of meat off a hook. It disappears back under the surface, avoiding the trap. There's a cry of disappointment from the riverbank. A group of LOCAL CHILDREN are trying to catch the beast. TRENCH is their leader. CASTELTON smiles at his friend's antics.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">treNCH
<P ID="dia">...Don't give up lads. Give the old porker another whack.
</p><p><p ID="act">The BOYS have tied a pig to a stake, outside the water. They beat it with a paddle until it whines. Hearing the noise, the CROCODILE rears its head, and sweeps towards the remaining lump of meat on the hook. 
</p><p><p ID="act">TRENCH and the BOYS swarm around the river expectantly. In their excitement they fail to notice the shrouded FIGURE watching them from the distance. It's HARRY, hidden beneath his Bedu robes. He gazes at his two friends longingly. Finally one of the BOYS sees him, and thinking he's a leper, starts throwing stones:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">sudanese boy
<P ID="dia">Imshi, imshi.
</p><p><p ID="act">The other BOYS join in, yelling insults. TRENCH and CASTELTON pay no attention. They have no idea who it is. 
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY steps back slowly, the pebbles landing at his feet, still gazing at his friends. He knows he doesn't have the courage to face them yet, that it's too soon.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. HAMILTON's TENT/ BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN/ SUDAN - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">Colonel Hamilton's tent is lit in torchlight. Dozens of OFFICERS mill about, celebrating their orders to march on Khartoum. 
</p><p><p ID="speaker">A MAJOR FROM ANOTHER REGIMENT
<P ID="dia">...It's hard to imagine anyone changing the Prime Minister's mind.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">COLONEL HAMILTON
<P ID="dia">Even he reads the papers. They told him if he didn't send us to Khartoum he'd be indicted for murder...
</p><p><p ID="act">There's laughter all around. Across the tent, DURRANCE stands on his own, feeling out of place. WILLOUGHBY arrives with two drinks.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">wILLOUGHBY
<P ID="dia">You're quite the hero tonight.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">The Colonel seems to be taking a fair bit of credit.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">wILLOUGHBY

<P ID="dia">Not even Ethne?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(A little put out)
<P ID="dia">Why should she? She's broken off their engagement.
</p><p><p ID="act">WILLOUGHBY notices the edge in his voice but doesn't say anything. DURRANCE feels a touch of guilt, surprised by his own jealous reaction. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. HARRY's ROOM/ LOCAL HOTEL/ SUAKIN/ SUDAN - night.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY studies his face in the mirror: his blisters have dried into tough leathery skin, his eyes are hollow from recent hardships. He whispers to himself in broken Arabic, and dips his fingers into a dark, mud like substance. He applies it to his hair, his beard, and his teeth.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. COOLIES/ BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">Long lines of DESERT AFRICANS have gathered outside the British camp, looking for work as coolies. There are Nuers, Dinkas, Somalis, Ethiopians, all of them wearing different clothes, and speaking different languages. Somewhere amongst them, we see HARRY, disguised in his Bedu robes. He's being examined by a BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR and an EGYPTIAN ORDERLY.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR
<P ID="dia">Tell him to remove his shirt.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY waits for the ORDERLY to translate before he opens his robes. His body is lean and tanned and scarred.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR
<P ID="spkdir">(Impressed by his physique)
<P ID="dia">This one's been in the wars. Let me see his teeth.
</p><p><p ID="act">Again HARRY waits for the Arabic translation before he opens his mouth.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR
<P ID="dia">Good bones. Put him on the boats.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY is ushered off. As he walks away he hears an argument start up behind him. The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY is protesting to the SEARGENT MAJOR about hiring a fierce looking NUBIAN warrior.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">EGYPTIAN ORDERLY
<P ID="dia">...This man comes from a race of slaves. They have blood feuds with everyone. If you arm him it will mean trouble. None of the Egyptian soldiers will serve with him.
</p><p><p ID="act">The NUBIAN stares ahead in silence, expressionless.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BRITISH OFFICER
<P ID="dia">Alright, put him on the boats.
</p><p><p ID="act">The NUBIAN falls into line, behind HARRY.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. DRILL AREA/ BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN - day.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. COOLIES/ BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY watches his friends from afar. He sits amongst the COOLIES, holding out his soup bowl, waiting to be fed. The NUBIAN squats opposite him. HARRY can't help staring at the long white ostrich feather in his hair. 
</p><p><p ID="act">The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY arrives and pours a rancid looking gruel in HARRY's bowl. He turns to the NUBIAN.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">EGYPTIAN ORDERLY
<P ID="spkdir">(In Arabic)
<P ID="dia">Is this good enough for you slave?
</p><p><p ID="act">The NUBIAN ignores him. The ORDERLY spits in the gruel before handing it to him.  The NUBIAN takes it, and calmly downs it in one. The ORDERLY moves on in disgust. The NUBIAN looks at HARRY. HARRY braces himself and swallows the stew. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. CATARACTS of the nile/ sudan - day.

Wearing it is a fierce looking DERVISH WARRIOR with long braided hair.

</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY bows, and starts to walk towards him, in supplication. His hand slips behind his back, groping for the knife that's hidden there.
</p><p><p ID="act">The DERVISH CAPTAIN barks at him to stay where he is. As he steps backwards, HARRY suddenly charges, and drives the dagger deep into his gut. The DERVISH CAPTAIN screams, but all that comes out is a terrible hissing sound. 
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY clamps his hand over the CAPTAIN's mouth and bends his head backwards. As they tumble to the ground, HARRY twists the knife in deeper. The Dervish bites down in agony, drawing a stream of blood from Harry's knuckles. HARRY rams his fist deeper into the man's throat, choking him slowly. Meanwhile his knife hand tears its way out of the Dervish's gut, and plunges back into his thigh.
</p><p><p ID="act">The CAPTAIN's eyes water in pain and fear. HARRY stares at him, crushing his spirit with his own unflinching gaze. As he feels the man's grip weaken, he pulls away sharply, and swings the knife down with all his force. The blade sticks in the DERVISH CAPTAIN's chest, sending his eyes spinning out of focus, forcing a rush of blood out of his mouth.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY watches in horror, as the man's eyes roll around, desperately trying to find their focus, then stop still. He feels his enemy's dying breath on his face, and hears a horrible sucking sound, as he withdraws the knife. 
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY's arm is elbow deep in gore. He turns away and tries to retch, but nothing comes out.

</p><p><p ID="act">There's something strident in Durrance's voice, a brittleness that hides the insecurity inside. CALDER continues:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CALDER
<P ID="dia">..."Knowing you as I do, and convinced as I am of your affections, I wish to go back on my previous fears. I'm writing now, to let you know how grateful I am to have you in my life -- and to say, with all my heart, how much I wish to be in yours...With all my love, Ethne."
</p><p><p ID="act">CALDER, lowers the letter, quietly moved.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CAPTAIN CALDER
<P ID="dia">Congratulations...
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE stares out quietly.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I knew a man once who went blind, a good man too, before...A year after you wouldn't have recognised him. He was the most selfish, exacting, egotistical human being you could ever meet. I wouldn't wish him on anyone...
</p><p><p ID="act">He smiles ironically, hiding the heartbreak inside.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">The one thing I want most in this life, finally comes to me when I can no longer accept it.

</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE stares out of the drawing room window, waiting. Her friend CAROLINE sits at a table, pretending to be absorbed in her book, listening just as intently. There's the jingle of a carriage outside.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CAROLINE
<P ID="dia">That's him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">It isn't stopping.

</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE turns away from the window.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CAROLINE
<P ID="dia">Maybe you should have gone to the station to meet him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">He might have thought I was going because I imagined he was helpless. I don't want him to feel like that.
</p><p><p ID="act">There's a quiet resolve in Ethne's voice, as if she's been mulling over her future life with Durrance. The doorbell rings. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">That must be him.
</p><p><p ID="act">CAROLINE gets up to answer the door. ETHNE walks to the window. Her movements are nervous, her eyes tense. The door finally opens. DURRANCE walks in, alone. As soon as ETHNE leaves the window he turns around and looks straight at her.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="spkdir">(Startled)
<P ID="dia">It isn't true then, you can see...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(Gently)
<P ID="dia">It's perfectly true. I can't see a thing.
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE stops, feeling guilty.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">You moved from the window, that's how I knew.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">I hardly made a noise.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">No, but the window was open. The noise outside grew louder. 
</p><p><p ID="act">She tries to answer his smile.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Let me get you some tea, and then we can talk.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(Sensing her tension)
<P ID="dia">Yes, we have a lot to talk about.
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE's hand trembles as she pours the tea. DURRANCE interprets every sound. She picks up the cup and walks over with a smile, holding it out for him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I hate to sound humble, but I don't trust myself with a cup of tea yet.
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE feels stupid again. She sets the cup down on a table. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(Gently)
<P ID="dia">You're not bound, you know.
</p><p><p ID="act">There's a pause. ETHNE knows exactly what he means.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Bound by what?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I wouldn't dream of holding you to your letter. Or a committment you made to a different man. 
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE stares at him in surprise, and then in quiet admiration.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">You're not a different man.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I don't say it begrudgingly. I'm not being particularly noble or heroic either. It's something I've thought about long and hard --
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Jack --
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">-- Please hear me out...
<P ID="spkdir">(With difficulty)
<P ID="dia">I'm thinking of myself as much as you. I have to learn to accept what's happened. I have to learn to respect the person I've become. The only way to do that is to start again.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Why does it have to be without me?
</p><p><p ID="act">Her words make him hesitate.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Because if I was with you, I'd spend every moment wondering how you really felt about me. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">If you don't know how I feel about you, then that's a good reason to call off our wedding. Your blindness isn't.
</p><p><p ID="act">She stares at him, determined. DURRANCE looks touched by her devotion, but still doesn't feel worthy of her love.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">It has to be more than mere obligation Ethne, or even friendship. It has to be more than that...
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE suddenly reaches out and touches his face. DURRANCE stops as he feels her fingers. He's lost for a moment, unsure of himself. ETHNE leans forward and kisses him, tenderly at first, but then more and more passionately, proving herself to him, proving herself to herself. DURRANCE kisses her back, close to tears.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. PATIO/ caroline's house -  DAY.          
</p><p><p ID="act">A sharp clatter of hooves. DURRANCE rides his horse with the help of a GROOM, his face fixed in concentration. ETHNE and CAROLINE watch him from the patio. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="spkdir">(Gazing at him proudly)
<P ID="dia">He seems to need his eyes less and less each day. It's incredible. Nothing escapes him. Sometimes I think he reads me like a book.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CAROLINE
<P ID="dia">You no longer have your face to screen your thoughts.
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE doesn't notice the edge in her voice. She's lost in her own thoughts. DURRANCE climbs off his horse and strides towards them, looking pleased with himself. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(Wrapping Ethne in his arms)
<P ID="dia">You smell wonderful.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">And you smell like a horse. Go wash.
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE keeps smiling, even after DURRANCE has gone. CAROLINE watches her friend quietly, fighting the jealousy she feels within. A voice interrupts their separate thoughts:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GARDENER o/s
<P ID="spkdir">(Calling out)
<P ID="dia">...Someone to see you Miss Eustace.
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE looks up to see a UNIFORMED OFFICER, standing with the GARDENER, by the maze. She gets up curiously.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">wILLOUGHBY
<P ID="dia">I went all the way to Bintree to find you. Your father told me you were here. I'm sorry I came unannounced, I needed to talk to you alone... 
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE doesn't reply or return his smile. WILLOUGHBY seems to read her thoughts.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">wILLOUGHBY
<P ID="dia">I understand how you feel, Ethne. All I can say is that we never set out to hurt you. What happened was between us and Harry, not the two of you.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="spkdir">(Coldly)
<P ID="dia">What do you want, Tom?
</p><p><p ID="act">WILLOUGHBY hesitates, bracing himself.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">wILLOUGHBY
<P ID="dia">...I've seen Harry. In Suakin. He asked me to give you these...
</p><p><p ID="act">He holds out TWO SOILED WHITE FEATHERS. ETHNE stares at them, unable to speak, her whole world turned upside down.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">wILLOUGHBY
<P ID="dia">He risked his life to save our regiment. He fought as if he'd been born to it.
</p><p><p ID="act">I've come to tell you I've withdrawn my accusation of cowardice against him, along with Castelton's.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="spkdir">(All she cares about)
<P ID="dia">Is Harry dead?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">wILLOUGHBY
<P ID="dia">He was fine when I saw him. He'd changed a great deal but he was in good health.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Changed how?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">wILLOUGHBY
<P ID="dia">I didn't spend much time with him. I don't know what else to tell you Ethne.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Tell me everything Tom. Please...

<P ID="dia">If by your own admission you've hurt me, then I have a right to know.

</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY stares back at him through his black desert robes.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">HARRY
<P ID="dia">I sent a man to you with a warning from Abou Klea. You wouldn't listen to him. You had him tortured instead.
</p><p><p ID="act">The confusion and shock bring pent-up tears to WILLOUGHBY's eyes. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">HARRY
<P ID="dia">He told you a British Officer had sent him. Even if you didn't believe him, what would it have cost to take precautions. What more did I have to do?

<P ID="dia">They say you can tell a woman's heart by the way she plays.

<P ID="dia">What if she can't play at all.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">It isn't how well you play, it's how passionately you stroke the keys.
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE presses the keys harder, pretending it's a joke, worried that he might see through her.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I'd say you're in love.
</p><p><p ID="act">Even though it's said in jest, his words stick like a knife. The notes torture her. She suddenly gets up and walk away from the piano.

<P ID="spkdir">(Following her footsteps)
<P ID="dia">Where are you going?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">I want to hear you play on your own.
</p><p><p ID="act">A moment's silence. Then DURRANCE turns back to the piano and starts to play -- quietly, tenderly. The haunting music breaks Ethne's heart. Almost involuntarily she starts to walk away from him, towards the open patio doors.

<P ID="spkdir">(With a sudden flourish of the keys)
<P ID="dia">There you go, I'm in love too...

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">...Before I came here I'd given up. I put on all kinds of fronts and defences, but deep down I was petrified. I had no idea what was going on around me, what people were thinking behind my back. I imagined the worst, so that nothing would surprise me, no-one would catch me out...
</p><p><p ID="act">He walks closer.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">...You've made me realise I can't live like that. Whether one can see or not, there's no way of knowing how people really feel about you, all you can do is put yourself in their hands, and trust them unconditionally...

<P ID="dia">I'm not afraid, because of you Ethne, because of the way you've made me feel...

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Ethne...?
</p><p><p ID="act">The only sound he hears is the wind on the curtains. We see for the first time that Ethne's left, through the open patio doors.

</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY staggers through the torchlit stalls. He sees a group of DERVISH WARRIORS, gathered around a fire. Their leader, a sickly looking EMIR, smokes a hashish pipe as he listens to his men recounting their feats of war. Next to him, lies a beautiful, jewel encrusted scabbard.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY thinks a moment, then approaches the group, strumming his zither, grinning at the men. Seeing the crazed musician, the DERVISH WARRIORS cover their ears. Some of them toss chunks of meat at him. HARRY picks up the dusty morsels, chewing them with relish, grinning like a happy puppy.

</p><p><p ID="act">The CROWD pushes them closer together. HARRY feels an overwhelming sense of pity and dread. The dreamlike intensity is getting to him. The tragic creature, shimmying before his eyes, is like a grotesque reminder of the woman he loved and lost. 
</p><p><p ID="act">The HAG starts murmuring to herself. As he listens, HARRY realises she's singing -- a tuneless lament, remembered from long ago, sung without any understanding now. The emotion wells up in HARRY's eyes, even as he laughs at her. It's as if he's gazing into a crazy, distorted mirror. 
</p><p><p ID="act">The EMIR stares curiously as he catches the emotion in Harry's eyes. He suddenly signals for his men to part the lunatics. HARRY is dragged away from the shrieking HAG, and flung before him.

</p><p><p ID="act">Hundreds of shapes move forward in the darkness. At first they look like a herd of animals, but slowly we recognise the grunts and cries as human. Faces come at us out of the dark, screaming and cursing, shoving each other violently, raising their faces to the ceiling, gasping for air.
</p><p><p ID="act">As our eyes adjust to the light, the vision of hell intensifies. The PRISONERS are manacled and herded into a space no more than thirty feet wide. They circle the room in a clockwise direction, pushed on by each other in perpetual motion, afraid that if they stop they'll be sucked under the maelstrom and trampled underfoot.
</p><p><p ID="act">The most fortunate are those who've found a resting space in the corners of the room. They cling to the walls, fighting off anyone who tries to share their sanctuary. From somewhere amongst them we hear a familiar voice:

<P ID="dia">Get away! This is Ibrahim's space!
</p><p><p ID="act">TRENCH protects his corner, lashing out at anyone who tries to breach the space. He bellows at the top of his voice:

</p><p><p ID="act">As if to prove his point, a fight breaks out at the far side of the room. TRENCH stands on tiptoes, as eager as everyone else to see the outcome. TWO PRISONERS try to strangle each other with their chains, fighting for an inch of space. It's hard to make out anything in the dark, but the savagery of the fight is reflected in the speed of flailing fists and feet. One of the PRISONERS finally loses his footing. In an instant he's sucked under. The victor laughs maniacally. The loser's cries continue for a moment and then stop suddenly as the trampling feet break his neck.

</p><p><p ID="act">The PRISONERS closest to the door push away. The head guard, the towering IDRIS-ES-SAIER, tosses in a blazing torch to clear some space. A NEW PRISONER is flung inside and the door slammed shut behind him. The other PRISONERS surge back, trying to reclaim their space. There are cries of pain as some of them tread on the blazing torch. The sheer weight of men quickly puts it out.

<P ID="dia">Watch Ibrahim. He's going to fall. 
</p><p><p ID="act">The NEW PRISONER is swept up in the savage wave. As he approaches TRENCH's corner he tries to claw his way to safety. TRENCH beats him back with a flurry of blows. The prisoner disappears under the heaving bodies, but then he pops up again, gasping for breath. He fights with all his might, swinging his fists, clutching at anyone in his way. TRENCH looks impressed, but he knows it won't be long.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">trench 
<P ID="dia">He'll fall. Youssef will get him.
</p><p><p ID="act">As the NEW PRISONER swings towards them again, the prisoner behind him, YOUSSEF, slams his chains down on his head. The new arrival goes down hard. As he disappears, he screams out the name: "Trench!!!"
</p><p><p ID="act">TRENCH stares in disbelief, frozen for a moment, then bellowing like a bull, he charges out of his corner and flails his way through the heaving mass, trying to retrieve the fallen prisoner. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">TRENCH

Half a dozen BODIES lie crushed on the floor, those who didn't make it through the night. Those who did, are ushered outside by the PRISON GUARDS, into the merciless heat. TRENCH and IBRAHIM support the NEW PRISONER. A fat, oily looking Prison Guard, HASSAN, sneers at TRENCH on his way out.

The PRISONERS limp as fast as they can to receive any food their families have brought them. Before they can eat, the GUARDS have to be paid off, IDRIS first, then HASSAN and the others.

HARRY is in the thick of the fighting, elbowing and head-butting people out of his way. He's changed beyond recognition, and it isn't just physical. He fights with a primal savagery, oblivious to everything except the precious scrap of food. He finally gets hold of it, and swings his elbow round, breaking another PRISONER's nose.

</p><p><p ID="act">TRENCH can't move his jaw, let alone eat. HARRY chews the meat for him. When it's soft between his teeth, he spits it out, and feeds TRENCH with his fingers. For all the primal horror, there's a touching human tenderness in the moment. 
</p><p><p ID="act">Suddenly a pair of hands grab HARRY by the hair, and drag him away from TRENCH. It's IDRIS. The giant prison guard tears the scrap of meat from HARRY's hands and kicks him in the ribs for good measure.

</p><p><p ID="act">HASSAN turns and walks towards the fortress gates. The other PRISONERS scramble after him, desperate to receive their daily handout from their RELATIVES. HARRY thinks about wading in and fighting them for it, but he has no energy left. He collapses in the sand, staring up at the sun. As he closes his eyes, he suddenly hears a whisper:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ARAB BOY o/s
<P ID="dia">English...

HARRY sees the piece of chicken in his hand, and waves him over. The ARAB BOY finally kneels down, and offers him the chicken bone.  HARRY snatches it and gnaws on it like a hungry animal. It's only when he examines the meat, making sure there's enough left for Trench, that we realise how human he still is. He slips the half eaten chicken bone in his robes, and looks at the ARAB BOY gratefully. The ARAB BOY holds out some coins for him.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. GIANT TREE ROOT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY reaches out and grabs a jutting tree root. With his legs clamped around TRENCH, he pulls them out of the fastest point of the current. As he looks behind him he sees IDRIS disappear under the torrent. Catching his breath, HARRY starts to clamber along the root, trying to make it to the safety of the riverbank. TRENCH groans, fully conscious now.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harrY
<P ID="dia">We're going to make it.
</p><p><p ID="act">TRENCH stares at HARRY with an almost childlike trust.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harrY 
<P ID="dia">See if you can touch the bottom.
</p><p><p ID="act">TRENCH dips his feet under, nodding as they touch the riverbed. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harrY 
<P ID="dia">Grab the root.
</p><p><p ID="act">TRENCH grips the root. HARRY swims around him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">Now walk to the riverbank. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">treNCH
<P ID="dia">My legs are broken.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harry
<P ID="dia">Your legs are fine. The poison paralyses the body. It's worn off.
</p><p><p ID="act">Gripping the root, TRENCH starts to walk against the current, the water flowing up to his neck. Slowly the river shallows. HARRY looks relieved as his friend finally tumbles onto the riverbank and collapses. He's about to follow him, when suddenly a pair of hands shoot out of the water, and grab him around the neck. It's IDRIS. He's also managed to clamber his way to safety. With a howl of rage he pulls HARRY's face under the water. 
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY kicks and flails. With one huge hand IDRIS keeps him under the surface, with the other he holds onto the giant tree root. HARRY tries to loosen his grip, but he isn't strong enough. He reaches down into the riverbed, and gropes around until he finds a rock. He grinds it into IDRIS's wrist like a pummel stone.
</p><p><p ID="act">IDRIS whips his hand away in pain. HARRY is instantly sucked out of his grasp. The current smashes him headlong into another root, downriver. IDRIS stares at his escaped prey in fury. His anger clouds his reason. He lets go of his own root and lets the current drag him to HARRY's.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. RIVERbank/ OMDURMAN - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY drags himself towards the riverbank. He's only a few yards away when IDRIS's hands grab him again. HARRY turns around swinging and catches IDRIS on the jaw. Both of them tumble in the water. 
</p><p><p ID="act">They wrestle beneath the surface, then shoot up again, tearing at each other like wild animals. IDRIS grabs HARRY by the hair, and slams his face down on his knee, smashing his nose. The searing pain staggers HARRY. He tries to crawl away, but IDRIS stamps on his back, flattening him. He drops to his knees, and grinds HARRY's face into the riverbed.
</p><p><p ID="act">As he pulls him back up by the hair, we see HARRY's mangled features -- a mask of blood, eyes staring out, jaws hanging open in defeat. For a moment time seems to slow, then suddenly, shaking his head free, HARRY screams a savage, primal cry, and drives his elbow back into IDRIS's face, shattering bone and cartilege.
</p><p><p ID="act">IDRIS falls back, stunned. HARRY has his chance to get away, but he's not interested now. He wades after IDRIS, an expression of pure, uncontrollable rage in his eyes. As IDRIS tries to pick himself up, HARRY slams both fists into his mouth, smashing his teeth down his throat. 
</p><p><p ID="act">It's IDRIS's turn to look scared. He tries to crawl away, but the bloody faced demon is on him in seconds, ramming his head back under the water. IDRIS manages to kick him away briefly, but it only enrages HARRY. He comes back at IDRIS with a large rock between his hands, cracking his face open. 
</p><p><p ID="act">And still he isn't finished. Sitting astride the gurgling prison guard, HARRY raises both arms as high as they'll go, and smashes the rock into IDRIS's face, again and again. The guard's blood splatters all over him, but HARRY hardly seems to notice. He's gripped by a savage, primordial fury. Everything he's suffered has built up to this point. He's at his highest and lowest ebb. His hands whirr up and down, his eyes glow feverishly, his lips curl in a terrifying sneer. 
</p><p><p ID="act">Strong arms grab him from behind, but HARRY ignores them, hammering away. He's beyond hatred, beyond compassion, face to face with his deepest, darkest self. Again the arms try to pull him off, but HARRY brushes them aside. The blood and tears stream down his cheeks. He howls like an animal. His hands finally slow as his arms reach exhaustion. 
</p><p><p ID="act">This time ABOU FATMA manages to pull him off. HARRY collapses in his arms and weeps like a baby, finally breaking out of the darkness, no longer sure who or what he is anymore. ABOU FATMA holds him tightly, hushing him, comforting him, understanding.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. country lane/ bintree/ england - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">A primal silence. Mist hovers over the emerald fields. In the distance a carriage approaches. As it draws nearer, we see HARRY, sitting in the back. His scars have healed, but his eyes have the far away look of someone who's seen too much. The outlines of the village church appear through the fog. HARRY hears a dog barking.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="spkdir">(To the Driver)
<P ID="dia">Could you stop here.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. church/ bintree - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">The barking grows louder as HARRY enters the churchyard. He sees a Collie, tied to a post. It's Dermod's dog. HARRY bends down and strokes the animal. Then he looks up through the open church door.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. church/ bintree - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">At first HARRY doesn't see ETHNE. She sits quietly in one of the Church pews. It's only as she hears his footsteps that she turns around. Her eyes stop still. She stares at him in silence, taking in the ravages of time. All the diffidence and boyish charm she remembers have long since disappeared. In their place, there's an inner strength, and confidence. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Everyone said how much you'd changed. I didn't believe them.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">Do I look that bad?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">Trench came to see me last week. He looked a good deal worse than you.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">He's suffered more.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">That isn't what he told me.
</p><p><p ID="act">She stares at him with quiet pride.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">May I have it back?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">That isn't why I came.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">I'd still like it back.
<P ID="spkdir">(She smiles sadly)
<P ID="dia">I have three of them, I'd like four.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY stares at her, then takes out the fourth feather.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">I'm almost sorry to let it go. It's brought me a lot of luck these past few months. 
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE takes the feather, unable to look at him. She stares at it in silence.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">When did you get back?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">Two weeks ago.
</p><p><p ID="act">She looks hurt that it's taken him so long to come and see her, but she knows she has no right to expect more. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">I'm glad you did what you did, on your own, without anyone's help. I'm glad for you, Harry.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">I did nothing on my own. You were with me the whole time. 
</p><p><p ID="act">The tears begin to shine in her eyes. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">You've heard our news?...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">Yes.
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE nods, unable to continue. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">I didn't come here to change your mind. 
<P ID="spkdir">(With quiet dignity)
<P ID="dia">The most I hoped for -- and I hoped for it every day -- was that I could do enough to save the memory of what we had. So that you wouldn't always be ashamed of the time we spent together. 
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE is too ashamed of herself to answer him. Her eyes drift to a crack of sunlight on the church wall, glinting through the stained glass windows. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">What are you thinking?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">You'd laugh if I told you.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">harrY
<P ID="dia">That might not be a bad thing.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">I was thinking I'd get up and leave when that patch of sunlight disappeared. So far it's been quite resilient.
</p><p><p ID="act">She smiles gently. For a moment they're the Harry and Ethne of old.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">I passed by your appartment the other day.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="spkdir">(Surprised)
<P ID="dia">When?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">When you didn't come and see me...
<P ID="spkdir">(She smiles sadly)
<P ID="dia">I was in London for the day. It took me hours to pluck up the courage. When I finally drove by, your lights were off. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">I've hardly been out since I got back.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">It was last Friday. Between five and six.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="spkdir">(Pausing)
<P ID="dia">I'd gone to see my father.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="spkdir">(Smiling ironically)
<P ID="dia">Someone must be watching over us.
</p><p><p ID="act">The sunlight lingers precariously on the wall. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">It will pass. You'll meet someone soon. Then you and her, and Jack and I, will sit over tea and chatter politely, as if there was never anything between us.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">That won't happen.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">It has to happen.
<P ID="spkdir">(The tears fill her eyes)
<P ID="dia">Because I love you Harry...and I can't. I can't.
</p><p><p ID="act">The sunlight on the wall finally fades. ETHNE wipes her tears and gets up to leave. As she tries to walk past him, HARRY takes her in his arms. She doesn't resist. If anything she's relieved. They stay like that for a moment, holding each other, unable to do anything else. We feel their desperate longing, but there's a self imposed wall that keeps them apart. ETHNE pulls away gently.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="dia">I'll take you to the station.
</p><p><p ID="act">He nods.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">I wanted to look in on Jack. I'll leave him a note.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ETHNE
<P ID="spkdir">(Considering)
<P ID="dia">No, he'd love to see you. He's staying at the vicarage. It's on the way.
</p><p><p ID="act">They're polite around each other now, like strangers. ETHNE slips past him with an awkward smile. HARRY waits before he follows her. They walk down the aisle, several feet apart.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. DURRANCE's room/ vicarage/ glenalla - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE sits at a table, knotting his tie. There's a determination in his eyes, as if the smallest activity has become a battle to be won. Suddenly he hears the noise of Ethne's carriage outside. His face lights up. He feels his way towards the window. 
</p><p><p ID="act">The carriage door takes a long time to open. DURRANCE stares curiously. Finally he hears footsteps on the gravel. They're heavier than he expected. They stop a moment. DURRANCE knows whoever it is, is staring up at him in the window. He looks thoughtful now, as if he knows who it is. 
</p><p><p ID="act">He turns away from the window and finds a chair. He sits, facing the door, checking to make sure the carafe of Scotch and the crystal glasses are within easy reach. The footsteps climb the stairs. There's a knock on the door.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Come in.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY enters. He stops as he sees his friend. DURRANCE's face has softened from inactivity. His skin seems pale compared to Harry's coarse, sunburnt features. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">It's good to see you, Harry. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="spkdir">(Quietly impressed)
<P ID="dia">How did you know?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">A calculated guess. 
<P ID="spkdir">(He grins)
<P ID="dia">Scotch alright?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">Perfect.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I've got to cut down on the stuff. I'm putting on weight. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">You look good.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Not as good as you, I'm sure.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY watches his friend, taking the carafe, pouring two perfect glasses. Everything Durrance does, is designed to show him he's alright, that there's nothing to pity. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(Handing him the drink)
<P ID="dia">I heard Ethne's carriage outside?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">She's giving me a ride to the station.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Why didn't she come up?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="spkdir">(He knows the question isn't as casual as it sounds)
<P ID="dia">I think she wanted to give us a few minutes alone. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Do we need a few minutes alone? 
</p><p><p ID="act">Even though he's smiling, the air is thick with tension.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">I came to thank you, Jack.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">For what? 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">For standing by me.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">If you're talking about the feathers, I wasn't there.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">Willoughby told me you were. He said you'd tried to talk them out of it. 
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE hesitates. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">You don't owe me anything Harry. The wedding isn't for another month. Ethne's free to make up her own mind.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">You don't owe me anything either, Jack. And she's made up her mind. You should trust her judgement.
</p><p><p ID="act">A long silence. DURRANCE is too proud to respond. HARRY stares at his friend, regretting the wall between them.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">I'd better go. I'll miss my train. I'll come and see you soon.
</p><p><p ID="act">He finishes his drink and gets up. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Have another one.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">I can't Jack.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Please.
</p><p><p ID="act">His voice is softer now, more conciliatory. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">The friendship was the best thing about that place. It's the one thing I haven't been able to hang onto. 
</p><p><p ID="act">It's his way of asking Harry to stay. HARRY sits again.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I've become like one of those old soldiers we used to laugh at. Forcing my stories on everyone. Enough medals on my uniform to light up a Christmas tree.
<P ID="spkdir">(Filling their glasses)
<P ID="dia">Have they given you back your commission?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">They haven't acknowledged me in any way.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I suppose it wouldn't be the British Army if they admitted their mistakes.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">I don't know if it was a mistake. I was never a real soldier like you.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">A real soldier doesn't come back in a hospital ship. 
<P ID="spkdir">(Raising his glass)
<P ID="dia">To Castelton and all the others we left behind.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY watches his friend down his whisky, sensing the guilt and pain inside. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="spkdir">(Reassuring him gently)
<P ID="dia">You did everything you could.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">You saw it happen?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">From a distance. I remember the entire British Square retreating in perfect order, and then these two lunatics, charging out to save their friend.
<P ID="spkdir">(He smiles affectionately)
<P ID="dia">I remember thinking there wasn't a bullet in the world that could stop you that day.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(Ironically)
<P ID="dia">Except my own.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">You obviously weren't meant to die. You certainly tried your best.
</p><p><p ID="act">DURRANCE chuckles, close to tears, holding them back.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">It's hard to talk like this with anyone else. They all want to know how many people you've killed, but the moment you mention the friends you've lost, their eyes glaze over.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">They weren't there.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">No.
<P ID="spkdir">(A beat)
<P ID="dia">Do you ever miss the desert Harry?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">I'm glad I'm home.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">It was the best time of my life. Whenever anyone had a problem they came to me. I never felt so needed. __
<P ID="spkdir">(He smiles)
<P ID="dia">Maybe we should change places.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY isn't sure what he means. DURRANCE tops up their glasses.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">You remember the first time we led a cavalry charge in public?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">You wiped the floor with me. Most of my horses ended up in the bandstand.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">Ethne was watching.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="spkdir">(Hesitating)
<P ID="dia">That's right.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">We'd met her the previous night, at the regimental ball.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="dia">I remember.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">You should. You were the only one she danced with.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY smiles but doesn't say anything. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">I've never been so jealous. I stayed up all night brooding. The next day I was determined to show you up -- prove to her I was the better soldier.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">hARRY
<P ID="spkdir">(Affectionately)
<P ID="dia">You were always the better soldier. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">And it still didn't make a difference.
<P ID="spkdir">(He smiles wistfully)
<P ID="dia">She was the first person I looked for in the crowd, and she was staring at you. Everyone else was applauding me, and she was staring at you.
<P ID="spkdir">(A beat)
<P ID="dia">I'm not sure if anything's changed.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY can't speak. He knows what DURRANCE is saying.  
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="spkdir">(Raising his glass)
<P ID="dia">To us Harry.
</p><p><p ID="act">He leans over, grinning, and touches Harry's glass.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DURRANCE
<P ID="dia">To you.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. churchyard/ glenalla - day.
</p><p><p ID="act">Church bells chime, drowned out by the excited GUESTS. The Wedding party has gathered outside the chapel, waiting for the bride. There's a flurry of activity as Ethne's carriage finally draws up. FRIENDS and FAMILY run over to greet her.
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY's PARTY stays behind at the Church door, preparing him for her imminent arrival. GENERAL FEVERSHAM and COLONEL SUTCH make last minute adjustments to HARRY's suit and tie. WILLOUGHBY reminds TRENCH to make sure he's still got the ring.
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE finally emerges from the carriage, looking radiant in a white dress. HARRY tries to catch a glimpse of her, but TRENCH covers his eyes, as if it's still bad luck to see his bride. 
</p><p><p ID="act">ETHNE laughs as she walks past them into the church, accompanied by her FATHER. TRENCH waits until she's safely inside, before he removes his hands from Harry's eyes. HARRY looks around, hoping to see Durrance amongst the crowd. 
</p><p><p ID="act">His friend is nowhere to be seen. HARRY smiles at the other GUESTS, but he seems distracted, as if he knows in his heart Durrance won't show. Slowly the CROWD outside thins until only HARRY, TRENCH, and WILLOUGHBY remain. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">trENCH
<P ID="dia">Ready?
</p><p><p ID="act">HARRY has one last look for Durrance, still hoping against hope, then he nods and follows his friends inside. 
</p><p><p ID="act">The noise of the choir fades as the doors close behind them. For a moment we're left in the balmly stillness of the churchyard, and then, in it's place, we hear the unmistakeable whisper of the desert wind.
