                              Romeo + Juliet

                                    by

                            William Shakespeare






                              ANCHOR WOMAN
          Two households both alike in dignity in fair Verona, 
          Where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to 
          new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands 
          unclean, From forth the fatal loins of these two 
          foes, A pair of star crossed lovers take their life, 
          Whose misadventured piteous overthrows doth with 
          their death, Bury their parents strife. The fearful 
          passage of their death marked love, And the 
          continuance of their parents rage, Which but their 
          children's end not could remove, Is now the two hours 
          traffic of our stage.    
          
                              SAMPSON
          A dog of the house of Capulet moves me! 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          The quarrel is between our masters. 
          
                              GREGORY
          And us their men. 
          
                              SAMPSON
          Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble. And I am a pretty 
          piece of flesh, I am a pretty piece of Flesh! Here 
          comes of the house of Capulet! 
          
                              GREGORY
          Quarrel, I will back thee. 
          
                              ABRAHAM
          Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha. 
          
                              SAMPSON
          I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to 
          them, if they bear it. 
          
                              ABRAHAM
          Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? 
          
                              SAMPSON
          I do bite my thumb, sir! 
          
                              ABRAHAM
          Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir. 
          
                              SAMPSON
               [Aside to GREGORY] 
          Is the law on our side, if I say ay? 
          
                              GREGORY
          No! 
          
                              SAMPSON
          No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I 
          bite my thumb, sir.  
          
                              GREGORY
          Do you quarrel, sir? 
          
                              ABRAHAM
          Quarrel sir! no, sir. 
          
                              SAMPSON
          If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man 
          as you. 
          
                              ABRAHAM
          No better? 
          
                              SAMPSON
          Uh? Uh? 
          
                              GREGORY
          Here comes our kinsmen say better! 
          
                              SAMPSON
          Yes, sir better. 
          
                              ABRAHAM
          You lie. Draw, if you be men. 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Part, fools! you know not what you do. Put up your 
          swords. 
          
                              TYBALT
          What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? 
          Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.  
          
                              BENVOLIO
          I do but keep the peace.  Put up thy sword, Or manage 
          it to part these men with me.  
          
                              TYBALT
          Peace. Peace? I hate the word, As I hate hell, all 
          Montagues, and thee.  
          
                              BOY
          Bang Bang! Bang Bang!  
          
                              TYBALT
          Bang. 
          
                              MONTAGUE
          Give me my long sword, ho! 
          
                              LADY MONTAGUE
          Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe. 
          
                              PRINCE
          Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, Throw your 
          mistemper'd weapons to the ground! On pain of 
          torture, from those bloody hands Throw your 
          mistemper'd weapons to the ground! Three civil 
          brawls, bred of an airy word, By thee, old Capulet, 
          and Montague, Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our 
          streets, If ever you disturb our streets again, Your 
          lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. 
          
                              LADY MONTAGUE
          O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day? Right glad I 
          am he was not at this fray.  
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Madam, underneath a grove of sycamore so early 
          walking did I see your son. 
          
                              MONTAGUE
          Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears 
          augmenting the fresh morning dew. 
          
                              LADY MONTAGUE
          Away from the light steals home my heavy son, And 
          private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his 
          windows, locks far daylight out And makes himself an 
          artificial night. 
          
                              MONTAGUE
          Black and portentous must this humour prove, Unless 
          good counsel may the cause remove. 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          So please you, step aside; I'll know his grievance, 
          or be much denied.  
          
                              MONTAGUE
          Come, madam, let's away.  
          
                              ROMEO
          Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything 
          of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious 
          vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms. 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Good-morrow, cousin. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Is the day so young? 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          But new struck cuz. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that 
          went hence so fast?  
          
                              BENVOLIO
          It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours? 
          
                              ROMEO
          Not having that, which, having, makes them short. 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          In love? 
          
                              ROMEO
          Out-- 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Of love? 
          
                              ROMEO
          Out of her favour, where I am in love. 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so 
          tyrannous and rough in proof!  
          
                              ROMEO
          Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, 
          without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall 
          we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, 
          for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, 
          but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O 
          loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O 
          heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of 
          well-seeming forms! Feather of lead--
               [Benvolio Snickers]
          Dost thou not laugh?  
          
                              BENVOLIO
          No, cuz, I rather weep. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Good heart, at what? 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          At thy good heart's oppression. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Farewell, my cuz.  
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do 
          me wrong.  
          
                              CAPULET
          But Montague is bound as well as I, In penalty alike; 
          and 'tis not hard, I think, For men so old as we to 
          keep the peace.  
          
                              PARIS
          Of honourable reckoning are you both; And pity 'tis 
          you lived at odds so long. But now, my lord, what say 
          you to my suit?  
          
                              CAPULET
          But saying o'er what I have said before: My child is 
          yet a stranger in the world; Let two more summers 
          wither in their pride,  Ere we may think her ripe to 
          be a bride.  
          
                              PARIS
          Younger than she are happy mothers made. 
          
                              CAPULET
          And too soon marr'd are those so early made. This 
          night I hold an old accustom'd feast, At my poor 
          house look to behold this night Fresh female buds 
          that make dark heaven light.  Hear all, all see, 
          Come, go with me.  
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Tell me in sadness, who is that you love. 
          
                              ROMEO
          In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.  
          
                              BENVOLIO
          I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved. 
          
                              ROMEO
          A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love. 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With 
          Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing 
          eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold: 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? 
          
                              ROMEO
          She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.  
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Be ruled by me, forget to think of her. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Teach me how I should forget to think. 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other 
          beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad? 
          
                              ROMEO
          Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in 
          prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. 
          Good day, good fellow.  
          
                              NEWSCASTER
          Now I'll tell you without asking the great rich 
          Capulet holds an old accustomed feast--A fair 
          assembly. Signior Placentio and his lovely daughters. 
          The lady widow of Vitravio; and her lovely nieces 
          Rosaline. 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair 
          Rosaline whom thou so lovest, With all the admired 
          beauties of Verona: 
          
                              NEWSCASTER
          If you be not of the house of Montague come and crush 
          a cup of wine. 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Go thither; and, with untainted eye, Compare her face 
          with some that I shall show, And I will make thee 
          think thy swan a crow. 
          
                              ROMEO
          I'll go along, no such sight to be shown, But to 
          rejoice in splendor of mine own. 
          
                              LADY CAPULET
          J U L I E T ! ! ! ! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet! Nurse. 
          Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me. 
          
                              NURSE
          I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet! 
          
                              JULIET
          Madam, I am here. What is your will?  
          
                              LADY CAPULET
          Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret.  
          Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's 
          hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's 
          of a pretty age. 
          
                              NURSE
          Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed. 
          
                              LADY CAPULET
          By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, 
          You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant 
          Paris seeks you for his love.  
          
                              NURSE
          A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world-
          -why, he's a man of wax.  
          
                              LADY CAPULET
          Verona's summer hath not such a flower. 
          
                              NURSE
          Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower. 
          
                              LADY CAPULET
          This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read 
          o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find 
          delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious 
          book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, 
          only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he 
          doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.  
          
                              NURSE
          Nay, bigger; women grow by men. 
          
                              LADY CAPULET
          Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love? 
          
                              JULIET
          I'll look to like, if looking liking move: But no 
          more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent to 
          give strength to make it fly.  
          
                              SERVANT
          Madam, the guests are come. 
          
                              LADY CAPULET
          Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah! 
          
                              NURSE
          Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up 
          like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must 
          have you dance. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With 
          nimble soles: I have a soul of lead  
          
                              MERCUTIO
          You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with 
          them above a common bound.  
          
                              ROMEO
          Under love's heavy burden do I sink.   
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Too great oppression for a tender thing.  
          
                              ROMEO
          Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, 
          too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.  
          
                              MERCUTIO
          If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick 
          love for pricking, and you beat love down. 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Every man betake him to his legs.  
          
                              ROMEO
          But 'tis no wit to go.  
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Why, may one ask? 
          
                              ROMEO
          I dream'd a dream to-night. 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          And so did I. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Well, what was yours? 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          That dreamers often lie. 
          
                              ROMEO
          In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is 
          the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no 
          bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an 
          alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over 
          men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an 
          empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, 
          And in this state she gallops night by night Through 
          lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er 
          lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, 
          Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then 
          dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus 
          frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. 
          This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That 
          presses them and learns them first to bear, Making 
          them women of good carriage: This is she--This is 
          she!  
          
                              ROMEO
          Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.  
          
                              MERCUTIO
          True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an 
          idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which 
          is as thin of substance as the air And more 
          inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the 
          frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs 
          away from thence, Turning his face to the dew-
          dropping south.  
          
                              BENVOLIO
          This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; 
          Supper is done, and we shall come too late.  
          
                              ROMEO
          I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some 
          consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly 
          begin his fearful date With this night's revels and 
          expire the term Of a despised life closed within my 
          breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But 
          He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my 
          sail! On, lusty gentlemen.  
          
                              ROMEO
          Your drugs are quick. 
          
                              CAPULET
          Ahhh! I have seen the day That I could tell A 
          whispering tale in a fair lady's ear, Such as would 
          please. 
          
                              NURSE
          Madam, your mother calls. Come, lets away. 
          
                              PARIS
          Will you now deny to dance? 
          
                              LADY CAPULET
          A man young lady, such a man. 
          
                              TYBALT
          What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn 
          at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my 
          kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.  
          
                              CAPULET
          Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so? 
          
                              TYBALT
          Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our 
          foe. 
          
                              CAPULET
          Young Romeo is it? 
          
                              TYBALT
          'Tis he. 
          
                              CAPULET
          Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him 
          alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town 
          Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be 
          patient, take no note of him 
          
                              TYBALT
          I'll not endure him.  
          
                              CAPULET
          He shall be endured 
          
                              TYBALT
          Uncle, 'tis a shame. 
          
                              CAPULET
          Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; 
          Make a mutiny among my guests?!  
          
                              ROMEO
          Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I 
          ne'er saw true beauty till this night.  
          
                              ROMEO
          If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy 
          shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing 
          pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with 
          a tender kiss.  
          
                              JULIET
          Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which 
          mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have 
          hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm 
          is holy palmers' kiss.  
          
                              ROMEO
          Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? 
          
                              JULIET
          Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; 
          They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.  
          
                              JULIET
          Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus 
          from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.  
          
                              JULIET
          Then have my lips the sin that they have took. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me 
          my sin again.  
          
                              JULIET
          You kiss by the book. 
          
                              NURSE
          Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets 
          away. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Is she a Capulet?  
          
                              NURSE
          His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son 
          of your great enemy.  
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Away, begone; the sport is at the best. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest. 
          
                              JULIET
          My only love sprung from my only hate! Too early seen 
          unknown, and known too late! Prodigious birth of love 
          it is to me, That I must love a loathed enemy.  
          
                              TYBALT
          I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall Now seeming 
          sweet convert to bitterous gall. 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Romeo! Romeo! 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure 
          thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead 
          and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg 
          and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open 
          ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll 
          to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me 
          to sleep. 
          
                              ROMEO
          He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! 
          what light through yonder window breaks? It is the 
          east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and 
          kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale 
          with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than 
          she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her 
          vestal livery is but sick and green And none but 
          fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, 
          it is my love! O, that she knew she were!  
          
                              JULIET
          Ay me! 
          
                              ROMEO
          She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel! 
          
                              JULIET
          Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy 
          father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be 
          but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.  
          
                              ROMEO
               [Aside]
          Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this? 
          
                              JULIET
          'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, 
          though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor 
          hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part 
          Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in 
          a name? that which we call a rose By any other word 
          would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not 
          Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he 
          owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And 
          for that name which is no part of thee Take all 
          myself.  
          
                              ROMEO
          I take thee at thy word. 
          
                              JULIET
          Ahhh! 
          
                              JULIET
          Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?  
          
                              ROMEO
          Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike. 
          
                              JULIET
          How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The 
          garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the 
          place death, considering who thou art, If any of my 
          kinsmen find thee here.  
          
                              ROMEO
          With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; 
          For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love 
          can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen 
          are no let to me.  
          
                              JULIET
          If they do see thee, they will murder thee. 
          
                              ROMEO
          I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And 
          but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were 
          better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, 
          wanting of thy love.  
          
                              JULIET
          Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else 
          would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which 
          thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell 
          on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but 
          farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou 
          wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou 
          swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If 
          thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully: 
          
                              ROMEO
          Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with 
          silver all these fruit-tree tops--  
          
                              JULIET
          O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That 
          monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy 
          love prove likewise variable.  
          
                              ROMEO
          Well what shall I swear by? 
          
                              JULIET
          Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy 
          gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And 
          I'll believe thee.  
          
                              ROMEO
          If my heart's dear love-- 
          
                              JULIET
          Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy 
          of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too 
          unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which 
          doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' 
          Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's 
          ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when 
          next we meet. Good night.

          O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? 
          
                              JULIET
          What satisfaction canst thou have to-night? 
          
                              ROMEO
          The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

          I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!

          Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If 
          that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose 
          marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll 
          procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou 
          wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy

          A thousand times good night! Exit, above 
          
                              ROMEO
          A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love

                              ROMEO
          By the hour of nine.

          I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.  
          
                              JULIET
          Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,

                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, 
          herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought 
          so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth 
          some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but 
          strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, 
          stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being 
          misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. 
          Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is 
          resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, 
          with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays 
          all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings 
          encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and 
          rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full 
          soon the canker death eats up that plant.

          Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?

          Good marrow, Romeo. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Good marrow. 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to 
          bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then 
          here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed 
          tonight. 
          
                              ROMEO
          The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine. 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!? 
          
                              ROMEO
          Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that 
          name, and that name's woe. 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          That's my good son: but where hast thou been 
          
                              ROMEO
          I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a 
          sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; 
          both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic 
          lies. 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling 
          confession finds but riddling shrift. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the 
          fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we 
          made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but 
          this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today. 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is 
          Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon 
          forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in 
          their hearts but in their eyes. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline. 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          For doting; not for loving, pupil mine. 
          
                              ROMEO
          I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace 
          for grace and love for love allow; the other did not 
          so. 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not 
          spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one 
          respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may 
          so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure 
          love. 
          
                              ROMEO
          O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste. 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast. 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not 
          home to-night?  
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Not to his father's; I spoke with his man. 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. 
          Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.  
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a 
          letter to his father's house.  
          
                              MERCUTIO
          A challenge, on my life. 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Romeo will answer it? 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Any man that can write may answer a letter. 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he 
          dares, being dared.  
          
                              MERCUTIO
          But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with 
          a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with 
          a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the 
          blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to 
          encounter Tybalt?  
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Why, what is Tybalt? 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          More than prince of cats. He is the courageous 
          captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick-
          song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests 
          his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your 
          bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, 
          a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of 
          the first and second cause: the immortal passado! 
          punto reverso! the hai!  
          
                              BENVOLIO
          The what? 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Here comes Romeo. Romeo! 
          
                              ROMEO
          Ho Ho, Capital Punks! 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation 
          to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit 
          fairly last night.  
          
                              ROMEO
          Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give 
          you? 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive? 
          
                              ROMEO
          Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in 
          such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.  
          
                              MERCUTIO
          That's as much as to say, such a case as yours 
          constrains a man to bow in the hams.  
          
                              ROMEO
          Meaning, to court'sy. 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Thou hast most kindly hit it. 
          
                              ROMEO
          A most courteous exposition. 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Pink for flower. 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Right. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Why, then is my pump well flowered. 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; 
          now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by 
          nature. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Here's goodly gear! 
          
                              NURSE
          I desire some confidence with you.  
          
                              MERCUTIO
          A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho! Romeo! Romeo! Romeo! 
          Will you come to your father's? we'll to dinner, 
          thither.  
          
                              ROMEO
          I will follow you. 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, 
          
                              NURSE
          If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they 
          say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they 
          say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you 
          should deal double with her, truly it were an ill 
          thing, and very weak dealing.  
          
                              ROMEO
          Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And 
          there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived 
          and married.  
          
                              JULIET
          O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?  
          
                              NURSE
          I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones 
          ache! what a jaunt have I!  
          
                              JULIET
          I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray 
          thee, speak.  
          
                              NURSE
          What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see 
          that I am out of breath?  
          
                              JULIET
          How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To 
          say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news 
          good, or bad? answer to that; 
          
                              NURSE
          Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how 
          to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face 
          be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all 
          men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body, 
          
                              JULIET
          But all this did I know before. What says he of our 
          marriage? what of that?  
          
                              NURSE
          Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my 
          back! Other' other side,--O, my back. 
          
                              JULIET
          I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, 
          sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?  
          
                              NURSE
          Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a 
          courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I 
          warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?   
          
                              JULIET
          Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your 
          love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your 
          mother?'  
          
                              NURSE
          O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your 
          messages yourself.  
          
                              JULIET
          Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo? 
          
                              NURSE
          Have you got leave to go to confession to-day? 
          
                              JULIET
          I have. 
          
                              NURSE
          Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There 
          stays a husband to make you a wife 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          These violent delights have violent ends. And in 
          their triumph die; like fire and powder, which as

          hot. the Capel's are abroad, and if we meet we shall 
          not 'scape a brawl, for in these hot day is the mad 
          blood stirring. 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these 
          fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern 
          claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send 
          me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the 
          second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there 
          is no need. 
          
                              BENVOLIO
          Am I like Such a fellow?

          Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one 
          of you? 
          
                              MERCUTIO
          OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with 
          something. Make it a word and a...a blow. 
          
                              TYBALT
          You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you 
          will give me occasion. 
          
                              MERCUTIO

          make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of 
          discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall

          O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see 
          thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom 
          of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, 
          for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but 
          send him back. 
          
                              GLORIA
          Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put 
          thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day 
          of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for. 
          
                              JULIET
          Madam, in happy time what day is that? 
          
                              GLORIA
          Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young 
          and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's 
          Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride. 
          
                              JULIET
          What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he 
          shall not make me there a joyful bride! 
          
                              GLORIA
          Here comes your father, tell him so yourself. 
          
                              CAPULET
          How now, wife? Have you delivered to her our decree? 
          
                              GLORIA
          Ay Sir! But she will none, she gives you thanks. I 
          would the fool were married to her grave. 
          
                              CAPULET
          How? Will she none? Is she not proud? Doth she not 
          count her blest, unworthy as she is, that we have 
          wrought so worth a gentleman to be her bride? 
          
                              JULIET
          Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. Proud 
          can I never be of what I hate! 
          
                              CAPULET
          Thanks me no thanking, nor proud me no prouds, But 
          fettle your joints 'gainst Thursday next. 
          
                              JULIET
          Hear me with patience. 
          
                              CAPULET
          Speak not, reply not, do not answer me. 
          
                              GLORIA
          Fie, Fie, are you mad? 
          
                              CAPULET
          Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch. 
          
                              NURSE
          God in heaven bless her! You are to blame my lord, to 
          rate her so! 
          
                              CAPULET
          Peace you mumbling fool! I tell thee what-get thee to 
          church o' Thursday Or never after look me in the face 
          an you be mine, I give you to my friend. An you be 
          not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, Trust to 
          it. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn! 
          
                              JULIET
          O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this 
          marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make 
          the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt 
          lies. 
          
                              GLORIA
          Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou 
          wilt for I have done with thee. 
          
                              JULIET
          O God!--O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? What 
          sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some 
          comfort nurse. 
          
                              NURSE
          Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with 
          this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you 
          are happy in this second match, for it excels your 
          first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 
          'twere as good he were as living here and you no use 
          to him. 
          
                              JULIET
          Speakest thou from thy heart? 
          
                              NURSE
          And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both. 
          
                              JULIET
          Amen 
          
                              NURSE
          What? 
          
                              JULIET
          Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in 
          and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my 
          father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be 
          absolved. 
          
                              DAVE
          Immoderately she weeps for Tybalts death. Now, sir, 
          her father counts it dangerous that she doth give her 
          sorrow so much sway, and in his wisdom hastes our 
          marriage to stop the inundation of her tears. Happily 
          met, my lady, and my wife. 
          
                              JULIET
          That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. 
          
                              PARIS
          That &quot;may be,&quot; must be, love, on Thursday next. 
          
                              JULIET
          What must be, shall be. 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          Well, that's a certain text. 
          
                              DAVE
          Come you to make confession? 
          
                              JULIET
          Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come 
          to you at evening mass? 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must 
          entreat the time alone. 
          
                              DAVE
          God shield I Should disturb devotion. Juliet, on 
          Thursday early will I rouse Ye, Till then, adieu, and 
          keep this holy kiss. 
          
                              JULIET
          Tell me not, Father, that thou hearest of this, 
          Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          It strains me past the compass of my wits. 
          
                              JULIET
          If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but 
          call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it 
          presently! 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          Hold Daughter! 
          
                              JULIET
          Be not so long to speak I long to die. 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate 
          and execution as that is desperate which we would 
          prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast 
          the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is 
          likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to 
          chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall 
          testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple 
          government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, 
          like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning 
          comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou 
          dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault 
          where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the 
          meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my 
          letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And 
          that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to 
          Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and 
          this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my 
          letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua. 
          
                              JULIET
          What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be 
          married then tomorrow morning? 
          
                              GLORIA
          What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help? 
          
                              JULIET
          No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our 
          behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let 
          me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night 
          sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands 
          full in all this so sudden business. 
          
                              GLORIA
          Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need. 
          
                              JULIET
          Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again. 
          
                              GLORIA
          Goodnight. 
          
                              JULIET
          Romeo, I drink to thee. 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to 
          church. 
          
                              ROMEO
          And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me 
          above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my 
          lady came and found me dead and breathed such life 
          with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an 
          emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed 
          when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News 
          from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring 
          me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my 
          Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can 
          be ill if she be well. 
          
                              BALTHASAR
          If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body 
          rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with 
          the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for 
          bringing these ill news. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence 
          tonight. 
          
                              BALTHASAR
          Have patience! 
          
                              ROMEO
          Leave Me! 
          
                              BALTHASAR
          Your looks are pale and wild and do import some 
          misadventure. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me 
          from the priest? 
               [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] 
          No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee 
          tonight. I will hence tonight.

                              ROMEO
          Let me have a dram of poison, such some speeding 
          gear, as will disperse itself through all the veins, 
          that the life weary taker may fall dead 
          
                              CRUSTY
          Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death 
          to any that utters them. 
          
                              ROMEO
          The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then 
          be not poor, but break it, and take this. 
          
                              CRUSTY
          My poverty, but not my will consents. 
          
                              ROMEO
          I pay thy poverty, and not thy will. 
          
                              CRUSTY
          Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty 
          men it would dispatch you straight. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than 
          these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell. 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          The letter was of dear import. 
          
                              CLERK
          I could not send it nor get a messenger to bring it 
          thee. 
          
                              FATHER LAWRENCE
          The neglecting it may do much damage.

          Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow. 
          
                              BALTHASAR
          Then I'll leave thee.

          Hold! Hold! 
          
                              ROMEO
          O my love, my wife, Death that hath sucked the honey 
          of thy breath, hath no power yet upon thy beauty, 
          thou art not conquered. Beauty's ensign yet is 
          crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, and death's 
          pale flag is not advanced there. Ah, dear Juliet, why 
          art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe that 
          unsubstantial death is amorous and keeps thee here in 
          the dark to be his paramour? For fear of that I still 
          will stay thee. Here, oh, here will I set up my 
          everlasting rest, and shake the yoke of inauspicious 
          stars from this world-wearied flesh. Eyes look your 
          last, arms take your last embrace, and lips, O you 
          the doors to breath, seal with a righteous kiss. A 
          dateless bargain, to engrossing death. 
          
                              JULIET
          Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no 
          friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. 
          Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips 
          are warm. 
          
                              ROMEO
          Thus..... with a kiss...... I die. 
          
                              CAPTIAN PRINCE
          See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, that 
          heaven finds means to kill your joys with love. And 
          I, for winking at your discords too, have lost a 
          brace of kinsman. All are Punished. ALL ARE PUNISHED! 
          
                              ANCHOR WOMAN
          A glooming peace this morning with it brings, the 
          sun, for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to 
          have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be 
          pardoned and some punished.  For never was a story of 
          more woe, than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
