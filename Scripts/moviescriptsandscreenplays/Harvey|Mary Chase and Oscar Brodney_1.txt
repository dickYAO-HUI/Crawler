	come back and spoil everything after the
	guests arrive?

	VETA - Oh of course not, dear. Your uncle
	always spends the afternoon down town at
	those filthy bars and taverns. You know

	started. Why, Miss Johnson, what are you
	doing?

	MISS JOHNSON - Leaving.

	serve as well as cater. Our guests will be
	here any minute.

	MYRTLE - Now Miss Johnson --

	VETA - Now Myrtle, let me handle this,
	dear. Miss Johnson, what's wrong?

	MISS JOHNSON - There was a man here a
	minute ago and he stopped and he spoke to
	me.

	VETA - You didn't tell him anything about

	MISS JOHNSON - I didn't tell him nothin' -

	MISS JOHNSON - Do you think I'd stay in
	this house after that?

	MYRTLE - Oh mother, people get run over by
	trucks every day. Why can't something like
	that happen to Uncle Elwood?

	VETA - Myrtle Mae Simmons! I'm ashamed of
	you. Even if people do call your uncle
	peculiar, he is still my baby brother and
	this thing is not his fault.

	MYRTLE - Whose fault is it then?

	VETA - Now we'll get the cook to do the

	poise, dear. I want you to charm Mrs.

	KELLY - I had to give a hypo to upper

	SANDERSON - I want you to telephone this
	Elwood P. Dowd right away. His sister's
	condition is serious.

	KELLY - Uh - but, Doctor, I --

	SANDERSON - He'll have to sign these
	commitment papers for her.

	KELLY - But I didn't know the woman needed
	the treatment! She said it was her brother!

	SANDERSON - Of course she did! That's the
	oldest dodge in the world. Always used by
	a cunning type of psychopath. She knew her
	brother was about to commit her so she
	came down here to discredit him. Get him
	on the phone, please.

	KELLY - But, Doctor, I thought the woman
	was all right, so I had Wilson take the
	brother up to Number Twenty-four - South
	Wing, G. He's there now.

	SANDERSON - You had Wilson take the brother
	in?! Come on, Miss Kelly, no gags, please!
	You're not serious, are you?

	KELLY - Oh, I did, Doctor, I - I did.
	Doctor, I'm terribly sorry.

	SANDERSON - Oh, you're terribly sorry!
	Well, that's fine! That - that fixes
	everything! That's just wonderful! No -
	oh, no! Kelly! Kelly, do you realize what
	you've done? This man Dowd can sue us for

	I'd ever want anything like this to happen
	to. You know that, don't you, Dr.
	Sanderson?

	SANDERSON - Miss Kelly, this is hardly the
	time or place to go into the balcony scene
	from Romeo and Juliet!

	KELLY - Lately, Doctor, there's never any
	time or place!

	SANDERSON - Jeepers! They may be putting
	him in the hydro room right now! Get up
	there quick and see if you can get him
	down here! I'll break the news gently to
	Dr. Chumley. He may want to handle this
	himself.

 	KELLY - Well, what shall I say to Mr.
	Dowd? What'll I do? He'll probably be so
	furious he'll refuse to come down here!

	ELWOOD - Well, I'm happy to know you, Miss
	Kelly.

	KELLY - Thank you, Mr. Dowd. I was
	wondering if you would come downstairs
	with me, please - to Dr. Sanderson's
	office. There's something he'd like to
	explain to you.

	ELWOOD - Uh-huh. Well, I'd be glad to,
	Miss Kelly, but there was another very
	charming girl in here a minute ago - and
	she asked me to wait. She said something
	about a bath. I - I - I don't like to

	heart set on it.

	Dowd, you haven't peeled yet.

	KELLY - Yes, of course.

	ELWOOD - Well, I - I - I - want both of
	you to meet a very dear --

	KELLY - It seems there's been a mistake.
	Just forget everything.

	DUNPHY - What?

	ELWOOD - I - I have a suggestion. Why
	don't I do what she wants - and then go
	with you?

	KELLY - That won't be necessary, Mr. Dowd.

	ELWOOD - All right. Well - good-bye, my
	dear. You could've had a bath, too.

	KELLY - I've already had a bath.

	ELWOOD - Oh, Miss Kelly, I wasn't speaking
	to you. I was speaking to my friend --

	DUNPHY - Mr. Dowd -- I take a bath every
	morning, just before I go on duty.

	ELWOOD - It's always such a pleasant way
	to start the day. No - a-after you.

	That's very often brought to my attention.

	ELWOOD - Yes. Would you care to try it?

	SANDERSON - No-no-no-no, thank you. How
	about a cigarette?

	ELWOOD - No, thank you.

	KELLY - Yes - a cigarette.

	SANDERSON - Mr. Dowd - you have us at a
	disadvantage here. Now, you know it and we
	know it, so let's lay our cards on the
	table.

	ELWOOD - Well, that certainly appeals to
	me, Doctor.

	SANDERSON - Best thing in the long run.
	You know, people are people, no matter
	where you go.

	ELWOOD - That is very often the case.

	SANDERSON - And being human are therefore
	liable to mistakes. Now, Miss Kelly and I
	- we've made a mistake here this afternoon
	and - and we'd like to explain it to you.
	You see, the truth is that --

	ELWOOD - You - you and Miss Kelly here?

	ELWOOD - Out here - this afternoon?

	SANDERSON - Yes, Mr. Dowd. We hope you'll
	understand.

	ELWOOD - Oh, yes - yes! I - these things
	are often the basis of a very long, warm
	friendship.

	KELLY - It wasn't Dr. Sanderson's fault,
	Mr. Dowd, it was mine.

	SANDERSON - Oh, no - the responsibility is
	all mine.

	ELWOOD - Well, your attitude may be old-
	fashioned, Doctor, but I like it. Like it
	very much.

	SANDERSON - Of course, if I had seen your
	sister first - this would've been an
	entirely different story.

	ELWOOD - Well, now - there you surprise
	me. I think the world and all of Veta, but
	I had supposed she'd seen her day.

	SANDERSON - Oh, you mustn't attach too
	much blame to her, Mr. Dowd. You see,
	she's a very sick woman. Why, she came in
	here insisting that you needed treatment.
	Now, that's - that's perfectly ridiculous.

	ELWOOD - Oh, well, Veta shouldn't be upset
	about me. I get along fine.

	SANDERSON - She was extremely upset and

	about your drink- --

	SANDERSON - Her alcoholism isn't the basis

	so emotional about this - this big white
	rabbit, uh - Harvey. Yes - I believe she
	called him Harvey.

	ELWOOD - Well, Harvey's his name. Uh,
	Doctor, before we go any further, I must
	insist you and Miss Kelly allow me to
	introduce you to a friend--

	SANDERSON - Now, let me make my point,
	please, Mr. Dowd.

	ELWOOD - Yes.

	SANDERSON - I think that your sister's
	condition stems from trauma.

	ELWOOD - From what?

	SANDERSON - Uh - trauma - spelled
	T-R-A-U-M-A. It means shock. There's
	nothing unusual about it. There's the
	birth trauma - the shock of being --

	ELWOOD - Uh-huh. Well, I've always wanted
	Veta to have everything she needs.

	SANDERSON - Exactly.

	ELWOOD - Uh - but I wouldn't want Veta to
	stay out here unless she liked it out here
	and wants to stay here.

	SANDERSON - Well, if this were an ordinary
	delusion - something reflected on the
	memory picture - that would be one thing.
	But this - this is more serious. It stands
	to reason nobody has ever seen a white
	rabbit six feet high.

	ELWOOD - Well, not very often, Doctor.

	SANDERSON - So she must be committed here
	temporarily. Under the circumstances, I'd
	commit my own grandmother.

	ELWOOD - Does your grandmother drink, too?

	SANDERSON - That's just an expression.
	Now, here are the commitment papers for
	you to sign and here's a visitor's pass.
	You can come and see her whenever you
	like.

	ELWOOD - Yeah - well, I think maybe you'd

	Myrtle Mae?

	MYRTLE - She's always said that, Judge.
	That's what Mother's always told me to do.

	VETA - Judge Gaffney, is that all those
	doctors do in places like that? Think
	about sex?

	JUDGE - I don't know.

	VETA - Because if it is they ought to be
	ashamed of themselves. It's all in their
	heads anyway. Why don't they get out and
	take long walks in the fresh air? Judge
	Gaffney walked everywhere for years,
	didn't you, Judge?

	MYRTLE - Didja?

	JUDGE - I'd better take some notes on
	this. You said - one of the doctors came
	up to - to talk to you?

	VETA - Yes - Dr. Sanderson - but don't pay
	any attention to anything he says. He's a
	liar. Close-set eyes. They're always liars.
	Besides I told him something in strictest
	confidence and he blabbed it. You can't
	trust anyone.

	MYRTLE - What did you tell him, Mother?

	VETA - Oh, well I - uh - what difference
	does it make? I don't want to - to think
	about it. I don't want to talk about it.

	you can tell us, Veta Louise. This is your

	VETA - I know which is which - I don't
	want to talk about it - I want to sue them
	and I want to get upstairs to my own bed.
	I should never have tried to do anything
	about Elwood - something protects him -
	that awful Pooka -

	MYRTLE - Uh where is Uncle Elwood?

	money, you can persuade people to do
	anything.

	VETA - Now, Dr. Chumley -- you brought
	this up - you might as well learn
	something quickly. I took a course in art
	last winter. I learned the difference
	between a fine oil painting and a
	mechanical thing - like a photograph. The
	photograph shows only the reality. The
	painting shows not only the reality, but
	the dream behind it. It's our dreams,
	Doctor, that carry us on. They separate

	go on living if I thought it was all just

	have no resentment. Dr. Chumley is your
	friend and he only wants to help you.

 	ELWOOD - Well isn't that nice of him.
	I'll be very glad to help him, too.

 	SANDERSON - You know we all must face
	reality, Dowd, sooner or later.

	ELWOOD - Uh huh - Well, I wrestled with
	reality for thirty-five years, doctor, and
	I'm happy to state I finally won out over
	it.

	KELLY - Mr. Dowd, where is Dr. Chumley?

	ELWOOD - Well not knowing, I cannot say.
	Wish I could. M-Miss Kelly, I don't like
	to see you standing -

	SANDERSON - Sit down, Kelly.

	voice saying, 'Good evening, Mister Dowd.'
	Well, I - I turned around and here was
	this big six-foot rabbit leaning up
	against a lamp post. Now, I thought
	nothing of that because when you've lived
	in a town as long as I've lived in this
	one, you get used to the fact that
	everybody knows your name. And naturally,
	I - went over to chat with him.

	don't know yours.' And - and right back at
	me, he said, 'What name do you like?'
	Well, I - I didn't even have to think
	twice about that. I - Harvey's always been
	my favorite name. So I said to him, I said,
	'Harvey.' And uh - he - and - - th- th-
	this is - this is the - the interesting
	thing about the whole thing. He said,

	-- green - cool - beautiful.

	ELWOOD - Uh - that's my favorite tree.

	CHUMLEY - I'd go there with a pretty woman.

	ELWOOD - Oh.

	CHUMLEY - A strange woman -- a quiet woman.

	ELWOOD - Ooh. Under a tree, huh?

	CHUMLEY - I wouldn't even want to know her
	name -- while I would be just - Mr. Smith.
	Then I would send out for cold beer.

	ELWOOD - Uh - no whiskey, huh?

	CHUMLEY - No. Then I would tell her things.
	Things that I've never told to anyone.
	Things that are locked - deep in here.
	(COUGHS) And as I talked to her, I would
	want her to hold out a soft white hand and
	say 'Poor thing. You poor, poor thing.'

	ELWOOD - For how long would you want this
	to go on, Doctor?

	CHUMLEY - Two weeks.

	ELWOOD - Two weeks?! Uh - wouldn't that

	beer and 'poor, poor thing' for two weeks?

	CHUMLEY - No! It would be wonderful!

	ELWOOD - Well, I - I - I can't help
	feeling, Doctor, that you're making a

	- if she'd been around at all, she

	had commitment papers drawn up. She has
	your power of attorney and the key to
	your safety box! And she brought you

	ELWOOD - My sister did all that in one
