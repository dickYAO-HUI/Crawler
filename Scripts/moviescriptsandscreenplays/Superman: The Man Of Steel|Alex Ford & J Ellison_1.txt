				SUPERMAN: THE MAN OF STEEL

OPENING SEQUENCE

	This is a pre-credit sequence and not meant to take place within
	the structure of the actual narrative.

EXT. GENERAL STORE

	This opening sequence is shot in glorious black and white.

	A BOY wearing depression era clothes enters the general store.

INT. GENERAL STORE

	The store is empty except for an older CLERK putting out the
	week's periodicals in front of the register. The BOY passes as
	the CLERK finishes and moves behind the counter.

	The BOY goes directly to a candy shelf and opens a jar, takes a
	handful of gum balls and heads for the counter.

	He passes the periodicals and on the rack among the newspapers
	and magazines is a color comic book alone amongst the colorless
	rack. The title reads ACTION COMICS with a 1930s era SUPERMAN
	lifting a car above his head and smashing the front end into the
	ground.

	Enamored by it, the BOY stares and in a DREAMLIKE STATE the
	CAMERA cuts between BOY, COMIC, and slowly panning in on each of
	them. Finally, the BOY looks up at the CLERK who's been patiently
	waiting for him.

	The BOY looks a last time at the book on the shelf, then at one
	handful of gum and the other with a single dime. He looks up at
	the CLERK who looks like he knows something the boy doesn't.

EXT. GENERAL STORE

	BOY exits with comic book in hand. He takes a seat on the
	sidewalk outside the store and...

	CAMERA OVER SHOULDER shows the BOY slowly opening the front cover
	with much delicacy revealing the interior to be a VIBRANT COLOR
	WARNER BROS LOGO (WB Shield on blue clouded sky).

	CAMERA PANS IN OVER THE SHOULDER and the LOGO fills the screen.

	Black and white sequence finished. WE ARE IN THE MOVIE.

	CAMERA pans upward slowly and the logo slides off the bottom of
	the screen, the blue clouded sky merges with the infinite reaches
	of space. Almost unnoticeable in the far off distance is a
	minuscule green dot.

	Without warning, the green dot EXPLODES IN A BURST OF SILENT
	LIGHT. Several seconds pass as the shockwave from the explosion
	travels towards us and like a rumble in the distance, bringing a
	tidal wave of sound with it.

	Debris hurls itself in all directions. With it A SMALL SPACECRAFT
	ZIP towards us, past the explosion and whips overhead. The CAMERA
	tilts and follows the orange and green craft. The planet's
	fragments follow the craft.

	The debris loses speed and begins to fall behind the ship. Soon,
	the only thing left in frame from the dead planet is the lone
	ship hurling through space.

	BEGIN OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE.

	Opening credit sequence is displayed while we follow the ship
	through infinite space. On occasion, the ship radically changes
	direction like it knows where it's going. Its destination is no
	accident.

	The ship enters our solar system and barrels past familiar
	planets. In the distance is Earth.

	The ship cracks through Earth's atmosphere and its hull ignites
	in a bright red flame.

						SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. SMALLVILLE, KANSAS - DESOLATE SNOWCOVERED ROAD - NIGHT

EXTREME CLOSE-UP of a mittened hand holding a misshapen rusty nail.

	JONATHAN KENT, a Kansas farmer in his thirties, is holding the
	nail. Standing in from of him is his wife MARTHA (also in her
	thirties) with a look is irritation. In the background is their
	weathered 1954 pickup truck with a flat tire. There is virtually
	no light on this country road.

					MARTHA
				What now, Jonathan?

	JONATHAN's face bends with an "I don't need this" smirk. The
	night lights almost like day and there is a tremendous crack as
	the ship breaks the sound barrier.

	In the background, the flaming craft crashes into a field digging
	a charred crevice several hundred feet long and a trail of
	steaming melted snow.

	JONATHAN and MARTHA, in total disbelief, slowly move towards the
	wreckage as if they are unconsciously drawn to it.

	In the background is the distant cry of a baby.

	ROCKET POV, JONATHAN and MARTHA peer into the crater with
	confusion and then turn to each other for an explanation neither
	of them has. They simultaneously look at the rocket then to the
	sky. The CAMERA looks upward with them and keeps going until
	there is nothing but space.

	END OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE ON NIGHT SKY.

						CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS SKY - DAY

	The CAMERA pans down from space through the clouds and merges
	with a beautiful blue sky, which is disrupted by a massive "L"
	shaped state-of-the-art skyscraper made of steel and glass. The
	roof is slanted to make the "L" visible in the distance.

	CAMERA keeps moving down the building for what seems like forever
	and finally other buildings appear along the skyline, but it's
	obvious this is "the" building in the city. A landmark like no
	other and everything else pales on comparison.

	The city in the background bustles with life. She is like no
	other on Earth. She is immaculately clean and meticulously
	engineered. Skyscrapers are everywhere but the city doesn't seem
	cluttered. Ten million people call her home and with the
	multilayered highways, subways and elevated trains it never looks
	congested. She is the most advanced city in the world, the
	template for all others. Her name is appropriate; this is...

	Metropolis.

	Still moving down building...

	FADE IN, TITLE ON MOVING IMAGE: METROPOLIS

	Still moving down building...

	FADE IN, TITLE ON MOVING IMAGE: TOMORROW, SATURDAY, 2:43PM

	Still moving...

	The CAMERA nears the bottom panning down huge letters etched in
	stone on the building side boldly announcing LEXCORP (and beneath
	it corporation's slogan "Bringing The Future To You Today").
	Finally we reach the bottom of the building and pedestrians come
	into view and the pan ends on the back of a young,
	business-suited woman staring up at the menacing tower. She
	nervously gathers herself, builds her confidence and enters.

INT. METROPOLIS, LEXCORP HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	WOMAN enters the lobby. There are dozens of people bustling
	about. She approaches one of a two dozen receptionists behind a
	massive marble counter all of whom are all assisting others. The
	RECEPTIONIST she has chosen is finishing up a telephone call on
	her headset/telephone. Several receptionists down is another
	woman who appears to be arguing with a receptionist and with
	someone on her cell phone at the same time, although the details
	can't be heard. The woman is dressed in a suit carrying a
	briefcase. She looks like she is about to explode.

				RECEPTIONIST #1
				(Finishing her call)
			Hello. Welcome to LexCorp. May I help you?

					WOMAN
				(Startled)
			I'm here to see Mister Luthor.

				RECEPTIONIST #1
			And what time is your appointment?

					WOMAN
			I don't have an appointment.

				RECEPTIONIST #1
				(disappointed)
			Oh. I'm sorry. Mister Luthor only sees guests
				by appointment.

					WOMAN
			It's very urgent. A matter of life and death.

				RECEPTIONIST #1
				(sympathetic)
			Let me see if I can fit you in.

	RECEPTIONIST #1 begins checking appointments in the computer when
	the arguing woman hears this and flips out. She barges past
	several people between them, pushing them out of the way to get
	to the sympathetic RECEPTIONIST.

	The woman is LOIS LANE.

					LOIS
				(furious)
			What?! I have been waiting here for three
			hours and I have an appointment!
					(Beat)
			Does he know Lois Lane from the Daily Planet
				is here?

				RECEPTIONIST #2
				(Under her breath)
			That's probably why he's not coming down.

	LOIS shoots her a nasty look.

					LOIS
				(To RECEPTIONIST #2)
			The parking garage. You and me, sister. I
			hope your medical is all paid up.

				RECEPTIONIST #1
			(to WOMAN and ignoring LOIS)
				I can fit you in Tuesday.

					WOMAN
			I'd have to wait until next Tuesday?

				RECEPTIONIST #1
				(apologetic)
				Tuesday the twenty-third...

					WOMAN
			That's three weeks from now.

				RECEPTIONIST #1
				(Slightly embarrassed)
				...in September.

	The woman looks blankly at her examining her options.

				RECEPTIONIST #2
				(calling)
				Miss Lane?

	LOIS returns to RECEPTIONIST #2.

				RECEPTIONIST #1
			If you have a business card or something, I'd
			be happy to leave it for him.

					WOMAN
				(Shakes off her daze)
				No. I don't have anything.
			(long beat, building nerve)
				Oh wait, I do have this.

	RECEPTIONIST #1 stands to retrieve her card and WOMAN opens her
	jacket revealing a bomb strapped around her mid-section.
	RECEPTIONIST #1 swoons and faints. LOIS, on her cell phone in the
	background...

					LOIS
				(into cell phone)
				Gotta go!

	She turns her back to the woman and starts punching buttons
	frantically.

						CUT TO:

EXT. THE DAILY PLANET BUILDING - DAY

	The building is one of the oldest structures in the city with its
	brick walls and the newspaper's logo, the Earth with a rotating
	ring that reads DAILY PLANET, on it's roof. The structure is a
	testament to the days of journalism before faxes and Internet.

INT. DAILY PLANET - CITY ROOM

	Through a large window, a staff meeting can be seen.

	Standing at the front of a large table is Daily Planet Editor
	PERRY WHITE. A large and foreboding pitbull of a man. His
	trademark unbuttoned collar and open vest give the appearance
	this has been very hard day when in fact, this is every day. In
	his fist is an unlit cigar he points at people accenting his
	sentences. He paces when he walks and doesn't speak words as much
	as he barks them. Through the glass, his booming voice is
	muffled. PERRY has two tones: LOUD and LOUDER.

	Among the staff are CAT GRANT (Society columnist, early 30s and
	very beautiful), RON TROUPE (Sports, an African American in his
	40s) and mild-mannered CLARK KENT (City Columnist). KENT is in
	his early 30s and very handsome, although he doesn't know it. He
	is someone that's above that.

	Seated at KENT's desk is and watching them through the glass is
	JIMMY OLSEN, photographer. He is sixteen years old and very
	bored. With him is ALI, who is flipping through some of his
	photos with awe.

					ALI
				(Amazed)
				Look at these Jimmy.

					JIMMY
				I know. I took them.

					ALI
			I know guys who've been taking pictures for
			fifteen years and aren't this good.

					jimmy
			Yeah. The Chief says it's a gift.

	A telephone rings and OLSEN looks around to make sure there are
	no other witnesses and answers it.

					JIMMY
			Daily Planet, Kent speaking.

	Incoherent yelling can be heard from the other end and OLSEN
	bullets to attention.

					JIMMY
			No, Miss Lane. They're in a meeting. Sure
				thing, Miss Lane.

	OLSEN scrambles to find a pen, jots down instructions on his palm
	and hangs up. He fumbles out of his chair and races for the
	Conference Room throwing the door open...

					PERRY
			...Has lost contact with the Constitution--

					JIMMY
				CHIEF! -

					PERRY
			OLSEN! What they hell are you doing in my
			staff meeting?! You're not a writer, you're a
			photographer and you're barely that! Get out
			of here before I have you selling papers on
				the corner!

	Instinctively, JIMMY folds and turns to quickly exit, then
	remembering why he came in the first place...

					JIMMY
			Oh yeah. Miss Lane called. Somebody has a
			bomb in the LexCorp building.

	Everything stops.

					PERRY
			Isn't Lois interviewing Luthor today?

	No one has an answer.

					PERRY
				(exploding)
			Well what are you waiting for?!

	Everyone hustles out of the room. As they are leaving, no one
	notices a glass of water and an empty chair where CLARK was
	sitting.

						CUT TO:

INT. DAILY PLANET - HALLS

	People are walking the halls performing their duties when a gust
	of wind and a blur streaks past causing some to look twice and
	finding nothing.

INT. JANITOR'S CLOSET

	In a supply closet, a JANITOR ducks around a corner to sneak a
	cigarette. He takes a drag and opens a window to exhale when the
	blur of wind blows past him and out the window knocking some
	cleaning supplies off the shelves. The JANITOR looks.

				JANITOR
					Windy.

	He takes another drag on his cigarette.

						CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS SKYLINE - DAY

	People are in their apartments as the red and blue blur streaks
	by the windows. It moves so quickly that some don't notice it.
	Others run to the windows and fire escapes calling their families
	to catch a glimpse of it.

EXT. METROPOLIS STREET - DAY

	The streets bustle with mid-day activity. A GIRL moving with a
	crowd across an intersection stops in the middle of the street.
	An oncoming taxi screeches to a halt to avoid killing her. The
	GIRL is staring skyward down the street.

	Cars horns blare and the TAXI DRIVER leans out and screams:

				TAXI DRIVER
				Hey stupid! What the-

	The TAXI DRIVER sees what she is focusing on and forgets what he
	was yelling for. Everyone in the street stops and stares. The
	noise of a city in mid-afternoon comes to a silence. In the
	distance the blue and red streak flies off and makes an almost
	perfect ninety degree turn around a building. People can been
	seen in awe for blocks.

						CUT TO:

EXT. LEXCORP HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	The serenity of the previous scene is interrupted by panic.

	People are fleeing the building being ushered to safety by the
	Metropolis Bomb Squad. The media has arrived, trying to force
	their way past the POLICE barricades with no luck.

	There is chatter among the crowd until they realize LUTHOR is
	among them and all their frustrations and fears change to a
	silent hush.

	Surrounded by bodyguards, is LEX LUTHOR. LUTHOR is a middle-aged
	imposing figure. An angel to some, devil to others. An
	egomaniacal recluse. A genius. An idiot. A humanitarian and
	exploiter. He is dressed in a dark business suit that costs more
	to clean than most people make in a month. The look on his face
	isn't one of fear that would be associated with an assassination
	attempt.

	To him, this is an annoyance.

	Leading the team of bodyguards with the LUTHOR center is MERCY
	GRAVES, Luthor's Minister of Security. She is young, petite with
	a short brown male haircut and dressed in a modified version of a
	traditional chauffeur's uniform with a more militaristic feel.
	She is LUTHOR's personal bodyguard and right hand woman. She
	looks harmless... she isn't.

	An EMPLOYEE is arguing with a COP when LUTHOR is ushered past.
	Their conversation stops and they gawk.

					COP
				Is that him?

				EMPLOYEE
				I think so.

					COP
				You think so?

				EMPLOYEE
			I've worked here for six years and I've never
			actually seen the guy before.

	LUTHOR is brought directly to the BOMB SQUAD SERGEANT
	(PENNINGTON).

					LUTHOR
				(annoyed)
			SERGEANT, I trust this won't take long. I am
				trying to run a company.

				SERGEANT
			Well, there is a bomb in your building,
				Mister Luthor.

					LUTHOR
			If they really wanted to kill me and were
			remotely competent, I'd be dead by now. I
			can't stand incompetence. I'd like this
			matter finished as soon as possible.

	BOMB SQUAD COP approaches.

				BOMB SQUAD COP
			Security gives us the go-ahead. The building
				is clear, sir.

				SERGEANT
			Good. We conduct a floor-by-floor building
			search in two-man parties for the bomber and-

					LUTHOR
				(adamantly)
			No! LexCorp is a secured facility. I can't
			have you traipsing through-

				SERGEANT
			How are my men supposed to find the-

					LUTHOR
			There are sensitive materials and projects-

				SERGEANT
			With all due respect, there is a bomb in
			there that could level this building-

					LUTHOR
				Then I'll build a new one.

				SERGEANT
			And what about your EMPLOYEEs?

					LUTHOR
				(leaning into SERGEANT)
				Then I'll hire new ones.
					(Beat)
			Regardless, your men will not be entering
				this facility.
				(to MERCY)
					Mercy.

					MERCY
				Yes, Mister Luthor?

					LUTHOR
			Are your men capable of finding a bomb?

					MERCY
				Yes, Mister Luthor.

					LUTHOR
				Then get it done.

					MERCY
				Yes, Mister Luthor.

	MERCY turns and whispers Secret Service-style microphone in her
	cuff.

				SERGEANT
			This is not standard procedure, Luthor.

					LUTHOR
				(irritated)
			As far as I know you're an industrial spy and
			sent the bomb yourself to get into my
			building with no witnesses--

				SERGEANT
				(furious)
			Are you accusing me of not doing my job!?

					LUTHOR
			I have pens that cost more than you make in a
					week.

	The two begin to argue when BYSTANDER #1 in the background looks
	up and points.

				BYSTANDER #1
				Look! Up in the sky...

	Several others look.

				BYSTANDER #2
				It's a bird...

	The focus shifts from LUTHOR to the sky.

				BYSTANDER #3
				It's a plane.

	A whisper builds through the crowd.

	SUPERMAN gracefully descends to Earth, his red boots gently
	connecting with the pavement as his red flowing cape cascades off
	his shoulders and perfectly hangs from his frame. He lands on the
	clear side of the barricade.

	He is a muscular man, 6'3" and 225 pounds. His ice blue eyes and
	jet black hair compliment his chiseled features. The red and
	yellow "S" shield covers his entire chest. He has a presence
	unlike any other.

	LUTHOR is still ranting as the SERGEANT notices him and stops
	arguing.

				SERGEANT
				Superman.

	SUPERMAN stares at the building like he's looking through it...
	because he is.

	SERGEANT leaves LUTHOR who isn't used to being walked away from
	in mid-sentence. SERGEANT approaches SUPERMAN who is
	concentrating on his invisible x-ray vision.

				SERGEANT
				(slightly nervous)
			Sir, I'm SERGEANT Pennington of the MPF Bomb
					Unit.

	SUPERMAN stops scanning and shakes SERGEANT's hand.

				SUPERMAN
			Nice to meet you, SERGEANT Pennington.
			There's no bomb in this building.

					LUTHOR
				(screaming)
				How could you know that?

				SUPERMAN
			I checked. There are some lead lined rooms
			which isn't unusual in a research facility
			but they're secured areas. So unless Luthor
			put the bomb there himself, the bomb is out
					here.

					LUTHOR
			What? How dare you insinuate-

	SUPERMAN motions to LUTHOR to be quiet.

				SUPERMAN
				("listening")
					Wait...

					LUTHOR
			Do you hear your mother calling you?

	SUPERMAN "listens" to the crowd. We hear what he hears. What
	sounds like a massive chaotic bass-heavy thumping narrows down
	shorter and shorter until there is one incredibly quick
	heartbeat.

	SUPERMAN stares into the crowd looking "through" them. The crowd
	parts as if they know he isn't looking at them until the WOMAN
	from the receptionist desk is left standing alone. Her face is
	full of tears and she looks like hell.

				SUPERMAN
				(to LUTHOR)
				Ex-wife?

					LUTHOR
			Hardly. I pay the six of them enough money
			not to try a stunt like this. She's a former
			EMPLOYEE I had to transfer to a "less
				desirable position."

					WOMAN
				(crying)
			All I wanted was to talk to you, Mister
			Luthor. You told me you cared and I just want
			one more chance. I just wanted to talk.

					LUTHOR
			Did you have an appointment?

	Furiously the WOMAN pulls a trigger from her pocket and rips her
	jacket open showing the bomb. Immediately, SUPERMAN begins to
	inspect it with his telescopic vision.

				SERGEANT
			Hey lady! I don't know what this schmuck did
			to you but you're gonna kill a lot of
				innocent people.

					LUTHOR
					Look...

	MERCY leans into LUTHOR and whispers in his ear.

					LUTHOR
			...Cheryl, I know there may have been some
				misunderstandings.

					WOMAN
			Transferring me to Bludhaven is hardly a
				misunderstanding.

					LUTHOR
			How about I'll have someone give you a call
			if you leave your number with-

					WOMAN
				I'LL GIVE YOU A NUMBER!

					THREE!

	People begin to scramble from the scene.

					LUTHOR
			I can give you a promotion. Maybe move you
			into a nice office on the one-hundred and
			fourth next to the Executive Wash Room.

					WOMAN
					TWO!

	People begin to knock each other over fleeing the area. The
	POLICE are right behind them. People take shelter behind cars and
	structures.

	SUPERMAN is watching her, totally calm.

					LUTHOR
			Five hundred percent salary increase. That
			oughta buy a lot of therapy.

					WOMAN
					ONE!

	She presses the trigger and there is an almost inaudible click.
	She presses repeatedly and nothing. She looks at the trigger and
	in its place is a sterling silver pen. She clicks it again and
	the point extends and retracts. She looks down at her mid-section
	and there is no bomb.

					SHASH CUT ACROSS TO:

LUTHOR, SUPERMAN and SERGEANT.

	They are confused except for SUPERMAN who no one notices is
	holding and inspecting the bomb.

				SUPERMAN
			Where did you get this? This is very
				impressive.
				(To SERGEANT)
				What is this?

	SERGEANT does a double take and then inspects it without touching
	it.

				SERGEANT
			That is impressive. That is your basic Class
			Six explosive with a chemical balance and
			wire trigger. It's a common weapon used by
			American Militias and Querac Jihads.
					(Beat)
			You disarm it by cutting the yellow, the pink
				and then the black.

	SUPERMAN's irises turn red and three wires burn clean through. He
	hands it to SERGEANT who just stares at him in amazement.

	Two OFFICERS arrest the WOMAN. As she's being taken away...

					LUTHOR
				Cheryl...

	She turns with hope in her eyes.

					LUTHOR
				...you're fired.

	She breaks free of the POLICE and lunges at LUTHOR. Stepping in
	the way of her charge is MERCY. With a martial arts move that
	appears to be one fluid motion, she drops her to the ground.
	POLICE gather her and take her away.

				SERGEANT
			Superman, how did you know where the bomb
					was?

					LUTHOR
				(Answering for SUPERMAN)
			A heartbeat has a particular rhythm that's
			corrupted when someone is under duress, a
			threatening situation or lying.

				SERGEANT
				Like a polygraph.

				SUPERMAN
				Exactly.

					LUTHOR
			That's a neat trick. Do you do parties?

				SUPERMAN
			It's not so easy to distinguish when there
			are two heartbeats, Luthor.

			(giving LUTHOR a very dirty look)
				If that's all...

	LOIS LANE runs to the scene as SUPERMAN is preparing to leave.

					LUTHOR
			I'm not done with you yet. You committed an
			extreme invasion of my privacy by looking
			into my building. You can expect to hear from
				my lawyers.

				SUPERMAN
			I don't have time for this, Luthor.
				(noticing LOIS)
			Hello, Miss Lane. How are you doing?

					LOIS
				(slightly nervous)
					Fine.

				SUPERMAN
			It's good to see you again but I have to be
					going.

	SUPERMAN effortlessly rises and disappears into the afternoon
	sky.

					LUTHOR
				(Shouting)
			When I have you brought up on charges and
			arrested and you'll have all the time in the
					world!

						CUT TO:

EXT. KENT FARM, (SMALLVILLE, KANSAS) - LATE AFTERNOON

	A sport utility truck drives up the long dirt road leading to the
	KENT farm. The modern truck clashes against the 1950s Norman
	Rockwell-ish landscape. The door opens and out steps LANA LANG
	(early 30s) carrying a covered dish. She is dressed in a simple
	shirt and worn jeans with very little makeup.

	The screen door opens and out steps MARTHA KENT, the same woman
	we saw for a moment thirty years earlier. Her hair has grayed and
	she's found some wrinkles. She is wearing an apron but there
	isn't a stain on it.

					MARTHA
				(Scolding)
			Lana Lang you know better than that.

	MARTHA rushes to her side like she's a long lost child returning
	home. She kisses her on the cheek and takes the dish.

					LANA
			Mrs. Kent we go through this every Sunday. Is
				Clark here yet?

					MARTHA
			No. I think he said something about a meeting
					today.

	JONATHAN KENT meets them on the porch.

				JONATHAN
			My girl Lana, what did you bring me?

	MARTHA rolls her eyes at him.

					MARTHA
				(scolding)
				Jonathan.

					LANA
				Peach cobbler.

					MARTHA
			Jonathan, what time is Clark coming?

	JONATHAN looks at his watch.

				JONATHAN
			Well Metropolis time is two hours behind but
			he's never been late for a Sunday supper. I
				reckon he should be here-

	The sound of their dog barking distracts JONATHAN. He looks by
	the barn and sees their son, SUPERMAN's alter-ego, CLARK KENT,
	playing with the dog. He is dressed in jeans and simple button
	shirt.

				JONATHAN
				--Right on time.

					CLARK
				Hey, Pa!

	He hugs his father who looks small in his arms. Almost boylike,
	he approaches Lana.

					CLARK
					Lana.

					LANA
				Hi Clark.

	There is a shared moment between them.

	MARTHA whispers to JONATHAN and they leave the two alone for a
	moment.

						CUT TO:

INT. KENT HOME - DINING ROOM

	Supper is finished and the table is cluttered with dirty dishes.
	MARTHA begins collecting dishes.

					CLARK
			You outdid yourself, Ma. Let me help you with
					those.

	CLARK gets up and assists. JONATHAN unbuckles his belt and leans
	back in his chair fully satisfied.

					MARTHA
			Jonathan, is that necessary. We have guests.

				JONATHAN
			What? Lana might as well be family. She can
			unbuckle her pants if it makes her feel
				better.

					LANA
				Maybe next time.

				JONATHAN
			Are you sure? I'm gonna stretch out on the
				floor in a minute.

					LANA
				You do that.

					MARTHA
				He will not.

						CUT TO:

EXT. KENT FARM - DUSK

	CLARK walks out of the house followed by JONATHAN. There is a
	marvelous Kansas sunset over the flatlands of the farm.

				JONATHAN
				Isn't that something?

					CLARK
			It sure is. You know, Metropolis has a
				beautiful sunset.

				JONATHAN
			But you can only see it when you're in a
			plane above the city. That's why I don't go
			there often. I think I'd miss her too much.

					CLARK
				Ma seems a little distant.

				JONATHAN
			We saw what you did this afternoon, son.

					CLARK
					Oh.

				JONATHAN
			You know how she worries. She just wants you
			to be safe. You're her only son. Be careful.

					CLARK
			I'll be careful, Pa. I promise.

	He kisses his father on the forehead. MARTHA comes out of the
	house with LANA.

					MARTHA
			You weren't going to race off with mine, were
					you?

					CLARK
				No, Ma.

	He gives her a long hug.

					MARTHA
			I have some leftovers I can wrap for you.

					CLARK
			Hmmm, homemade meat loaf, that's tempting but
				I'll be okay.

					LANA
			Are you going to walk me to my car, Clark?

					CLARK
					Sure.

					LANA
			Thanks for having me, Mrs Kent.

					MARTHA
				Anytime, Lana.

	MARTHA and JONATHAN return to the house. CLARK walks LANA very
	slowly to her truck.

					LANA
				They love you so much.

					CLARK
			I know. I don't know what I would do without
					them.
					(Beat)
			You know, when I fly through Metropolis I
			notice different things all the time. Subtle
			changes nobody probably notices. But when I
			fly over Smallville, it's like nothing ever
			changes. It's just the way I left it. It's
			like time doesn't work here.

					LANA
				(laughing to herself)
			It works. It just works very slowly.
				(beat, very serious)
			I miss you, Clark. I miss you so much.

					CLARK
				I miss you, too, Lana.

	LANA looks at him realizing he doesn't understand.

					LANA
			You really don't know, do you? You can hear
			clouds collide into each other but you are so
				oblivious sometimes.
					(Beat)
			You know every time your parents see you on
			TV they are so proud and so terrified at the
			same time. When other people worry if their
			kids are making friends and eating right your
			parents are worrying if some super-powered
			goon is going to get the best of you. If
			you're going to be trapped in space or buried
			in a lava flow or something.

					CLARK
					(Beat)
			I had that lava flow under control.

					LANA
			You're missing the point, Clark. They love
			you and worry about you. I worry about you.
			Sometimes I wish you would just come home one
			Sunday for dinner and stay but I know that
			can't happen. I've known you since we were
			kids and I know how your parents raised you.
			You could never stay in Smallville knowing
			there were things happening in the world you
			could prevent. You couldn't live with
			yourself. You could never be that selfish.
					(Beat)
				But I could.

					CLARK
			You know, there are ten million people in
			Metropolis and I don't know any of them.
			Sometimes I think about it and I'm saving a
			city full of strangers when the people I know
			and love are here. And the worse part is
			everyone there thinks they know me.

					LANA
			But there things actually happen. They need
			you more than we ever could. They depend on
				you. You're their hero.

					CLARK
			Am I? NASA lost contact with the Constitution
			and on reentry it exploded and twelve men
			died. I might have been the only man on Earth
			who could have saved them.

					LANA
			But you didn't, Clark. You didn't save them
			and they died. You can't save them all.

					CLARK
			Instead, I spent my afternoon saving the life
			of a billionaire egomaniac.

					LANA
			And what if you hadn't? What if that woman
			blew up the building and a few thousand
			people died? Clark, you can't be everywhere.

					CLARK
				But if I had been-

					LANA
			If you had been what? Two places in the same
			time? Stronger? Faster? You may be the most
			amazing person on the planet and the world
			may call you Superman but inside you're just
			a man. You have to accept that.

	CLARK reaches over and holds her hand. She smiles and leans in
	and kisses him.

					LANA
			Remember that night after graduation when you
			took me out into the back field. I knew you
			were going off to college but somewhere, I
			thought you were going to ask me to marry
					you.

	CLARK has a look of surprise.

					LANA
			I thought we would get married and you'd get
			me out of the one cow town and I'd actually
				see something in my life.

					CLARK
				Lana, I didn't...

	LANA shushes him before he can finish.

					LANA
				It's okay.

					CLARK
			I should have married you when I had the
				chance.

					LANA
			You'll always have the chance, Clark.
			Whenever you're ready to come home, I'll be
					here.

	They both gaze up into the open Kansas sky.

INT. LEXCORP CONFERENCE ROOM

	In the room seated around a large marble table are thirty men
	from various divisions of the LexCorp empire. One entire wall is
	a window overlooking a breathtaking view of night-lit Metropolis.
	The massive seat at the front of the table is empty.

	The two giant doors to the room are tossed open and in walks
	LUTHOR (everyone stands). As always, within arms distance is
	MERCY, followed by two SECRETARIES. He sits at the front of the
	table with a SECRETARY on each side. MERCY stands behind him.

					LUTHOR
			Gentlemen, I've had a hell of a day and I am
			not in a very good mood so let's make this
					short.
				(calling out)
				Accounting?

	VAN HYNING, the Accounting Rep stands and clears his throat.

				VAN HYNING
			We have acquired six more research facilities
			in Southeast Asia. The munitions plant in
			Northern Europe that has been prohibiting our
			use of their new patented circuit board is no
				longer a problem.

					LUTHOR
				Then the merger went well?

				VAN HYNING
			The details are in my report. LexAir, LexOil,
			LexCom and their subsidiaries are all doing
			well, twenty-two percent above the projected
					goals.

					LUTHOR
				(excited)
			That's what I like to hear!

				VAN HYNING
				(nervous)
			The stock divided this morning and LexCorp
			took a two hundred point seven million dollar
			loss... the lowest percentage loss of all the
			listed companies. A loss sixteen percent
			higher than Maxwell Lord's holdings.

	LUTHOR doesn't look happy with the news and everyone waits for
	his reaction.

					LUTHOR
			What exactly am I standing in?

				VAN HYNING
			Company assets are at four point two trillion
				dollars.

					LUTHOR
				(long beat)
				That's acceptable.
					(Beat)
				Research?

	HOLLISTER, the rep from RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT stands.

				HOLLISTER
			Construction of our new facilities in South
			America and Greenland are proceeding ahead of
			schedule. The great news is medical research
			has perfected the Leukemia vaccine prototype.
				It works flawlessly.

					LUTHOR
			Have they sent the conditions to the
				pharmaceutical firms?

				HOLLISTER
			Yes they have and they've all declined. They
			argue the asking price is outrageous.

					LUTHOR
			If it were their kids let's see how
			outrageous it is. Very well, we keep it and
			it goes no where. The Antarctica facility?

				HOLLISTER
			Running totally on your new energy source for
			eight months on a less than a quarter of a
			percent what it previously used. The new fuel
			is clean, stable and most importantly cheap.
			Of course, we only have limited resources.

					LUTHOR
			Is it possible to replicate the chemical
				structure?

				HOLLISTER
			We know it isn't from Earth but it's being
				worked on as we speak.

					LUTHOR
			And the Metropolis Energy Commission?

				HOLLISTER
			That news isn't as good. There needs to be a
			unanimous vote to change the city's power
			source. We own ten of the twelve commission
			members but the other two refuse to
			cooperate. They think it's unnecessary to
			spend billions of dollars of taxpayer's money
				on an untested source.

					LUTHOR
				The cloning?

				HOLLISTER
				We have a cat?

					LUTHOR
				You cloned a cat?
				(to VAN HYNING)
			How much money have I spent on this cloning
					thing?

				VAN HYNING
			Two billion, Mister Luthor.

					LUTHOR
			Two billion dollars and you have a cat?

				HOLLISTER
			Well, we have fifteen hundred cats.

			(LUTHOR gives him a horrid look)
			It's very remarkable. They all are identical
				when means the matrix-

					LUTHOR
			Fifteen hundred cats? What am I supposed to
			do with fifteen hundred cats? If I were in
			Korea I'd open a delicatessen but I'm not.
			I'm in Metropolis where fifteen hundred cats
			are useless to me. I want something better.
			Dogs, monkeys, French-speaking gorillas.
				Impress me.

				HOLLISTER
				Yes, Mister Luthor.

					LUTHOR
			(changing tone and becoming extremely
				serious)
			Now to my Legal Department... I have a problem,
			which in turn means you have a problem.

	LUTHOR stands and begins circling the table in a tiger-like stalk
	looking for something to kill.

					LUTHOR
			This afternoon a man stood outside, on my
			property and looked inside my building. My
			business. My home. I consider this a grave
				invasion of my privacy.
					(Beat)
			Now what are you going to do about it?

	Several attorneys look nervously at each other. LUTHOR points at
	WYNN, a young man, who returns a "who me" look.

					WYNN
			Well, he's Superman, sir. He's not the kind
			of person you issue subpoenas to. And he was
			acting with the cooperation of the Police and
			under The Good Samaritan act of 1968 you
					can't...

	The entire room cringes. LUTHOR looks up with a frightening
	serene expression.

					LUTHOR
				I what?

					WYNN
				(very nervous)
			You can't take legal action-

					LUTHOR
			I'm sorry, what's your name?

					WYNN
				Wynn, sir.

					LUTHOR
			And Wynn, how long have you been employed
					here?

					WYNN
				Three months, sir.

					LUTHOR
			And can you tell me what qualifies you to
			work in my Legal Department?

					WYNN
			I attended Harvard Law School on a full
			scholarship and graduated in the top three
			percent with honors. I worked as a public
			defender for three years in Gateway City with
			an undefeated record. I had my own firm for
			two years in Keystone and decided I wanted to
			work with the best and came here.

					LUTHOR
			Are you familiar with my qualifications?

					WYNN
				(nervous)
				No, sir.

					LUTHOR
			Well, let me familiarize you with my resume.

			I completed high school when I was fourteen.
			I had my first Bachelor's Degree when I was
			sixteen. My first doctorate when I was
			seventeen. I have four of them. I graduated
			in the top three of my class because I was
			too busy working on theories for matter
			destabilization that year but I did manage a
			Nobel Prize nomination in science but I lost
			to some Mathematician with theories no one
			will ever use. NASA paid me for the
			destablizer and I was a millionaire at
			twenty-four. I made my first billion when I
				was thirty-one.
				(to VAN HYNING)
			What are my personal assets?

				VAN HYNING
			As of four-fifteen this afternoon, your
			personal worth is one hundred and sixteen
			point one billion dollars... give or take a few
				hundred million.

					LUTHOR
			Of the other two, one is an advisor to the
			President and the other spends his nights
			praying he can defend WayneTECH from my
				corporate raiders.
					(Beat)
			I understand you're new but for future
			reference, you never tell me what I can and
				cannot do.
					(Beat)
				VAN HYNING.

				VAN HYNING
					Sir?

					LUTHOR
			Superman said something about not being able
			to see through the lead-lined rooms in the
			radiation labs. Get an estimate to the
			interior walls painted with a lead content
					paint.
				(Turns toward the window)
				I'm thinking... beige.

	LUTHOR is staring out over the city.

	Everyone exits except MERCY. LUTHOR reaches adjusts his jacket
	and realizes he's missing his sterling silver pen. He looks at
	MERCY for an answer and she shrugs her shoulders.

	She drops the disk on his desk.

					PERRY
				What's this?

					LOIS
			The story on LexCorp bomb for the morning

	PERRY holds up another disk.

					PERRY
			Clark had his here before he left at seven.

	LOIS doesn't say anything. She fumes until she's built up enough
	pressure she storms out.

					PERRY
			(shouting out and holding the disks)
			And what ever happened to paper?

INT. DAILY PLANET CITY ROOM

	LOIS drops into her chair, consumed with anger. The clock in the
	background reads 11:00PM.

	Cleaning people come and go along with the occasional worker
	burning the midnight oil. She never moves but the time does.

	The clock DISSOLVES to 8:30am. The office becomes alive with
	people.

	CLARK KENT enters with RON TROUPE and they go to their respective
	desks. CLARK situates his things, opens the morning paper while
	LOIS glares at him the whole time.

					LOIS
				(monotone)
			How do you do it, Smallville?

					CLARK
				(not lowering the paper)
				Do what, Lois?

					LOIS
				You know what.

					CLARK
			(lowering the paper and looking up)
				I'm just doing my job.

					LOIS
			No. Getting the stories on the front page is
			what I do. You're doing my job.

					CLARK
				Are you jealous, Lois?

					LOIS
			No, I am not jealous of you.

					CLARK
			Tell you what. I have a meeting with MAYOR
			Berkowicz to discuss the revamping of the
			transit system. Why don't you go instead?

					LOIS
			Don't do me any favors. Sam Lane didn't raise
			his daughters to take hand-outs.

					CLARK
			No, I insist. I have a friend coming to town
			and it'll free up more of my time. He likes
			you better anyway. You always get the good
				stuff out of him.
				(convincing)
			Come on, Lois. He owes me an interview as a
			favor. It'll be an exclusive.

					LOIS
				(hesitant)
			Okay, I'll do it, but not because I want the
			story. I'm doing it so you can spend the
			evening with your friend to do whatever it is
			you do when you're not here. Understood?

					CLARK
				You're helping me out.

					LOIS
				Exactly.

	Across the room RON and JIMMY are listening in.

					RON
				Lois is one hard case.

					JIMMY
			Miss Lane hates to lose... especially to Mister
					Kent.

					RON
			Actually, I'd hate to be on the receiving end

EXT. STREET - DAY - RUSH HOUR

	A speeding VAN is weaving DANGEROUSLY through traffic while being
	pursued by POLICE cars. The VAN loses its pursuers but SWERVES to
	avoid a civilian, causing the VAN to flip several times landing
	in the middle of an intersection.

	Dazed, three ski-masked THUGS emerge carrying duffel bags of
	money.

				THUG #1
				Let's go!

	They flee through the streets, past pedestrians and into the
	subway.

INT. SUBWAY

	The THUGS jump the turnstile and FORCE THEMSELVES Into a subway
	train as the doors shut and it pulls from the platform. Subway
	patrons scream with terror.

				THUG #2
			Everybody shut up or somebody's gettin' a
				bullet in the head!

				THUG #1
				(to THUG #3)
			Go up front and make sure the driver doesn't
			radio anybody or make any stops until I say
					so.

	THUG #3 hustles to the front of the car.

				THUG #1
				(to THUG #2)
			They can still stop the car from the central
			station so if we don't stop at the 147th then
			they don't know what car we're on.

	The train approaches the next platform without slowing.

				THUG #3
				(excited)
			We're not slowing! They don't know which
			train we're on! We are outta here!

	The THUGS rejoice in a quick celebration as the train speeds past
	the platform. On the platform is CLARK KENT next to LOIS LANE
	(with her cell phone.)

	The waiting commuters are confused and start mumbling. In an
	instant, CLARK peers into the moving train with his telescopic
	vision sees the THUGS with their hostages.

	CLARK takes two steps backwards behind the line of people. His
	gray hat can be seen above the headline as he moves along the
	platform in the direction of the train. Between the people, we
	see a blur that changes from a gray suit to the familiar colorful
	uniform. He emerges from the other side as SUPERMAN and flies
	into the tunnel.

	He's gone in a blur.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL

	SUPERMAN speeds through the darkened tunnel, his image is a
	flicker among the passing subway lights. As he approaches the
	train he turns sideways (left side down, his front to the train)
	and squeezes BETWEEN THE TRAIN AND SUBWAY WALL. His face strains
	as he builds speed and MATCHES the turns without slowing.

INT. SUBWAY CAR

	The HOSTAGES in the train are panicked. One HOSTAGE, facing the
	window, can see a large sideways "S" shield moving past them to
	the front of the train. HOSTAGE burps a small nervous laugh and
	another until they quickly build to a frenzy of uncontrolled
	laughter. The other HOSTAGES fear he's going to get them killed.

				THUG #2
				(to LAUGHING HOSTAGE)
			What the hell is so damn funny?

				laughing hostage
				(trying to calm himself)
					You...

	SUPERMAN arrives at the front of the train and turns upright
	flying in a standing position at the door.

				LAUGHING HOSTAGE
				(laugh)
				...are gonna...

	SUPERMAN forces his fingers between the doors and tears them open
	with the sound of twisting metal.

				LAUGHING HOSTAGE
				(trying to stop)
				...get your ass...

	SUPERMAN, hovering two feet above the floor, steps down inside.

				LAUGHING HOSTAGE
				(laughing)
				...so kicked.

	EVERYBODY in the train looks at the LAUGHING HOSTAGE with no idea
	what he's talking about.

				SUPERMAN (OS)
				Gentlemen...

	THUGS turn to see SUPERMAN. Immediately they point their guns and
	fire in a rapid succession of bullets. Barely moving, SUPERMAN
	whips his hands through the air catching dozens of bullets.

	THUG #2's gun jams.

	THUG #1 runs out of ammunition.

	THUG #3 keeps firing and SUPERMAN, still catching bullets walks
	slowly toward him, reaches out, wraps his fingers around the gun
	and begins to "crinkle" it causing it to SMOKE AND break apart.
	Metal chunks clang as they hit the floor. After the last piece
	falls, SUPERMAN laces his fingers with the THUG's and squeezes
	causing the THUG to buckle to his knees screaming in pain.

				SUPERMAN
				(to THUG)
			I'm guessing you're new here.

	THUG #2's gun unjams and he fires at SUPERMAN's back. SUPERMAN
	hears the shot and turns. The bullet hits him square in his chest
	and ricochets...

POV - the bullet: speeds back to THUG #2's forehead. THUG #2 screams and as
the bullet closes in on his face, it stops in mid-air.

	CAMERA pans out and SUPERMAN is holding the bullet between his
	thumb and index finger, four inches from THUG #2's forehead. The
	bullet is wafting smoke.

	THUG #2 is whimpering.

				SUPERMAN
			I think this belongs to you.

	He puts the hot bullet in THUG #2's palm and closes his fingers
	around it.

	The train comes to a stop.

EXT. STREETSIDE

	There are emergency vehicles and POLICE waiting streetside.
	SUPERMAN emerges from the subway surrounded by the crowd of
	people he's rescued.

	A little GIRL approaches.

					GIRL
			Superman, can I get my picture taken with
					you?

					MOTHER
			We're from out of town and it would be a
				great souvenir.

				SUPERMAN
			I really don't do pictures... but I'll tell you
					what...

	SUPERMAN holds out his hand still full of bullets. He kneels to
	the girl's level and blows on them. The little GIRL winces at the
	cold air. When the mist clears, the bullets are incased in ice.

	SUPERMAN plucks one from the mounds and hands it to her.

				SUPERMAN
			Why don't you take one of these and tell all
			your friends you saw Superman catch it?

					GIRL
					COOL!

	SUPERMAN sets the frozen bullets on the ground and the crowd
	scrambles for them. SUPERMAN sees LOIS off to the side jotting
	notes on a tablet furiously.

	The GIRL takes the frozen bullet and gleefully shows her parents.

					FATHER
				Thanks, Superman.

				SUPERMAN
				My pleasure.

	SUPERMAN shakes his hand and winces. FATHER looks at him shocked.
	LOIS notices.

					LOIS
				Let me see that.

				SUPERMAN
				I'm fine, Lois.

	LOIS opens his hand and his palm is burned. LOIS looks at him
	with fear in her eyes.

					LOIS
				Is this from the bullets?

				SUPERMAN
				I'll be okay.

	He flies off.

	He twists his ham-fists together and strains the small silver
	chain until it breaks. He holds his free hands in the air.

					PERP
				I'm flexible.

	He picks her up (OFFICER WARREN screams) and tosses her across
	the room like a discarded toy.

	The station goes berserk. POLICE scramble for cover and draw
	their weapons.

					PERP
			Okay, who wants to be first?!

				STRANGER (OS)
				That would be me.

	This whole sequence is done without a visual of the STRANGER. He
	is to be revealed later.

	PERP looks down and laughs.

						QUICK CUT TO:

EXT. POLICE STATION -- MIDDAY

	PERP is thrown through the front double glass doors and lands in
	the middle of the street. Dazed, he lifts himself to see a TRUCK
	headed straight for him.

	He SCREAMS! The DRIVER slams his breaks and the truck skids.

	At the last possible second, a hand presses into the truck grill
	and stops it. The airbag ignites and explodes on the DRIVER. The
	front of the car is smashed like it hit a tree.

				STRANGER (OS)
				To POLICE)
			Someone see if that driver is okay.

	The Police Station empties into the street. The PERP is mumbling
	to himself. The STRANGER grabs him by the back of his neck and
	squeezes. He points him into the direction of the OFFICER WARREN
	(who is rubbing her neck).

				STRANGER (OS)
				(To PERP)
			Since I'm sure you don't have a mother, I'll
			assume you don't know better.

					PERP
				Screw you, you frickin'-

				STRANGER (OS)
				(squeezing harder)
			Apologize to the lady. I'm only going to ask
				you nicely once.

					PERP
			(in horrible pain and whimpering)
			I'm sorry, Miss Police Lady Miss.

				STRANGER (OS)
				That's better.

	He lets go and PERP falls to the ground.

	CLOSE-UP ON PERP'S HANDS as six pair of handcuffs lock around his
	wrists and he's led back into the station by several COPS with
	rifles pointed at him.

	The STRANGER walks down the street.

					COP
				What was that?

						CUT TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

	A school bus has a blow-ouT. The DRIVER tries to keep control as
	it leans and is hit by A TRUCK knocking it on its side.

INT. SCHOOL BUS

	The CHILDREN are screaming and crying. The DRIVER staggers to his
	feet in the overturned bus.

					DRIVER
			KIDS! KIDS! Everybody stay calm. This is
				going to be okay.
				(pointing to an older boy)
			Patrick! See if you can open the emergency
					door!

	PATRICK pulls the lever but the door doesn't open. He sticks his
	head out a broken window and sees...

	A FREIGHT TRAIN. They have been pushed through traffic onto the
	tracks.

				PATRICK
			Mister Clifton! There's a train coming!

	The CHILDREN begin screaming when something else slams into the
	bus with a THUD!

					DRIVER
				What the--?

EXT. INTERSECTION/TRAIN CROSSING

	The bus starts to slide on the pavement through the train
	intersection. People get out of their cars watching the sight.
	CAMERA pans around the back of the train revealing STRANGER with
	his back against the bus PUSHING it over the tracks. The MAN is
	revealed slightly more than he was in the previous scene.

	The bus barely clears the tracks and the train speeds by.

	The STRANGER goes to the top of the bus (which is on its side)
	and with his bare hands tears into the metal roof making an
	opening for the children to escape.

				STRANGER
			Everybody be careful. The edges are sharp.
				Don't cut yourself.

	The DRIVER, the last one out, squints at the sun in his eyes as
	he looks to his silhouetted benefactor...

					DRIVER
				Thank you, Superm-

	And realizes this isn't SUPERMAN.

					DRIVER
				(Embarrassed)
				I'm sorry.

				STRANGER
			Don't worry. It happens all the time.

						CUT TO:

EXT. MONORIAL TRACKS

	CLOSE UP: There is a short in the magnet track, which showers in
	sparks.

INT. MONORAIL COCKPIT

	Gages begin flashing and the MONORAIL CONDUCTOR frantically tries
	to regain control. He clicks his radio on.

				MONORAIL CONDUCTOR
			Attention base fourteen! Attention base
			fourteen! MMT six eight nine zero is runaway!
			Repeat: MMT six eight nine zero is runaway!

	The monorail barrels through its switch-off.

				MONORAIL CONDUCTOR
				(to himself)
				Oh no. The switch.

INT. CITY HALL PRESS ROOM

	DEPUTY MAYOR MICHAEL WALKER is behind a podium fielding questions
	from reporters. Among them is CLARK KENT and JIMMY OLSEN.

					WALKER
			...has no official stand at this time but I'll
			have an answer for you next week. The last
			three questions will be Ms Parks, Mr Kent and
				Mr Knox from the Globe.

					KNOX
			With increased activities by Superman, does
			this administration endorse these
			unsanctioned actions and if it doesn't, how
			does it plan to police them?

					WALKER
				The MAYOR...

	CLOSE on CLARK KENT whose attention starts to drift. The DEPUTY
	MAYOR's voice warbles and with his hearing, he begins to focus on
	other things. The next lines overlap as if listening to a hundred
	people talk at once.

				EAVESDROP #1
			...I had the Szechwan Chicken and Garlic Sauce...

				EAVESDROP #2
			...how could you do that do me? You know how
				much I care about you...

				EAVESDROP #3
			...this behavior cannot be tolerated...

				EAVESDROP #4
			...has managed to synthesize and patent some
				new mineral at LexCorp...

				EAVESDROP #9
				...the nine thirty show...

				EAVESDROP #10
				...because of the gun...

				EAVESDROP #11
				...is so yummy...

				EAVESDROP #12
				...aren't really hers...

	The voices get more and more singled out until there is one lone
	voice.

				EAVESDROP #13
			...emergency vehicles stand by for massive
			collision victims at Monorail Base fourteen...

	The sound focuses again on WALKER.

					WALKER
			...but is appreciated regardless, Mr Knox. And
			the last question goes to Kent.

	The attention in the room shifts to an empty chair where CLARK
	was seconds earlier. Nobody saw KENT leave and no one is as
	surprised as OLSEN.

						CUT TO:

INT. CITY HALL PRESS ROOM

	CLARK scurries around the corner past employees. An elevator
	being repaired and the doors are wedged open. Two REPAIRMEN are
	working on the doors. CLARK moves to the elevator in a blur. Both
	REPAIRMEN turn away as the blur moves between them and drops down
	the darkened shaft.

	The two REPAIRMEN turn and look at each other and then go about
	the business.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

	CLARK freefalls down the shaft, his body a perfectly rigid form.
	His tie wisps above his head and his hair flips in the breeze as
	he plummets several stories. His eyes are closed enjoying the
	moment. The camera CLOSES IN on his chest.

	His hands gently take the edges of his buttoned shirt and TEAR
	THEM APART REVEALING THE RED AND YELLOW "S" SHIELD ON BLUE THAT
	FILLS HIS CHEST.

INT. CITY HALL ELEVATOR SHAFT

	The Lobby elevator is opened and marked off with "OUT OF ORDER"
	signs.

	SUPERMAN flies out of the shaft and through the lobby. Someone
	enters and SUPERMAN meets the open door perfectly and flies out.

						CUT TO:

EXT. SECOND MONORAIL

	A SECOND MONORAIL is unaware another has lost control and not
	switched tracks. They are heading directly toward each other.

EXT. TRACKS FROM OVERHEAD

	SUPERMAN swerves into view and catches up with RUNAWAY MONORAIL.

INT. RUNAWAY MONORAIL

	From inside, PASSENGERS look and point at SUPERMAN flying
	overhead.

EXT. RUNAWAY MONORAIL

	SUPERMAN flies in front of the monorail, places himself AGAINST
	the front car and pushes in an attempt to slow it down in vain.
	The MONORAIL CONDUCTOR can see SUPERMAN through the window.

				MONORAIL CONDUCTOR
			Come on, Superman! You can do it!

	The second monorail is gaining. SUPERMAN uses his telescopic
	vision and can see the other MONORAIL miles away closing in.

						CUT TO:

INT. SECOND MONORAIL

	CONDUCTOR is on the radio.

				CONDUCTOR
					WHAT!

	He throws a series of switches stopping the monorail. Passengers
	are thrown about as it halts.

						CUT TO:

EXT. RUNAWAY MONORAIL

	The RUNAWAY MONORAIL is within immediate distance.

	CLOSE on SUPERMAN's face, which is tightened and strained.

	The MONORAIL frame begins to cave in making an indention with
	SUPERMAN at its center.

	CLOSE on SUPERMAN's face, which is contorted...

	The noise stops.

	All is silent.

	CAMERA pans back from SUPERMAN's face and reveals a halted
	MONORAIL with his body pressed against it. He looks like a child
	in front of a semi compared to the train. CAMERA pans further
	revealing the SECOND MONORAIL maybe two feet in front of him.

	The CONDUCTORS stare at him in disbelief.

				CONDUCTOR
			Wait till my wife hears this one.

	CAMERA moves along side the distance of the RUNAWAY showing the
	relieved passengers through the windows and finally coming to the
	end of the train revealing the STRANGER holding the back end.
	From a back window, people inside the train have been watching
	him.

	The STRANGER lets go and steps out onto the platform tired and
	worn. This is the first time we fully see him in light. His is
	huge and bald with a goatee and dressed in black. In the
	distance, SUPERMAN staggers out from the train.

	SUPERMAN and the STRANGER's eyes meet. The train doors open and
	people flood out.

						CUT TO:

TELEVISION INTERVIEWS

	All taken from witnesses to the day's events and all in different
	places.

				SCHOOL GIRL
				(nervous)
			Then the bus flipped over and we all fell and
			the train was coming but somebody pushed us
			out the way and he was big and strong and big
			and he pushed us off the tracks.

					COP
			I don't know where he came from but he
			grabbed that guy and tosses him through the
			window into traffic like he was nothing. He
			made him apologize to Leah but I don't know,
			I might have let the guy get hit by that
					truck.

				MONORAIL CONDUCTOR
			I've seen Superman in action but he looked
			different today. Like he wasn't all there.

	The interviews are part of:

NEWSCAST: ACTION COMMENTS FEATURING SUPERMAN

	The show is a daily broadcast with a special segment every day on
	SUPERMAN's daily exploits. The logo in the background is made of
	slanted letters that appear to be flying off the screen.

	The host is ANGELA CHEN.

					ANGELA
			Metallo. Who is he? What is he? Where did he
			come from? In the past twenty-four hours,
			he's been responsible for six different
			rescues and stopping three crimes in
			progress. With rumors of Superman's abilities
			waning, could his timing be better?

			Here to address the issue of Superman's
			abilities and limitations is STAR Labs' Chief
			Science expert, Nobel Prize winner and
			personal friend of Superman, Professor Emil
				HAMILTON.

	PROFESSOR HAMILTON is a man in his early fifties with glasses;
	gray hair and a matching beard.

					ANGELA
			Professor HAMILTON, how accurate are the
			reports of an "injured" Superman?

				HAMILTON
			Since Superman's potential and the origin of
			his abilities are unknown to us, there is no
			sure way to tell to what extent he's
			suffering, if he's suffering at all.

					ANGELA
			So you will agree Superman is not the Man Of
			Tomorrow he was last month.

				HAMILTON
			I have done more tests on Superman than
			anyone else has on Earth but the duration of
			time it took for his powers to deteriorate to
			their current state, only he knows. I can
			only imagine the effect having such power and
			then suddenly have it dissipate...

	HOST gets a message from her earpiece.

					ANGELA
				(interrupting)
			Hold on. We have a report Metallo just
			stopped a jewel heist in the downtown
			financial district. We have a camera there
			now. Let's see if we can go live.

	A window appears with a scene of overturned cars on fire and
	several other wrecked vehicles.

					ANGELA
			Folks, I'm not sure what we're looking at
			here. There appears to be some fire and
				property damage.

	The JERKY CAMERA pans catching METALLO hoisting a THUG in each
	hand in the air and into the back of a POLICE van.

					ANGELA
				Wait! There's Metallo.

	CAMERA gets closer.

					ANGELA
				Metallo!

	He turns.

					ANGELA
			This is Angela Chen with Action Comments. Can
				we have a few words?

				METALLO
					Sure.

	Despite his massive intimidating size and almost threatening
	appearance, METALLO speaks very articulately and is
	well-mannered. He is a paradox of himself.

					ANGELA
			You're abilities obviously dwarf the rest of
			us. Can you tell us how you became Metallo?

				METALLO
			I wish I could but most of it's a blur to me.
			I remember being in a car accident and
			rescued by someone on the outskirts of the
			city. I was almost dead and this man, a
			scientist, saved my life. Unfortunately the
			scientist died soon after so there is a lot
			that's unexplained even to me. I'm not sure
			what he did to me but I'm just glad to be
			alive. I feel better now than I ever have.

					ANGELA
			The talk of the town is that if you hadn't
			assisted Superman with the monorail, hundreds
			could have died and possibly Superman. Do you
			believe Superman is weakening?

				METALLO
			Stopping that train wasn't easy. I know.
			Maybe there are some jobs that require more
				than Superman.

					ANGELA
			Is that your way of saying you plan on
			replacing Metropolis' Marvel?

				METALLO
			Definitely not. Superman is a hero to me as
			he is everyone in Metropolis, if not the
			world. Look, Metropolis is a big town. There
			are eleven million people here and I think
			there is more than enough room for the both
			of us. I bet the guy could use a vacation.

	Forced laughter from CHEN.

				METALLO
			Now if you don't mind, I'd like to make sure
			these guys get taken off and I still have to
				clean up this mess.

					ANGELA
			Thanks for your time. We have a CALLER.
			CALLER you're on the air with Professor
				HAMILTON.

				CALLER (VO)
				(very inarticulate)
			I seen Sooperman in action and I don't
			believe you guys is writin' his death
			certificate already and puttin' that Metallo
			guy on yer shoulders. The guy didn't catch a
			train for Pete's sake! He's always been there
			when it mattered. Maybe the guy didn't get
			enough sleep or he's got some kinda
			twenty-five hour bug or somethin'.

					ANGELA
				(confused)
			Oh-kay. We have another CALLER with an
				opposing view.

				Go CALLER.

				LUTHOR (VO)
			You really must develop a better screening
				process.

					ANGELA
				Is this Lex Luthor?

				LUTHOR (VO)
				Yes it is.

					ANGELA
			What an unexpected pleasure. Metropolis'
			favorite entrepreneur. Can I call you Lex?

				LUTHOR (VO)
					No.
					(Beat)
			I agree with Metallo. There is room in
			Metropolis for two heroes. I think
			underestimating Metallo may be a grave
			mistake. To put so much trust in one person
			can only be dangerous. At least we know
			Metallo is human unlike Superman who hides
			his origin. Exactly what do we know about
			Superman in the few years he's been here.

				CALLER (VO)
			I know he can kick your bald ass clear to
				Otisburg--

				LUTHOR (VO)
				(confused)
				Otisburg?

				CALLER (VO)
				Yeah you-

				LUTHOR (VO)
				Otisburg?

				CALLER (VO)
				Tell you what Luther...

				LUTHOR (VO)
				Lu-thor.

				CALLER (VO)
			Dumbass! Why don't you come out of that fancy
			glass house and you and me can do a little
			one on one in yer front yard or ain't you got
				the rocks?

					ANGELA
			Okay, I think that will be enough and we'll
			be back after this commercial break.

INT. DAILY PLANET

	Several staffers are gathered around the wall-mounted television
	and break up when the LEXAIR commercial starts. In the
	background, CLARK is at his desk handwriting a letter. LOIS is
	seated across from him. JIMMY approaches.

					JIMMY
			Did you see Metallo on the news? Man, is he
				something or what?

			(looking over LOIS' shoulder and pointing)
			There's a "k" in "panicked."

	LOIS smacks his hand... HARD. CLARK sneezes. LOIS instinctively
	hands him a box of tissue.

					CLARK
				Thank you.

	CLARK reaches for the box and LOIS draws it back.

					LOIS
				What was that?

					JIMMY
				(slightly confused)
				Mister Kent sneezed.

					LOIS
				Are you sick, Smallville?

					CLARK
			A little under the weather. Probably
				something going around.

					LOIS
				In June?

	She hands him the box.

					LOIS
			I've never seen you sick, Clark. I thought
			they built all you country boys big and
				strong.

					JIMMY
			That's true, Mister Kent. Wow. You're quick,
				Miss Lane.

					LOIS
			I'm a reporter, Jimmy. I notice things.

	CAT GRANT shouts from her desk on the other side of the room.

					CAT
			HAS ANYBODY NOTICED IF METALLO IS WEARING A
				WEDDING RING?

					CLARK
			I haven't been feeling well. I'm probably
			best I go home and get some rest.

	CAT approaches. CLARK puts his letter in an envelope and hands it
	to JIMMY.

					CLARK
			Jimmy, could you take this down to the mail
					room.

					JIMMY
				Sure thing, Mister Kent.

	CAT takes it from JIMMY.

					CAT
				Lana Lang?

					LOIS
			A letter? Let me guess your pigeons haven't
			come back yet? You know, with emails, faxes
			and if you really want to be a Neanderthal
			you could always use the telephone.

					CAT
			I think it's sweet. I can't remember when the
			last time somebody wrote something for me.
			Why can't I meet a nice guy?

					JIMMY
			Didn't Bruce Wayne serve you with a
				restraining order?

					CAT
			That was four years ago and I am feeling much
				better now, thank you.
					(Beat)
			Any good dirt I should know about, Clark?

					LOIS
			Kent doesn't have any dirt. He's going to go
			home and make some soup from a Kent recipe
			that's been in the family for six generations
			and huddle down with a quilt and Frank Capra
			movie that would make me wretch. Aren't you,
					Kent?

					CLARK
				Seven generations.

					JIMMY
			I thought you had visitors tonight, Mister
			Kent. Isn't that why you're letting Miss Lane
				interview Mayor Berkowicz?

INT. DAILY PLANET LOBBY

	A statuesque WOMAN (#2) dressed in a long skirt and conservative
	blouse enters. Her body is that of an athlete. Her legs are to
	die for. Her skin's like porcelain and her thick jet black wavy
	hair cascades down her shoulders to the middle of her back.

	She approaches the RECEPTIONIST (#3) who looks up, startled.

				RECEPTIONIST #3

	The doors open. Everyone in the elevator is at shoulder height to

	CLARK gets up and heads for PERRY's office.

					CAT
			Why are you so hard on Clark, Lois?

					RON
			She's jealous because she's LOIS LANE: ACE
			REPORTER and the story of the century, the
			coming of SUPERMAN, was swooped right out
			from underneath her while she was there; by
			the new guy, the country guy. The nobody who
			went to college at Hicksville University in
			Kansas. The nobody who never had a
			professional gig in his life and not only
			does he manage to sneak a story pass the
			great and powerful Lois Lane, he manages to
			win a Carlin Award in the process...

				On his first... time... out.

INT. CITY ROOM

					LOIS
					(Rant)
			You want to know what it is? This guy is a
			Boy Scout. He doesn't smoke. He doesn't
			drink. He doesn't swear. He calls his parents
			everyday. If I had to talk to my father
			everyday I'd kill myself. He's honest. He's
			trustworthy. He's moral. Every friend he's
			got he's had since high school and that just
			isn't normal. The guy says grace before his
			meals, eats his vegetables first and drinks
			milk. And that ridiculous hat! Who wears a
				fedora?
					(Beat)
			For Christ's sake, has anyone ever seen him
				use the bathroom?

	They stare at her like she's a madwoman.

					JIMMY
			I saw him help old lady Hayworth across the
			street to Berardo's Delicatessen yesterday.

					LOIS
			That is exactly what I mean. Everybody knows
			old lady Hayworth is a cranky bitch.
				(Searching for words)
			He's like some kind of by-the-book moral,
			excellent worker, great writer,
			seven-year-old in the body of a linebacker
				virgin.

					RON
			That's it. You're crazy. I hope your medical
				is paid for.

					LOIS
				(Standing to exit)
			No. There is something else to this guy.
			Things about him we couldn't imagine. Nobody
			eats that much apple pie. I can't put my
			finger on it but you'll know when I do. Kent
				is full of surprises.

	She turns and is eye level at the chest of the mystery WOMAN.

	(5'11" wearing four inch heels) towering over the 5'7" LOIS.

				WOMAN #2
			I was told I could find Clark Kent here.

	The WOMAN speaks in a very distinct accent (similar to Greek).
	Everyone is speechless.

			Clark Kent. He's a reporter.

			This is the City Room, isn't it?

	PERRY's door open and he and CLARK exit. CLARK sees his guest.

	He hugs her. LOIS stares at them both in disbelief.

	WOMAN #2 from here on will be known as DIANA.

					DIANA
			I thought I was in the wrong place.

				(To everyone)
			Everyone, this is an old friend, Diana.

			This is Ron Troupe. Cat Grant our society

					LOIS
				Oh really...

			Let me get my things and we can go. Have a

					LOIS
				So Diana...?

					DIANA
				Just... Diana.

					LOIS
				What is it you do?

					DIANA
			I'm an ancient history liaison for Marston
				University in Boston.

					LOIS
				Is that so?

					DIANA
			Mostly Greek history and cultures.

					LOIS
				Are you from Smallville?

					DIANA
			(Laughing, leans and whispers)
			Do I look like I'm from Smallville?

	CLARK returns.

					CLARK
				I'm ready.

	DIANA gets up and joins him.

	The apartment decor is simple. Lots of photos and mementos from

			That's my parents and Lana last Christmas.

					DIANA
				They're such good people.

	DIANA gently runs her finger over the image of PA KENT with envy.

					DIANA
			You know they sent me a Christmas card.

					CLARK
				(Embarrassed)
			I told them you didn't celebrate Christmas.
			You should send them a card when Zeus'
				birthday comes.

					DIANA
			I don't think Hallmark makes a card for that.

EXT. GRASSY PLAINS - NIGHT

	CLARK and DIANA are sitting on a large blanket eating by the dim
	light of a lantern. Although we can't see the background, they
	seem to be in the middle of nowhere with a starlit sky.

					DIANA
			Everyone misses you, Clark.

					CLARK
				(Distant)
			Really? That means a lot to me.

					DIANA
			You seem distant. What's troubling you,
					Clark?

					CLARK
			That train. I've caught planes in midair. I
			should have been able to stop that. If
			Metallo hadn't been there those people would
				have died.

					DIANA
			But they didn't. Be glad he was there.

					CLARK
			It's weird because I felt fine before I got
			there and then I just felt so tired.

					DIANA
				(Comforting)
				It's okay.

					CLARK
				(Worried)
			It's not okay. I don't get sick. Do you have
			any idea what it takes to make me tired?
					(Beat)
			There was a minute where I thought I was
			going to die with those people.

	DIANA's face turns serious.

					CLARK
			Have you ever thought you were going to die?

					DIANA
				(Uneasy at the idea)
			I, I've never considered it.

					CLARK
			Me neither. I swear I was going to get
			crushed between those trains. There was a
			minute, not even, a fraction of a second,
			where something inside told me to get out the
					way.

					DIANA
					Clark...

					CLARK
			And then in a split second I justified it
			thinking if I saved myself and let those few
			hundred people die how many more could I save
			in my lifetime? A few thousand? Tens of
			thousands? Would letting a few hundred people
			die be worth saving a few million in the end?

					DIANA
			But you could never do that. Do you think you
			could just let some asteroid drop into the
			middle of downtown and whatever happens,
				happens.
					(Beat)
			That's not like you. I know it's a lot of
			pressure but you raise the standard. Hal
			doesn't tell anybody but I can tell he tries
			to run the League like you would. People
			strive to be like you and that's a good
					thing.

					CLARK
			I'm afraid one day I'm going to fail them.

					DIANA
			And one day you might. But you can't live in
			fear of that. One day we both might die but
			it isn't how you die that's important... it's
				how you lived.

	There is a long silence.

					CLARK
			It's nice to have someone who understands.

					DIANA
				Anytime, Clark. Anytime.

					CLARK
			This is a really nice spot. I always wondered
				why it's here.

	Suicide Slum Metropolis' only ghetto and bigger than some towns.
	The buildings are run down tenements with barred windows. The
	cars are old and decrepit with exception if the occasional
	gangsta ride that people cross the street to avoid. Unless you
	can protect yourself, you don't walk here at night.

	On a corner, dozens of youths are hanging out when the sirens
	begin to wail. They echo through the night like air raid sirens
	from World War II.

	One by one, everything stops. Cars stop moving. Music stops
	playing. People stop talking. People sleeping wake and look out
	their windows to see the commotion. Everyone already outside

	of the nuclear power plant visible in the distance at the edge of
	the slum.

				VOICE (OS)
			--has ruptured and reached threatening levels
			in the Suicide Slum borough of Metropolis-

	CLARK shoots upright and darts into the living room where the
	CAMERA centers in on a television tuned to Metropolis' 24 hour
	news network WGBS. The volume is almost inaudible making the
	ANCHOR appear to be moving her lips without sound. As the CAMERA

	to escape the slum.

	In a blur, SUPERMAN passes overhead straight for the power plant.
	People stop in their tracks behave themselves reminded there will

				How old is this plant?

				SUPERVISOR #1
				It was built in 1984.

				SUPERMAN
			Then I assume you're using Barium and lead
			shielding to contain the radiation?

				SUPERVISOR #1
			Yes. If you can manually force the fail-safe
			shields back into place we can control the
			rupture from here. If not, radioactive steam
			forces the chamber to depressurize and there
			are going to be a lot of dead people in this

				Not tonight.

				Are the people safe?

				HAMILTON
			Everyone is fine. Metallo shut the reactor

	SUPERMAN gives him a look of surprise and disgust that he failed
	at the same time.

				SUPERMAN
				I have to get out of here.

			Superman, you're very weak. I'd like to run

	SUPERMAN staggers across the room and exits. People stare as he
	exits the elevator, a shadow of his former self, and exits the
	front door.

EXT. STAR LABS - DAY

	SUPERMAN moves across the pavement, lifts his hands in the air

	hovering in the air. He looks much better than he did earlier.
	LANA tosses balcony window open and leaps out into SUPERMAN's
	arms with no concern for her safety. He holds her thirty feet
	above the grassy lawn.

					LANA
				They said you were dead.

				SUPERMAN
				I'm not.

	Gently he floats to the balcony and carries her inside.

	MAYOR FRANK BERKOWICZ takes his place.

				BERKOWICZ
			I appreciate your coming on such short
			notice. I will try to make this brief. These
			are the facts: This morning, there was an
			unidentified malfunction at the Shuster
			Nuclear Facility. Attempting to stop a
			possible meltdown, Superman was rendered
			unconscious. The state of his condition was
			not known then and is still unclear. Metallo
			rescued Superman from the nuclear core of the
			facility and possible death.
					(Beat)
			For that we are all grateful. At this time I
			would like to extend my personal gratitude,
			as well as that of the great city of
			Metropolis, to Metallo, for averting disaster
				and saving our friend.

	Double doors in the back of the conference room swing open and
	METALLO strides down the aisle to the podium. Cameras barrage him
	with flashes. He shakes the MAYOR's hand and steps behind the
	podium for a few words.

			Hello. Yes, I was watching it just now.

	She mouths "It's your mother," to CLARK. He motions not to let

NEWS BROADCAST "ACTION COMMENTS FEATURING SUPERMAN"

	CLOSE on ANGELA CHEN, the host.

					ANGELA
			Welcome to a special edition of Action
			Comments. I'm your host, Angela Chen. With
			the near-disaster that took place several
			days ago, a debate has emerged regarding
			Metropolis' questionable power source. Our
			special guest for the hour is Metropolis'
			other favorite son, millionaire industrialist
				Lex Luthor.

	The CAMERA snaps to a TWO SHOT putting an insulted LUTHOR in the
	frame.

					LUTHOR
				Billionaire.

					ANGELA
				(Embarrassed)
				Oh, I'm sorry.

					LUTHOR
				A common error.

					ANGELA
			I would like to give a special thanks to
			Mister Luthor who not only agreed to this
			interview, but also permitted us to telecast
			from one of his soundstages in the LexCorp
				building.

					LUTHOR
			I would have been happy to join you downtown
			but in light of recent (ah-hem) incidents,
			one can never be too careful.

					ANGELA
			It's our pleasure, Mister Luthor.
					(Beat)
			Now it's your opinion this whole incident
				could have been avoided.

					LUTHOR
			Several months ago my engineers at LexCorp
			developed a revolutionary energy source. This
			source is able to produce the same results as
			a nuclear facility without the ugly side
			effects the citizens of Metropolis came so
			close to experiencing first hand.

					ANGELA
			Without the chance of a hazardous leak?

					LUTHOR
			None whatsoever. Our energy source is devised
			by splitting atomic particles and then
				harnessing that energy.

					ANGELA
			Nevertheless, if you have eliminated the
			radioactive side effect, then you aren't
			splitting uranium or any other radioactive
				element.

					LUTHOR
				Precisely.

					ANGELA
			Then what are you splitting?

					LUTHOR
			Now Angela, if I had a dime for every time
			someone asked me how I did something I'd be a
				millionaire.

					ANGELA
				But you are a billionaire.

					LUTHOR
				You catch on quick.

					ANGELA
			(Reaching to the side and getting a report)
			This is a report from the Metropolis Energy
			Commission in which they reviewed your
			proposal. They objected to your not allowing
			the energy source to be tested by an outside
			safety committee or revealing the source of
				the energy.

					LUTHOR
			Angela, you don't look into the face of God
			and ask him how he makes air. You should just
				be glad it's there.
					(Beat)
			Let it be known there were only two people on
			that panel that oppose me and refused to move
			into the twenty first century.

					ANGELA
			Then there is an issue of price. This energy
			would cost the citizens of Metropolis three
			times what they are currently being charged.
				Do you think this is fair?

					LUTHOR
			Things cost money. Power plants cost money.
			Research costs money. Skilled EMPLOYEEs cost
			money. Your children's safety costs money.
			People will say it's a lot of money but I can
			guarantee the people at Love Canal, Three
			Mile Island and Chernobyl wish they had that
			option. In fact, I bet there are people in
			Suicide Slum tonight that would pay for that
				option.

					ANGELA
			But aren't you afraid people will look at
			this as a case of the rich getting richer?
			Don't you have a duty as a human being to-

					LUTHOR
			I want the best for my city, Miss Chen. I'm a
			business man, let Simon Carr and Ted Kord be
			philanthropists and humanitarians.

			I have always thought Metropolis was on the
			forefront of technology and many of those
			advancements come from LexCorp.

			They don't call Metropolis "America's City"
			for nothing. We are not the standard and
			never should accept that position. We are the
			example and if my beloved city refuses to
			look at the future because of a few extra
			pennies, then I think it's a sad day in
			Metropolis. How many more meltdowns do we
			have to incur before we realize safety is our
			responsibility and not that of some stranger
				in his underwear.

					ANGELA
			Whoa! That almost sounded like an attack on
				Superman.

					LUTHOR
			Let me just thank God for Metallo because
			without him there would be a few hundred
			thousand dead people MAYOR Berkowicz would
				have to account for.

					ANGELA
			Well, in an opinion poll taken this
			afternoon, citizens were asked who they would
			depend on in a crisis and an overwhelming
			eighty-two percent still said they would side
			with Superman. I think it may be a little
				premat--

	S M A S H!

	The image, revealed to be on a television, dies. Inside the
	cracked screen is an empty liquor bottle.

				METALLO (OS)
				WHAT THE HELL?!

	METALLO is on a huge sofa with five scantily clad BIMBOS trying
	to caress a piece of him. The furnishings in the massive room
	reek of money. The wall-sized windows overlook the nightlit city.
	Along the floor are liquor bottles and empty plates where METALLO
	has been treated like a king.

	His demeanor is 180 degrees different than what it was earlier.
	He is loud, thuggish and belligerent.

				BIMBO #1
			Oh John, what did you have to go and do that
			for? That's the third set this week.

				METALLO
			I can't stand this crap! Everywhere I go it's
			Superman save me and Superman you're my hero!
			How many people do I have to save?! How much
			of this do I have to put up with?!

	BIMBO #1 can be heard in the background ordering a new
	television.

				BIMBO #2
			I don't know what that Chen girl likes but I
			think you're so much sexier than Superman.
			Capes are so out this year. Besides,
			everybody knows nice boys finish last, and
			more importantly, are so bo-ring.

				BIMBO #3
			Come on, John. Let's go in the back and we
			can take your mind of things.

	She nuzzles his neck. BIMBO #2 starts unbuttoning his shirt and
	kissing his chest. It makes him uncomfortable.

				BIMBO #3
				Doesn't that feel good?

				METALLO
					NO!

	He bucks them both onto the floor.

				METALLO
			It doesn't feel like anything! I can't feel
			anything! I can't smell anything!

			(He kicks a plate of food across the floor)
			I can't taste anything! And I am sick of
			being second to that blue idiot! I'm just a
			shell of a man and I got nothing!
				(Long Beat)
			Me and Luthor gotta have a talk.

	METALLO stands up and BIMBO #4 hangs on him.

				BIMBO #4
			Don't go anywhere, Johnny Baby. Stay here
				with us.

	Picks BIMBO #4 up with one hand and tosses her through the air
	onto a sofa.

	METALLO storms from the room. The BIMBOS all get very serious.
	They aren't as dumb as the pretend and their real purpose is
	keeping METALLO docile. BIMBO #5 picks up the telephone.

				BIMBO #5
				Security? He's out.

	MAKE-UP people rush the two and touch up the make-up. LUTHOR's
	cell phone rings. He motions the MAKE-UP people away and answers
	it.

			Yes. How long ago? Very well.

						CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY

	Four SECURITY GUARDS scramble through the hall to meet METALLO.
	The elevator door opens revealing the hulking METALLO.

				SECURITY #1
				(To METALLO)
			Sir, I'm going to have to ask-

	METALLO lifts him and throws him THROUGH THE AIR. He hits the
	floor and slides into a wall.

	He grabs another and lifts him over his head knocking ceiling
	tiles down with his feet as he turns and drops him.

	He takes another and pushes him into a wall denting the plaster
	rendering him unconscious. His limp body hangs in the broken
	plaster for a few seconds and drops.

	The last GUARD draws his gun and fires into METALLO's back.
	METALLO turns. The GUARD fires Repeatedly.

				METALLO
			Is that the best Luthor's got?

	METALLO pushes him aside and he slides across the tiles and stops
	at the feet of MERCY GRAVES.

	METALLO walks over the bodies to pass MERCY. She raises her hand
	for him to halt.

	His hulking mass makes her look even smaller than she is. There
	is fury in METALLO's eyes and no fear in MERCY's.

	MERCY calmly reaches into her pocket, retrieves a small remote
	control with one button.

				METALLO
				You gotta be shittin' me.

	She shows it to METALLO, and then presses the button.

	METALLO lets out a quick scream and is silenced. He doubles over
	and drops to his knees in excruciating pain.

	LUTHOR's voice is heard through her earpiece.

				LUTHOR (VO)
			Mercy, is our guest under control?

					MERCY
				Yes, Mister Luthor.

				LUTHOR (VO)
			Good. Prepare him for company. I'll be up in
				a minute.

						CUT TO:

INT. LEXCORP PENTHOUSE - METALLO'S QUARTERS

	METALLO is seated in a large metal chair with thick, modified
	manacles on his wrists and ankles. He's immobile except from the
	neck up. His face strains as he tries to break free.

	The doors are tossed open and LUTHOR saunters to the bar and
	makes himself a drink.

					LUTHOR
			John Corben. I have to say I thought our
			working relationship up to this point had
			been quite complimentary. You really must
			learn how to behave when you're a guest in
				someone's home.

				METALLO
			What have you done to me, Luthor?

					LUTHOR
			The same thing I do to everyone.
				(Facing him)
				I control you.
					(Beat)
			Of course with you, it isn't something as
			easy as slush funds or threatening your
			family. You're special. I had to have
			equipment built, satellites to monitor you
			etcetera etcetera etcetera.

	LUTHOR walks over and taps the manacles with a new sterling
	silver pen.

					LUTHOR
			You didn't think I was going to spend a few
			billion dollars to make you the most powerful
			THUG on Earth just to watch you walk away
			when you got bored, did you? It's all
			planning, my boy. That's why I am who I am
				and you are...
					(Beat)
			Well, why you're stuck in that ridiculous
					chair.

				METALLO
			Nobody treats John Corben like a chump.

					LUTHOR
			Pay attention you idiot, I am treating you
			like a chump because, I don't know if you
			noticed or not, you are the chump. Without
				me, you're nothing.

				METALLO
			Without you, I'd still be man! I can't feel
			anything! The heat, the cold, nothing! I
			can't smell! I can't taste! Everything sounds
			funny. Nothing looks right. I can't stand
			this! You've made me into some kind of freak!

					LUTHOR
				(Furious)
			I saved your life! If I hadn't invested in
			you, you would be a two-bit dead assassin and
				petty thief.

	LUTHOR turns to leave.

				METALLO
				This isn't over, Luthor.

					LUTHOR
				(Furious)
				Is that a threat?

				METALLO
			Why don't you call one of your lawyers and
				have them figure it out?

					LUTHOR
			Better yet, why don't I call my technicians
			and have them take you apart one piece at a
					time?
					(Beat)
			Bitch bitch bitch. Moan moan moan. You're
			alive and as jarring as it may be, it still
			beats the hell out of the alternative...
					(Beat)
				...Which is still an option.

	No answer.

					LUTHOR
			John Corben, you are alive because I want you
			that way and when or if I decide otherwise,
			there is nothing on this planet than can save
				you. Is that clear?

				METALLO
				(Reluctantly)
					Yes.

					LUTHOR
			Excellent. Now I'll let you go if you promise
			to behave and cooperate as agreed.

	METALLO nods. LUTHOR has the remote MERCY had earlier and
	switches him "on." METALLO stands and breaks free of the manacles
	that drop to the floor with a metallic clang.

					LUTHOR
			Now if you'll excuse me, I have business to
				attend to.

	LUTHOR turns before exiting.

					LUTHOR
			And John, you may be a shell of your former
			self and you may be my pawn...
					(Beat)
			...but at least you have your health.

	LUTHOR leaves. METALLO, furious, picks up the metal chair and
	tears it in half.

INT. METALLO'S PENTHOUSE

	TIME LAPSE: METALLO paces the room pondering his situation.

	METALLO exits.

						CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY

	METALLO walks the halls with a mission. People cross to get out
	of his way.

						CUT TO:

INT. LEXCORP COMMUNICATIONS CENTER

	The door slides open and METALLO enters. The room is covered with
	wall-to-wall state-of-the-art technology. There are several TECHS
	wandering about manning their stations. One sees METALLO and
	approaches him.

				TECH #1
			Sir, this area is authorized personnel only.
				(Recognizes him)
				You're Metallo.

				METALLO
				(Polite)
				Yes, I am.

				TECH #1
			I didn't know you were in the building.

				METALLO
			I'm a guest of Mister Luthor.

				TECH #1
			Well it sure is pleasure to meet you, sir. I
			saw what you did with the chemical fire on
			the East Side. My brother lives there and
				it's appreciated.

				METALLO
			No problem. I was bored so I've been
			wandering the building. I just wanted to look
				around. Is that okay?

				TECH #1
			Sure. We aren't accustomed to having guests
			but I can give you the nickel tour.

				METALLO
				What is all this?

				TECH #1
			This is the Communication Center for LexCorp.
			From here we keep in contact with the
			affiliates in Atlanta, New York, Tokyo, Coast
			City, Sydney, London and another three dozen
			cities worldwide. Mister Luthor can control
			information from his own private network as
			well as the sixty-eight satellites he has in
			orbit around the planet and on reconnaissance
				missions through space.

				METALLO
				Pretty impressive.

				TECH #1
			State-of-the-art. When NASA and NORAD
			upgraded they came to Mister Luthor. There
			isn't another system close to this on Earth.

				METALLO
			I guess all this is pretty expensive.

				TECH #2
			Most of it is prototype. Some of it designed
			by Mister Luthor himself and only he knows
				the specs.
				(Whispering)
			He's something of a paranoid and doesn't like
			to depend on others for designs.
					(Beat)
			Most of it is irreplaceable.

				METALLO
					Good.

	METALLO pushes a TECH out of the way, RIPS A 25" MONITOR FROM THE
	WALL and lifts it over his head showering him in sparks. All the
	TECHS scramble for safety.

				METALLO
				Excuse me.

	Some TECHS in his way run for cover. METALLO throws the monitor
	and destroys a panel of computer banks.

				TECH #2
			Somebody call Mister Luthor!

	He begins to trash the room ripping components from the walls and
	flipping work stations over. Fires flare and components explode.

	A TECH, cowering behind some equipment, reaches out and presses a
	button.

						CUT TO:

INT. LEXCORP SECURITY

	A SIREN wails accompanied by FLASHING RED LIGHTS. SECURITY MEN
	scramble for the COMMUNICATION CENTER.

	INT. HALLWAY

	The SECURITY TEAM passes several intersecting hallways. MERCY
	GRAVES comes out of one and joins them.

	METALLO rounds a corner to find MERCY and her men waiting for
	him. She is in the forefront. The TEAM is kneeling with rifles.
	MERCY is holding out his remote.

	He pauses.

	She presses the button.

	METALLO is still standing. She presses the button again. Nothing.
	A look of fear sweeps over her face as METALLO gently takes the
	box from her hands and crushes it in his fist.

					MERCY
				(Quiet)
					Shit.

	He lifts MERCY and tosses her.

	The SECURITY TEAM opens fire riddling METALLO with bullets.
	METALLO charges them.

						SNAP CUT TO:

INT. LUTHOR'S PENTHOUSE

	LUTHOR is in bed with another anonymous BIMBO when the videophone
	rings. Annoyed, he sits and answers it.

					LUTHOR
					What?

				SECURITY
			Mister Luthor, there's been a problem.

					LUTHOR
				What kind of problem?

				SECURITY
			You better just come down here.

						CUT TO:

INT. LEXCORP LOBBY

	LUTHOR enters what looks like a battlezone. The walls are on fire
	and riddled with bulletholes. There is a LEXCORP MEDICAL TEAM
	attending to the wounded.

	Furiously, LUTHOR looks for someone to blame.

				SECURITY
			We did the best we could. We barricaded the
				exits to contain him.

					LUTHOR
				Then where is he?

	SECURITY GUARD points OFF CAMERA and LUTHOR turns as the CAMERA
	pans revealing a door-sized hole in the wall.

						CUT TO:

EXT. JUMPERS BRIDGE - NIGHT

	JUMPERS BRIDGE is the entrance to SUICIDE SLUM. METALLO walks
	across the desolate bridge, occasionally being passed by
	vehicles.

EXT. SUICIDE SLUM MAIN STREET - NIGHT

	Despite the hour, there are people, drug dealers, gangs and
	hookers wandering the streets. He walks into the center of the
	main strip. Traffic stops around him and comes screeching to a
	halt. Horns start to blare and people become irate that he
	refuses to move. A crowd starts to gather.

	A car screeches to a halt barely missing him.

					DRIVER
			WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM?!

	METALLO reaches under the front end of the car and flips it over
	landing it on its top.

	People are too frightened to move but the noise stops.

	His voice, which starts as a low roar and escalates without
	effort.

				METALLO
				(Bellowing and building)
				GET OUT!

						CUT TO:

EXT. SMALLVILLE GENERAL MARKET (6AM)

	CLARK is getting groceries. The market owner, METCALF, spots
	CLARK behind the shelves.

				METCALF
				Clark? Is that Clark Kent?

					CLARK
				Hi, Mister Metcalf.

	Excitedly, he comes around the counter and shakes his hand.

				MERCALF
			I don't think I've seen you since you went
			off to the big city to be reporter.

					CLARK
			That's not true. You saw me last Christmas.

				METCALF
			Then it just feels like forever. You know, I
			bet we're the only store in all of Kansas
			that gets the Daily Planet sent in everyday.
			Granted, it gets here two days late but it's
				the effort that counts.

					CLARK
				I appreciate that.

				METCALF
				Where are your folks?

					CLARK
			They're probably at home. They don't know I'm
			here. It's kind of a surprise.

	CLARK hands him some money and METCALF gives him change.

				METCALF
			I get it. Mums the word. You take care.

					CLARK
				I will.

EXT. GENERAL STORE - DAWN

	CLARK exits and LANA is in her truck listening to the radio,
	singing and tapping the steering wheel like drums. He gets in the
	passenger side.

						CUT TO:

EXT. APPROACHING LANA'S HOUSE - MORNING

On the radio are SONNY & CHER. LANA is singing along. CLARK much more shy.

					LANA
				(Singing)
			...before it's earned our money's all been
					spent.
				(To CLARK)
				Come on, Clark.
				(Coaching)
			"Put your little hand in mine."

					CLARK
				(Singing badly)
			Put your little hand in mine. Ain't no hill
			or mountain, we can't climb.

				CLARK & LANA
				(Singing)
			Babe, I got you, babe. I got you, babe.

					CLARK
				(Loosening up)
				I got you, babe.

					LANA
				(Singing)
				I got you, babe.

					CLARK
			If you've got me, who's got you?

	LANA laughs.

					LANA
				(Singing)
				I got you, babe.

	The car pulls into her driveway. CLARK carries the groceries
	inside as LANA is still humming the song.

						CUT TO:

INT. LANA'S KITCHEN

	CLARK puts the groceries up while LANA turns on the television.
	Her humming stops. Without being called, CLARK comes out of the
	kitchen.

	On the television is a LIVE broadcast of Metropolis where a city
	block has been devastated. Behind the reporter are barricades and
	what looks like hundreds of POLICE in riot gear swarming into the
	area. In the center of it all is METALLO.

				REPORTER (VO)
			...don't understand. We're a safe distance but
			that's uncertain since Metallo has been seen
			to toss various debris, some the size of
				cars, several blocks...

	LANA changes the channel and the same scene is shown from a
	helicopter POV.

				REPORTER (VO)
			...just tuning in, Metallo, who only days ago
			prevented a meltdown and saved hundreds of
			thousands of lives in Metropolis' Suicide
			Slum, came in this morning and ordered,
			repeat ordered, it's citizens to evacuate as
			he then took over the fifteen square mile
				project...

	She changes the channel again.

				REPORTER (VO)
			...declared Suicide Slum his property and said,
			and we quote, "whoever wants it can come and
			get it," and then forced its inhabitants out
				of their homes...

	Another channel.

			...luckily, most of the people in the area have

					ago...

	Another channel.

				reporter (VO)
			...Berkowicz has called in the Metropolis
			Special Crimes Unit and is in contact with
			the Governor requesting National Guard
			assistance in the absence of Superman...

	The CAMERA is close on CLARK's stunned face and then pans forward
	revealing LANA looking at him.

					CLARK
				I have to go.

					LANA
			Why does it always have to be you, Clark?

					CLARK
			Because I'm the only one who can.

	CLARK leans in, LANA closes her eyes and he gives her a long
	passionate kiss.

	While her eyes are closed, there is a burst of wind through the
	house that rattles the walls. She opens her eyes to see pictures
	shifting on their nails and the front door flung wide open
	flapping on its hinges.

	She runs to the front lawn and looks skyward and he's gone.
	CLARK's POV: On her lawn, she looks tiny.

					LANA
				(Shouting)
				BE CAREFUL, CLARK!

						CUT TO:

INT. LEXCORP COMMUNICATIONS CENTER

	The center is in shambles after the METALLO incident. LUTHOR
	enters and a TECH is immediately at his side.

					LUTHOR
			If that's your best, your best won't do.

			Sir, we've already doubled our staff.

					LUTHOR
				(Angry)
			Metallo is tearing up a city block and every

						CUT TO:

EXT. SUICIDE SLUM STREET - DAWN

	Concrete chunks have been torn out of the street. Cars are over
	turned on their sides and on fire along with various other
	debris. Holes have been punched through buildings leaving their
	insides visible from the street. Scattered along the streets are
	the bodies of fallen POLICE OFFICERS and CITIZENS who got in the
	way.

	Among it all is METALLO. Barely worn and in a frenzy.

INT. SUBWAY BENEATH SUICIDE SLUM

	PEOPLE crush into the subway trying to escape the escalating
	damage above them. Fighting their way through the mass of PEOPLE
	are LOIS LANE with JIMMY OLSEN in tow. They are the only people
	fighting to get in SUICIDE SLUM.

					LOIS
				Come on, Jimmy!

					JIMMY
			I don't think this is a good idea, Miss Lane.

					LOIS
			Front seat at the fight of the century is
				always a good idea!

					JIMMY
			But nobody's seen Superman in days.

					LOIS
			What does that have to do with anything?

					JIMMY
			If nobody's seen Superman then who's gonna
			save us if something goes wrong?

					LOIS
			What are you talking about? Superman doesn't
				always save us.

					JIMMY
			Yes, he does. Especially you.

	LOIS pauses. She's never considered that.

					LOIS
				Let's go.

	They force their way through the masses.

EXT. STREETSIDE

	LOIS and JIMMY emerge onto the street and find themselves in the
	middle of a firefight.

	LOIS ducks while JIMMY's starts clicking away.

	The METROPOLIS SPECIAL CRIMES UNIT (SCU) arrives.

	Six HUMVEE-like RIOT VEHICLES roll onto the site. They have thick
	armor plates that extend the length of the vehicle attached their
	sides with hydraulic arms. Three barricade one side of the block
	and the other three the opposing side. The hydraulic arms lower
	the armored plates to the ground with a thud. A back door drops
	open forming a ramp and simultaneously SCU TROOPERS hustle from
	the transports and take cover behind the plates. The TROOPERS are
	dressed in SWAT/Military black uniforms with a large white "SCU"
	insignia and various technical modifications (radios, helmets,
	goggles).

	Leading them is SCU Commander CAPTAIN MAGGIE SAWYER along with
	DAN TURPIN (her second in command). They are also dressed in
	black fatigues. SAWYER has short brown hair and a lack of
	femininity. TURPIN is a gruff, seasoned veteran of the force in
	his late 40s.

				TROOPER #1
				(To SAWYER over the noise)
			Sir, ground force is in place and air support
				is standing by!

					SAWYER
				Drop 'em!

	OVERHEAD, BLACK METROPOLIS SCU HELICOPTERS fly overhead and hover
	above the tenements as SCU TROOPERS repel to the rooftops. With
	their weapons strapped to their backs, they scurry into positions
	overlooking the street.

				TROOPER #1
			The eye in the sky is armed and ready, sir!

					SAWYER
				(In MEGAPHONE)
			METALLO! You're surrounded! Throw down your
			weapons and step into the open!

	METALLO looks around him and holds his arms out.

				METALLO
				You see any weapons?!

					TURPIN
			Jesus, he did all that by himself?

					SAWYER
				(To METALLO)
			Surrender, Metallo! You don't have a chance!

				METALLO
				Then come and get me.

					SAWYER
				(To METALLO)
			This is your last chance! I am counting to
					three!
					(Beat)
					ONE!
					(Beat)
					TWO!

	METALLO picks up a motorcycle and hurls it through the air at
	SAWYER.

					TURPIN
				INCOMING!

	TROOPERS scatter for their lives. The cycle crashes into a RIOT
	VEHICLE and EXPLODES.

				METALLO
				(To himself)
					Three.

					SAWYER
				(In radio)
				GROUND TROOPS! OPEN FIRE!

	TROOPERS pop up from behind their cover and begin a nonstop
	barrage of bullet fire that doesn't phase him. He starts smiling.

					TURPIN
				He ain't droppin'.

	Several grenades are thrown and explode around him. He catches
	one and it explodes in his fist. METALLO walks to the barricade.
	TROOPERS fire furiously at him as he grabs one and lifts him over
	the four foot barricade, tossing the TROOPER into the middle of
	the street. METALLO pushes the barricade over and several
	TROOPERS run but one is caught under its falling weight.

	FIRE TROOPER comes with a flame thrower.

				FIRE TROOPER
					CLEAR!

	METALLO turns as the fire blast engulfs him. The sixty foot blast
	makes visibility almost zero. METALLO appears through the flames
	and crimps the flame thrower nozzle causing the fire to draw
	inside. The fuel tank on FIRE TROOPER's back explodes, killing
	him.

	When METALLO emerges from the fire his flesh is burned but is
	causing him no pain. Parts of it don't even look attached to his
	face.

					TURPIN
			Maggie we are getting our butts handed to us!

					SAWYER
				(In radio)
			ALL UNITS! EXERCISE DEADLY PHYSICAL FORCE AT
			YOUR OWN DISCRETION! I REPEAT: TAKE THIS PUNK
					DOWN!

	WEAPONS ERUPT from all directions. METALLO picks up a rifle and
	starts shooting TROOOPERS. When his clip is empty, he starts
	tossing MEN with reckless abandon.

	Rooftop SNIPERS, frustrated, toss their guns to the side and open
	their ROCKET LAUNCHERS. ROCKETS whistle through the air exploding
	near METALLO knocking him off balance. When he falls, the
	TROOPERS are given hope and suddenly what seems like dozens of
	rockets are exploding around him.

	A rocket zooms directly at the back of his head and he turns and
	CATCHES IT. The end is hot and there's a long exhaust trail. He
	holds it over his head and screams. The exhaust flame stops.
	METALLO hurls the rocket back to the rooftop it came from and it
	explodes at the top of the building front causing it to break
	off. Huge chunks of concrete. TROOPERS at the building edge fall
	several stories to their deaths.

	LOIS and JIMMY are hiding and taking pictures when JIMMY is hit
	with a stray bullet. He hits a wall and is knocked unconscious.

					LOIS
					JIMMY!

	Frantically, LOIS tries to wake him but can't.

	She calls out on her cell phone.

			If there are any snipers available, we have

				She's coming out with us.

				TROOPER #1
				I'm not going in there.

					What?

				SNIPER (VO)

			There is a woman and a boy about three
			hundred yards in from the East Side. The boy
				is unconscious.

					TURPIN
				No problem. I'll go.

	TURPIN gets his gear.

					TURPIN
				(To TROOPER)
				It's my job.

					SAWYER
				(On radio)
			Rescue underway. I need as much distraction
				as possible.

	TROOPERS pop up and start firing at METALLO as TURPIN runs into
	the block. Distracted, TURPIN finds LOIS and JIMMY.

					TURPIN
				Lois Lane?

					LOIS
			No, I'm some other idiot caught in a warzone.

					TURPIN
				Nobody likes a smart ass.

	TURPIN tosses JIMMY across his shoulder.

					TURPIN
				Hold this.

	He gives LOIS his rifle and takes his handgun out.

					TURPIN
			It's like a camera. Just point and click.

					LOIS
			Nine millimeter German Glock with a modified
					grip.

	TURPIN gives her a surprised look.

					LOIS
			I was an Army brat. I think I'll be okay.

	LOIS takes the handgun and gives him his rifle back.

					TURPIN
				Okay then, let's go.

	They charge out into the open running for the barricade. TURPIN's
	in the lead when METALLO turns. LOIS stops and starts firing.

	TURPIN makes it to safety. METALLO closes in on LOIS and lifts
	her into the air and disarms her.

				METALLO
			I know you. You're that reporter from The
				Daily Planet.

					LOIS
			And here I didn't think you could read.

				METALLO
				Oh, you're funny, too.

	He lowers her so they're face to face. Her feet are still
	dangling over a foot off the ground.

				METALLO
				How about we dance?

	LOIS spits in his face.

					LOIS
				My dance card's full.

				METALLO
				That's gonna cost you.

	There is a tapping on METALLO's shoulder.

				SUPERMAN (OS)
				Excuse me.

	Surprised, he turns.

	Behind him is SUPERMAN.

				SUPERMAN
			If the lady says she doesn't want to dance,
			then she doesn't want to dance.

	SUPERMAN belts METALLO in the face and he drops LOIS to the
	street. METALLO is first shocked and then angry.

				SUPERMAN
				(Very serious)
			You need to get to safety, Miss Lane. This
			looks like a job for Superman.

	LOIS runs to the TROOPERS who are standing by.

				METALLO
			So... you finally decided to come out and play.

	METALLO charges and grabs SUPERMAN. SUPERMAN spins and using his
	own momentum tosses METALLO across the street into a wall.
	METALLO pushes himself out leaving an indentation.

				SUPERMAN
			Do I look like I'm playing?

				METALLO
			Fine. It's about time this got interesting.

	METALLO rips a lightpole from the pavement and swings at
	SUPERMAN's whose irises turn from blue to red and a thin beam of
	light sears the end of the pole off. It falls to the ground with
	a thud.

	METALLO jabs the shortened pole at SUPERMAN and hits him in the
	stomach doubling him over. SUPERMAN, angry, straightens and grabs
	METALLO and begins punching him about the face. He lifts him over
	his head and throws him through a building leaving a gaping hole.

	In the background, the SCU UNIT cheers. Only SUPERMAN hears the
	punch through brick in the distance.

	He turns and with his telescopic vision he zooms in on the
	building corner and again until he sees where an arm is extended
	through the brick wall. The fist starts to move horizontally very
	quickly tearing brick from the building. The building begins to
	creak as the front, without lower support, starts to shift.

	THE BUILDING SIDE collapses on superman exposing the interior of
	the tenement. Clouds of dust are thrown into the air. The SCU
	UNIT takes cover coughing. SUPERMAN is buried beneath the rubble.

	The dust clears and METALLO steps from inside over the rubble. He
	leers at the SCU UNIT.

				METALLO
				Who's next?

	A HUM THAT SOUNDS LIKE MASSIVE DRILLING NOISE ERUPTS FROM BENEATH
	THE PAVEMENT.

	SUPERMAN bursts UPWARD IN A WHIRLWIND OF MOTION sending bricks
	and rubble airborne. He picks METALLO up with one hand on his
	shoulder, the other on his leg and lifts him over his head and
	slams him to the ground.

	METALLO gets up and charges SUPERMAN tackling him to the ground,
	through the pavement and into the sewer.

INT. SEWER

	Waist high in water, METALLO stands. SUPERMAN, hovering above the
	water, blows with his freezing breath turning the sewer water to
	ice with the moisture on the walls.

	SUPERMAN begins to look visibly weak. METALLO laughs.

				METALLO
			Is that the best you got? It's starting to
			get to you. You can't beat me. You're a dead
			man and you don't even know it.

	METALLO punches and shatters the ice freeing himself. SUPERMAN
	flies upward out of the sewer. METALLO climbs out after him.

	In the background, SUPERMAN is getting the hell beat out of him.

	SUPERMAN moves from METALLO's path and fires his HEAT VISION at
	him. METALLO blocks the beam with his hand causing it to burn
	bright red.

	His hand starts to smoke and his "skin" burns off.

	The flames die exposing METALLO's forearm and hand As a highly
	advanced metal skeleton hand with gears and joints. VARIOUS PARTS
	OF HIM HAVE BEEN EXPOSED REVEALING A MECHANICAL ROBOT INTERIOR.

			Let's get this over with and call it a day.

	METALLO opens his tattered shirt exposing his metallic chest. A
	series of layers opens and SUPERMAN is basked in a bright green
	light. Inside METALLO's chest cavity is a jagged softball-sized
	chunk of KRYPTONITE, SUPERMAN's only weakness. The KRYPTONITE is
	surrounded by small solar cells absorbing it's energy and
	powering METALLO.

			You mean, "there should be nothing
			radioactive in these areas." But there is.

			Suicide Slum to make his stand.

			Superman doesn't stand a chance.

					TURPIN
				Krypto-what?

			It's a mineral with radioactive properties

			I designed this suit for when Superman

	METALLO picks SUPERMAN up and slams him into the ground
	repeatedly cracking the pavement.

	SUPERMAN makes contact with METALLO who catches him, slamming him
	into the pavement. METALLO picks SUPERMAN up and tosses him
	across the parking lot. SUPERMAN stands and is hit by a car flung
	at him, knocking him down again.

	METALLO picks up the dazed SUPERMAN and tosses him into the back
	of a trash truck, walks around the side and throws the switch. As
	the compactor closes, the truck ROCKS BACK AND FORTH and topples
	over on METALLO pinning him underneath.

	SUPERMAN tears through the roof of the truck, lifts the corner
	where METALLO is pinned and slams it down on him repeatedly.

	SUPERMAN pulls METALLO from under the truck, stands him upright
	and kicks him across the street into the remains of the LEXFLIGHT
	battle. METALLO grabs a LEXFLIGHT rifle and fires on SUPERMAN.

	METALLO's face is filled with a wicked satisfaction and perverse
	pleasure as he fires on SUPERMAN.

	SUPERMAN is knocked down from his feet. Somewhere in the
	background LOIS witnesses it and screams.

					NO!

	She tries to charge past the SCU to help him but is restricted.

	Slowly, SUPERMAN gets to his feet.

	METALLO fires again. SUPERMAN is slowed down but doesn't fall.

	He fires again. SUPERMAN keeps moving toward him. METALLO fires
	in a frenzy OF gunfire. His face begins to lose its look of
	confidence and is quickly replaced with fear.

	A quiet mechanical voice can barely be heard coming from the
	LEXGUN.

				LEXGUN (VO)

	SUPERMAN doesn't flinch.

	METALLO hits him repeatedly with no effect. He swings again and
	SUPERMAN catches his fist and they lock. METALLO lifts his other
	hand to strike him as SUPERMAN's HEAT VISION creates a wide beam
	that METALLO's fist crosses and incinerates up to the elbow.

	SHOCKED, METALLO stares at what used to be his arm. SUPERMAN
	TEARS his other arm, still gripping the LEXGUN, off at the
	shoulder and strikes him across the face repeatedly.

	The more SUPERMAN hits him, the more METALLO's loses his
	artificial skin revealing the chrome metal cyborg beneath it.

			You remember this: You aren't the first MAYOR
			this city has ever had and God knows you
			aren't the first idealist. There will be
			another election in November and you might be
			sitting in your quaint little office in City
			Hall and you might not be. I, however, know
			exactly where I'll be sitting.

	LUTHOR goes behind his desk and comfortably eases into his chair.

					LUTHOR
			Now gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I have an
				empire to run.

	There is a very long silence.

				BERKOWICZ
				Superman...

				SUPERMAN
				Yes, your honor.

				BERKOWICZ
			Under the power granted to me by the city of
			Metropolis I am deputizing you.
					(Beat)
				Arrest this man.

	LUTHOR has an expression few people see.

	Shock.

						CUT TO BLACK:

	BLACK SCREEN

					VOICE
				Look up.

						FADE IN

IMAGE OF LUTHOR STANDING AGAINST A WALL.

	LUTHOR looks up. LUTHOR's tie is undone and he's fuming with
	anger. In front of him is a plate with: "LUTHOR, ALEXANDER L
	1591418017."

	A CAMERA FLASHES.

					VOICE
				Turn to the left.

	LUTHOR turns and the CAMERA FLASHES again.

INT. POLICE STATION

	LUTHOR is getting fingerprinted.

					COP
				(Trying not to laugh)
					Name?

	COPS in the background start snickering.

INT. HOLDING CELL

	LUTHOR is placed into the holding tank with the other riff raff.

						CUT TO:

EXT. POLICE STATION - EVENING

	LUTHOR is met by MERCY. They exit the station swarmed by
	reporters. LOIS LANE is among them.

						CUT TO:

INT. LEXCORP - LUTHOR'S OFFICE

	LUTHOR enters and gets himself a drink. As he walks past the
	window, SUPERMAN is floating outside waiting for him with his
	arms folded.

	LUTHOR takes a remote control from the desk and opens the window.

					LUTHOR
			I'd invite you in for a drink but you don't
			seem like the drinking type... even though a
			stiff drink would probably do you some good.

	SUPERMAN says nothing.

					LUTHOR
			You're a pretty smart fellow so you probably
			know your recent failings were no fault of
			your own. It's really simple: For enough
			money you can get anyone to sabotage a
			monorail or school bus and push it on some
				train tracks.

			Then you plant your man in a the site of the
			predetermined disaster he averts. He smiles
			for the cameras and looks fantastic. On the
			other hand, it doesn't exactly make you look
			like the spit and polish hero everybody loves
				so much.

			The whole reason I created Metallo was to
			falter the public's faith in its power
			source. Make them feel unsafe and then I
			would come along and sell them something
			safer. Something more advanced. Something
			more, how should I say, expensive and I make
			a few billion dollars in the process and
			replace you with my own "Man Of Steel." One
			that I hold the strings to and take you out
			of my misery at the same time.

				Absolutely brilliant.

			I don't know who you are or where you come
			from or why you're here but what I do know is
			I don't like to be shown up my city. Don't
			think you can come in here with your fancy
			pants, good looks and that truth, justice,
			blah blah blah and that from me. I can live
			with the heroics and I can even live knowing
			there may be one person in Metropolis I can't
			influence but you embarrassed me in front of
			my town and that will not be forgotten.

			When your number is up, I'll be the one
			holding the ticket. That I promise you.
					(Beat)
			Now, you tell me... am I telling the truth?

	Arms folded, SUPERMAN's expression is stern blankness.

				SUPERMAN
				I'm watching you, Luthor.

	SUPERMAN flies straight up. LUTHOR looks out the window and he's
	gone.

	When he's gone, LUTHOR reaches inside his jacket and beneath his
	shirt and retrieves a small pager size box. On the front is a
	pulsing light. He presses the intercom.

					LUTHOR
				Miss Teshmacher.

				secretary (VO)
				Yes, sir?

					LUTHOR
			Tell the boys in R and D it works. They'll
			see my appreciation for the efforts in next
				week's check.

				SECRETARY (VO)
				Right away, Mister Luthor.

						CUT TO:

EXT. LOIS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

	SUPERMAN flies by her apartment window. Inside, she's on the
	telephone with her sister LUCY. Her arm is in a sling.

	He notices an envelope pinned under the window with his name on
	it. He opens it and it reads:

			THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME... AGAIN.

	He smiles, folds the letter neatly and takes off. LOIS sees
	something in the corner of her eye and runs to the window. Like a
	schoolgirl with a crush, she smiles.

						CUT TO:

INT. UNKNOWN COMPUTER CENTER

	The redheaded WOMAN seen very briefly earlier is behind her
	computer data center. On the monitors are images of METALLO/JOHN
	CORBEN with reports and articles with CIA/INTERPOL markings.

	The REDHEAD's face is barely seen although we can tell she's
	wearing glasses and seated in a wheelchair. She types
	ACHEN@WGBSNET.COM and presses ENTER. Her mail has been sent.

						CUT TO:

EXT. KANSAS COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK

	CAMERA passes slowly overhead of the beautiful farmland with
	newscaster ANGELA CHEN's following voice-over.

				ANGELA (VO)
			This morning, sources at Interpol and the
			Central Intelligence Agency have confirmed
			internet speculation that Metallo's true
			identity is that of John Corben, a known
			mercenary and thief wanted worldwide for
			crimes neither agency would elaborate on. How
			the human Corben became the superhuman
			Metallo, is still a mystery. MAYOR Berkowicz
				has this to say:

				BERKOWICZ (VO)
			It has been a difficult few days for us all.
			The loss of life cannot be replaced. We have
			suffered many tragedies and avoided more but
			today we are safe. Wherever you are, thank
				you Superman.

				ANGELA (VO)
			This is Angela Chen. Goodnight.

EXT. SMALLVILLE KS, KENT FARM -SUNSET

	JONATHAN and MARTHA KENT are standing in a field overlooking
	their farm. In the distance is an incredibly vibrant sunset. In
	the background is their house.

	JONATHAN's arm is around MARTHA. CLARK walks up from behind them.
	Silent, he enjoys the view.

					CLARK
					(Beat)
			You never get tired of this do you?

	They aren't startled. They were expecting him.

				JONATHAN
					Never.

					MARTHA
				I'm glad your home, Clark.

					CLARK
			Of course, Ma. It's Sunday.

	CLARK puts his arm around them.

	CAMERA PANS OUT ENDING ON THEIR SILHOUETTES AND THE SUNSET AND
	THEN A SLOW FADE TO BLACK.

	CREDITS ROLL.



CREDITS END.

AFTER CREDIT SEQUENCE.

INT. LEXCORP RESEARCH LAB

	Several SCIENTISTS are working on various projects. LUTHOR enters
	and approaches the lead scientist, DR WENG.

					LUTHOR
			My time is valuable, Doctor Weng.

					WENG
			Then I will not abuse it. I thought you'd be
			interested in our progress.

					LUTHOR
			I'm always interested in progress.

	WENG leads LUTHOR to a glass tube filled with liquid. Inside is
	what's left of METALLO being kept alive.

					WENG
			Since the Metallo body was a prototype, we
			were able to salvage the main processors and
			reflex circuitry. The brain still functions
				well... surprisingly.

					LUTHOR
			Keep the equipment. That costs money. You can
			toss the brain. I'll find another one.
					(Beat)
				And the Police...?

					WENG
			Will have the useless replica we designed to
			replace this one and will be none the wiser.
					(Beat)
			It still puzzles me how you managed to
			retrieve this one from a secured Police
				facility.

					LUTHOR
			Gotham has some of the best thieves in the
			world if you can find them. Pay them enough
			money and they can get you anything.

					WENG
			We have also made great strides with the
				cloning.

					LUTHOR
				What have you got.

					WENG
			The last was orangutan. Fully mobile and
			intelligent. She lived for three days.
			Seventeen hours longer than the previous one.
				It was quite marvelous.

					LUTHOR
			You do fantastic work, Weng.

					WENG
			I am glad you're satisfied.

	LUTHOR shakes his hand and leaves. As he is leaving he turns:

					LUTHOR
					Weng...

					WENG
				Yes, Mister Luthor?

					LUTHOR
			On second thought, keep the brain. I'll find
				some use for it.

					WENG
				Of course, Mister Luthor.

	LUTHOR leaves.
