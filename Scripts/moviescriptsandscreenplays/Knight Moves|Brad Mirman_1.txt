     FADE IN:
     
     
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - 1972 - DAY
     
     TWO BOYS sit on opposite sides of a chessboard.  One is NINE,
     the other FOURTEEN.  The room is SILENT, the tension between
     the two young players severe.  All the ADULT PLAYERS that have
     been eliminated from this match by the two boys stand around
     watching.  On the wall is a BANNER that reads:  1972 WASHINGTON
     STATE TOURNAMENT.
     
     The FOURTEEN year old moves and hits his TIMER.  Frustration
     fills the NINE year old's face.  He moves.  The FOURTEEN year
     old moves and calls CHECK.  The NINE year old frantically
     searches the board for a solution.  He moves.  Again the
     FOURTEEN year old moves and calls CHECK.  The NINE year is
     stunned.  He picks up his KING to lay it on it's side and
     signal defeat.  Suddenly, he rakes the pieces off the board,
     grabs his fountain pen and lunges at the FOURTEEN year old,
     stabbing him repeatedly in the chest.  They fall to the floor.
     The ADULTS try to pull them apart.  The NINE year old struggles
     ferociously, SCREAMING and kicking like a mad man.
     
     
     INT.  HOSPITAL WARD - 1972 - DUSK
     
     In the b.g. we see the Nine year old Boy sleeping.  A DOCTOR
     and the boy's FATHER, a hard-looking MAN in his forties, walk
     through the door.  We MOVE with them down the hall.
     
                         DOCTOR
               The pressures and demands players with
               your son's abilities put on themselves
               to win are incredible.  The stress and
               tension are difficult enough for adults
               to handle, yet alone a nine year old.
               
                         FATHER
               I can't afford to keep him in here
               forever, you know.
               
                         DOCTOR
               I'd just like to keep him here over
               night, then start sessions with a child
               psychologist.
               
                         FATHER
               I knew this would happen.  This is his
               mother's doing.  She's not strict
               enough with him.  I work all day.  She
               lays in bed drunk and the boy does
               whatever he wants.
               
     
                                                             2
                         DOCTOR
               After he's released it's crucial that
               he's supervised.  The most important
               thing is that during his treatment he's
               not allowed anywhere near a chessboard.
               
               
     EXT.  HOUSE, BACKYARD - 1972 - DUSK
     
     A small, tract home.  The Boy sits on the ground, drawing in
     the dirt with a stick.  He does not notice as his Father walks
     up and stands behind him.
     
                         FATHER
               What are you doing?
               
     The Boy is startled.  He stands up quickly.  In the DIRT we see
     he has drawn a CHESSBOARD.
     
                         BOY
               Nothing.
               
     The Father SLAPS him across the face.
     
                         FATHER
               Don't lie to me!  What did the doctor's
               tell you about playing chess!  Get in
               the house!
               
     The Father drags his foot across the dirt, erasing the board.
               
               
     INT.  BEDROOM - 1972 - NIGHT
     
     The Boy is sitting on his bed.  In the b.g. we HEAR the VOICES
     of his PARENTS.
     
                         FATHER (OS)
               I've had it!  I've got a drunk for a
               wife and a lunatic for a son.  I don't
               need this shit anymore!
               
     We HEAR FOOTSTEPS.
     
                         FATHER (OS)
               You're crazy!  Both of you.
               
     We HEAR a DOOR SLAM.  The Boy shows no sign of emotion.
     
               
     
                                                             3
     INT.  HALLWAY BLACK SCREEN - NIGHT
     
     All is quiet except for a faint DRIPPING SOUND.  A door is
     slowly opened.  Light streaks out into a hallway.  We see the
     NINE year old.  He is barefoot and wearing pajamas.  He looks
     up.  Drops of BLOOD drip from a crack in the ceiling above.
     The Boy moves towards a staircase at the end of the hall.
     
     
     INT.  BEDROOM - 1972 - NIGHT
     
     The Boy enters, takes a few steps into the room and stops. He
     stares ahead blankly.
     
     HIS POV: WOMAN'S ARM - CLOSE SHOT
     
     The arm hangs off the bed, blood flows out of a deep gash in
     her wrist and pools on the floor.  The CAMERA moves up the arm.
     A WOMAN in her forties lays in bed.  The blood flows from her
     other wrist, soaking into the mattress.  Her eyes are closed,
     head titled away from him.
     
     The Boy shows no sign of emotion.  He walks over to the
     nightstand and starts to open her purse.  There is a MOAN from
     the WOMAN as she opens her eyes and turns her head toward the
     boy.  They lock eyes for a moment, then slowly, her eyes close.
     The boy removes a key from the purse and walks to a dresser.
     He unlocks a drawer and removes a box, then leaves the room.
     
     
     INT.  KITCHEN - 1972 - NIGHT
     
     The Boy walks over to the table with a glass of MILK and
     COOKIES.  He sits down, his feet dangling from the chair and
     opens the box.  Inside is a CHESSBOARD and PIECES.  He removes
     them, sets up the board and starts to play.
     
     CLOSE ON CHESSBOARD:  The CAMERA moves from one side of the
     board to the other, weaving through the chess pieces, then
     PULLS BACK over the heads of the AUDIENCE.
     
     
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT
     
     >From the rear of the room, over the HEADS of the AUDIENCE, we
     see THREE TABLES on stage.  A large board of the game is
     presented on the wall behind each table.
     
     CLOSE SHOT - PLAYER'S EYES:  We cut back and forth.  Deep,
     probing eyes, intensely focused and determined.
     
     CLOSE ON THE CLOCK: It ticks methodically, and is the only
     sound we hear.
     
                                                             4
     
     THE AUDIENCE:  watches with anticipation, their eyes locked on
     the viewing board.
     
     PETER SANDERSON sits on one side of the board.  He is a
     handsome man, in his early thirties.  Well-dressed in an
     expensive suit, there is an air of confidence about him.  Peter
     makes a move, then hits the timer.  Peter's opponent,
     GRANDMASTER LUTZ, a quirky-looking little man in his fifties
     makes a tentative move.
     
     JEREMY EDMONDS, Peter's trainer, a distinguished-looking man in
     his fifties, watches from his WHEELCHAIR.  He grins and nods
     his head, knowing that Peter has got the game.
     
     Lutz studies the board, makes a move, then hits his timer.
     Peter moves, then hits his timer.  He is in control.
     Frustration shows on Lutz's face.  He surveys the board, then
     slowly reaches over and lifts up his KING and lays it on it's
     side signaling defeat.  Peter stands, shakes his hand, waves to
     the crowd, then leaves the stage.
     
     
     INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
     
     A NEWSCASTER is positioned by the stage door.
     
                         NEWSCASTER
               Today concludes the second week of
               competition in this round-robin
               candidates tournament.  Each of the
               players will play four games against
               the other and the winner will earn the
               right to play for the world title next
               year.
               
     Peter walks through the doorway and down the hall, accepting
     congratulations.  Jeremy wheels himself along side of him.
     
                         NEWSCASTER
               But the big story is the amazing
               comeback of Peter Sanderson who is
               currently leading the tournament.
               America's best hope since Bobby
               Fischer, Sanderson stunned the chess
               world three years ago when he walked
               out in the middle of last candidates
               tournament while leading by three games
               and forfeited the match to Viktor
               Yurilivich who is only two games behind
               Sanderson in this match.
     
     
                                                             5
     Peter stops to sign a few autographs.  A young attractive WOMAN
     in her twenties walks over to Peter.  She is wearing a CHESS
     FEDERATION BLAZER and a NAME TAG identifying her as DEBI
     RUTLEGE.
     
                         DEBI
               Mister Sanderson, here is your schedule
               for tomorrow.
               
     Peter takes it.  They lock eyes.  She smiles at him.  A
     REPORTER sticks a MICROPHONE in Peter's face.
     
                         REPORTER
               Peter, could we have a moment please?
     
     The moment is broken, as ERICA SANDERSON, Peter's daughter, a
     bright-faced ten year rushes up to him and hugs him.
     
                         ERICA
               Congratulations, dad.
               
                         PETER
                    (to the press)
               My cheering section.
               
     
     INT.  PETER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Peter sits across a CHESSBOARD from Jeremy, who has just
     finished making an opening move.
     
                         PETER
               You opened with the English.  Lutz
               won't use it.  He opened his first game
               with it.
               
                         JEREMY
               He knows you're aware of that.
               
                         PETER
               Then I'll transpose.
               
                         JEREMY
               On a variation, yes -- but it must be a
               variation that is unique.
               
                         PETER
               I suppose you have something in mind?
               
     Peter gets up and begins to pace.
     
     
                                                             6
                         JEREMY
                    (quickly moving the
                     pieces)
               At this point you'll move Bishop to e4.
               He'll capture your Knight e6.  Rook to
               b5, begins his counterplay.  D6 takes
               your Rook, your advantage is lost --
               but watch -- Queen f5 check.  He takes
               your Knight -- Now, Rook to d3 -- he's
               finished.
               
     There is a KNOCK on the door and a MESSAGE is slipped under.
     Peter picks it up.
     
                         PETER
               It's a good play, but risky.
               
                         JEREMY
               You don't win by playing it safe,
               Peter.
               
     Peter opens the MESSAGE and reads it.  Erica appears in the
     doorway to her room.
               
                         PETER
               What are you doing up?
               
                         ERICA
               I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
               
                         PETER
               I see.  You forgot to bring you're
               night-light, didn't you?
               
                         ERICA
               That has nothing to do with it.
               
                         PETER
               You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
               
                         ERICA
               Okay.
               
                         JEREMY
               I'll tuck you in.
               
     Erica kisses Peter, then runs into his room.  Jeremy wheels
     after her.
               
                         PETER
               Jeremy, have someone pick up a night-
               light tomorrow.
               
     Jeremy nods and leaves the room.  Peter picks up the phone and
     dials.
     
                                                             7
     
                         PETER
                    (into phone)
               Debi..?
               
               
     INT.  DEBI'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     Peter and Debi move passionately on the bed, their bodies
     moving rhythmically.  Peter pulls her up to a sitting position,
     guiding her up and down as he runs his lips sensually over her
     breasts.  She arches her back, MOANING softly as she gives way
     to her pleasure.
     
     
     EXT.  DEBI'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
     
     Peter kisses Debi goodbye.  He walks off and she closes the
     door.
               
               
     INT.  DEBI'S BATHROOM - LATER - NIGHT
     
     Debi is soaking in the bath.  The DOORBELL RINGS.
     
     
     INT.  DEBI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Debi slips on a ROBE as she walks to the door.
     
                         DEBI
               Yes?
               
                         MAN'S VOICE
                    (static; barely
                     audible)
               It's me.  I forgot something.
               
     She smiles and pushes the button, then opens the door, leaving
     it ajar, and walks out of the room.
     
     
     INT.  DEBI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
     
     Debi quickly fixes her face, grins and leaves.
     
     
     INT.  DEBI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     It is dark.  She enters and tries the light switch.  It doesn't
     work.
     
                         DEBI
               Very funny.
               
     
                                                             8
     CLOSE ON DEBI:  She senses something is very wrong.  She turns
     around slowly, her eyes squinting to see through the darkness.
     Suddenly, terror fills her face as a FLASH of BRIGHT LIGHT
     fills the screen.
     
     
     EXT.  FERRY LANDING - MORNING
     
     Quaint and charming.  Boats bob lazily in the water.  TOURISTS
     walk along the waterfront shops.  ANDY WAGNER, a tough-looking
     cop in his twenties, smokes a cigarette as he waits on the
     dock.  CHIEF OF POLICE, FRANK SEDMAN, walks towards him.  He's
     a large, slightly over-weight man in his forties.  He takes one
     last drag of a cigar, then crushes it out on the dock.
     
                         ANDY
               Sorry to ruin your trip to the city,
               but we got a real nut on our hands,
               Frank.
               
                         FRANK
                    (all business)
               Run it down.
               
     Frank starts to walk.  Andy follows.
               
                         ANDY
                    (looking at note-pad)
               Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian.
               Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four
               Oaks Hotel.
               
                         FRANK
               Local?
                         
                         ANDY
               No.  She just moved here last month
               from Portland.
     
     
     EXT.  DEBI'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
     
     Several BLACK and WHITE units are in front of the building.
     Uniformed OFFICERS keep back a CROWD of onlookers.  A CAR
     drives up and stops in front of the building.  Frank and Andy
     get out.                 
     
     
     INT.  DEBI'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
     
     The room is filled with FORENSIC TEAM MEMBERS along with
     UNIFORM OFFICERS.  Frank enters with Andy.  UNIFORMED OFFICERS
     are standing around talking.
     
     
                                                             9
                         FRANK
               This isn't a party.  Everybody that
               doesn't need to be here get out!
     
     
     INT.  DEBI'S BEDROOM - MORNING
     
     Frank enters the room with Andy.  He stops and stares at the
     sight before him.
     
     Debi Rutlege is laying on her bed.  Her face is a deathly white
     and has been painted awkwardly with rouge and lipstick giving
     her a macabre appearance.  She is draped in the sheet which is
     tucked tightly around her body, her hands folded carefully
     across her chest.
     
     Above the bed written in blood is REMEMBER.
     
                         FRANK
               I moved out here from the city so I
               could get away from this kind of shit.
               
     STEVE NOLAN, from the forensic team, who has been kneeling on
     the other side of the bed stands up.
               
                         FRANK
               Whaddaya got, Nolan?
               
                         NOLAN
                    (continuing; holding
                     up a plastic bag)
               Not much.  There's no sign of a break
               in.  I think she let him in.
               
                         FRANK
               How long has she been dead?
               
                         NOLAN
               Six, eight hours tops.
               
                         FRANK
               Any sign of rape?
               
                         NOLAN
               Not that I can see.  We'll know more
               once I get the lab reports back from
               Seattle.
                    
                         ANDY
               What she die of?
               
     Nolan turns over her arms.  There are deep gashes in each
     wrist.
     
     
                                                             10
                         ANDY
               You think whoever did this wanted it to
               look like it was a suicide?
               
                         NOLAN
               No.  He would have taken more care not
               to the leave rope burns on her wrists.
               The way I got it figured is he tied her
               up, slit her wrists, then sat back and
               watched her bleed to death.  But that's
               not the main thing.  What's wrong with
               this picture?
               
     A beat.  Suddenly, Frank sees it.
               
                         FRANK
               There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin'
               blood?
               
                         NOLAN
               Bingo.
               
               
     EXT.  DEBI'S APARTMENT, COURTYARD - MORNING
               
     Frank and Andy walks across the yard.
               
                         FRANK
               Who found her?
               
     Andy points to MISS GREENWELL, a middle-aged woman talking to a
     UNIFORMED OFFICER in the b.g.
               
                         ANDY
               The landlady.  Alice Greenwell.  She
               came for the rent check.  The door was
               ajar.
               
     Frank walks over to Miss Greenwell.
     
                         FRANK
               Miss Greenwell, I'm Captain Sedman.
               Did Miss Rutlege have a boyfriend?
               
                         MISS GREENWELL
               I guess so.
               
                         FRANK
               What do you mean, you guess so?
               
                         MISS GREENWELL
               I know she had company last night.
                    (confidentially)
               A man.
               
     
                                                             11
                         FRANK
               How do you know that?
               
                         WOMAN
               Well, her bedroom is on the other side
               of mine.  The walls are very thin.  I
               could hear them.
               
                         ANDY
               What were they doing?  Humping?
               
                         MISS GREENWELL
               They were having sex, yes--
               
     Andy grins.
     
                         MISS GREENWELL
               -- not that I was intentionally
               listening -- but  with the walls being
               so thin--
               
                         FRANK
               I understand.  Thank you.
               
               
     INT.  POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON
     
     Frank and Andy stand before several UNIFORMED OFFICERS.
     
                         FRANK
               First of all, I'd like to say that a
               lot of us haven't got to know each
               other since I replaced Captain Waters
               last month.  A lot of you think that
               I'm an outsider who came over and took
               away a job that should have gone to a
               local... but that's the way it worked
               out.  So, all I can say is tough shit.
               You want to bitch about it, that's fine
               -- but you will tow the line in my
               department.  That means the next time
               an Officer is responding to a homicide
               call he seals off the crime scene and
               nobody -- nobody but  but Detective
               Wagner and I go in.
                    (Beat)
               Also, if anyone talks about the message
               on the wall or the blood I'll
               personally cut their balls off with a
               butter knife.
                    (to Andy)
               Get 'em going - then meet me at the
               car.  We're going over to the hotel.
               
     Frank heads to the door.
     
                                                             12
     
                         ANDY
               Campbell, you check with the FBI see if
               they got anything like this on file...
               
               
     INT.  POLICE STATION, HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
     
     Frank steps into the hall and bumps into Nolan.  They walk
     together.
     
                         FRANK
               Anything?
     
                         NOLAN
               Not much.  I don't think she was raped.
               There's no bruising, or any signs of
               trauma to the pelvic region -- and no
               trace of sperm which makes sense
               because she took a bath.
               
                         FRANK
               What about prints?
               
                         NOLAN
               No prints.
               
                         FRANK
               You mean, no prints but hers?
               
                         NOLAN
               No Frank.  No prints.
               
     
     INT.  PETER'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
     
     Peter is sitting at a chessboard with Jeremy.  Peter studies
     the board.  There is a KNOCK on the door.  Peter gets up and
     opens the door.  Frank and Andy are outside.
     
                         FRANK
               Mister Sanderson?  I'm Frank Sedman,
               Bainbridge P.D. and this is Detective
               Wagner.  We'd like to ask you a few
               questions about Debi Rutlege.
               
     Peter opens the door and they enter.
               
                         FRANK
               I know you're busy so I'll get right to
               it.  Did you know her?
               
                         PETER
               Only in passing.  To say hello to.
               
     
                                                             13
                         ANDY
               I've talked to a few people who say you
               and her were... friendly?
               
                         PETER
               Chess tournaments can be boring
               sometimes.  People have a lot of free
               time.  They like to gossip.
               
                         FRANK
               Could you tell me where you were last
               night?
               
                         PETER
               Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
               
                         FRANK
               I know.  You won two games against him
               and left the auditorium at eight forty
               five.  Where did you go after that?
               
                         PETER
               To my room and then I went for a walk.
               
                         ANDY
               By yourself?
               
                         PETER
               Yes.
               
     Frank takes out a piece of paper from his jacket pocket.
     
                         FRANK
               This is a printout from the hotel
               computer for all the messages logged to
               your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It
               says:  From Debi.  Please call me at
               home.
               
                         PETER
               She called to give me my schedule for
               tomorrow.
               
                         FRANK
               What's interesting about it is you say
               you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she
               says on her message for you to call her
               at home and she doesn't leave a number.
               That would imply you already knew the
               number.
               
                         PETER
               I got it from the tournament directory.
               
     Frank takes out a small book.
     
                                                             14
     
                         FRANK
               There's no Debi Rutlege listed in the
               directory.
               
     Peter's irritation starts to show.  He opens a dresser drawer
     and removes a small book.
     
                         PETER
               You're looking in the general
               directory.  The player's directory
               lists everyone connected to the
               tournament.
               
     A beat.  Frank and Peter have reached a stalemate.
                         
                         ANDY
               We seem to have a little problem here?
               
                         PETER
               What kind of problem?
               
                         ANDY
               I think you're lying.  That's what kind
               of problem.
               
                         PETER
               What are you saying?
               
                         FRANK
               We're not saying anything right now.
               We're just trying to put a few pieces
               together.
               
     Frank and Andy leave.  Peter turns and stares at Jeremy.
               
     
     EXT.  HOTEL GROUNDS - AFTERNOON
     
     Frank and Andy walk along the grounds, heading back towards the
     main hotel.
     
                         ANDY
               What do you think?
               
                         FRANK
               He's got an answer for everything, but
               he doesn't have an alibi.
               
                         ANDY
               You think he's dirty?
               
                         FRANK
               I don't know, but I think you're right.
               He's lying.
     
                                                             15
               
               
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON
     
     On the stage is three tables each flanked by two chairs.
     Several CHESS OFFICIALS along with the PRESIDENT of the CHESS
     FEDERATION attend to the GRANDMASTERS at their respective
     boards.  Peter sits in a chair and swivels back and forth.
     
                         PETER
               I want another chair.  This one killed
               me yesterday.
                    (points to big board)
               Also, the pieces on the board move too
               slowly.  I can see them out of the
               corner of my eye.  Can they be sped up?
     
                         PRESIDENT
               David?
               
     DAVID WILLERMAN, a computer technician sits at a computer off
     to the side of the stage.
     
                         DAVID
               No problem.  It's just a matter of
               adjusting the response time.
               
     He taps in a few commands on the keyboard.  We see a piece
     quickly move across the board.
     
                         DAVID
               That should do it.
               
     Grandmaster Lutz walks over and stands by the board.
     
                         GRANDMASTER LUTZ
               You're acting like a superstitious
               schoolboy, Peter.  What's next?
               Incense and rosary beads?
               
                         PRESIDENT
                    (points to a chair)
               Grandmaster Lutz, you'll be sitting
               here for your next match.
               
                         GRANDMASTER LUTZ
               Oh no -- no, I can't sit there.  I must
               be facing North.  My power comes from
               the North.
               
     Peter smiles and starts to walk off stage.  VIKTOR YURILIVICH,
     a tall, slender man in his forties, walks on stage.  The two
     men stand face to face, their eyes locked on each other.
     
     
                                                             16
                         YURILIVICH
               Hello, Peter.  You played an
               interesting game last night.  Even
               though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is
               the game I played against Valsney in
               '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
               
                         PETER
               I'm sure you are.
               
                         YURILIVICH
               No, I want you to do good.  That way
               when I beat you at the end I'll look
               that much better.
               
                         PETER
               You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich.
               You're nervous?
     
                         YURILIVICH
               I'm not nervous.
                    
                         PETER
               Well, you should be, because this time
               I'm going to win.
               
                         YURILIVICH
               Well, then this time you'll have to
               stay for the whole match, won't you?
     
     
     EXT.  HOTEL TERRACE - AFTERNOON
     
     Peter sits at a table across from Erica.  They play a game of
     checkers as they eat their ice cream.  Peter is grinning.
     
                         PETER
               Who told you that?
     
                         ERICA
               Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr.
               Lutz goes to a medium to try and
               contact great Grandmasters in the
               spirit world.
               
                         PETER
               Has he gotten through to any?
               
                         ERICA
               No, but he did contact a dead
               parcheesi champion from Ohio.
               
     They both LAUGH.  A WAITER comes over with a CORDLESS PHONE.
     
     
                                                             17
                         WAITER
               There's a call for you Mister
               Sanderson.
               
                         PETER
                    (into phone)
               Hello?
     
     The "CALLERS" VOICE we HEAR is FILTERED through some type of
     electronic devise that alters the voice.  It is low, resonant,
     with a macabre quality to it.
                         
                         CALLER (OS)
               Hello, Peter.
               
                         PETER
               Who is this?
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               Someone who's going to become an
               important part of your life.
                    (Beat)
               I want to play a game with you.
               
                         PETER
               I haven't got time for this.
               
     Peter starts to hang up, when...
     
                         CALLER (OS)
               You had time for Debi.
               
     Peter freezes.
     
                         CALLER (OS)
               Don't worry, I wiped off all your
               prints.
               
     Peter slowly lowers the phone back on the cradle.  He is
     visibly shaken.
     
                         ERICA
               What is it, dad?
               
                         PETER
               Nothing.
               
     
     INT.  LOBBY - AFTERNOON
     
     As Peter walks across the room the DESK CLERK calls out to him.
     
                         DESK CLERK
               Mister Sanderson, there's message for
               you.
     
                                                             18
               
     Peter walks over to the desk.  The Clerk hands him an envelope.
     Peters walks away and starts to open it.
     
     CLOSE SHOT:  The back of a POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH.  Letters have
     been clipped out of a magazine and spell out a message:  THE
     GAME HAS BEGUN.  WILL CALL AGAIN TOMORROW AT ELEVEN.  The
     photograph is turned over.  It is a shot of DEBI RUTLEGE
     exactly as the police found her.  The word REMEMBER written on
     the wall.  Peter slides the picture back into the envelope,
     thinks for a moment, then looks at the DESK CLERK.
     
                         PETER
               Get me the police.
     
     
     INT.  PETER'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
     
     Peter is with Frank and Andy.
     
                         FRANK
               Why didn't you tell us you were there
               earlier?
               
                         PETER
               I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be
               hours of questions.  I can't afford to
               miss a game.
               
                         ANDY
               We wouldn't want someone's death to
               interfere with your games.
               
                         FRANK
               What was your relationship with her?
               
                         PETER
               Casual.
               
                         ANDY
               Casual?  You were boning her weren't
               you?
               
                         PETER
               It wasn't serious.  What's your
               problem?
               
                         ANDY
               You are!  I don't like you.
               
                         PETER
               Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
               
     
                                                             19
                         ANDY
               Don't worry I won't.  I've seen how
               your dates end up.
               
     Peter takes a step towards Andy.  They both square off.
               
                         FRANK
               Take it easy.  Both of you.
               
                         ANDY
               I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
               
                         PETER
               What's that supposed to mean?
               
                         ANDY
               It means, if I were a killer and I
               thought the police were closing in on
               me I might invent someone to try and
               put them off the scent.
               
                         PETER
               That's crazy!  Why would I draw
               attention to myself like that?
               
                         ANDY
               You like to play games, don't you,
               Peter?
               
                         PETER
               He says on the photo he'll call
               tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back
               then and listen for yourself.
               
                         ANDY
               Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
               
               
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON
     
     Peter sits across from GRANDMASTER LUTZ.  He looks over a few
     tables and stares at Yurilivich.  Meanwhile, Lutz takes out a
     compass.  He checks his reading then starts shifting the board
     slightly.  Peter looks at him.
     
                         LUTZ
               Do you mind?
               
     Peter shrugs his shoulders indicating he doesn't.  The
     President walks over to Peter's table and starts his timer.
     Peter makes a move.
     
     
     
                                                             20
     INT.  BAINBRIDGE INSTITUTE - DUSK
     
     Frank and Andy sit at a table with DOCTOR ALAN FULTON.  A tall,
     thin man in his fifties.  Doctor Fulton studies the
     photographs, then looks up at Frank.
     
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               You must understand that this is not my
               field?
               
                         ANDY
               It ain't mine either but I can tell
               this guy's crazy.  That's your business
               ain't it, doc?  You deal with crazy
               people.
               
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               I deal with people with problems... and
               there are all different types of
               problems.
               
                         FRANK
               Doctor Fulton, we don't have a budget
               out here like Seattle.  We can't afford
               to hire outside Psychological help.
               I'll take whatever you can give me.
     
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               Well, he appears to be acting out some
               kind of fantasy.  We're talking about a
               deeply disturbed person.
               
                         ANDY
               No shit!
               
                         FRANK
               Could someone this disturbed give the
               appearance of being normal?
               
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               Absolutely.
               
                         FRANK
               We've got a suspect but no hard
               evidence.  If you met him do you think
               you could tell?
               
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               Tell what?
               
                         ANDY
               If he's crazy?
               
     
                                                             21
                         FRANK
                    (askance at Andy)
               If he's... disturbed.
               
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               It's possible, but not likely.  There's
               only one opinion I can offer with any
               certainty.
                    (Beat)
               He's going to kill again.
               
               
     INT.  HOTEL GYM - NIGHT
     
     Peter is on the bench press straining to finish his set.
     Although he is clearly tired, it's a battle of will over
     muscle.  Although his face is red, veins bugling, he does his
     three last presses, then replaces the bar.  He sits up and
     buries his face in his towel.  When he looks up he sees...
     
     KATHY SHEPPARD, a beautiful woman in her twenties is standing
     against the wall, her eyes on him.  Peter smiles at her.  She
     smiles back, then walks out of the room.  Peter lays back down
     and starts another set.
     
               
     INT.  STEAM ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Peter enters, a towel wrapped around his waist.  He takes a few
     steps into the room, then stops when he sees Kathy through the
     steam.
     
                         PETER
               Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
               
                         KATHY
               It's alright.
               
     Peter sits down a few feet from her.  Steam swirls through the
     room.  Kathy's eyes drift over to him.
     
     HER POV:  Beads of sweat roll down his chest and stomach.
     
     Peter looks over at her, their eyes meet.  She looks away.
     Peter closes his eyes and takes a few deep, meditative breaths.
     Kathy looks over at him again.  As if sensing he is being
     watched Peter opens his eyes.  A beat.  Their eyes linger on
     each others.
     
                         KATHY
               Is this your first time here?
               
                         PETER
               Yes.
               
     
                                                             22
                         KATHY
               I love this hotel.  I stay here every
               time I visit my parents.
     
                         PETER
               How come you don't stay with them?
               
                         KATHY
               Because I love them, but they drive me
               crazy.  You know how parents are?
               
                         PETER
               No.  I don't.
     
     A beat.
     
                         KATHY
               Are you with the tournament?
               
                         PETER
               Uh huh.
     
                         KATHY
               Are you one of the players?
               
                         PETER
               Yes.
               
                         KATHY
               I've always wanted to learn how to play
               chess.  I don't have the patience for
               it.  When did you start playing?
               
                         PETER
               When I was very young.
               
                         KATHY
               It seems like such a complicated game.
               
                         PETER
               Not really.  You see your goal and you
               go after it.  Anything that gets in the
               way is an obstacle and must be
               destroyed.
               
                         KATHY
               Sounds very violent.
               
                         PETER
               Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is
               violent.  The strong win.  The weak
               perish.
     
                                                             23
     
                         KATHY
               --but you enjoy being the stronger one?
               You like the control.
               
                         PETER
               If you're asking me if I'm passionate
               about what I do, the answer is yes.
               Without passion, nothing moves us.
               What's your passion?
     
                         KATHY
               That's a very personal question.
               
                         PETER
               I see.  This is going to be a very
               polite conversation.  What shall we
               discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
               
                         KATHY
               Are you disappointed that I won't
               answer you?
               
                         PETER
               I had just hoped there would be more
               substance to the conversation.
               
                         KATHY
               I thought opening too quickly was a
               fatal mistake in chess.
               
                         PETER
                    (grinning)
               It is.
               
                         KATHY
               Do you always open quickly?
               
                         PETER
               Are we talking about me, or chess?
               
                         KATHY
               You.
               
                         PETER
               Each circumstance requires a different
               tactic.
               
                         KATHY
               Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow
               when you play Krikorian.
     
     Peter stares at Kathy for a moment.  She's made a mistake and
     she knows it.  She stands up.
     
     
                                                             24
                         KATHY
               Well, I think I've had enough.
               
                         PETER
               Getting too hot in here for you?
               
     She feigns a smile and starts towards the door.  Suddenly, his
     hand shoots out, grabbing her arm.  She freezes.  Peter stands
     up, his body trapping her between him and door, his lips almost
     touching her ear.
     
                         PETER
               What are you looking for?
               
                         KATHY
               Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
               
                         PETER
               No you didn't.
               
     He spins her around.  They are face to face.
     
                         PETER
               What are you?  A reporter?  Just how
               far were you going to go?
               
     A beat.  Peter lets her go and backs off.  She opens the door
     and leaves.  Peter smiles.
               
               
     EXT.  HOTEL - NIGHT
     
     Kathy walks across the grounds.  Frank catches up with her and
     walks along side.
     
                         FRANK
               Well?
               
                         KATHY
               Well what?  I told you this was a
               stupid idea.  You can't learn anything
               from someone in a few minutes.
               
                         FRANK
               You didn't pick up any vibes from the
               guy?
               
                         KATHY
               I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a
               psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
               
                         FRANK
               What did Dr. Fulton tell you?
               
     
                                                             25
                         KATHY
               Only that you wanted someone from the
               institute to talk to Sanderson for some
               case you're working on.  What'd he do?
               
                         FRANK
               We're not sure.
               
                         KATHY
               What do you think he did?
               
                         FRANK
               We think he could be a suspect in a
               murder investigation.
               
     Kathy stops dead in her tracks and stares at him.
     
                         KATHY
               The girl that was killed last night?
               
     Frank's silence tells her she's right.  She stares at him for a
     moment, then walks off.
     
     
     EXT.  DOCTOR FULTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
     
     Kathy is BANGING loudly on the front door.  A moment later it
     is answered by Dr. Fulton.  In the b.g a DINNER PARTY is going
     on.
     
     
     INT.  DOCTOR FULTON'S STUDY - NIGHT
     
     Dr. Fulton sits on the couch.  Kathy paces the room.
     
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               You might not have done it had you
               known.
               
                         KATHY
               You're damn right!  I'm a child
               psychologist and you send me into a
               room with someone who could be a
               murderer!
               
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               Would you mind keeping your voice down?
               I have guests.
               
                         KATHY
               Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb
               your guests, would we?
               
     
                                                             26
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               The police came to me for help.  What
               could I do?
               
                         KATHY
               You could have been honest with me for
               starters.  We work together.  I have to
               be able to trust you.
               
                         DOCTOR FULTON
                    (checks his watch)
               I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson
               wasn't going to talk to me... but
               you're young, attractive--
               
                         KATHY
               --the same type as the girl who got
               killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be
               a psychopath.
               
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               They asked who would be best suited for
               this and you--
               
                         KATHY
               Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a
               potentially dangerous situation and
               didn't warn me!
               
     She walks to the door and opens it.
               
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               It worked out alright, didn't it?
               
                         KATHY
                    (loudly)
               Fuck off!
               
     All the GUESTS are sitting at the dinner table, eating soup.
     They stare at Kathy.  Fulton.
     
                         KATHY
                    (to the guests)
               That's what I would have said to the
               chef if I caught him shaving over the
               soup.
               
     She walks out.  Slowly, several of the GUESTS lower the soup
     spoons and push their bowls away.
     
               
     
                                                             27
     INT.  OFFICE, LOBBY - NIGHT
     
     The LOBBY appears empty.  One of the office doors opens and
     CHRISTIE EASTMAN, A young, attractive woman, comes out carrying
     a stack of files.  She walks out of the lobby, LOCKING the door
     behind her.
     
     
     INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
     
     As the car descends, Christie looks through one of the files.
     She turns a page and the file falls to the floor.  She bends
     down to pick it up.  As she does the elevator stops and the
     doors open.
     
     A pair of black boots stand before her.  She looks up to see a
     MAN in his fifties.  He smiles and gets in.  The doors close
     and the car starts down again.  Christie stares at the floor
     indicator, somewhat unnerved by the man's presence.  The car
     stops at the lobby and the man gets out.
     
     
     EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT
     
     Christie walks across the deserted parking lot towards her car.
     She HEARS a SOUND and stops and looks around.
     
     CHRISTIE'S POV:  As her eyes scan the desolate parking lot, she
     sees nothing unusual.
     
     Christie starts to walk again.  She arrives at her car, gets
     inside, then rolls down the window.
     
               
     INT.  CAR - NIGHT
     
     Christie starts the car, then takes out a cigarette from her
     pocket and lights it.  She takes a deep drag, then looks
     into...
     
     CLOSE ON REAR VIEW MIRROR:  From the back seat we see TWO DARK
     EYES staring at her from behind a PORCELAIN MASK.
     
     She turns around.  Her face filled with fear.  FLASH!  The
     screen is filled with BRIGHT LIGHT.
     
     
     EXT.  BAINBRIDGE INSTITUTE - MORNING
     
     A car drives up the gravel path and stops in front of the
     entrance.  Frank gets out and walks towards the door.
     
     
     
                                                             28
     INT.  OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING
     
     Kathy is watching a young GIRL through a two-way mirror in the
     next room as she plays and interacts with dolls and toys.  She
     makes a few notes, then the door opens and Frank walks in.
     
     
                         KATHY
               I'm busy right now.
               
                         FRANK
               It's important.
               
     Kathy goes through a door into the observation room.  Through
     the mirror we see her kneel down next to the girl and smile.
     She says something to her as she points to a door leading out
     of the room.  The girl gives her a big hug.  A moment later we
     see Frank join her in the room.  He says something and they
     start to argue.  Kathy points towards the door.
     
     
     CLOSE ON COMPUTER MONITOR:  A chess program.  A piece is moved.
     The screen reads:  CHECKMATE!  YOU WIN.  PULL BACK.
     
     
     INT.  PETER'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
     
     Peter is at the computer.  Jeremy sits beside him.  Frank walks
     over to Andy who is with a TECHNICIAN setting up tracing
     equipment.
     
                         TECHNICIAN
               We're all set.
               
                         ANDY
               I still think this is a crock of shit.
               
     There's a KNOCK at the door.  Andy opens it.  Kathy enters.
     
                         FRANK
               I'm glad you could make it.
               
     Peter looks at Frank, then Kathy with confusion.
     
                         FRANK
               Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor
               Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping
               us out.
               
                         PETER
               We've already met.  Haven't we...
               Doctor.
               
     
                                                             29
                         KATHY
                    (she smirks)
               I see you're still having problems with
               your openings.
     
                         FRANK
               And this Jeremy--
               
                         KATHY
               --Edmonds.  I know.  You lost to Karpov
               in '82, didn't you?
               
                         JEREMY
               Yes.  However, that's not exactly how I
               prefer to be remembered.
                    (Beat)
               Well, I'm going to get out of your way.
               Peter, I'll see you this afternoon.
               
               
     CLOSE ON ASHTRAY:  A cigarette is snuffed out.  PULL BACK.
     Andy finishes putting out his cigarette, then glances up at
     Peter who is pacing back and forth.  Andy checks his watch.
     
                         ANDY
               Eleven oh six.
               
     He looks at Peter with a grin.  A beat as the two men stare at
     each other.  The moment is broken as the PHONE RINGS LOUDLY.
     Peter's head snaps towards the phone.
     
                         FRANK
               Remember, try to keep him on as long as
               you can.  Don't confront him.  Let him
               answer the questions I gave you.
               
     The Technician starts his tape machine and tracing equipment.
     Peter picks up his CORDLESS PHONE.
     
                         PETER
               Hello?
               
     We HEAR the CALLER'S distorted VOICE.
     
                         CALLER (OS)
               Hello, Peter.
     
                         PETER
                    (stalling)
               Just a second.
                    (a beat, then)
               Hello?

               Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised
               you would use such an obvious tactic.
                    (there is anger in his
                     voice)
               I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as
               one!  I'll call you everyday... You get
               one minute, whether you put me on hold
               or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to
               play?
               
                         PETER
               Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
     
                         CALLER (OS)
               To get your attention.
               
                         PETER
               Did you know her?
               
                         CALLER(OS)
               No, only the path she chose to travel.
               
     Peter is trying to keep the conversation moving.
     
                         PETER
               And -- what path is that?
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               We all have paths to follow.  You hope
               yours will lead you to me.
               
                         PETER
               Why did you write remember on the wall?
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               That's something you'll have to figure
               out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you
               can't expect me to answer such direct
               questions.
               
                         PETER
               Why not?
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               You don't want to think and that's why
               I'll win!  I'm already two points
               ahead.
               
                         PETER
               What?
               
     
                                                             31
                         CALLER (OS)
               I did another one last night.  You
               might have saved her, but you didn't
               want to play.
               
                         PETER
               Where is she?
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               You'll find her.
               
                         PETER
               If you got something to say to me, just
               come out and say it!
               
     Andy picks up the extension phone.
     
                         ANDY
               Where is she you sonofabitch!
               
     There's a chuckle from the Caller.
     
                         CALLER (OS)
               Ah... Detective Wagner.  I'm sorry but
               you'll have to get off the line and go
               back to your tracing equipment.  If I
               wanted to play the game with a moron I
               would have called you.
               
     Frank angrily motions Andy to get off.  Andy hangs up.
     
                         CALLER (OS)
               I suppose you want to know where I'm
               going to kill tonight, Peter?
               
                         PETER
               You're not going to tell me that.
     
                         CALLER (OS)
               "Wee Willie Winkie runs through the
               town.  Upstairs and downstairs in his
               nightgown.  Crawling through the
               window.  At the end of Miss Emma's
               street.  Her God has gone and left his
               home.  So her and I can meet."
               
     The line goes dead.  A beat.  Everyone reflects on what they
     have just heard.
     
                         FRANK
                    (to Andy)
               Are you out of your fuckin' mind
               picking up the phone!

                    (to Technician)
               Anything?
               
                         TECHNICIAN
               Nothing.  We'd have a better chance if
               we could tap in at the junction box.
               
                         FRANK
               Thanks Mister Sanderson.
                    (to Kathy and Andy)
               Let's go.
               
                         PETER
               You want me to go with you?  Maybe I
               can help.
               
                         FRANK
               That's alright.  We'll take it from
               here.
               
               
     EXT.  HOTEL GROUNDS - MORNING
     
     Kathy, Frank and Andy leave Peter's room and walk back towards
     the hotel.
     
                         ANDY
               You should be an actor, Frank.  You
               looked like you were really mad.  The
               veins popping out on your neck was a
               really nice touch.
               
                         KATHY
               You weren't mad at him for picking up
               the phone?
               
                         FRANK
               No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make
               sure there was someone on the other
               end.
               
                         KATHY
               But we heard him.
               
                         FRANK
               It could have been a tape.  A
               prerecorded conversation between
               Sanderson and himself.
     
     
     
                                                             33
     INT.  POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON
     
     A room set up to deal with the murder.  PHOTOGRAPHS are pinned
     to a cork board.  Frank is at a table with Kathy, Andy and
     Nolan.  On the chalkboard in the rhyme the Caller recited
     earlier.
     
                         ANDY
               The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar
               to this guy.  I think he's a first-
               timer.
               
                         FRANK
               Check with the State.  If he's never
               killed outside of Washington the F.B.I.
               wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
               
                         NOLAN
               He tapes their mouths shut.  We found
               traces of adhesive around the victims
               mouths.  We're doing a chemical
               analysis for components, but it's
               probably a standard brand you can buy
               in any hardware store.
               
                         FRANK
               There's only two hardware stores on the
               whole Island.  We'll check that out.
               What about the blood?
               
                         NOLAN
               Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for
               the Red Cross.
               
     Frank looks at Nolan askance.
     
                         FRANK
               Kathy?
               
                         KATHY
               Well, the fact that he views this as a
               game suggests that he is trying to
               prove some sense of superiority -- and
               the way he murders confirms a need to
               be in complete control of his victim.
               
                         FRANK
               What about the way he arranged the
               body?
               
     
                                                             34
                         KATHY
               That would indicate he's playing out a
               fantasy.  Power-control killers usually
               fantasize about their actions long
               before they commit them.  Once they
               become a reality though, they reach a
               sense of euphoria and need to repeat
               the act to sustain it.  But, in all the
               research I've read on Serial Killers,
               I've never heard of one moving so fast.
               It's as if the game is the catalyst for
               the murders -- not the other way
               around.
               
                         FRANK
               Anything else?
               
                         KATHY
               Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one
               knows it?
               
                         FRANK
               I was thinking the same thing.  He must
               be local.  It's logical for him to
               assume that the police would be there,
               but he recognized Andy's voice and
               called him by name.
                    (points to the rhyme)
               What about this?
               
                         KATHY
               I would think it's some type of clue as
               to where he's going to kill next?
               
                         ANDY
               Why does he call Sanderson?
               
                         KATHY
               He's one of the best Chess players in
               the world.  Who better to play a game
               with?
               
                         FRANK
                    (to Andy)
               You still having a problem with this?
               
                         ANDY
               Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us.
               If I was a killer and the police were
               trying to make a case against me, what
               better why to draw them off than to put
               their attention on someone else?
               
     
                                                             35
                         KATHY
               Sending yourself anonymous notes in the
               mail is one thing -- but who called him
               today?
               
                         ANDY
               I don't know.  Maybe there's two of
               them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make
               the calls.
               
                         KATHY
               Maybe you're reaching a bit?  I think
               Sanderson should be in on this.
               There's a reason why the killer's
               calling him.
               
     A UNIFORMED OFFICER KNOCKS and enters.
     
                         OFFICER
               Captain, we found her.
               
               
     EXT.  WAREHOUSE - WIDE SHOT - AFTERNOON
     
     Several BLACK and WHITE UNITS are parked in the rear of the
     building.  Frank and Andy walk up the loading dock steps in
     silence.
     
     
     INT.  WAREHOUSE - AFTERNOON
     
     The body of CHRISTIE EASTMAN is laying on top of a large crate.
     Her body has been draped tightly with a sheet and her arms are
     folded across her chest.  Her face is deathly white and has
     been made up with the same clumsy makeup.
     
     Written in blood on the wall behind her is:  EVENTUALLY
     
     
     INT.  STAGE WINGS - EVENING
     
     Peter paces back and forth waiting for the match to begin.
     Yurilivich is sitting in a chair, watching Peter with a grin.
     Peter turns around and almost bumps into Lutz who is wearing a
     ridiculous hat with sheets of aluminium foil sticking out.
     
                         [LUTZ
               They're trying to control my thoughts.
                    (points to the hat)
               Aluminium foil.  It repels the thought
               rays.]
               
     Peter stares at him.  In the b.g. Kathy enters, looks around,
     then walks over to Peter.
     
     
                                                             36
                         KATHY
               They couldn't break the riddle.
               
                         PETER
               Did you think it was going to be easy?
               You think he was going to lay it out at
               your feet?
               
                         KATHY
               We need your help.
               
                         PETER
               I offered my help this morning and
               Sedman turned me down.
               
                         KATHY
               But you're the key.  The one he wants
               to play the game with.
               
                         PETER
               I can't right now.  I've got a game.
               
                         KATHY
               She could be dead after the game.
               
                         PETER
               She could be dead now.
               
                         KATHY
               What if she isn't?  Where are your
               priorities?  You have to think between
               someone's life and a chess game?
                    (raising her voice)
               The girl he killed last night was only
               twenty one years old!  He dumped her
               body behind a warehouse like a sack of
               garbage!
               
     Everyone is now staring at Kathy and Peter who are staring at
     each other.  In the b.g. The President appears.
     
                         PRESIDENT
               Gentlemen...
               
     The GRANDMASTERS walk onto stage as Peter and Kathy continue to
     stare at each other.  A beat.  Peter starts to move towards the
     stage.  Kathy takes a step after him.  She takes a envelope
     from her jacket pocket and puts it into Peter's jacket pocket.
     
                         KATHY
               These are for you.
     
     
     
                                                             37
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
     
     Peter sits across from GRANDMASTER KRIKORIAN.  He makes a move,
     then hits his timer.  On the BOARD behind him the move is
     duplicated.  Krikorian studies the board.  Peter is staring out
     over the AUDIENCE deep in thought.  Krikorian makes a move and
     hits the timer.  Peter continues to stare, unaware that it is
     his move.  A beat.  All eyes are on him.
     
     Peter turns around and stares at the big board, then walks over
     and makes a move.  Krikorian studies his position.  Peter
     reaches into his pocket for a cigarette.  He removes the
     envelope Kathy gave him, then his cigarettes.  A beat.  He
     stares at the envelope, flicking his finger against it.
     Krikorian looks up annoyed.  Peter opens the envelope.
     
     CLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPHS:  We see several PHOTOGRAPHS of Christie
     Eastman before her death.  Peter turns through them.  Next, we
     see the grisly PHOTOS taken at the crime scene.  He is a man
     struggling to make a decision.  Krikorian makes a move.  Peter
     does not react.  He replaces the PHOTOS and stares at the
     envelope, then looks up at Krikorian who is watching him.  A
     beat.  Peter replaces the envelope in his pocket, then makes a
     move.
     
     
     INT.  POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Kathy sits with Frank and Andy.  Coffee cups litter with table.
     The nursery rhyme is written on the BLACKBOARD and reads:
     
     
     
     WEE WILLIE WINKIE RUNS THROUGH THE STREET,
     UPSTAIRS AND DOWNSTAIRS IN HIS NIGHTGOWN;
     CRAWLING THROUGH THE WINDOW,
     AT THE END OF MISS EMMA'S STREET,
     HER GOD HAS GONE AND LEFT HIS HOME,
     SO HER AND I CAN MEET.
     
     
     
                         FRANK
               "Her God has gone and left his home?"
               
     Everyone shakes there head indicating they don't understand the
     reference.
     
                         KATHY
               Why these girls?  How does he pick
               them?
     
     Frank points to a LARGE MAP of the CITY on the wall, with TWO
     RED PINS in different locations.
               
     
                                                             38
                         FRANK
                    (pointing to the map)
               I don't think it matters.  Last nights
               victim, Christie Eastman was found in a
               warehouse on the outskirts of town.
               The night before, Debi Rutlege was
               found in the center.
               
                         KATHY
               Meaning?
               
                         ANDY
               Meaning, it looks like his victims are
               chosen at random.
               
                         PETER (OS)
               No.
               
     Peter is standing in the doorway.  He enters the room.
     
                         ANDY
               What do you mean, no?
               
                         PETER
               He says it's a game.  All games have a
               strategy.
               
                         ANDY
               All you gotta do is look at the map.
               
                         PETER
               His victims aren't random.  It only
               means that they appear to be random.
               There's a connection, we just have to
               find it.
               
     Peter turns his attention to the blackboard.
     
                         PETER
               What have you come up with on the
               riddle?
               
                         FRANK
               "Wee Willie Winkie runs though the
               street."  We think he might be making a
               reference to himself.
     
                         PETER
               Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think
               it's just a tease.
               
                         FRANK
               Upstairs and downstairs in his night
               gown -- He could be saying the house
               he's picked is two stories.
     
                                                             39
               
                                             
     EXT.  HOUSE - NIGHT - KILLER'S POV
     
     As he approaches a TWO STORY house.  The POV stops moving, as
     if to decide which way to go... then goes around the right side
     of the house.
     
                                             
     INT.  POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Peter, Kathy, Frank and Andy continue to unravel the message.
               
                         KATHY
                    (offering)
               "Crawling through the window"... We
               think that's how he's going to get in?
               
                                             
     EXT.  SIDE OF HOUSE - KILLER'S POV - NIGHT
     
     A crowbar is placed under a window and pried up until the lock
     breaks.  We see two GLOVED HANDS open the window.
     
                                             
     INT.  POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Peter has taken his jacket off and is pacing the room.  Kathy,
     Frank and Andy stare at the board.
     
                         PETER
               That's it?
               
                         FRANK
               We think he might be making a reference
               to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term
               used by junkies for Morphine.
               
                         PETER
               Could Emma be the name of the girl he's
               going to kill?
               
                         ANDY
               We've checked.  There's no one with the
               last name of Emma on the Island.
               
                         FRANK
               Maybe he's going to drug her?
               
                         KATHY
               He's killed both girls exactly the same
               way.  It's almost ritualistic.  Why
               would he change now?
               
     
                                                             40
                         PETER
               Morpheus.
               
                         ANDY
               What?
               
                         PETER
               Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek
               God of dreams.  Look at the next line.
               "Her God has gone and left his home."
               
                         KATHY
               His home would be... Mount Olympus.
               
                         FRANK
               Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I
               want that area blanketed.
               
     Frank and Andy rush from the room.
               
               
     INT.  LORAINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     LORAINE OLSEN, a YOUNG, ATTRACTIVE GIRL in her twenties enters
     the room and walks over to the CLOSET as she takes off her
     jacket.  She reaches for the DOORKNOB when the PHONE RINGS.
     She hesitates for a moment, deciding whether to open the door,
     but decides to answer the phone first.  She walks over and
     picks it up.
     
                         LORAINE
               Hello?...  Oh hi Mom...  No I just got
               in...  No I haven't forgotten.
               Tomorrow, ten o'clock...  Yes... Yes...
               Okay, I'll see you in the morning.
               Bye.
               
     She hangs up, walks back to the CLOSET and opens the door.
     
     INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT
     
     is a large WALK-IN, the back filled with LONG HANGING DRESSES
     that almost reach the floor.  Below them is a row of SHOES,
     neatly aligned on the floor.  Loraine hangs up her jacket,
     takes off her shirt, then puts on a tee shirt.
     
     
     INT.  LORAINE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
     
     Loraine finishes brushing her teeth.  She turns off the water,
     but we still HEAR a DRIPPING SOUND.  She looks over at the bath
     tub with the SHOWER CURTAINS DRAWN.  She opens the curtain and
     tightly turns the handle to stop the nozzle from leaking.
     
     
     
                                                             41
     INT.  LORAINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     Loraine sits on the edge of her bed and peels herself out of
     her tight pants.
     
     
     INT.  LORAINE'S CLOSET - NIGHT
     
     She enters the closet and hangs up her pants.  As she does so
     we see: Among the row of shoes is a pair of BLACK HIGH-TOP
     TENNIS SHOES.       
     
     Loraine starts to leave.  The TENNIS SHOES move forward.
     
     CLOSE ON LORAINE:  A GLOVED HAND reaches over and CLAMPS down
     tightly over her mouth, muffling her SCREAM as,
     
     
     INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     The CLOSET DOOR is SLAMMED SHUT.  SILENCE.  A FLASH of light
     fills the frame of the door.
     
     
     EXT.  WATERFRONT - NIGHT
     
     Colorful SHOPS and RESTURANTS line the street.  Peter grabs a
     HOT DOG from a VENDOR and takes a big bite, then looks at
     Kathy.
     
                         PETER
               You sure you don't want to eat
               something?
               
                         KATHY
               I don't think I could.
               
     They start to walk agin.
               
                         PETER
               It's going to be a long night.  It
               could take hours before we know
               something.  You should try to eat.
               
                         KATHY
               You sound like my mother.
               
                         PETER
               It wasn't intentional.
     
                         KATHY
               Does what's going on bother you at all?
               Or are you just wearing your game face?
               
     
                                                             42
                         PETER
               I think it's interesting.
               
                         KATHY
               Another kind of game?
               
                         PETER
               In a way.
               
                         KATHY
               This isn't a game.
               
                         PETER
               Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person
               everyday and challenging us to catch
               him.  That's a game.  It has rules and
               objectives.
               
                         KATHY
               How can you look at it so clinically?
               
                         PETER
               Take your average cop.  They deal with
               death everyday.  If they let emotions
               get in the way it would cloud their
               judgement.
               
                         KATHY
               That's true -- but the emotion is still
               there.  They just learn to control it.
               
                         PETER
               What about you?  Aren't there times
               when a young child is telling you a
               story so sad you just want to cry?
               
                         KATHY
               Of course.
               
                         PETER
               Do you?
               
                         KATHY
                    (uncomfortable)
               Let's change the subject.
               
                         PETER
               Okay.  So, tell me about yourself.  Are
               you married?
               
     Kathy stops.
               
                         KATHY
               How did we get to that subject?
               
     
                                                             43
                         PETER
               I'm just curious.
               
                         KATHY
                    (uncomfortable)
               I think it's best if we don't ask too
               many personal questions -- I want to
               keep things on a professional level.
               
                         PETER
               You mean like in the steam room?
               
                         KATHY
               That's not fair!
               
                         PETER
               Are you going to tell me you didn't
               feel something in there?
               
     Kathy is growing more uncomfortable by the moment.
     
                         KATHY
               You're projecting your own desires and
               reading more into what happened than
               what actually did.
     
                         PETER
               Very good.  Spoken like a true
               psychologist.  When confronted with the
               prospect of your own reality, hide
               behind quotations.  What is that
               Masters and Johnson?
               
     The tension breaks.  Kathy smiles.
     
                         KATHY
               You have to win every point, don't you?
               
                         PETER
               I just wanted to know if you're
               involved with anyone?
                    (Beat)
               Let me ask you something?  Do your
               colleagues know if you're involved or
               not?
               
                         KATHY
               Of course.
               
                         PETER
               Why?
               
                         KATHY
               Because I work with them.
               
     
                                                             44
                         PETER
               Aren't you working with me?
               
     Kathy smiles again, amused by Peter's tactics.
     
                         KATHY
               No.
               
                         PETER
               You're not?
               
                         KATHY
               No -- I'm not involved.
                    (Beat)
               And I plan on keeping it that way.
               
     Kathy walks off, leaving Peter staring after her.
               
               
     INT.  LORAINE'S KITCHEN - MORNING
     
     Kathy, Frank and Andy are in the room with Nolan.  Nolan is on
     his knees at the base of a window.  On the floor beside him is
     a RULER and a SHEET OF RUBBERIZED PAPER.
     
                         NOLAN
                    (proudly)
               This is where he forced his way in.  We
               found some fibers on the windowsill,
               probably particles of clothing that
               rubbed off when he climbed through.
               I'll know more once I get it under the
               microscope.
               
                         FRANK
                    (not impressed)
               That's great.
               
                         NOLAN
               Wait, I've saved the best for last.
               Andy, hit the lights, will you?
               
     Andy looks for the light switch.  Kathy realizes she's standing
     in front of it and moves out of the way.  Andy turns off the
     lights and the room goes dark.  Nolan turns on a FLASHLIGHT and
     gets down on his knees, then SHINES the LIGHT at a LOW ANGLE
     across the floor.
     
     THE FLOOR - CLOSE SHOT:  We can clearly see the impression of a
     SHOE PRINT.
     
                         NOLAN
               It's a tennis shoe.  Pretty old by the
               individual characteristics.  About a
               size ten or eleven.  This guy is big.
     
                                                             45
               
                         ANDY
               What's this?
               
     Andy points to a JAGGED LINE in the impression.
               
                         NOLAN
               Don't know.  Looks like a cut or a gash
               in the sole of the shoe.  We'll blow it
               up back at the lab.
               
               
     INT.  HALLWAY - MORNING
     
     Frank, Andy and Kathy follow Nolan towards the bedroom.  Frank
     stops and taps Kathy on the shoulder.
               
                         FRANK
               Before we go in I gotta tell you this
               isn't going to be pretty.
               
                         KATHY
               I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
               
                         FRANK
               This ain't no photo.
               
                                             
     INT.  LORAINE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
     
     Frank, Andy  and Kathy enter the room.  Loraine's body is
     laying on the bed, her appearance is like all the others.
     
     On the wall written in blood is: REVENGE.
     
     Kathy stares at the sight, horrified.  She starts to gag and
     runs from the room.
     
                         FRANK
               Same as the others?
               
                         NOLAN
               Yeah.
                         
                         FRANK
               How long she been dead?
               
                         NOLAN
               I'd say at least eighteen hours.
               
                         FRANK
               That means she was dead before we even
               finished figuring out the message.
               
     
                                                             46
                         ANDY
               Or before Sanderson ever showed up to
               help us with the riddle.  He figured it
               out pretty quick, didn't he?  Maybe
               it's not to hard if you wrote it.
               
               
     INT.  PETER'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
     
     Peter enters in his SWEATS to find Erica, Jeremy and David
     sitting around a computer.
     
                         PETER
               Good morning.
               
     Erica runs over to him and gives him a kiss.
     
                         PETER
                    (to Jeremy)
               We got a problem?
               
                         JEREMY
               Our computer went on the fritz again.
               David came up to fix it.
               
                         PETER
               Is it serious?
               
                         DAVID
               Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up
               a program that'll analyze your games
               three hundred percent faster.
               
                         PETER
               Thanks.
               
     Peter walks over to the MONITOR.  A COMPUTER GAME is on.
     
                         PETER
               What's this?
               
                         DAVID
               Oh, I put a few games on for your
               daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
               
                         PETER
               Of course not.
               
                         [DAVID
               Well, I've got to go over Lutz's room
               now.  He thinks someone has tapped into
               his computer and is monitoring his
               practice games.]
               
     David picks up his bag and starts to leave.
     
                                                             47
     
                         PETER
               Don't you have something you want to
               say to David?
               
                         ERICA
               Thanks, David.
               
                         DAVID
               Your welcome.
               
     David leaves.
               
                         ERICA
               You ready?
               
                         PETER
               For what?
               
                         ERICA
               You told me you'd take me over to
               Seattle today.
               
                         PETER
               I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
               
                         ERICA
               But you promised.
               
     Erica stares at him sadly.
               
                         JEREMY
               I'll take you.
               
     She forces a smile for Jeremy's sake, then leaves the room.
     
                         JEREMY
               Peter...
               
                         PETER
               I've got be here for the police when
               they come.  Then I've got to practise.
               In case you forgot I'm in the middle of
               a match right now.
               
                         JEREMY
               You're always in the middle of a match.
               
                         PETER
               I want to be the best I can.
               
     
                                                             48
                         JEREMY
               Sometimes I think you'd rather be the
               best chess player, than the best
               father.  Instead of thinking about what
               kind of day your daughter had, you
               would rather think about the Sicilian
               Najdorf opening or a counter to the
               Tartokover Bondarevsky System.
                    (Beat)
               A relationship is not a chessboard.
               You can't walk away from it and come
               back whenever you want and still expect
               all the pieces to be there.
               
               
     INT.  PETER'S ROOM - MORNING
     
     Peter enters from the bathroom wearing only his jeans.  He goes
     over to his briefcase and starts to take out a paper.  He
     stops, then slowly takes out an OLD, WORN, ENVELOPE.  He stares
     at it. There is a KNOCK on the door.  Peter replaces the
     ENVELOPE. He opens the door to find a pale and shaken Kathy.
     She walks into  the room.
     
                         KATHY
               They found the third girl.  Her name
               was Loraine Olsen.  I just came from
               the crime scene.  It was horrible.  How
               can anybody do something like that?
               You got anything to drink around here?
               
     Peter walks over to the bar and pours her a brandy.  He brings
     it over to her and sits beside her on the couch.  Kathy gulps
     it down.
               
                         PETER
               Relax.
               
                         KATHY
               How the hell can I relax after seeing
               what I just saw.
               
                         PETER
               I know it was bad.
               
                         KATHY
               How could you?  Unless you were there.
               
     Their eyes lock for a moment, each probing the others.
     
                         KATHY
               Sorry, I didn't mean that the way it
               sounded.
               
     
                                                             49
                         PETER
               I know you didn't
               
                         KATHY
               You know, Andy thinks you're doing
               this.
               
                         PETER
               Doesn't that scare you?
     
                         KATHY
               No.
               
                         PETER
               Why?
               
                         KATHY
               Because I think he's wrong.
               
     Peter takes her hand and holds it in his.  There is a KNOCK at
     the door.  Peter opens it to find Frank and Andy.
     
                         FRANK
               Come with us.
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL HALLWAY - MORNING
     
     Peter follows Frank and Andy as they walk down a utility
     hallway.
     
               
     INT.  HOTEL BASEMENT - MORNING
     
     Damp and dark.  A large cavernous room built under the hotel.
     SEVERAL SMALLER ROOMS, OR ALCOVES, CONNECT TO THE MAIN ROOM
     THROUGH A SERIES OF JOINING DOORS.  FLORESCENT LIGHTS spaced on
     the ceiling cast long shadows through the room.  Large water
     pipes and electrical mains run across the ceiling.
     
     Frank, Andy, Peter and Kathy enter.  Frank walks over to the
     TECHNICIAN we saw before.  He is setting up his tracing
     equipment at the main TELEPHONE JUNCTION BOX.
     
                         FRANK
               How's it going?
               
                         TECHNICIAN
                    (points to a phone)
               While we're down here all calls coming
               into Mr. Sanderson's room will be
               routed to extenion 611.  I've also--
               
     
                                                             50
     The PHONE RINGS.  It echoes through the room.  Peter's face
     tenses.  He walks over and picks it up.  A LOUDSPEAKER is
     activated.
     
                         PETER
               Hello?
     
                         CALLER (OS)
               Do you know what I'm doing right now,
               Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the
               girl I'm going to kill tonight.
               
                         PETER
               You know her?
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               Not really.
                         
                         PETER
               Why her?
               
                         CALLER (OS)
                    (a trace of anger)
               Because she's the type.
               
                         PETER
               But you said you didn't know her.
               
                         CALLER (OS)
                    (annoyed)
               I know what I said!  She looks just
               like...
               
                         PETER
               Just like who?
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               I really wish you'd stop trying to
               maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not
               to mention insulting.
               
                         PETER
               I'm just trying to play the game.
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               You're not playing very well.  There
               are clues all around you and you keep
               missing them.
               
     Peter's frustration grows.  He decides to try a different line.
     
                         PETER
               Listen, if you're just going to call up
               to gloat, I don't want to hear it!
               
     
                                                             51
                         CALLER (OS)
               I'm sure there are other people who
               would be interested in what I have to
               say.
               
                         PETER
               Then call them!
               
     Peter slams down the phone.  Kathy, Frank and Andy are stunned
     that Peter would end the conversation.
     
                         ANDY
               Are you crazy?
               
                         PETER
               Let's see how much he wants to play.
     
     SILENCE fills the room.  Peter stares at the phone expectantly.
     A moment later it RINGS.  Peter waits and lets it ring.
     Finally he answers it on the fourth ring.
     
                         CALLER (OS)
               Just for that no hint today.
                         
                         PETER
               Why are you doing this?  You must have
               some idea of the pain you're causing
               people.
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind.
               It's something you learn to live with.
               I have.
               
     Kathy hands Peter a note she has written.
     
                         PETER
                    (reading the note)
               And you want these girls to feel your
               pain?
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               Please, I don't want to get into the
               psychological aspects of my actions.
               It would detract from the game.
               
                         PETER
               How?
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               I couldn't say it any better than
               Huxley.
               
     
                                                             52
                         PETER
               Huxley's quote also says, "his play is
               always fair and just."
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               So is mine, within the framework of my
               rules.
               
     The line goes dead.  Peter hangs up.
     
                         ANDY
               What in the hell do you think you're
               doing?  Slamming down the phone in the
               middle of the trace.
               
                         PETER
               You think you're going to catch him on
               a trace?  Everything he does is planned
               out well in advance.  The only way
               we're going to get him is to rattle him
               -- make him slip up.
               
                         FRANK
               You never know how you're going to
               catch a suspect.
               
                         KATHY
               Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be
               forced into making a mistake.
               
                         ANDY
               We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
               
                         PETER
               Maybe you should.
               
     Peter stares at Andy defiantly.
     
                         ANDY
               You don't tell us how to run our
               investigation.  You got that?
               
                         PETER
               You don't have an investigation without
               me.  You got that?
               
     The two men lock eyes hostilely.
     
                         FRANK
               What were you going to say, Kathy?
               
     
                                                             53
                         KATHY
               Well, I think you have to play to his
               ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The
               more secure he feels, the more chances
               he'll take.
     
                         FRANK
               What did he mean by Huxley?
               
                         PETER
               He was referring to a quote by Thomas
               Henry Huxley.
                    (quoting)
               "The chess board is the world, the
               pieces are the phenomena of the
               universe, the rules of the game are
               what we call Nature.  The player on the
               other side is hidden from us.  We know
               that his play is always fair, just, and
               patient.  But also, we know, to our
               cost, that he never overlooks a
               mistake, or makes the smallest
               allowances for ignorance."
     
     
     EXT.  PUGET SOUND - AFTERNOON
     
     Peter and Kathy are sitting on the beach.  Peter draws squares
     in the sand like a chessboard and starts moving shells and
     rocks around.  Kathy grins.
     
                         KATHY
               Are you playing chess?
               
     Peter smiles like a boy with his hand caught in the cookie-jar.
     
                         PETER
               When I was little I'd watch the other
               kids playing baseball from my room.  In
               the evening, when their parents would
               call them in to put their bats and
               balls away, I'd watch them from my
               window, forcing, expressions of
               disappointment, trying to gain another
               few minutes outside so they could play
               -- but no one could stop me from
               playing.
                    (he closes his eyes)
               All I had to do was close my eyes and
               my whole world became a chessboard.  I
               could see the pieces, and sometimes it
               felt like if I reached out I could
               almost touch them.  I ordered them and
               they obeyed.
               
     
                                                             54
     Kathy stares at him for a moment, unsure what to make of his
     speech.  Peter opens his eyes, there is a beat as he seems to
     bridge the gap back to this world.  He smiles.
               
                         KATHY
               Can you go fifteen minutes without
               thinking about it?
               
                         PETER
                    (thinks for a moment)
               No.  But I'm open to distractions.
               
                         KATHY
               I'm sure you are.
               
     He smiles at her.  He destroys the pattern in the sand, takes
     her hand and they start walking.
     
                         PETER
               You know, you're not the easiest person
               in the world to get close to.
               
                         KATHY
               You always want to talk about me.  What
               about you?
               
                         PETER
               Wasn't I just talking about me?
               
                         KATHY
               No.  You were talking about chess.
               
                         PETER
               Alright.  What about me?
               
                         KATHY
               I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
               
                         PETER
               She died in a car accident.
               
                         KATHY
               I'm sorry.
               
                         PETER
               It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
               
                         KATHY
               It must've been very hard on Erica?
               
                         PETER
               It was.
               
                         KATHY
               And you?
     
                                                             55
               
     Peter stops and smiles.
     
                         PETER
               Do you want me to lay down, Doctor?
               
     Kathy grins.
     
                         PETER
               Look, why don't you just come out and
               ask me what you want to know?
               
     Kathy hesitates.
     
                         PETER
               Was it serious between Debi and me?
               No.  Have I known a lot of girls like
               her?
                    (Beat)
               None of your business.
               
     Kathy stares at him, almost studying him for a moment.
     
                         PETER
               What?
               
                         KATHY
               Have you noticed that every time we
               start to talk about something serious
               you start to play games.
               
                         PETER
               I'm not playing a game now.
               
                         KATHY
               Yes you are.  You're playing word
               games.
               
                         PETER
                    (defensive)
               What is this?
               
                         KATHY
               I'm just trying to get to know you,
               Peter.
               
                         PETER
               What?  By attacking me?
               
     
                                                             56
                         KATHY
               Nobody could attack you.  You set your
               life up like one of your chessboards.
               You're impregnable -- but at the same
               time you've become trapped behind your
               own defenses.  You're cut off from
               everyone around you.
               
                         PETER
               What are you talking about?  You don't
               even know me.
               
                         KATHY
               Does anyone?
               
     He starts to walk away.
               
                         KATHY
               Are you forfeiting?
               
     He stops dead in his tracks, turns and walks back.
               
                         PETER
               I just don't want to fight with you.
               
                         KATHY
               Then show me who you are.
               
     Peter thinks.  There's a seriousness we haven't seen before.
     
                         PETER
               This frightens me -- because I'm
               starting to feel things I haven't felt
               in a long time.
               
                         KATHY
               You've got to face the things you feel.
               
                         PETER
                    (a little grin)
               I thought you were the woman who didn't
               want to get involved.
               
                         KATHY
               I said I didn't plan on getting
               involved.
               
     He moves closer.  She takes a step back.
               
                         PETER
                    (moving closer)
               What happened to facing the things we
               feel?
               
     
                                                             57
                         KATHY
                    (giving in)
               You can turn everything around so
               easily.  This is not just another game,
               is it?
               
                         PETER
               No.
               
     They stare at each other, each of them probing the others eyes.
     Peter leans forward and gently kisses her on the lips.  He
     kisses her again.  Their passion builds until they throw their
     arms around each other and embrace passionately.
     
     
     INT.  PETER'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
     
     Peter pins her against the wall and kisses her.  She wraps her
     legs around his waist as he holds her against the wall.  They
     continue to kiss as they move along the wall, knocking pictures
     off the wall.  Peter carries her over to a LARGE CHESSBOARD.
     With one hand he sweeps the PIECES off onto the floor, then
     sits her down on it.  They kiss each other furiously, each of
     them groping at the others clothing.  Their hands move along
     each others bodies, exploring, touching, feeling.  He un-
     buttons her blouse, then kisses her neck, working his way to
     her breasts.  Kathy closes her eyes, submitting to the pleasure
     of his touch.
     
     
     INT.  PETER'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
     
     TWO SILHOUETTES.  Bodies intertwined.  The SOUNDS of love
     making fill the room.
     
                                             SLOW FADE TO BLACK
     
     
     INT.  PETER'S BEDROOM - LATER - NIGHT
     
     DARK.  SILENCE.
     
                         KATHY
               I'm hungry.
     
                         PETER
               Call room service.
               
     A LIGHT COMES on.  Kathy lays next to Peter.  She rolls over
     and kisses him.
               
               
                         KATHY
               I hate hotel food.  Rondi's Pizza is
               just down the street.
     
                                                             58
               
                         PETER
               Fine.
               
                         KATHY
               What do you want on it?
               
                         PETER
                    (nibbling at her neck)
               You.
               
                         KATHY
               Would you settle for pepperoni?
               
                         PETER
               If I have to.  I'm going to take a
               shower.
               
     Peter goes into the bathroom.  Kathy sits up and throws on a t-
     shirt.  She goes to the desk.  By the phone is a copy of the
     WHITE PAGES.  She starts to look up the number.  In b.g. we
     HEAR the SHOWER.
     
     CLOSE ON PHONE BOOK:  In the middle of the page a name is
     underlined in RED.  It reads:  RUTLEGE, DEBI
     
     Kathy stares at the name.  A beat.  Slowly she turns through
     the pages.
     
     CLOSE ON PHONE BOOK:  The name EASTMAN, CHRISTIE is UNDERLINED.
     The pages are quickly turned again until we see the name OLSEN,
     LORAINE UNDERLINED.
     
     Kathy is stunned.  She thinks for a second, then gets up and
     starts getting dressed.  In the b.g. we HEAR the SHOWER stop.
     
                         PETER (OS)
               Did you call?
               
                         KATHY
               The line was busy.  I'll try again.
               
     She finishes dressing then heads for the door.  She opens the
     door and stops, then looks back.
     
     HER POV: Her PURSE is on the nightstand.
     
     She hesitates, then quickly walks back to get it.  She picks it
     up and starts back for the door when... Peter steps out of the
     bathroom.  He stares at her.
     
                         PETER
               Where are you going?
               
     
                                                             59
                         KATHY
               They're not delivering.  I'm going to
               go pick up the pizza.
               
                         PETER
                    (moving closer to her)
               I thought you said the line was busy?
               
                         KATHY
               I tried again and got through.
               
                         PETER
                    (still closer)
               What's wrong?
               
                         KATHY
                    (backing away)
               Nothing.
               
                         PETER
                    (following her)
               Then why are you backing up?
               
     Peter waits for an answer.  There isn't one.  He looks around
     the room, retracing in his mind what could have happened.  He
     sees the open PHONE BOOK on the dresser next to him.  He stares
     at it for a moment, then back at Kathy.
     
                         PETER
               This?
                    
     She doesn't answer.  Peter appears disappointed.
     
                         PETER
               I was looking for correlations between
               their names, addresses, anything that
               might be the same.
                    
     Kathy looks away.
     
                         PETER
               You're as bad as Andy... maybe worse.
               
     He walks over to a chair and sits down, freeing the path to the
     door.
     
                         KATHY
               Peter, you have to admit--
               
                         PETER
               --admit what?  That I was right about
               you in the steam room?  That you're
               willing to do anything to find out what
               you want?  Would you like me to leave
               so you can search the rest of the room?
     
                                                             60
               
                         KATHY
               Peter...
               
                         PETER
                    (cutting her off;
                     hurt)
               How could you think that, Kathy?  How
               could you even consider it?
               
     A beat.  Kathy thinks for a moment, then walks to the door and
     leaves.  A beat.  Peter gets up, stares at the phone book, then
     closes it softly.
     
     
     INT.  AUDITORIUM WINGS - NIGHT
     
     Peter seems deep in thought.  Behind him Lutz is pacing back
     and forth.  He is wearing a ridiculous hat with sheets of
     aluminium foil sticking out.  Peter stares at him.
     
                         LUTZ
               They're trying to control my mind.
                    (points to his hat)
               Aluminium foil.  It repels the thought
               rays.
     
     Peter stares at him blankly.
     
     
     INT.  KATHY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
     
     Kathy enters her house and checks her messages.  There are
     none.
     
                         KATHY
               Very popular.
     
     
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
     
     Peter walks out on stage.  Yurilivich is waiting for him at the
     CHESSBOARD.  The other two tables are vacant_  The President
     addresses the audience.
     
     
                                                             61
                         PRESIDENT
               Since Grandmaster Sanderson leads the
               tournament with nine wins,  and
               Grandmaster Yurilivich is in second
               with eight -- it as become apparent
               that with only four games remaining,
               the other players, should they win all
               four of their remaining games, would
               still not be in a position to win the
               tournament.  Therefore, we have decided
               that the remaining games between
               Grandmaster Sanderson and Yurilivich
               will be held separately.
                         
     
     INT.  KATHY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
     
     Kathy sits on the couch, reading a book entitled: CASE STUDIES
     OF SERIAL KILLRS.  She appears distracted.  She looks off and
     thinks about Peter.  Finally, she grabs her coat and leaves the
     house.
     
     
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
     
     Yurilivich makes a moves, then hits his timer.  The PIECE moves
     on the board behind them.
     
     Jeremy grabs Erica's arm excitedly.
     
                         ERICA
               What is it?
               
                         JEREMY
               Mate in five.
               
     Peter makes a move.  There is a slight MOAN from the crowd.
     
     Jeremy looks at the BIG BOARD reflecting Peter's move then over
     at Erica.
     
                         JEREMY
               He didn't see it.
               
     Yurilivich makes a move.
     
                         YURILIVICH
               Check.
               
     Peter is stunned at his position.  He looks at the board,
     frustration fills his face.  Slowly he picks up his KING and
     lays it on his side.
     
     At the door to the auditorium we see Kathy watching him.  She
     turns and leaves.
     
                                                             62
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT
     
     A tired-looking Peter walks to his door.  He starts to put in
     his key when he notices the door is ajar.  A beat.  He slowly
     pushes it open.
     
     
     INT.  PETER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Dark.  Peter enters.  He tries the light switch.  It doesn't
     work.  He walks slowly across the room.  As he nears the hall a
     FIGURE OF A MAN stands up out of one of the high-backed chairs.
     Peter senses something and spins around.  A LIGHT on the desk
     comes on.  Andy stares at him with a grin.
     
                         ANDY
               Scare you?
               
     Peter doesn't answer.  He stares at Andy hostilely.
     
                         ANDY
               You know, I figure that's pretty much
               how these girl's feel just before they
               get it.  You think I'm right?
               
                         PETER
               I wouldn't know.
               
                         ANDY
               That's right.  I guess only the killer
               would know that.
               
                         PETER
               How'd you get in here?
               
                         ANDY
               The door was open.
               
                         PETER
               No it wasn't.
               
                         ANDY
               Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be
               breaking and entering.  That's a
               felony.
               
                         PETER
               What do you want?
               
                         ANDY
               You ever do any hunting, Peter?
               
     
                                                             63
                         PETER
               No.
               
                         ANDY
               I used to.  With my old man.  He taught
               me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a
               lot harder than most people think.  We
               used to go after Raccoons mostly.
               They'd get into our garbage, our
               fields.  When an animal can't live
               peacefully with those around it, it has
               to be destroyed.  But they're crafty
               little devils.  You see the trick is,
               you can put your trap down, but no
               Raccoon is going come near it unless
               you lay down the scent.  You ever smell
               Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but
               to a male Raccoon it smells just like
               pussy.  He'll walk right up to that
               trap, even though it don't look nothing
               like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam
               head right in it.  You know why?  Cause
               he can't help himself.  The scent
               drives him.  So, if you want to catch a
               Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out
               where he is -- lay down the scent --
               and sooner or later he'll walk right
               into the trap.
               
                         PETER
               What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's
               an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
               
                         ANDY
               Well then, you just gotta find out
               where he is -- and once you're sure
               where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
               
     A beat.  They stare at each other.  Andy walks to the door and
     leaves.
               
               
     EXT.  PETER'S HOTEL ROOM, BALCONY - NIGHT
     
     Peter sits outside, thinking.  Jeremy and Erica join him.
     
                         ERICA
               Hi dad.
               
     She hugs him.  He hugs her back.
     
                         ERICA
               He just got lucky tonight, that's all.
               You'll cream him next time.
               
     
                                                             64
     Peter smiles.  There is a long pause.  Peter looks at Jeremy.
     They stare at each other.
     
                         PETER
               You have something you want to say?
               
                         JEREMY
               Just thought you might want to talk.
               
                         PETER
               About what?
               
                         JEREMY
               Whatever's on your mind.
               
                         PETER
               Who says something's on my mind.
               
     Jeremy pulls out a printout of chess board with pieces in
     different positions.  He shows it to Peter.
     
                         JEREMY
               What do you see here?
               
                         PETER
                    (after a moment)
               Mate in five.
               
                         JEREMY
               Exactly... and you did this.
               
     Jeremy moves an imaginary piece.  Peter stares at the paper for
     a moment.  He can't believe he could miss such an obvious move.
     
                         JEREMY
               Is it Kathy?
               
                         ERICA
               Who's Kathy?
               
                         PETER
               No, it's not Kathy.
               
     Jeremy stares at him with a knowing expression.
     
                         PETER
               It isn't Kathy.
               
                         ERICA
               Who's Kathy?
               
                         JEREMY
               Peter, I know you better than you
               think.
               
     
                                                             65
                                             FADE TO BLACK
                                             
     Over the BLACK we hear
     
                         ERICA
               Who's Kathy??
               
               
     INT.  APARTMENT - BLACK SCREEN - NIGHT
     
     FLASH!  As we see the word IS  written in blood on a wall, we
     HEAR the SOUND of a POLAROID CAMERA pushing out the photo.
     DARKNESS
     
     FLASH!  We see a new GIRL laying in her bed, the sheet draped
     over her body, her face made up.  DARKNESS
     
     FLASH!  A CLOSE UP of the girl's ghastly face.  DARKNESS.
     
     CLOSE ON:  GLOVED HANDS as they pull a photo from the camera.
     
     
     EXT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT
     
     All the apartment LIGHTS are out.  We see SEVERAL FLASHES of
     LIGHT from an upstairs window.
     
               
     EXT.  INSTITUTE - MORNING
     
     Kathy walks up a dirt path towards the side of the building.
     She comes to a depression in the earth.  She stops, lifts her
     skirt, as she gets ready to jump over, when something catches
     her eye.
     
     HER POV:  in the soft ground she sees A perfect imprint of the
     Killer's distinctive tennis shoe_
     
     Kathy stares at it as the thought that the killer is nearby
     becomes more frightening.  She starts to back up slowly when...
     She bumps into Dr. Fulton behind her.  She SCREAMS, then turns
     around quickly.  Fulton is startled at her action.
     
                         KATHY
               Jesus, Alan, you scared the crap outta
               me.
               
     
     EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING - WIDE SHOT
     
     Several BLACK AND WHITE UNITS are in front of the building.
     Frank and Andy are off to the side talking to an ATTRACTIVE
     GIRL in her twenties.
     
     
                                                             66
                         FRANK
               If you can think of anything else give
               us a call.
               
                         GIRL
               You know, I hate to say I told you so,
               but I warned her.  Coming home at all
               hours of the night.  A young girl new
               to the city.  This neighborhood ain't
               what it used to be.
               
     A UNIFORMED OFFICER standing by a BLACK and WHITE UNIT yells
     over.
     
                         OFFICER
               Captain, you got a call!
               
               
     INT.  POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING
     
     CLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPH:  OF THE KILLER'S SHOE:  Pull back to see
     another PHOTOGRAPH just like it on the wall.
     
     A distraught Kathy sits on a chair, sipping a cup of coffee
     with both hands.  Frank and Andy stand up waiting for Nolan's
     appraisal.
     
                         NOLAN
               It's the same shoe alright.
               
                         ANDY
               Was there anyone else on the grounds?
               
                         KATHY
               A few people.
               
                         ANDY
               Did anyone stand out?
               
                         KATHY
               What do you mean, stand out?
               
                         ANDY
               Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
               
                         KATHY
               Now that you mention it there was
               somebody who looked suspicious.
               
                         ANDY
                    (excited)
               What was suspicious about him?
               
     
                                                             67
                         KATHY
               He was holding a sign that said "Serial
               Killer".
               
     Frank LAUGHS.  Andy does a slow burn, then smiles.  Through the
     GLASS WINDOW Frank sees the GIRL from the apartment walking
     down the hall.  He thinks about something for a moment, then
     springs from his seat.
     
     
     INT.  HALLWAY - MORNING
     
     Frank steps into the hall.  Andy follows.
     
                         FRANK
               Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary
               Albert just moved in.  How long ago was
               that?
               
                         GIRL
               Ten days ago.
               
                         FRANK
               Do you know how she found the
               apartment?
               
                         GIRL
               Through a rental agency.
               
                         FRANK
                    (to Andy)
               Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege
               had just moved into her place also?
               
               
     INT.  FRANK'S OFFICE  - MORNING
     
     Kathy is standing off to the side, listening to Frank and Andy
     as they both speak on the phone.
     
                         ANDY
                    (into the phone)
               Uh huh...  Thank you very much.
               
     He hangs up, looks at Frank and NODS with a grin.
     
                         FRANK
                    (into the phone)
               No, I really appreciate it.  Thanks.
                    (he hangs up)
               That's it!  All the women moved into
               their homes in the last three months
               and all of them found them through
               Homesearchers!
               
     
                                                             68
                                             
     EXT.  STREET - MORNING
     
     An UNMARKED CAR is parked down the street from HOMESEARCHERS.
     Frank and Andy get out and walk towards a building with TWO
     DETECTIVES.
     
               
     INT.  HOMESEARCHERS - MORNING
     
     A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN stands behind the counter. She stares at
     Frank with a bewildered expression.
     
                         FRANK
               Who else works here beside you?
     
                         WOMAN
               There's a girl that helps at the
               counter, part time and that's it.
               
                         FRANK
               Who else has access to these files?
               
                         WOMAN
               No one.
               
               
     INT.  PETER'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
     
     There is a KNOCK on the door.  Erica opens it to find Kathy
     outside.
     
                         KATHY
               You must be Erica.
               
                         ERICA
               Uh huh.
               
                         KATHY
               I'm Kathy.
               
     Erica grins.
     
                         KATHY
               Is your dad here?
               
                         ERICA
               He went down to the lobby for a minute.
               He should be right back.  Would you
               like come in?
               
               
     Kathy enters and sits on the couch.  Erica sits beside her and
     stares at her, evaluating her.
     
     
                                                             69
                         KATHY
               So, are you having a good time on the
               Island?
               
                         ERICA
               Not really.  It's pretty boring.
               
                         KATHY
               That's only because you don't know
               where to go.  You like hiking?
                    (Erica nods no)
               Fishing?
                    (Erica nods no)
               Sailing?
                    (Erica nods no)
               What do you like?
               
                         ERICA
               Boys.
               
     Kathy grins and they LAUGH together.
               
                         ERICA
               Do you like my dad?
               
                         KATHY
               Of course.
               
     Erica stares at her.
     
                         KATHY
                    (getting it)
               Oh... do you mean do I like, like him?
               
     Erica waits expectantly.  Kathy grins, but doesn't answer.
     
                         ERICA
                    (confidentially)
               I know he really likes you.
               
                         KATHY
               How do you know that?  Did he say
               something?
     
                         ERICA
               No... but I can tell.  A woman knows
               these things.
               
     Kathy smiles.  She looks up and sees Peter standing in the
     doorway.  There is a moment of embarrassment between them.
     
                         PETER
               Honey, why don't you run down to
               Jeremy's now.
               
     
                                                             70
                         ERICA
               Okay.
                    (to Kathy)
               Nice meeting you.
               
                         KATHY
               Nice meeting you.
               
     She walks over to Peter and gives him a kiss.
     
                         ERICA
                    (whispering)
               I like her.  She's nice.
     
     Erica leaves.  There is an uncomfortable moment between Peter
     and Kathy.  They look at each other, probing each others eyes.
     There is a KNOCK on the door.  Frank and Andy enter, their
     expressions are serious.
     
                         PETER
               Another one?
                    (Frank nods)
               What word did he leave?
               
                         FRANK
               "Is".
                    (to Kathy)
               Did you tell him about the institute?
               
               
     INT.  HOTEL BASEMENT - MORNING
     
     Peter is on the phone with the Caller.  Kathy sits beside him.
     Frank and Andy are with the Technician.
                         
                         CALLER (OS)
               Have you any idea what the message is?
               
                         PETER
               If it's so important, why don't you
               just tell me?
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               I couldn't tell you that.  It would
               ruin the game.  Not that you're playing
               it very well.
               
                         PETER
               You like to brag, don't you?
               
     
                                                             71
                         CALLER (OS)
               Credit should be given where it's due.
               I'm not worldly like you, Peter.  I'm
               not an internationally known figure.
               I'm just a poor guy who has never been
               anywhere, but I'm beating you.
               
     The Caller's statement hits home.  Slowly a look of
     determination covers Peter's face.
     
                         PETER
               So, why were you looking for Doctor
               Sheppard today?
               
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               What?
               
                         PETER
               You heard me.  Why did you go out to
               the institute looking for her?
     
                         CALLER (OS)
               What makes you think I was there?
               
                         PETER
                    (using his words)
               I couldn't tell you that.  It would
               ruin the game.
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               The game's almost over, Peter, and
               you're running out of time.
               
     Peter's face hardens, eyes intensely staring off in the
     distance.
               
                         PETER
               It's you who's running out of time.
               You're starting to make mistakes now.
               You're wondering just how much I really
               know.  Just how close I'm getting?
               Well, I'm closer than you think, pal --
               and I'm gonna nail your ass to the
               wall!
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you
               rehearse that, or was it impromptu?
                    (Peter doesn't answer)
               There's an old wooden bench in the
               garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll
               find a message for you under it.  Let's
               see if you're as clever as you think
               you are.
     
                                                             72
               
     The line goes dead.  Peter hangs up, his frustration shows.
     
     
     INT.  POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON
     
     Peter sits across the desk from Frank.  Kathy stands by the
     window.  The room is crowded with the Caller's clues.  The MAP
     with colored pins in it.  The words:  REMEMBER EVENTUALLY
     REVENGE IS...  A copy of the Caller's NOTE written on the
     blackboard.  It reads:
     
     
     
     PETER:
     
     IN A FIERCE MAGAZINE YOU WILL FIND A HINT OF MY ACTION TO COME:
     
     AS LARGE AS YOU MAYBE IN THE WORLD OF PAWNS AND CASTLES YOU ARE
     STILL LIGHT YEARS FROM REACHING ME.   INVISIBLE AS THE AIR, ONE
     HUNDRED MEN WITH THEIR DESPERATE PLEAS TO STOP, CAN'T MOVE ME
     
     
     
     Peter walks over to the BLACKBOARD and studies the note.
     
                         PETER
                    (reading)
               In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint
               of my actions to come... Why does he
               set this line apart?
               
                         KATHY
               For emphasis?
               
                         PETER
               Exactly.  It's the key.
               
                         KATHY
               But what does he mean by a fierce
               magazine?  Violent?
               
                         PETER
               A fierce magazine... brutal...
                    (thinking aloud)
               An angry magazine... A war magazine...
               a mercenary magazine...  fierce...
                    (he gets it)
               Mad.
               
                         KATHY
               What?
               
                         PETER
               Where's the note?
     
                                                             73
               
                         ANDY
               You got it on the board.
               
                         PETER
               No, I need the original note.
               
                         ANDY
               There's a photostat of the original on
               the wall.
     
     Peter gets up and takes the note off the wall and studies it
     for a moment, then starts to fold it in half.
     
                         PETER
               My daughter reads Mad Magazine all the
               time.  If you fold the back cover a
               certain way, the text reads
               differently.
               
     Peter moves the crease of the paper in and out until it forms
     the correct margin.
     
     
     The NOTE now reads:
     
     
     
     IN A FIERCE ACTION TO COME:
     
     AS LARGE AS CASTLES, YOU ARE
     STILL LIGHT AS THE AIR,
     ONE HUNDRED MEN CAN'T MOVE ME.
     
     
     
     Kathy looks at Peter, impressed.
     
                         PETER
                    (reading)
               As large as castles.  You are still
               light as air, one hundred men can't
               move me.
               
                         FRANK
               It doesn't make sense.
               
                         KATHY
               It doesn't make sense because we don't
               understand it.
               
                         ANDY
               But a hundred men could move him.
               
     
                                                             74
                         PETER
                    (losing patience)
               He's not talking about himself.
               
                         ANDY
               Then what's he talking about?
               
                         PETER
                    (on edge)
               If we knew that we'd know the answer to
               the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling
               us where he's going to kill tonight and
               we can't see it.
               
                         FRANK
               Maybe we should back up a minute and
               take a look at what we do have.  All
               the girls that have been killed have
               been killed at night.  They're all the
               same type.  All moved into their homes
               within the last three months -- and all
               of them found their homes through
               Homesearchers.
               
                         KATHY
               I thought that Homesearchers was a dead
               end?
               
                         FRANK
               It can't be a coincidence.  The woman
               that owns it has a son.  She says he's
               been on vacation in Montana for the
               last ten days.  We're trying to locate
               him.  There's also a cleaning service
               that comes in once a week.  We're
               checking that out too.
               
                         KATHY
               He moves around a lot.  Why?
               
                         ANDY
               He finds his victims through
               Homesearchers.  He goes where they are.
               
     Peter is only half-listening to the conversation.  He appears
     deep in thought.
     
                         KATHY
               But they rent lots of apartments.  He
               could probably find them all in a
               localized area.  Why move all over the
               Island?
               
     Peter slowly comes to a realization.  His eyes open wide as a
     thought crashes into his mind.
     
                                                             75
     
                         PETER
               Jesus!  It can't be that easy!
               
     Peter walks to the MAP of the victims locations on the wall.
     He moves his finger from point to point, examining each
     location.  Kathy, Frank and Andy watch him.  Peter continues to
     move his finger in various GEOMETRIC LINES across the map.
     
                         ANDY
               You want to tell us what the hell
               you're doing?
               
     Peter doesn't answer.  He stares at the MAP for a few more
     seconds, as the excitement of his realization grows.  He takes
     a step back and turns to Kathy.
     
                         PETER
               He told us and we missed it!  He said
               he's never been anywhere.  Therefore,
               this Island is the world to him.
                    (pointing to the map)
               As far as he's concerned, this is a map
               of the world.  That's why he quoted
               Huxley.  "The chessboard is the world."
               
     Peter takes a MARKS-O-LOT off Kathy's desk and DRAWS a LARGE
     SQUARE BORDER on the MAP, OUTLINING THE GRIDS, EIGHT BY EIGHT.
     
                         PETER
               He's using the map as a chessboard!
               The sonofabitch is playing chess with
               me!!
               
                         FRANK
               How can he be playing Chess with you?
               You're not making any moves against
               him.
               
                         PETER
               Maybe I already have.
               
     Peter rushes towards the door.
               
     
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON
     
     Peter is with Kathy, Frank, Andy and David at the computer
     station.
     
                         PETER
               Can you get into the Federation
               records?
               
     
                                                             76
                         DAVID
               Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up
               with the data base in New York.
               
                         PETER
               Can we correlate data?  Look for
               specific things, like player's ages...
               stuff like that?
               
                         DAVID
               No problem.
                    (hits a few buttons)
               We're in.
               
                         PETER
               Okay.  Run a search to see if there are
               any players with a rating above two
               thousand that live on the Island.
               
     David enters the commands on the keyboard.
     
                         DAVID
               Nope.  Nothing.
               
                         PETER
               Set up some pieces on the big board?
               
                         FRANK
               I still don't see how he could be
               playing chess against you.  There's
               only enough grids on the map to be half
               a board.
               
                         PETER
               That's all he needs.  He's making the
               moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't
               remember the name.
                    (looks at the board)
               Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it,
               so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
               
     The pieces on the board move, following Peter's instructions.
     
                         PETER
               D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.
                    (he studies the board)
               It's the number two variation of the
               Tarakoss opening.
                    (thinks for a moment)
               David, can you bring up the tournament
               records for the last ten years.
               
                         DAVID
               Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds
               of thousands of games.
     
                                                             77
               
                         PETER
               We're only interested in people who
               have played against me.
               
     David enters the data.
     
                         DAVID
               Now what?
               
                         PETER
               Have computer search for anyone that's
               used that opening against me.  There
               can't be more than a handful.
               
     David enters the information and waits.
     
                         DAVID
               There's three.  The first is 1983.
               Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
               
                         PETER
               Never mind.  He died two years ago.
               
                         DAVID
               1985.  Hans Korshaud.
               
                         PETER
               He's in his seventies and lives in
               Holland.
               
     David presses a button and looks at the next one.  He hesitates
     and looks at Peter awkwardly.
     
                         PETER
               What is it?
               
                         DAVID
                    (a beat; hesitantly)
               New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
     
     A quiet rage spreads across Peter's face.
                    
                         PETER
               Print out the game.
               
               
     INT.  PETER'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
     
     Peter, Kathy, and  all stand around a map of the Island.  Peter
     looks at a PRINTOUT.
     
     
                                                             78
                         PETER
               He's replaying the game I played
               against him move by move, using these
               girls as the Chess pieces.
                    (Beat)
               All the girls have been found in their
               homes except Christie Eastman, who was
               found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
               
                         KATHY
                    (making the
                     connection)
               Because to follow the game he played he
               had to move to that grid?
               
                         PETER
               Right.
                    (he searches the map
                     and points to a spot)
               Here!  c-4.
               
                         FRANK
               It's a commercial area.  No one lives
               there.
               
                         PETER
               But he had to dump the body there to
               make the move.
               
                         KATHY
               Now that you know what stage of the
               game he's at, can we figure out where
               his next move is going to be?
               
     Peter walks over to the MAP and traces his finger over it, then
     looks at the computer printout.
     
                         PETER
               His last move was c1-f4.  I would move
               f8-g7.  His next move using the
               Tarakoss would be... e2-e3... that
               would be...
                    (points to a spot)
               Right here!
               
     There is a moment of silence as Kathy, Frank and Andy both
     digest what they have heard.
     
                         KATHY
               Each of those grids represents almost a
               square mile.
               
                         FRANK
               That's a big area to cover.
               
     
                                                             79
                         PETER
               Then let's narrow it down.
               
                         ANDY
                    (knowingly)
               Homesearchers.
               
               
     INT.  HOMESEARCHERS - AFTERNOON
     
     Andy stands at the desk with the WOMAN they talked to before.
     He holds out a THOMAS GUIDE and places it on the desk next to
     the computer.
     
                         WOMAN
                    (shocked)
               You want me to what?
               
                         ANDY
               I want you to feed every street in this
               grid into your computer.
               
                         WOMAN
               It'll take hours.  You can't make me do
               this.
               
                         ANDY
               You're right, I can't make you do it.
               Besides, you're probably gonna be too
               busy with the Franchise Tax Board
               anyway.
               
                         WOMAN
               What are you talking about?
               
                         ANDY
               I gotta friend over there.  He was
               telling me things are kind of slow.
               So, I figured I'd give him a call, have
               him come down here and look through
               your records.  You know, give him
               something to do.
               
                         WOMAN
               What's the first street?
               
     The CAMERA PULLS BACK through the window until we are...
               
               
     EXT.  HOMESEARCHERS - AFTERNOON
     
     Peter, Kathy and Frank stand on the sidewalk.  Peter looks at
     the NOTE and folds it to read the message.
               
     
                                                             80
                         PETER
               As large as castles, you are still
               light as the air, one hundred men can't
               move me.  It's posed as a question.
               What am I?
               
                         FRANK
               A building?
               
                         PETER
               A building isn't as light as air.
               What's large, but as light as air and
               can't be moved?
               
                         KATHY
                    (correcting him)
               As large as castles.
               
                         FRANK
               Yes.  Why not just say a building if he
               meant any general type of structure?
               
                         PETER
               He's not going to give us direct hints.
               He's going to skirt around it.
               
                         FRANK
               He uses castles...plural --  then says
               "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't
               move us.
               
     Kathy stretches her arms above her head.  Her shadow falls
     across the lawn.  Peter stares at the ground for a moment.
     
                         PETER
               A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As
               light as air , but one hundred men
               can't move it?  The shadow of the
               castle.  Are there any buildings that
               have the name Castle in it that cast a
               shadow long enough to fall across
               another building?
               
                         FRANK
               Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in
               that area called the Castle Arms.
               
                         PETER
               That's got to be it.
               
     Peter rushes inside Homesearchers.
               
               
     
                                                             81
     INT.  POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - EVENING
     
     Frank stands Andy and SIX DETECTIVES.  One of them is a WOMAN
     named JANET MCLELLAN.
     
                         FRANK
               Okay.  Homesearchers gave us the name
               Laura Owens.  She just moved into an
               apartment across the street from the
               Castle Arms one week ago.  We've moved
               her to her parents house in Seattle and
               S.P.D. is going to keep a watch on her
               tonight.
                    (pointing)
               Officer McLellan will spend the night
               at her apartment.
                    (Beat)
               Andy, you're going to go to the hotel
               and pick up Yurilivich at the
               tournament.  Stay with him until it
               ends, then follow him wherever he goes.
               If things work out right we'll wrap
               this up tonight.
               
               
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
     
     Peter walks out on stage to join Yurilivich who is already
     seated.  Peter stares at him.
     
               
     INT.  LAURA OWENS BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     Frank is standing over a bed.  Officer McLellan is under the
     covers.
     
                         FRANK
               You all set?
               
     McLellan pulls down the blanket to reveal her .38 and nods.
     
     
     INT.  LAURA OWENS KITCHEN - NIGHT
     
     Frank joins a DETECTIVE and begins to wait in the darkness.
     
     
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
     
     The game continues.  Peter makes a move.  Andy watches the game
     from the back of the room.
     
     
     
                                                             82
     EXT.  STREET - NIGHT
     
     An OUTLINE of SOMEONE walks down the street, then stops for a
     moment.  Under s STREET LAMP we see that it's a WOMAN in her
     fifties walking her dog.
     
               
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
     
     Yurilivich makes a move, then hits his timer.  Peter studies
     the board.  He looks up at Yurilivich.  Both of them stare at
     each other intensely.  Peter looks back at the board and makes
     a move.  On the BIG BOARD a PIECE MOVES, then STOPS halfway
     between a square.  A moment later the entire board breaks up
     into an unreadable mass of lines.  There's a GROAN from the
     crowd.  The President walks over to David and confers with him
     quickly, then goes to the players.
     
                         PRESIDENT
               The board's going to take several hours
               to repair.  I think we should adjourn
               until tomorrow.
               
                                             
     EXT.  SIDE OF APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
     
     The POV of someone walking slowly along the side of the
     building.
     
     
     INT.  APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     Officer McLellan stirs in bed, the tension of waiting beginning
     to take affect on her.
     
     
     EXT.  SIDE OF BUILDING - NIGHT
     
     The POV of someone looking through a bedroom window and looks
     inside.  We can see the outline of a WOMAN in bed.  Slowly the
     window is open by TWO GLOVED HANDS.
     
     
     INT.  APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     The POV climbs through the window and studies the WOMAN in bed
     for a moment.  She is on her SIDE, her back to him.  Sensing
     something the WOMAN turns over.  THE WOMAN IS NOT OFFICER
     MCLELLAN!  Her eyes widen with terror... then FLASH!  BRIGHT
     LIGHT fills the screen.
     
     
     INT.  LAURA OWENS KITCHEN - LATER - NIGHT
     
     Frank looks impatient.  He checks his watch.
     
                                                             83
     
                         FRANK
               I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
               If Yurilivich was making a move we
               would have heard something from Andy by
               now.
               
                         DETECTIVE
               You think we're in the wrong place?
               
                         FRANK
               This has to be the right place.  It all
               fits.  This is the only building that
               has the word castle in it.
               
                         DETECTIVE
               No.  There's the Castle Courts
               Apartments over on Pine Road.
               
                         FRANK
               But that's all the way across town.
               It's in another grid.
               
     Frank thinks for a moment, then checks his watch again.
     
                         FRANK
               You hold things down here.  I'm going
               to take a run over there.
               
               
     EXT.  CASTLE COURTS APARTMENTS - NIGHT
     
     A bracket-shaped, one story building in a less expensive part
     of town.  Frank drives up in his car and gets out.  He starts
     to walk towards the building.
     
     FRANK'S POV:  From a window in the back we see a series of
     FLASHES.
     
     Frank grabs his radio microphone.
     
                         FRANK
               This is Sedman.  It's going down in the
               back apartment of the Castle Courts.
               
     He runs towards the building.
     
     
     INT.  CASTLE COURTS, APARTMENT - NIGHT
     
     The front door crashes open as Frank breaks it down.  He enters
     the room, his .38 readied.  We MOVE with him as he works his
     way towards the hall.
     
     
     
                                                             84
     INT.  APARTMENT HALL - NIGHT
     
     Frank slowly moves towards the bedroom.  He stops at the door,
     takes a deep breath, then lunges in.
     
     
     INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     Frank enters.  The room is lit by moonlight.  The rear window
     is open.  On the bed is the WOMAN we saw earlier.  She is
     naked.  Her arms tied to the bed frame.  There are two deep
     GASHES in her wrists.  Blood flows from her wrists into large
     plastic bags.  Her mouth is taped.  Still conscious she
     struggles, her eyes opened wide in a horror-filled stare.
     
     On the wall behind her, written in blood is CAREFULLY.
     
     Frank runs to the window.  The b.g. we HEAR the SOUND of
     FOOTSTEPS running away.  Frank turns back towards the Woman and
     quickly moves to the bed.
     
     
     EXT.  CASTLE COURTS APARTMENTS - NIGHT
     
     BLACK and WHITE UNITS are parked in front, their lights
     flashing.  Frank looks drained as he watches an AMBULANCE pull
     away.  He walks over to Andy who is at a POLICE CAR on the
     RADIO.
     
                         ANDY
               How is she?
     
                         FRANK
               She's unconscious, but they think she's
               going to make it.
     
                         ANDY
               You alright?
               
                         FRANK
               I've seen a lot of things in my time on
               the job, but nothing like this.
               Yurilivich?
               
                         ANDY
               I was with him the whole time until I
               got the call at the hotel.
               
                         FRANK
               Sanderson?
               
     
                                                             85
                         ANDY
               I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching
               Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out
               after the match and hasn't come back
               since.
               
                         FRANK
               Find him!  I want to talk to him.
               
               
     EXT.  PUGET SOUND - NIGHT
     
     Peter sits on the beach.  He stares out over the water with a
     pained expression.  He reaches into his pocket and removes the
     ENVELOPE we saw earlier and stares at it.
     
     
     INT.  KATHY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
     
     We HEAR the DOORBELL.  Kathy glances at her watch as she walks
     across the living room to the front door.  She looks through
     the viewing-hole, then opens the door to reveal a tired-looking
     Peter on the doorstep.
     
                         KATHY
               Hi.
               
                         PETER
               Can I come in?
               
     Kathy thinks about it for a moment,then opens the door wider,
     signaling for him to come in.  Kathy sits down on the arm-rest
     of a chair, Peter stands.  A beat.
     
                         PETER
               The other night -- I said some things
               that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean,
               you haven't known me very long and I
               can see how you thought what you did.
               
                         KATHY
               I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
               
                         PETER
               I was thinking that... maybe when this
               is all over we could...
               
                         KATHY
               I want someone I can get close to. I
               don't know if that's possible with you.
               
                         PETER
               You really haven't seen my best side.
               
     
                                                             86
                         KATHY
               Peter...
               
                         PETER
               No, listen.  You have no idea of the
               kind of pressure I'm under right now.
               
                         KATHY
               That's still no excuse.  You treat
               everything like a game.
               
                         PETER
               I can't think any more, unless it's
               about you.  I'll be in the middle of a
               match and instead of thinking about my
               next move, I think about how you look
               when you smile.
                    (Beat)
               Remember how you said that I hide
               behind my chessboard?  Ever since my
               wife died I've been...
                    (this isn't easy)
               I've been afraid of getting too close
               to someone again -- afraid of losing
               them.
               
                         KATHY
               You're wife died.  You can't feel
               responsible for that.
               
                         PETER
               You don't understand.
               
                         KATHY
               Then help me to understand.  I want to
               understand.
               
                         PETER
               It's not that easy.
               
                         KATHY
               Of course it isn't.  It's always
               difficult when someone you love dies.
               But you can't feel responsible because
               she had a car accident.
                         
                         PETER
               But I do.
               
                         KATHY
               Why?
               
                         PETER
               Because she killed herself!!
     
                                                             87
                    (softer)
               She killed herself.
                    (Beat)
               She drove her car over that cliff!
                    (Beat)
               Oh, the police said it was an accident
               -- but I knew.  I've always known.  I
               closed myself off to her and after I
               found the letter I closed myself off to
               everything else.  Beating Yurilivich
               and playing for the title was all I
               could think about -- but I snapped.  I
               had a breakdown in the middle of the
               match.  I don't remember too much about
               it.
               
     He removes the envelope from his pocket.
     
                         PETER
               This letter.  I've never opened it.
               
                         KATHY
               Why not?
               
                         PETER
               Because I know what it says.
               
                         KATHY
               Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
               
     A beat.  Peter walks to the couch and sits down.  He stares at
     the envelope, then starts to open it.  He stops and looks up at
     Kathy who nods her head.  Kathy starts to leave
     
                         PETER
               Will you stay with me?
               
     Kathy sits beside him.  He opens the envelope and starts to
     read.
     
                         WOMAN'S VOICE
               Peter.  There are many pains we feel in
               this world -- but loving someone who
               has shut you out of his life has to be
               the most unbearable of them all.  I
               knew when we married that you were a
               man consumed with ambition, but
               somewhere along the way, your
               chessboard became your wife, and I
               became your mistress.
     
                                                             88
                    (Beat)
               I know now that you cannot change,
               cannot give me the things I need.  You
               may think that I'm a coward for what I
               am about to do, but it is my choice.
               My release.  I only ask that you shield
               Erica from the truth, and that you
               forgive me for being so weak.
               Jennifer.
               
     His eyes fill with tears.  The guilt he has carried for so long
     is released.  Kathy puts her arm around him.  He turns to her
     and rests his head on her shoulder.

     REPORTERS stand outside the police station.  We see Kathy
     walking down the steps.  PULL BACK to reveal we are in...
     
     
     INT.  PETER'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
     
     Jeremy is watching the TV.  He does not notice the door open
     behind and Peter enter.
     
                         REPORTER
               Doctor Sheppard, what goes on in the
               mind of someone like this?
               
                         KATHY
               That's a very difficult question to
               answer.
               
                         REPORTER
               Is there a usual scenario?
                                             
                         KATHY
               Well -- yes... usually we find they've
               had a traumatic childhood.  He was
               probably abused by a dominant female
               figure.  That, coupled with the fact
               that these girls have not been raped
               leads me to believe that he is either
               impudent or a latent homosexual.
               Regardless, he's acting out some type
               of revenge fantasy that fulfills some
               sick sexual needs.
     
     Jeremy notices Peter.  He turns off the TV.
               
                         PETER
               Hi.  Where's, Erica?
     
     
                                                             89
                         JEREMY
               She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did
               they get him?
               
                         PETER
               No.
               
                         JEREMY
               Feel like practicing?
               
                         PETER
               Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
               
               
     INT.  BASEMENT - MORNING
               
     Peter enters the room to find Frank and Andy staring at him
     angrily.
     
                         FRANK
               Where were you last night?
               
                         PETER
               Are we going to go through this again?
               
                         FRANK
               Answer the question.
               
                         PETER
               I went out.
               
                         ANDY
               Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
               
                         KATHY (OS)
               He was with me?
               
     Kathy is standing in the doorway.  Frank and Andy look at her
     as she enters.
     
                         FRANK
               What time did he get there?
               
                         KATHY
               About a quarter to one.
               
                         ANDY
               We're interested in where you were from
               the time you left the auditorium until
               you got there.
               
                         PETER
               I was at the beach.
               
     
                                                             90
                         ANDY
               You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
               
                         PETER
               I'm positive.
               
                         ANDY
               You're a lying bastard!
               
                         PETER
               Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam
               accusations!  If you want to arrest me
               go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
               
                         ANDY
               It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick,
               fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's
               two of you involved, or what -- but
               we're going to find out.  Last night
               you gave us just enough to send us to
               the wrong place.  It must've shocked
               the hell out to you when Frank walked
               in on Pine Road and you couldn't
               finish.
               
     Peter starts to walk away.
     
                         PETER
               I'm not going to listen to this.
               
     Andy grabs him forcefully.
     
                         ANDY
               Yes you are.
               
                         PETER
                    (pushing him)
               Get off me!
               
     Andy explodes.  He pushes Peter backward into a GLASS FIRE
     EXTINGUISHER CASE.  It breaks as Peter's HAND SMASHES THROUGH
     THE GLASS.  Peter raises his hand.  Blood pours out from a cut
     on his wrist.  Anger floods across his face.  He raises his
     hand to hit Andy.  Andy quickly pulls out his gun and points it
     at Peter's head.
     
                         ANDY
               Go ahead.  Do it.
               
     A beat.  Peter stares at him.  Slowly a crazed grin spreads
     across his face.  He moves closer, pressing his forehead
     against the barrel of the gun, his eyes locked on Andy's.
               
     
                                                             91
                         PETER
               You want to shoot me?  Go ahead.  Shoot
               me!
               
     Peter and Andy lock eyes.  Everyone in the room is stunned by
     Peter's action.  The tension is broken as the phone RINGS.
     Peter and Andy continue to stare at each other.  Slowly, Andy
     backs off.  Peter doesn't move.  The PHONE continues to RING.
     
                         FRANK
               You going to answer that?
               
     A beat.  The PHONE continues to RING.  Peter stares at Andy.
     
                         KATHY
               Peter.  Please.
               
     Peter walks to the phone and answers it.  Kathy wraps a towel
     around his hand to stop the bleeding.
     
                         PETER
               Hello.
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               Last night was very exciting, wasn't
               it?  Have you figured out what I'm
               doing?
               
                         PETER
               You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               Very good.
               
                         PETER
               You're next move should have been e2-
               e3.
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               I used a variation.  You should have
               anticipated that.  Have you figured out
               the message?
               
                         PETER
               What word did you leave last night?
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               The police haven't told you?
               
                         PETER
               They think that you and I are doing
               this together.
               
     
                                                             92
                         CALLER (OS)
                    (a pause)
               Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought
               of that.  If you think about how Anton
               Berger plays chess you might get it.
               
                         PETER
               I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean
               anything.  Remember eventually revenge-
               -
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               --you're hopeless!  You can't even read
               a sentence!  Didn't they teach you
               punctuation in school?  The game ends
               tonight!
               
     The line goes dead.
     
     
     INT.  POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON
     
     Kathy sits with Frank at the table. Andy paces.  Frank and
     Kathy look at the PHOTOGRAPHS of MESSAGE-WORDS on the wall.
     
                         KATHY
               Remember eventually revenge is
               carefully...  Have you tired
               juxtaposing the words?
               
                         ANDY
               Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend
               any more time on this crap, are we?  It
               doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
     
                         KATHY
               It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in
               on this in the beginning because you
               wanted my opinion if he was capable of
               doing this.
               
                         ANDY
               Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy.
               You've lost your perspective.  You
               can't possibly be unbiased.
               
                         FRANK
               He's right, Kathy.
               
                         KATHY
               What are you saying?  That I'm seeing
               what I want to see?  That I'm
               protecting a murderer?  What?
               
     
                                                             93
                         FRANK
               We can't rely on your judgement
               anymore.
               
                         KATHY
               What does that mean?
               
                         ANDY
               It means you're off the case.
               
     Kathy looks at Frank.
               
                         FRANK
               I'm afraid I have no choice.  I can't
               run the risk of compromising what
               little we do know and the future
               actions of this department by sharing
               knowledge with someone who is
               emotionally involved with the prime
               suspect.
               
     Kathy stands up and stares at Frank angrily.
               
                         KATHY
                    (pointing to Andy)
               And what if he's wrong.  If you were
               one hundred percent sure it was Peter
               you would've arrested him.  If it is
               someone else then he's going to kill
               again tonight and you're sitting here
               ignoring the message.
               
                         FRANK
               We're going to work on the message.
               
                         KATHY
                    (angry)
               This stinks!  You want to know what I
               think?  I think there have been five
               murders and you've got shit to go on.
               You need to blame someone and he's the
               easiest choice.
               
                         FRANK
               The most logical choice.
               
                         KATHY
               You don't have a shred of evidence!
               
                         ANDY
               We'll find the evidence.
               
                         KATHY
               You couldn't find your dick in a wind
               storm!
     
                                                             94
               
     Kathy storms out of the room.
     
     
     INT.  JEREMY'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
     
     Peter enters.
     
                         PETER
               Jeremy?
               
     
     INT.  HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON
     
     Peter walks through the room.  He bumps into Lutz.
     
                         PETER
               Have you seen Jeremy today?
               
                         LUTZ
               No.
               
                         PETER
               If you do will you tell him I'm looking
               for him?
     
     
     INT.  KATHY'S HOUSE - EVENING
     
     Peter is sitting on the couch writing on a piece of paper.
     Kathy walks over holding two cups of COFFEE.
     
                         PETER
               If we could just figure out what the
               next word is going to be.  He said the
               game's going to end tonight so there's
               only going to be one more word.
               
                         KATHY
               It could be anything.
               
                         PETER
               It's got to be grammatically correct.
                         
     Peter gets up and starts pacing.
     
                         PETER
               Remember eventually revenge is
               carefully... carefully what?
               
     Kathy looks at Peter with a stunned expression.
     
                         PETER
               What?
               
     
                                                             95
                         KATHY
               How did you know it was "carefully"?
               
                         PETER
               Frank told me.
               
                         KATHY
               No he didn't.
               
     A beat.  Peter stares at her for a moment.
     
                         PETER
               You're right.  The killer told me.
               
                         KATHY
               He didn't tell you either.
               
     A beat.  Their eyes lock.
     
                         PETER
               Yes, he did.  He said, "think about how
               Anton Berger plays chess".  Anton
               Berger wrote one of the most famous
               books on chess called "Principals and
               Tactics".  Every beginning player reads
               it.  The first chapter is his three
               rules to good play:  Carefully.
               Carefully.  Carefully.
               
     Peter looks at her, studying her for a reaction.
     
                         PETER
               This isn't going to be like the phone
               book, is it?
               
                         KATHY
                    (weakly)
               Of course not.
               
     A beat.  Kathy checks her watch.
     
                         KATHY
               You're going to be late for your match.
               
                         PETER
               Are you going to come tonight?
               
                         KATHY
               Yeah.  I'll be there later.
               
     Peter walks over to her and kisses her good-bye.  Kathy forces
     a smile.  Peter walks to the door, opens it, then looks back at
     her, then leavess.  Kathy stares at the door, her mind racing.
     She starts to pace as she thinks, then walks to her phone book
     and looks up a number.  She dials and waits as it rings.

                         KATHY
               Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I
               was wondering if you could tell me if
               you have a book on chess called
               "Principals and Tactics" by Anton
               Berger.
               
                         WOMAN'S VOICE
               I can check and call you back.
               
                         KATHY
               Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
               
                         WOMAN'S VOICE
               We'll call you back.
               
     Kathy hangs up.  There is a KNOCK on the door.  She walks
     towards it.
     
                         KATHY
               Yes?
               
                         MAN'S VOICE (OS)
               It's me.  I forgot something.
               
     Kathy hesitates a moment, then opens the door.  Terror fills
     her face.
     
     HER POV:  A man wearing a black RAIN COAT stands outside.  His
     face is covered by a porcelain MASK.  FLASH!  A bright light
     goes off.  Kathy is blinded.
     
     The Man lunges inside, pushing Kathy to the floor.  He enters
     and SLAMS the door shut.  Kathy gets up and starts to run
     towards the back of the house.  The MAN tackles her to the
     ground.  Kathy kicks her way free.  She crawls backwards,
     pushing herself back with her legs.  The MAN crawls after her
     groping for her legs with his GLOVED HANDS.  He grabs her
     ankle, then sits on top of her, pinning her to the ground.  HE
     SPEAKS IN A WHISPER.
     
                         MAN
               You shouldn't have said those things
               about me today.  You have no idea what
               I am.
               
     He raises a STILETTO.  CLICK!  The BLADE just out.  He holds it
     before her eyes.
     
     KATHY'S POV:  There is a DEEP CUT on his wrist.
     
     
                                                             97
                         KATHY
               Peter...
               
                         MAN
               Peter, isn't here anymore.
               
     The PHONE RINGS.  The MAN snaps his head towards the sound.
     Kathy quickly pushes him backwards and rolls over.  The Man
     falls backwards.  Kathy gets up and runs to the front door,
     SCREAMING.
     
     
     EXT.  KATHY'S HOUSE - EVENING
     
     Kathy runs out into the street, SCREAMING for help.  She runs
     across the street and BANGS on the front door.
     
     
     EXT.  KATHY'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
     
     It has begun to RAIN lightly as Kathy sits in the passenger
     seat of a PATROL CAR.  Frank and Andy are with her.
               
                         FRANK
               Did you see his face?
               
                         KATHY
               No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw
               the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
               
                         FRANK
               I can't arrest someone for having a cut
               on their wrist.  Do you have someone
               you can stay with tonight?
                         
                         KATHY
               I've got a room at the institute I use
               when I stay late.
               
                         FRANK
               Okay.  Why don't you go out there.
               We'll check in with you later.
               
               
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
     
     Peter walks out on stage and sits across from Yurilivich.  He
     sits down and makes a move, then looks out into the audience.
     
     PETER'S POV:  The place where Jeremy usually sits is empty.
     
     
     
                                                             98
     INT.  POLICE CAR - NIGHT
     
     Andy drives.  Frank sits in the passenger seat.  A VOICE
     crackles over the radio.
     
                         MAN'S VOICE (OS)
               King base one.  This is King fifteen.
               
                         FRANK
               This is Sedman.
               
                         MAN'S VOICE (OS)
               Captain, this is Harton.  I'm out at
               Hollow Bluffs.  I think you should get
               out here.
               
                         FRANK
               It better be important.
               
               
     EXT.  HOLLOW BLUFFS - NIGHT
     
     A PATROL CAR is parked at the base of a CLIFF.  OFFICER HARTON
     is standing by it on the RADIO.  In the light from the HEAD
     LIGHTS we can see the body of JEREMY laying on the rocks, his
     WHEELCHAIR in the b.g.
     
                         OFFICER HARTON
               It is, sir.
               
               
     EXT.  HOLLOW BLUFFS - LATER - NIGHT
     
     Frank and Andy study Jeremy's battered body.  Frank looks
     through Jeremy's jacket and removes a NOTE.  He reads it, then
     looks up at Andy.
     
                         FRANK
                    (reading)
               "Peter, I'm sorry but I just can't do
               it anymore".
               
     They stare at each other.  OFFICER HARTON walks over holding
     something.
     
                         OFFICER HARTON
               I found this over by the wheelchair.
               
     Frank takes it and looks at it.
     
                         ANDY
               What is it?
               
                         FRANK
               It's a voice modulator.
     
                                                             99
               
                         ANDY
               He was never there when the calls came
               in.  He was covering for Sanderson the
               whole time.
               
               
     INT.  POLICE CAR - NIGHT
     
     Frank and Andy drive back towards town.  Frank is on the RADIO.
     
                         FRANK
               I want you to find Judge Meyerson and
               have a search warrant for Peter
               Sanderson by the time I get back to
               town.
               
               
     INT.  DOCTOR FULTON'S OFFICE - NIGHT
     
     Doctor Fulton is at his desk working on a computer.  Kathy
     enters.  She looks tired.
     
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               What are you doing here?
               
     Kathy doesn't answer.  She walks wearily into the room.
     
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               Kathy, what is it?
               
     She is on the verge of tears.
     
                         KATHY
               I've been such an idiot!
               
     Doctor Fulton walks over to her.  Tears flow down her cheeks.
     He hugs her and she falls into his arms weeping.
     
     
     EXT.  PETER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Frank and Andy walk towards the door with a HOTEL EMPLOYEE.
     Frank KNOCKS, waits a moment, then motions for the Employee to
     open the door.
     
     
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
     
     Peter and Yurilivich continue their match.  Peter looks
     confidant.
     
     
     
                                                             100
     INT.  PETER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Frank looks through the desk.  We HEAR Andy call from another
     room.
     
                         ANDY (OS)
               Frank, c'mere.
               
               
     INT.  PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     Frank enters and joins Andy at the nightstand.  Andy points to
     a DRAWER that he's pulled out.
     
                         ANDY
               Take a look under here.
               
     Frank looks under the drawers, then at Andy.  He removes
     several POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS taped to the bottom.  He looks
     through them.
     
     CLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPHS:  Each one shows a different girl, her
     face filled with terror.
     
     
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
     
     The match continues.  Peter makes another move.  Yurilivich
     looks nervous as he studies his position.  In the back of the
     room the doors crash open as Frank and Andy barge into the
     room.  Peter watches them from the stage as they approach.
     They walk up the steps and stop before him.
     
                         ANDY
               Peter Sanderson.  You're under arrest.
               
     Peter bolts up from his seat.
     
                         PETER
               This is...
               
     Before he can finish Andy grabs him and SLAMS him down onto the
     chessboard.  He removes his HANDCUFFS.
     
                         ANDY
                    (cuffing him)
               You have the right to remain silent.
               If you give up that right anything you
               say can and will be used against you in
               a court of law... (Con't)
               
     Andy snaps the cuffs on tightly and jerks Peter upright, then
     pushes him off the stage.  Andy continues reading Peter his
     rights as he pushes him down the aisle towards the doors.
     
     
                                                             101
     
     INT.  DOCTOR FULTON'S OFFICE - NIGHT
     
     Kathy sits by the window.  LIGHTNING lights up the night sky.
     She sips a cup of coffee.  Doctor Fulton stands behind her.
     
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               Feeling better?
     
                         KATHY
               I just can't believe it.
               
                         DOCTOR FULTON
               You don't want to believe it.  It's a
               normal reaction.
               
                         KATHY
               How come the police never had a record
               of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come
               out of nowhere, there has to be a
               history.

     Peter is sitting on a chair, his hands cuffed.  He looks
     stunned.  Frank and Andy sit before him.
     
                         PETER
               Jeremy would have never killed himself.
               
                         FRANK
               Maybe he just got tired of covering for
               you.
               
                         PETER
               This is insane!  Can't you see what's
               going on.  The killer wants me out of
               the way.  He's setting me up.
               
                         ANDY
               You set yourself up tonight when you
               attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
               
                         PETER
               What?

               called you earlier about a book.

               Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you

               Could you please do me a big favor?  In
               the first chapter the author mentions
               his three rules of chess.  Could you
               look and tell me what they are?

               Of course.

               Yes, here it is.
                    (a little laugh)
               Why, they're all the same?

     We HEAR the CALLER'S distorted VOICE.
     
                         CALLER (OS)
               Hello, Peter.
               
                         PETER
               You sonofabitch!

               Emotional?  I expected more from you.
               
                         PETER
               If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the
               police will know I'm innocent.
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               By that time the game will be over.
               
                         PETER
               I've figured out the message.
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               No you haven't.  And even if you had it
               doesn't matter.  Who would you tell?
               The police don't believe you, and
               you've just used your only phone call.
               
     We HEAR the Caller LAUGH, then the line goes dead.  Peter turns
     his attention to the WORDS.  He springs from his seat.
     
                         PETER
               Alright, Peter, think.  The game ends
               tonight.  He'll leave one more word.
               Remember eventually revenge is

               You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
               
                         KATHY
               He already did once.

               Yeah -- that's what we've always
               thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What
               if I had nothing to do with the reason
               he came here?
               
                         DOCTOR FULTON

                         KATHY
               What if he came here because he's a

     Peter walks to the PHOTOGRAPH of the word REMEMBER.  He points
     to a smudge after the word.

               Period!  That's what he meant about

               Okay.  Remember is a separate sentence.
               They key is in the long sentence
               Everything with him has been word
               games.

     message like a chessboard, calculating, evaluating.

     INT.  POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Peter erases the word "PLANNED"  and adds "ARRANGED" at the
     bottom.  He studies it for a moment, then closes his eyes.  He
     turns around and takes a few steps, then stops dead in his
     tracks.  His eyes open wide as a thought crashes into his mind.
     He turns around and stares at the board confirming what he
     already knows.
     
                         PETER
               Oh my God!
               
     Frank and Andy walk into the room.  Peter is on the verge of
     being hysterical.
     
                         PETER
               The message!  I figured out--
               
                         ANDY
               Sit down!
               
     Andy moves towards Peter and grabs him.  Peter plows into him,
     slamming his full body weight him.
     
                         PETER
               He's going to kill my daughter!!
               
     Peter gets the blackboard and erases all of the letters but the
     first one of each word.  It now spells:
     
     
                           E

               games.  I'm not sending a car.
               
     Something in Peter snaps.  Rage fills him as he crashes his
     body into Frank's, then quickly strips Frank's pistol out of
     his belt.  He holds it out in his handcuffed hands, pointing at
     Harton before he can even get up from his seat.
     
                         PETER
               Get up!  Real slow and put your hands
               on the desk.

                    (to Frank)
               Drop the keys to the cuffs on the
               ground and kick them over to me.
               
     Frank drops the keys and kicks them over.  Peter bends down,
     his eyes on Frank and Harton.  Slowly he removes the cuffs.
     
                         PETER
               Alright!  Let's move down the hall.
     
                                                             109
                    
     WE MOVE down the hall with them.  Peter motions for them to go
     inside the Conference room.  They do.  Peter closes the door
     and LOCKS it from the outside.  As Peter runs out of the
     station the PHONE starts to RING.
     
     
     INT.  DOCTOR FULTON'S OFFICE - NIGHT
     
     She is at her desk, on the PHONE, listening as it RINGS.
     
     
     EXT.  POLICE STATION - NIGHT
     
     Peter runs out and gets into  Frank's car.  He drives.
     
     
     INT.  PETER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     The CAMERA MOVES IN towards a WINDOW on the other side of the
     DARKENED ROOM.  Suddenly, a GLOVED HAND smashes through the
     GLASS and reaches inside.  At the same time a CLAP of THUNDER
     booms overhead, covering most of the noise.
     
     
     INT.  ERICA'S BEDROOM  - NIGHT
     
     Erica is watching TV. She gets up, thinking she has heard
     something.
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL ROOM, HALLWAY - NIGHT
     
     Erica enters the DARK ROOM and cautiously walks over to the
     LIGHT SWITCH located next to a DOOR that leads to the living
     room.  She is just about to turn the SWITCH when... There is a
     LONG FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  Suddenly, her expression turns to one
     of horror as she sees something in the next room.
     
     ERICA'S POV:  On the other side of the LIVING ROOM is a LARGE
     MIRROR.  The LIGHTNING LIGHTS the room well enough for her to
     see A MAN'S SILHOUETTE in the MIRROR.  He is standing on the
     other side of the doorway, his back pressed up against the
     wall, waiting for her to enter the room.
     
     INSERT LIGHT SWITCH:  Erica slowly starts to move her hand away
     from the SWITCH when a HAND GRABS her firmly by the WRIST.
     
     ON ERICA:  She is startled, but quickly relaxes as she looks up
     at someone.
     
                         ERICA
               Boy!  You scared me.
               
     There is a KNOCK at the door.
     
                                                             110
               
               
     EXT.  HOTEL, PARKING LOT - NIGHT
     
     Peter pulls his car in and skids to stop.  As he gets out he
     sees Andy's car parked close by.  He runs towards the building.
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT
     
     Peter rushes frantically towards room.
     
     
     INT.  PETER'S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
     
     Peter rushes inside and runs across the room.
     
                         PETER
               Erica!  Erica!
               
               
     INT.  HOTEL ROOM, HALLWAY - NIGHT
     
     Peter runs towards Erica's room.  A NOTE is taped to her door.
     It reads: CHECK!
     
     
     EXT.  HOTEL - NIGHT - WIDE SHOT
     
     Lightning lights up the sky.  Before the THUNDER comes we HEAR
     Peter's frantic cry.
     
                         PETER (VO)
               No!!!
               
               
     EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT
     
     We see Kathy through the windshield as she drives through the
     storm.
     
     
     INT.  PETER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Peter sits by the phone in the dark.  He stares at the PHONE
     almost willing it to ring.  In a FLASH OF LIGHTNING he sees a
     pool of blood flowing out under the closet door.  Slowly Peter
     walks towards the door, he reaches to open it, then hesitates,
     afraid of what might be behind the door.  He takes a deep
     breath, then opens it quickly.
     
     PETER'S POV:  A FLASH OF LIGHTNING highlights Andy's lifeless
     body as it falls out of the closet.
     
     Peter is startled as he backs away from the body.
     
                                                             111
               
               
     INT.  POLICE STATION, FRONT DESK - NIGHT
     
     Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS enter and notice that no one is at the
     desk.  In the b.g. they HEAR someone POUNDING on a door.
     
     
     EXT.  POLICE STATION - NIGHT
     
     The RAIN falls in sheets.  Frank runs out and gets into a
     patrol car and drives off.
               
               
     INT.  PETER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     The PHONE RINGS.  Peter runs to the cordless phone and lifts it
     up.
     
                         PETER
               Yes?
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               Congratulations on your daring escape.
               You just missed me by a few seconds.
                    (Beat)
               It's check, Peter.
               
                         PETER
               Let me speak to my daughter.
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               She's in the other room.  I just wanted
               you to know she wasn't dead... yet.
               But it's time for her to die now.
               
                         PETER
               Please... wait.
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               The game's over.  You lost.
               
                         PETER
               It's me you want.  Not her.
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her
               I want.  Killing you would be easy.
               Living with the consequences of losing
               will be much more of a defeat.
               
     Peter HEARS a faint RATTLING SOUND in the background.
     
                                                             112
                         
                         PETER
               That wouldn't be very sporting.
               Remember Huxley?  "His play is always
               fair and just."
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               You're groping.  I have been fair.
               It's my move now.
               
                         PETER
               I'll give you anything you want.
               Anything!  Please!
               
                         CALLER (OS)
               Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I
               can't win unless she dies.
               
     Peter hears the SOUND again.
     
                         CALLER (OS)
               I was thinking about leaving the phone
               line open so you could hear her die --
               but I've decided it's better if you
               don't know exactly when I kill her.
               Good-bye Peter.
               
                         PETER
               No!  Wait!!
               
     The line goes dead.  Peter's mind races.
     
                         PETER
               A few seconds!  Where could he have
               gone in a few seconds?  Think!  Think,
               Goddamit!
     
     He looks towards the window.
     
     PETER'S POV:  of the wind blowing through the trees outside.
     
     Peter's face floods with realization.
     
                         PETER
               Steam pipes!
               
     Peter dials a THREE DIGIT number on the phone.
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT
     
     The MAN wearing a black rain-coat walks across the room towards
     an alcove.  The door to the alcove is OPEN and we see Erica who
     is tied to a chair and gagged.  WATER FLOODS in through cracks
     in the foundation flooding the room.
     
                                                             113
     
     THE PHONE RINGS.  He stops, startled by the sound, his head
     snapping towards the phone.  The MAN is stunned.  His mind
     races.  He thinks for a moment.  He walks back to the phone and
     slowly lifts the receiver.
     
                         PETER (OS)
               I know where you are.
     
                         CALLER
               Very good.  How did you know?
               
                         PETER (VO)
               The pipes.
     
     The MAN looks at the PIPES.  They RATTLE.  The realization of
     his mistake dawns on him.
     
                         CALLER
               Excellent.  It doesn't matter.  You
               still lose.  She'll still be dead
               before you can get down here.
               
     The MAN slams down the receiver. CLICK!  The blade snaps out of
     the STILETTO.  He walks quickly back towards the alcove, the
     KNIFE  clutched tightly in his hand.  He stops for a moment at
     the door, as he prepares for the act ahead.
     
     Erica stares at him as he approaches with wide-eyed terror!
     The MAN moves towards her then stops, sensing something is
     wrong.
     
     The door slowly CLOSES revealing Peter standing behind it,
     Frank's gun aimed at him in one hand, the CORDLESS PHONE in the
     other.
     
                         PETER
                    (dryly)
               Checkmate!
               
     Peter turns on the LIGHTS.  The MAN turns around.  It is David,
     the computer technician.  He slowly brings the KNIFE to his
     side, hiding it behind his leg.
     
                         CALLER
               How'd you know I wouldn't be in the
               same room with her?
               
                         PETER
               You told me.  When you called you said
               she was in the other room.  Drop the
               knife.
               
     The Caller shrugs his shoulder, then drops it.  They stare at
     each other.  David takes a little step closer.
     
                                                             114
     
                         PETER
               Computers.  That's how you got into
               Homesearchers records.  You can get
               into anything.  But why?  Why?
               
                         DAVID
               You still haven't figured it out, have
               you?   You think that I've put you
               through an ordeal.  My scars run so
               much deeper than yours.
                         
                         PETER
               What scars?
               
                         DAVID
                    (moving closer)
               The scars on your chest.  From where I
               stabbed you with my fountain pen.
               
     Shock pours over Peter's face as his mind drifts back to a
     tournament twenty years ago.
     
                         PETER
               We were only children.
               
     David lunges at Peter.  Peter raises the gun.  Too late!  David
     is too close.  He pushes Peter's hand away.  They struggle over
     the gun.
     
     
     INT.  PETER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Kathy enters and starts to move down the hall.
     
                         KATHY
               Erica!
     
               
     EXT.  HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT
     
     Kathy runs outside.
     
                         
     INT.  HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT
     
     The struggle continues.  David butts his head into Peter's
     nose, then slams him into the wall again.  THE GUN FIRES into
     the air.  At the same moment a CLAP OF THUNDER BOOMS overhead.
     
     
     EXT.  HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT
     
     Kathy does not HEAR the SHOT.  In the b.g. we see Frank running
     towards her.
     
                                                             115
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT
     
     David repeatedly smashes Peter's hand into the wall.  THE GUN
     FIRES INTO THE AIR SEVERAL TIMES.  A bullet hits an over head
     PIPE.  STEAM FLOODS the room.
     
     
     EXT.  HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT
     
     Frank hears the shots and runs towards the SOUND.
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT
     
     David smashes Peter's hand into the wall until the gun falls to
     the ground, disappearing under the water.  He grabs Peter,
     lifting him into the air, displaying brute strength, his rage
     is unleashed.  He slams Peter's back into the wall, knocking
     the wind out of him.
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL UTILITY CORRIDOR - NIGHT
     
     Frank races through the hallway.
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT
     
     The fight continues.  STEAM SWIRLS through the room.  David
     slams his elbow into Peter's face.  Blood pours out of Peter's
     nose.  David raises his knee, kicking Peter in the stomach.
     Peter doubles over.  David picks up a lamp off the desk and
     smashes it over Peter's head.  Peter drops to the ground.
     David picks up his knife and walks over to Peter, then lifts
     his head out of the water.
     
                         DAVID
               They took everything from me -- because
               of you --  and now I'm going to take
               everything from you.
               
     David opens the door to the alcove, then walks back to Peter.
     He bends down and presses the BLADE to Peter's neck.  For a
     moment we sense he is going to kill Peter, then, he grabs him
     by the hair, lifting his head up so he can see.
     
     PETER'S POV:  Erica is sitting in the alcove, tied to the
     chair.
     
     Peter is only semi-conscious.  David starts to leave.  David is
     just about at the alcove door when Frank enters the room, his
     weapon drawn.  Then looks at Peter, then David.
     
     
                                                             116
                         DAVID
                    (moving towards Frank)
               Thank God you're here.  I heard Erica
               scream and came in to see what was
               going on.  Mister Sanderson was going
               to stab her.
                    (holds up the knife)
               With this.
     
     Frank looks at the knife.
     
     FRANK'S POV:  There is a DEEP CUT on David's wrist, exactly
     like Peter's.
     
     Frank's face registers the cut.  David notes it.  Before Frank
     can even look at him, David thrusts the blade into his stomach.
     The force drives Frank back against the wall.  His gun drops
     from his hand as Frank slides to the floor.
     
     Peter tries to grab David's leg as he heads towards the alcove.
     Frank pulls up his pant leg revealing his backup gun.  He tries
     to reach for it.
     
     
     INT.  HOTEL BASEMENT, ALCOVE - NIGHT
     
     David enters the room.  Through the STEAM he sees Kathy trying
     to untie Erica.  David stares at them, his lips spread into
     maniacal grin.  The OVERHEAD LIGHTS FLASH on and off
     intermittently.
     
                         KATHY
               This isn't going to help, David.
               You're mother's dead.  You can't undo
               it.
     
                         DAVID
               You don't understand.
               
                         KATHY
               Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know
               what happened.
     
                         DAVID
               They took away the game because of him.
               My father left and my mother...  There
               was so much blood... It covered
               everything.
               
                         KATHY
               I know, but this isn't going to bring
               her back.
               
     
                                                             117
                         DAVID
               Don't you see?  I had to make it right.
               I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat
               with them all.  I held their hands.  I
               stroked their hair.  I was with them to
               the end.  I took away the blood.  I
               washed them.  Their crossing was
               peaceful.
               
                         KATHY
               I think your mother knows that now.
               Why don't you put the knife down.  Put
               it down, David.
               
     For a moment it appears he is thinking about it.  He lowers the
     blade, but his need to kill is to strong.  He raises it again.
     
                         DAVID
               She has to die!
               
     His face tenses.  He lunges towards Erica.
     
     BANG!  A shot tears through his chest.  The impact blows him
     off his feet.  He falls back into the murky water and
     disappears.
     
     Peter stands in the doorway, straining to stay conscious,
     Frank's GUN aimed at David.
     
     Kathy quickly finishes untying Erica.  They run to the corner
     of the room.  Kathy holds her close.
     
     Peter slowly staggers forward.  He probes the water with his
     feet, checking for David's body.  The MURKY WATER, THE STEAM
     and the BLINKING LIGHTS don't make it easy.  Peter leans over,
     pointing the gun at the ground.
     
     PETER'S POV:  The MURKY WATER.  Suddenly, a HAND streaks out of
     the water.
     
     The hand grabs Peter around the neck.  David stands up quickly.
     They struggle over the gun.  They both fall backwards into the
     water.  Peter surfaces and crawls backwards.  David stands up.
     They locks eyes.  Peter stares back with a deadly calmness.
     
                         PETER
               The game's over, asshole!
     
     David starts to lunge for him.  Peter empties the GUN into him.
     His body jerks backwards violently, smashing into the wall,
     then he slides down and dies, slowly disappearing under the
     surface of the water.
     
     
     
                                                             118
     EXT.  HOTEL GROUNDS - LATER - NIGHT
     
     BLACK and WHITE UNITS fill the area, their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.
     UNIFORMED OFFICERS hold back the CROWD of on-lookers.
     
     Peter sits off to the side.  He looks worn to the point of
     exhaustion.  A PARAMEDIC attends to the wounds on his face.
     Erica sits beside him, clinging to his arm.  TWO MEN carry a
     STRETCHER, the body on it is covered.  Peter stares at it
     blankly as it passes.
     
     Kathy is standing at the rear of an AMBULANCE.  The doors close
     and it drives off.  She walks over to Peter and Erica.
     
                         KATHY
               Frank's going to be alright.  They
               don't think any major arteries were
               severed.
               
     The information doesn't seem to register with Peter.  He
     continues to stare ahead blankly.
     
                         KATHY
               Peter, you beat him.
               
     He slowly looks over at her, but says nothing.
     
                         KATHY
               You beat him.
               
                         PETER
               I got lucky.
               
                         KATHY
               There's a girl in the hospital who is
               going to live because of you.  You made
               a difference.
               
     Peter just continues to stare at her.
     
                         KATHY
               Peter, I'm sorry I doubted you, but--
               
     Peter reaches forwards and places his fingers on her lips.
     
                         PETER
               It's over now.
               
                         KATHY
               I just wanted you to know in case you
               thought about it in the future.
               
                         PETER
               Do we have a future?
               
     
                                                             119
     A beat.  Kathy leans in a kisses him.  Erica smiles.
               
               
     INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY
     
     Yurilivich is at his seat.  The seat across the board from him
     is vacant.  THE AUDIENCE waits, silently.  THE PRESIDENT:
     Checks his watch, then gets up to address the crowd.  We HEAR
     the SOUND of DOORS opening.
     
     CHESSBOARD CLOCK:  It TICKS methodically.
     
     CLOSE ON YURILIVICH'S HAND:  his fingers taps on the table.
     
     KATHY AND ERICA:  in the audience.  Kathy checks her watch.
     She is anxious.
     
     Peter enters and limps towards the stage.  Slowly he climbs the
     steps, then sits down across from Yurilivich.  He looks out
     into the audience.
     
     Kathy smiles.  Erica nods to him.
     
     CLOSE ON PETER:  He looks at the board and makes a move, then
     hits his timer.  Slowly he looks up at Yurilivich.  A huge
     smile covers his face.
