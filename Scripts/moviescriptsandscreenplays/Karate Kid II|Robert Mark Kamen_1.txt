Karate Kid II Missing Scenes














Updated: 
              14th June 2001





 Thanks 
            to true Hero and site reader Tom Funch, 
            who gave up his time over the 2000 Xmas and New Year holiday season 
            to type in the whole of his 1st Draft of the Karate Kid II script, 
            we are exclusively able to bring you the details of sequel as it might 
            have been ...






Karate Kid II 1st Draft Script New Ongoing Series!

This 
    script version is very important because it is Robert Mark Kamen's first version 
    of the script for the sequel and is very, very different to the final movie...


As 
    soon as 1 month after the release of The Karate Kid, it had become clear to 
    the filmmakers and the studio that they had a bonefide hit. The movie would 
    go on to cross the magic $100 million mark and, as far as Hollywood was concerned, 
    was the greatest kind of mega hit --One made on a shoestring that returned 
    the same kind of ticket sales as one made for ten 
    times the cost.

    It was only natural, therefore that the producers and studio start work immediately 
    on a sequel to their 'sleeper' hit about a teenage kid and his wise, Okinawan 
    mentor.

    Robert Mark Kamen, who penned the first movie's script was immediately hired 
    to work on a sequel. When he delivered his 114 page 1st Draft, on November 
    20 1984, the producers would ask for many changes but essentially the story 
    was set.

    Now, with eternal thanks to Tom Funch, we are 
    very proud to be able to bring you a serialisation of the script to the new 
    movie, as first envisioned by it's original writer...



KK 
  II 1st Draft Script -Part One: End Of The Tournament... 

You 
  may recall that it was originally planned that the confrontation between Kreese 
  and Miyagi would take place at the end of the first film, (it was in the draft 
  scripts) but then when they saw what a great movie they had, the producers changed 
  their mind and left it for a sequel. This 1st draft of the sequel only casts 
  more doubt on this theory. Readers of the site like Chris 
  Lozano have written in noticing discrepancies with the Cobras during 
  this scene. It would be nice to know what was filmed originally, and what was 
  added later -does anyone know?

  We pick up the action as the group emerge from the Tournament building...
 
FADE 
  TO EXT: ARENA 
  Miyagi waits on the outskirts of the crowd, by the locker room door as one contestant 
  after another exits. A booing goes up from the crowd. A moment later, Kreese 
  exits, scowling, bulling his way through the gathered people, followed by his 
  team and a trail of boos and hisses. He steams past Miyagi, brushing against 
  him on purpose, catching the old man off balance. Miyagi falls to the floor. 
  Last in Kreese's line is Johnny, who stops, looks and offer Miyagi a helping 
  hand up. At that moment, Kreese turns and sees the gesture. Johnny turns and 
  sees Kreese waiting, his anger building. He looks at Miyagi and smiles, a hurting 
  smile, and runs to catch up with his group. Miyagi watches the boys go, pitying 
  them. LUCILLE and ALI exit. 

  LUCILLE 
  He come out yet? 

  MIYAGI 
  Not yet. 

  ALI 
  We're gonna go ahead and buy some things. 

  LUCILLE 
  Champagne and cheesecake. But give us a chance to get set up. 

  MIYAGI 
  Dont worry. We'll take long way home. 

  The crowd at the door begins to cheer and whistle. Ali looks over in that direction. 
  

  ALI 
  We better go. 

  Lucille and Ali take off for the parking lot. Miyagi turns his attention to 
  Daniel exiting, besieged for autographs. Daniel basks in his moment of glory, 
  signing autographs, shaking hands, taking the congratulations and adulation 
  of the crowd. After a moment, he works his way through to Miyagi. 

  DANIEL 
  Being a celebrity is hard work. 

  MIYAGI 
  Then good thing career ended. 

  DANIEL 
  Until next year. 

  Miyagi gives Daniel a stern look. 

  DANIEL 
  Just kidding. Where's Mom and Ali? 

  MIYAGI
  Oh. Went on ahead. Come, let Miyagi help. Miyagi relieves Daniel of his trophy. 
  

  MIYAGI 
  How feel? 

  DANIEL Not so hot. How do I look? 

  Miyagi looks Daniel up and down, focusing on his bruised face. 

  MIYAGI 
  Not so hot. 

  VO 
  Excuse me! 

  Daniel and Miyagi turn to an ORIENTAL MAN of about 35, WEBSTER MIYAGI and his 
  FIVE YEAR OLD SON, DEXTER, both distinctly American in dress and posture. There 
  is an uncanny resemblance to Miyagi. 

  WEBSTER 
  You were really terrific. 

  DANIEL 
  Thanks. 

  WEBSTER 
  I know you must be in a hurry and all, but would you mind? 

  He extends a program and a pen. 

  WEBSTER 
  For my kid. He's kinda shy. 

  Daniel looks down at the boy, who pushes close to his father's leg and smiles. 
  

  DANIEL 
  What's your name? 

  DEXTER (shy) 
  Dexter. 

  DANIEL 
  Dexter what? 

  DEXTER 
  Miyagi. 

  Daniel looks up at Miyagi who for some reason grows uncomfortable. 

  DANIEL 
  Miyagi? That's my teacher's name. He's from Okinawa. Where are you from? 

  DEXTER 
  Sherman Oaks. 

  Webster's curiosity is aroused. 

  WEBSTER 
  I bet we're relatives. 

  MIYAGI (uncomfortable) 
  Don't think so. 

  WEBSTER 
  I bet we are. My mom and pop told me everyone with our last name from Okinawa 
  is related. 

  Miyagi shakes his head. Daniel looks at all three Okinawans. 

  DANIEL
  You know, you do look alike. 

  MIYAGI 
  To you we all look alike. Come. Mother waiting. 

  Webster unexpectedly pulls out a camera and snaps two pictures of Miyagi. 

  WEBSTER 
  There we go. I'm gonna ask my folks to check into it. They're always in touch 
  with my Aunt who still lives on the other side. 

  MIYAGI 
  Good luck. 

  Miyagi and Daniel walk off. 

  WEBSTER 
  Where can I find you? 

  MIYAGI (over his shoulder) 

  In book. 

  Webster, a little perplexed, but unperturbed, watches Daniel and Miyagi wend 
  their way through the cars in the parking lot. 

  CUT TO: INT. PARKING LOT 
  Daniel and Miyagi walk through rows of cars. 

  DANIEL 
  How come you don't want to hear from that guy? 

  MIYAGI 
  Why say that? 

  DANIEL 
  You told him you were in the book. 

  MIYAGI 
  So? 

  DANIEL 
  You don't even have a phone. 

  VOICES coming from the other side of a black van interrupt their conversation. 
  Daniel and Miyagi stop to listen. 

  ANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF KREESE'S BLACK CUSTOMIZED COBRA VAN. 
  All the other Cobras are loaded in the van. Kreese blocks Johnny's way as he 
  attempts to enter. 

  KREESE
  Beat it. 

  JOHNNY 
  I tried, sensei. 

  KREESE 
  I had him crippled and you still couldn't beat him. 

  JOHNNY 
  It wasn't my fault. 

  Kreese, angered by the statement, grabs Johnny by the shirt front and pulls 
  him within inches of his face. Johnny trembles in fear. 

  KREESE 
  You inferring it was mine? 

  A VOICE from the side turns Kreese. 

  MIYAGI 
  Why you no pick on someone your own size? 

  KREESE 
  Mind your own business, old man. I've had enough of you. 

  MIYAGI 
  Who you calling old man, monkey face? 

  Kreese throws Johnny aside like a rag doll and rushes Miyagi, lunge punching 
  for his face. At the last moment, Miyagi side steps. Kreese's punch goes up 
  to his elbow through a car windshield Miyagi was standing in front of ripping 
  the fist to shreds. Kreese pulls his mangled hand out and looks at it, his fury 
  growing. Miyagi stands in front of a 14-foot U-Haul truck. Kreese charges again 
  with his good hand. At the last moment, Miyagi sidesteps. Kreese's fist crumbles 
  against the truck side. He screams in agony and anger. He turns to face Miyagi 
  cradling both his hands. Miyagi is right there and delivers a short undercut 
  to Kreese's stomach. Kreese doubles over. Miyagi hits him on the back of the 
  neck with an elbow. Kreese falls to his knees. Miyagi pulls his head up by the 
  hair exposing his throat. On his knees for the first time in his life, Kreese's 
  eyes flicker with fear. As Miyagi's smile dies, his eyes turn to stone. He cocks 
  his fist back slowly, still holding Kreese's throat, exposed. 

  MIYAGI 
  Mercy is for the weak! We do not train to be merciful. A man faces you he is 
  the enemy. An enemy deserves no mercy. Miyagi's fist is cocked as far as it 
  can go behind his head, his face a mask of vengeance. 

  ANGLE ON 
  The Cobra Kai students, their mouth fairly trembling with fear. 

  ANGLE ON 
  Daniel, astounded by what is happening. He cannot believe his teacher would 
  abandon what he has taught him. 

  DANIEL (whispered) 
  No! 

  ANGLE ON 
  Kreese. He looks up at Miyagi, his face rattled with fear, his eyes closed. 
  Miyagi's eyes flash. His fist cuts through the air, whistling towards Kreese's 
  unprotected head. 

  CLOSEUP 
  Kreese's face, his eyes shut tightly expecting the death blow. When it does 
  not come, he opens his eyes slowly. Miyagi's fist is less than an inch from 
  his nose, trembling with power. Miyagi's forefinger flicks out, nubbing the 
  end of Kreese's nose in the lowest form of insult. He drops Kreese's head. His 
  body slumps forward. Miyagi turns to Daniel and winks. With a wave of relief, 
  Daniel rushes into his teacher's arms. The two of them embrace. One by one, 
  the Cobra Kai students exit from the van, dropping their belts in front of the 
  still kneeling Kreese, and walking off, leaving him alone. 

  CUT TO: 

  EXT. PARKING LOT 
  Daniel and Miyagi are climbing into Miyagi's truck. 

  DANIEL 
  You could have killed him, couldn't you? 

  MIYAGI
  Sometimes living is more punishment. 

  Miyagi starts the engine and drives out of the parking lot.


So, 
    this scene seems fairly similar to the finished movie.. EXCEPT... who is this 
    WEBSTER MIYAGI????? and what part does he have to play in the story???



KK 
  II 1st Draft Script -Part Two: Graduation Day... 

In 
  the final film, Daniel mentions that Ali left him for a football star... In 
  this version we see that things were planned differently... 
 
FADE 
  TO SIX MONTHS LATER 

  EXT. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION DAY 

  All the pomp and circumstance of an outdoor graduation. The graduating class 
  sits in cap and gown listening to the graduating address. ANGLE ON Daniel, Ali, 
  and SUSAN, all sitting next to each other. Susan leans over to Ali and whispers. 
  

  SUSAN 
  Have you told him yet? 

  ALI 
  Shhhh! 

  The words produce a pained look in her eyes. At that moment, Daniel looks up 
  and smiles lovingly. She smiles back and he slips his hand into her's. They 
  both listen to the speaker. 

  SPEAKER 
  and as you leave here today, I exhort you to open yourselves to new experiences 
  so that you can grow as individuals into strong self sufficient adults. God 
  Bless you all (pause) graduates! 

  On the word, a WHOOP and hundred of mortar boards go sailing into the air. 

  EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS 
  Parents and children mingling after the graduation ceremony. Lucille and Miyagi 
  come upon Ali and Daniel. Lucille is bursting with pride and sentimental reminiscence. 
  

  LUCILLE 
  You graduated high school. I can't believe it. 

  MIYAGI 
  Me, either. 

  DANIEL 
  You didnt think I'd graduate? 

  MIYAGI 
  Didnt think you'd live to graduate. 

  Daniel looks at him sideways. 

  LUCILLE 
  Here! Congratulations. 

  She hands Daniel a small present. 

  DANIEL 
  Thanks, Mom. 

  Daniel opens it. 

  LUCILLE 
  And one for you, too, Ali. Congratulations. 

  Ali is touched. She kisses Lucille on the cheek. 

  ALI 
  Thank you. 

  She begins to open her's as well. Daniel displays his: an imitation alligator 
  skin wallet with a fifty dollar bill neatly stuck in the bill fold. 

  LUCILLE 
  I wish it could be more. 

  DANIEL 
  No. Thanks, Mom. This is great. 

  Ali's parents, MR. and MRS. MILLS, appear. Their smiles taper as they notice 
  the company present. 

  MR. MILLS 
  Here she is. 

  LUCILLE (effusive) 
  Oh, hi. 

  MRS. MILLS (reserved) 
  Hello. Congratulations, darling. 

  Ali and her mother kiss, politely. 

  DANIEL 
  Hi, Mr. Mills. 

  MR. MILLS 
  Hello, Daniel (beat) Congratulations. 

  The feeling behind the words is halfhearted. 

  DANIEL 
  Thanks. 

  MR. MILLS 
  Congratulations, darling. 

  He kisses Ali and hands her an airplane ticket envelope. She looks up at it. 
  Her face lights up. A wish come true. 

  ALI 
  Paris? 

  Her parents smile affirmatively. She hugs both of them. 

  ALI
  Oh, I can't believe it. Thank you. Thank you. I never thought. 

  Susan comes running up with the exact same envelope. 

  SUSAN 
  Ali! Ali! 

  The girls are all over each other, squealing with delight. 

  GIRLS 
  You won't believe it. A whole summer. We have a whole summer in Paris. 

  ANGLE ON 
  Daniel: he looks down at his wallet and the fifty dollar bill, suddenly not 
  so excited. 

  MR. MILLS
  Well, let's go girls. Club Luncheon starts at one, and you know how prompt they 
  are. 

  MRS. MILLS 
  Nice seeing you again. 

  LUCILLE 
  I'm sure. 

  She smiles, a smidgen of sarcasm in the corner of her mouth. 

  ALI 
  I'll see you at eight? 

  DANIEL
  Okay. 

  Ali and Susan, their enthusiasm trailing after them, walk off with their parents. 
  Lucille and Miyagi see a cloud creeping over Daniel. 

  LUCILLE 
  So! Where are we celebrating this momentous event today? 

  DANIEL (despondent) 
  How about Paris? 

  Lucille feels for her son. 

  MIYAGI 
  So sorry. Dont want to go to Paris. 

  DANIEL
  What's wrong with Paris? 

  MIYAGI 
  Everybody goes there. 

  Miyagi's joke puts everything back into perspective for Daniel. He shakes off 
  his malaise. 

  DANIEL 
  Thanks. 

  Miyagi bows his head. 

  LUCILLE 
  Well, that takes care of Paris. How about the Thousand Oaks Shopping Mall? 

  DANIEL 
  Sounds good to me. 

  ZOOM OUT 
  as all three walk through the crowd. 



KK 
  II 1st Draft Script -Part Three: Daniel and Ali Part Company... 

After 
  the training sequence that is much the same as the movie, we see that Ali and 
  Daniel, like so many college age lovers, were victims of circumstance at the 
  end... 


 
    EXT. MIYAGI'S HOUSE -- DAY CLOSEUP: 

    A large frosty glass of iced tea with a mint sprig on a tray moves outdoors. 
    The sound of deliberate one-stroke hammering fills the air. 

    PULL BACK TO MIYAGI 
    returning to the shade of a beach umbrella with his tea and Daniel, pounding 
    nails, one at a time, into the under-construction addition to Miyagi's house. 
    Daniel is sweating bullets, his method peculiar. He sets up a nail and tries 
    to drive it in with one blow of the hammer. He is not concentrating and consequently, 
    not succeeding. Miyagi sees this and approaches. 

    MIYAGI
    Daniel-san. Purpose exercise build focus. 

    DANIEL 
    I thought it was to build a new room. 

    MIYAGI 
    That too. Now watch. 

    Miyagi sets up a nail, draws the hammer back no more than twelve inches and 
    hammers the nail through the wood with one deft shot. 

    MIYAGI 
    Now you. 

    Daniel sets up a nail. 

    MIYAGI 
    Focus. Concentrate power. 

    Daniel swings. The blow is misdirected, off. The nail bends. Daniel's spirit 
    seems to collapse. Miyagi removes the hammer from his hand. 

    DANIEL 
    Sorry, Mr. Miyagi. I can't concentrate. 

    MIYAGI 
    What problem? 

    DANIEL 
    I don't know. I feel like I'm losing my balance, like every- thing's just 
    floating away. 

    MIYAGI
    Only thing matter, Daniel not float away. 

    DANIEL 
    I don't know how to stop it. 

    Miyagi presses Daniel's hands together in a prayer position at chest level. 
    

    MIYAGI 
    When fear losing focus always return to basic of life. 

    DANIEL 
    Praying? 

    MIYAGI 
    Breathing. No breath -- no life. Now, breathe. In and out. 

    On the exhale, he raises Daniel's hands still clasped above his head until 
    the arms are fully extended. 

    MIYAGI 
    In. 

    On the intake, he returns Daniel's hands to the prayer position. 

    MIYAGI 
    Out. 

    On the exhale, he leads Daniel's hands straight out in front of him, still 
    clasped. 

    MIYAGI 
    In. 

    He returns Daniel's hands to the prayer position, removing his own. 

    MIYAGI 
    Out. 

    Daniel does the movement solo. 

    MIYAGI 
    In. 

    His breathing is deep, measured. 

    MIYAGI 
    Out. 

    His face calm, his eyes focus. 

    MIYAGI 
    In. 

    The exercise has come full circle. 

    MIYAGI 
    How feel? 

    DANIEL (pleased) Better. 

    Miyagi slaps the hammer back in his hand. 

    MIYAGI 
    Good. Back to work. 

    Miyagi returns to his shade and his tea. Daniel, with renewed vigor, sets 
    up the first nail, and without hesitation drives it straight home. 

    CUT TO: EXT. ALI'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 
    Daniel and Ali pull up in front of her house, home from what looks like a 
    disastrous date. She sits against one door and he sits against the other, 
    both waiting for the inevitable. 

    ALI 
    Daniel? There's something we have to talk about. 

    Daniel lets out a sigh. 

    DANIEL 
    Does it have to do with us growing as individuals? 

    ALI 
    Yes. 

    DANIEL 
    I already heard this speech today. 

    Daniel turns the engine back on. 

    ALI 
    Don't be like this. 

    DANIEL 
    You're breaking up with me. How should I be? 

    ALI 
    A little understanding. 

    DANIEL 
    Right. 

    ALI 
    We're not gonna be together all summer and then I'm going away to school. 
    It's not fair to either one of us. 

    Her words fall on deaf ears. He turns and looks through the windshield, his 
    face a mask of indifference. 

    DANIEL 
    Goodnight. 

    ALI (sorrowful) 
    Daniel -- ! 

    She goes to stroke his cheek. He moves his face away. 

    DANIEL 
    Please dont. 

    The hurt in his voice stops her cold. After a moment's hesitation, she exits 
    from the car. Daniel slams the accelerator to the floor, leaving rubber all 
    the way dwon the block, as Ali stands at the curb watching him go, her pain 
    as genuine as his. 

    CUT TO: EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE -- NIGHT 
    Daniel stands in front of his car looking out over the valley, his emotions 
    raging. He joins his hands in the prayer position and starting breathing in 
    and out, trying to foucs, trying to retain control. Despite the effort, tears 
    come, and keep coming as he breathes in and out, striving to keep everything 
    from floating away.






KK 
II 1st Draft Script -Part Four: A Previously Unseen Training Exercise... 


In 
this sequence we see a type of training that was planned but never made it into 
the movie. We also see that Danniel's mom, absent from the second film was very 
much a part of this script and her career trials continued... 

INT. APARTMENT -- DAY 
Daniel is sitting on an armchair, listlessly watching one rock video after another, 
moping. There is a knock at the door. 

DANIEL (listless) 
Come in. 

Miyagi enters. 

MIYAGI
Daniel-san. Miss training appoint- ment three days now. 

DANIEL 
Oh, yeah. I guess I forgot. 

MIYAGI 
What matter? 

DANIEL Nothing. 

Miyagi looks at his young friend and turns the TV off. He goes over to Daniel 
and lifts him out of the chair. 

MIYAGI (commanding) 
Come! Up! 

DANIEL 
I really don't feel like it. 

MIYAGI 
Come! Clear brain. 

Miyagi grabs two batting practice helmets from a shelf, puts one on Daniel and 
the other on himself. He pushes Daniel towards the door. 

DANIEL 
I really don't feel like batting practice, either. 

MIYAGI 
Who said anything about batting practice? 

CUT TO: 

EXT. BATTING CAGE 
An automatic pitch-and-swing range with dozens of high netted batting cages lined 
up. Daniel and Miyagi stand in one, batting helmets in place. Miyagi places Daniel 
directly in the strike zone. 

MIYAGI
Like riddles, Daniel-san?

Daniel looks around for a bat. 

DANIEL 
Sometimes. Don't I need a bat? 

MIYAGI
Need pay attention. Now, what karate technique remind you of bird? 

DANIEL
I don't know. What? 

Miyagi pushes a button on the control box by his hand. A ball comes hurtling forward 
from the pitching machine. Daniel sees the ball in the knick of time. He ducks. 
The ball whizzes past where his head was and flacks into the canvas backstop. 
That gets his attention. 

MIYAGI 
Duck. (pause) Good block. Good defense. Good duck, even better. Try again. 

Not really sure about this, Daniel nonetheless sets himself in the strike zone, 
staring out at the auto pitch. 

MIYAGI
When Miyagi say move, move. Not before. Now focus, concentrate. 

Daniel's mind locks into the auto pitch. 

MIYAGI
Focus. 

CLOSEUP: 
Miyagi's finger hits the button. 

CLOSEUP: 
The pitching arm. The ball fires. 

CLOSEUP: 
Daniel's face, tense as the ball hurls toward him. 

ANGLE ON 
Miyagi. 

MIYAGI
Move. 

The sickening thud of a baseball against flesh makes Miyagi grimace. 

DANIEL
Oww! 

Miyagi walks over to a doubled up Daniel, his hands across his stomach. 

MIYAGI
Okay, Daniel-san? 

DANIEL
Really clears the mind. 

He straightens up slowly. Miyagi, proud of him. He stands in the strike zone again. 


DANIEL (determined) 
Do it! 

ANGLE ON 
Miyagi, pressing the button. 

MIYAGI
Move! 

But again there is a sickening thud. Miyagi helps Daniel up a second time. 

MIYAGI
Maybe take little rest. 

But Daniel is determined.

DANIEL
No. I'm okay. 

He stands facing the autopitch bravely. 

DANIEL
Go. 

Miyagi presses the button. Daniel gets hit again.

DANIEL (rising) 
Again. 

And again the same thing happens. Miyagi now grows concerned. Miyagi comes to 
the batting cage, straightening Daniel up after his last debacle. Daniel rubs 
the center of his chest this time. 

MIYAGI
Try again tomorrow, maybe. 

But Daniel has his mind set on succeeding or dying trying.

DANIEL
No. 

He sets himself up. 

DANIEL
Okay. 

Miyagi, with misgiving, presses the button.

ANGLE ON
Daniel waiting for the ball.

MIYAGI
Move!

Daniel waits a second longer. He ducks to the side at the last moment. The ball 
sails by, flacking harmlessly against the canvas. 

MIYAGI (excited)
Hoi, Daniel-san! 

DANIEL (cocky)
Give me another one. 

Daniel sets himself up immediately. Miyagi is only too happy to comply. 

ANGLE ON
Daniel waiting till the last moment, and then casually slipping away from the 
ball to the left. Daniel places himself in the batters box, immediately, focusing 
on the autopitch. 

DANIEL
Another.

Miyagi complies again. This time Daniel moves to the other side, a fancy little 
head move. The ball hits the canvas behind him. 

DANIEL (cocky)
Well, okay! He walks over to the speed-selector box and turns the dial from three 
to ten.

MIYAGI (cautioning)
Daniel-san.

DANIEL
Don't worry. I'm in focus. 

Miyagi presses the button. The ball comes out like a comet.

DANIEL (O.S.)
Owww! 

Miyagi grimaces at the sound. Daniel comes hobbling over a moment later, and returns 
the speed lever to three. He hobbles back to the batter's cage.



KK 
II 1st Draft Script -Part Five: Healing, Training and Mom's Career... 

In 
the following scenes we see more of Mrs LaRusso (absent from the finished film) 
and a warm and touching scene that expands her relationship with Miyagi (that 
relationship was never covered in any of the films) ... and the usage of a smelly 
healing powder, cut from the movie that re-appeared in KK III...

INT. MAINTENANCE SHACK 
Daniel sits on a bench with his shirt off, his body covered with bruises and welts. 
He talks to Miyagi, who is in the next room. 

DANIEL 
You know, after a while, watching the ball today, I felt better. (beat) When it 
was just me and the ball right there. You know? Locked in? I didn't have a care 
in the world. 

Miyagi exits, holding a covered jar. 

DANIEL 
Know what I mean? 

MIYAGI 
Called focus. 

He examines Daniel's bruises. 

DANIEL 
Why can't I transfer that to the rest of my world? 

MIYAGI 
Can. Called practice. 

Miyagi opens the lid on the jar. Daniel screws up his nose at the horrible odor. 


DANIEL 
What's that called? 

Miyagi slaps some on his most pronounced bruises. 

MIYAGI 
Don't want to know. 

Lucille enters. 

LUCILLE 
Hello. 

DANIEL 
Hi, Mom. 

She sees Daniel's bruises. 

LUCILLE 
I won't even ask. (beat) Will he survive? 

MIYAGI 
Training will survive. Treatment not so sure. 

LUCILLE 
50-50 odds. I can live with that. 

She kisses Daniel. 

LUCILLE 
Are you ready for the news of the year? (pause) I was selected to attend the Company 
Training School for Regional Managers. 

MIYAGI 
Congratulations. 

LUCILLE 
Thank you. 

Lucille picks up Daniel's silence. 

LUCILLE 
Don't show your enthusiasm all at once. 

DANIEL 
I'm waiting for the back end. 

LUCILLE 
What back end? Your Mom's being kicked upstairs. 

DANIEL 
And where am I getting kicked to? 

This is the part Lucille has been dreading. 

LUCILLE 
Chicago. It's where the course is given. 

DANIEL 
Just where I wanted to spend my summer. 

LUCILLE (weakly) 
It's only a month. 

Daniel turns his head. 

LUCILLE 
You can't stay here by yourself, honey 

DANIEL 
No. I have to go all the way to Chicago for that. 

He fixes his mother with a stare, rises, pulls on his shirt and heads for the 
door. Lucille looks at Miyagi for help in the long silence. 

MIYAGI 
You know, I just had extra room built on house. 

Lucille catches the drift. 

LUCILLE 
I didn't know that. 

MIYAGI (pointed) 
Guest room. 

Daniel stops before exiting. He turns, slowly, to a smiling Lucille and Miyagi. 


LUCILLE 
He never makes his bed, you know? 

MIYAGI 
Me, either. 

DANIEL 
Thanks, Ma. Thanks, Mr. Miyagi. 

LUCILLE 
Think you'll miss me? 

DANIEL 
No. I mean, yeah. I mean -- (beat) I mean thanks. 

LUCILLE 
You're welcome. C'mon. Help me unload the car. 

Daniel, excited, runs out. 

DANIEL 
I'll see you later, Mr. Miyagi. 

Lucille lingers. She looks Miyagi directly in the eye. 

LUCILLE Thank you. He needed someone. 

Miyagi returns her look. 

MIYAGI 
So did I. 

The two of them share the moment in their hearts. Miyagi bows. Lucille bows back 
and exits. 

CUT TO: 

A MONTAGE 
Miyagi shows Daniel how to best use avoidance maneuvers instead of blocks. 

CUT TO: 2. 
Daniel and Miyagi exiting from a laundromat together, carrying folded clothes. 


CUT TO: 
Daniel and Miyagi sitting before Miyagi's shrine and meditating. 

CUT TO: 
INT. MIYAGI'S HOUSE 
Miyagi and Daniel are cleaning the house. Daniel removes a cigar box from the 
side table near Miyagi's bed. 

POV Daniel: 
Miyagi's war medals and decorations. Daniel examines these. 

DANIEL 
You should make a display for these. You know. To hang up. 

MIYAGI 
For what? 

DANIEL 
Well, it says something about you, winning the medal of honor. 

MIYAGI 
What does it say? 

DANIEL 
That you're brave. 

MIYAGI 
No, Daniel-san. Only this 

Miyagi taps his heart. 

MIYAGI 
says you're brave. 

Daniel peruses the medals. Miyagi is about to exit. Daniel holds up the Medal 
of Honor. 

DANIEL 
Then what does this say you are? 

MIYAGI 
Lucky. 

Miyagi exits. Daniel looks from the medals to his tournament trophy, wondering 
if the same applies to him


KK 
II 1st Draft Script -Part Six: Bad News From Okinawa... 

The 
re-appearance of the mysterious "Webster Miyagi". My feeling is that 
the purpose of this character was to re-establish contact for Miyagi with Okinawa. 
If his family knew where to reach him, why had they never persuaded him to return? 
Why had Sato never come looking for him for revenge. If they didn't know where 
to find him, then the plot needed a character to re-establish contact between 
the family and Mr Miyagi...

EXT. MIYAGI'S FRONT YARD -- DAY 

Daniel is sanding Miyagi's boat down, using on his fingertips for pressure on 
the sant paper, not a very comfortable procedure to say the least. Miyagi exits 
with a lunch tray. 

MIYAGI
Lunch time. 

Daniel, glad to stop, approaches, rubbing his aching fingertips. 

DANIEL 
I'm hurting. 

MIYAGI 
Only way to get attack trained finger- tips. 

DANIEL 
I don't know what I'm going to attack with them. They're the weakest part of my 
body. 

MIYAGI 
Always something weaker. 

Daniel looks at his fingertips, touches them. They are very sensitive. He recoils, 
and then thinks. His face lights up with a minor revelation. 

DANIEL 
Mr. Miyagi. 

Miyagi turns. From the table, Daniel mock-rakes his fingertips across his eyes. 


DANIEL 
Right? Something weaker? Miyagi smiles. 

MIYAGI 
Pretty soon won't need Miyagi for anything. 

Daniel grabs a sandwich. 

DANIEL 
You still make the best tuna fish I ever ate. 

Daniel is about to take the first bite, when a car pulls up in the driveway. Miyagi 
and Daniel look up to Webster, exiting. Webster approaches, formally, dour, unlike 
his former self. 

WEBSTER 
My mother, Machiko, your father's second cousin's oldest child, sends you her 
regards. Miyagi is stunned into silence for a moment, but then his good manners 
prevail. 

MIYAGI 
I send her mine. 

WEBSTER 
They all thought you died in the war. (beat) I'm sorry it took so long to find 
you. 

He hands Miyagi a telegram from his shirt pocket. 

WEBSTER 
You weren't in the book. 

Miyagi reads the telegram and rises, almost distracted. 

MIYAGI 
Thank you. 

He turns to go inside, forgetting about Daniel and Webster. 

DANIEL 
What's the matter? 

WEBSTER 
His father is dying. 

Webster departs. Daniel looks towards the house, feeling for his friend. 

CUT TO: INT. HOUSE -- NIGHT 

Miyagi sits, eyes open, but staring inward, in front of his shrine. 

Daniel sits in a corner, hugging his knees to his chest, keeping the vigil. 


CUT TO: INT. HOUSE -- MORNING 

Daniel, asleep in the same position, wakens to find himself alone in the room. 
He gets up and exits to Miyagi's bedroom, where he finds Miyagi moving back and 
forth, packing a suitcase. 

DANIEL 
Mr. Miyagi? 

Miyagi is more cheerful than one would expect. 

MIYAGI 
Come in Daniel-san. 

DANIEL (tentative) 
You okay? 

MIYAGI 
Fine. Fine. 

DANIEL (down) 
You're going to Okinawa, huh? 

MIYAGI 
Son's duty. 

Miyagi continues packing. Daniel's mind clouds with visions of Chicago. 

DANIEL (crestfallen) 
I guess I'll go pack too. 

MIYAGI Good idea. (pause) Don't want to wear the same clothes in Okinawa every 
day. 

The answer is not what Daniel expected. He stops, stunned. 

DANIEL 
You're going to take me? 

MIYAGI 
Can't leave you. 

DANIEL 
We should call my Mom, maybe. 

MIYAGI 
Already did. 

DANIEL 
What did she say? 

MIYAGI 
Sayonara. 

Daniel lets out an involuntary whoop, so excited at the prospect of traveling 
to the mythical land of Okinawa. But then he remembers the reason why. He tones 
down, somber. 

DANIEL 
I'm sorry, Mr. Miyagi. I -- I didn't mean that. I wish we were going for another 
reason. 

MIYAGI 
Thank you. So do I. 

DANIEL 
I'll go pack. 

Daniel exits. Miyagi reaches under his bed and takes out a box untouched for a 
long time. He wipes the dust away from the cover and lifts it. Inside is an old 
photo album. His hand brushes across the cover. His mind brushes across time....


KK 
II 1st Draft Script -Part Seven: On To Okinawa... 

In 
the following scenes we see that though broadly similar to the finished movie, 
the emphasis is different and Sato seems to be called "Seikichi"...

INT. AIRPLANE -- NIGHT 

Daniel comes back from the toilet to find Miyagi looking through the photo album, 
at yellowed pictures. Daniel sits and looks. 

DANIEL 
Is that your village? 

MIYAGI 
Hai. 

DANIEL 
This you? 

Miyagi nods. 

CLOSEUP: 
A picture of two young men, one slight, the other built like a bull. 

DANIEL 
You were pretty handsome. 

MIYAGI 
What mean were? 

DANIEL 
Who's the other guy? 

MIYAGI 
Seikichi. 

DANIEL 
You did karate together? 

MIYAGI 
Father's only other student. 

DANIEL 
You were friends? 

MIYAGI Best friends. (beat) Once upon a time. 

Before Daniel can ask what happened, a picture slips out of the album onto the 
floor catching his attention. He retrieves it. 

CLOSEUP: 
The picture of a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN. 

DANIEL 
Who's this? 

MIYAGI (soft) 
Yukio. 

When he says her name there is music in his voice harkening intimacies of long 
ago. 

DANIEL 
Special, huh? 

MIYAGI 
Very special. 

He looks at the picture, remembering. The STEWARDESS interrupts his reverie with 
a blanket and a pillow. Daniel takes a seat also. Miyagi puts the picture away 
in his album and spreads out the blanket as the cabin lights go out. 

MIYAGI 
Goodnight, Daniel-san. 

DANIEL 
Goodnight. 

Miyagi goes immediately to sleep. Daniel looking for a comfortable position, turning 
back and forth in his seat, notices that two pictures have fallen out of Miyagi's 
album. He picks them up. 

POV Daniel: 
The two pictures: The one of Yukio, and the other of Yukio standing at Seikichi's 
side as a couple, Miyagi standing several feet off. On the back of Yukio's picture 
is some calligraphy. 

STEWARDESS 
Can I get you anything? 

DANIEL 
Can you translate this? 

He shows her the inscription. 

STEWARDESS "To my beloved with high hopes for the future." Anything else? 

DANIEL 
No, thank you. 

She leaves. Daniel looks at the two pictures again and over at Miyagi. 

CUT TO: CLOSEUP: 
Of Yukio, or her look alike, in real life, amidst a crowd of people, outside the 
customs area at an airport. Her POV: Miyagi and Daniel in a crowd clearing customs. 
There are many American GIs moving along with them. ANGLE ON Miyagi and Daniel 


DANIEL 
Boy, I didn't expect so many Americans. 

MIYAGI 
Yes. Very big military bases on Okinawa. Biggest in all Pacific. 

DANIEL 
Look at that. 

Daniel points to a large advertisement on the wall in English: "LEARN KARATE AT 
OKINAWA'S BIGGEST DOJO FROM MASTER SEIKICHI. Instruction in English. For forty 
years, official instructor to the United States Military. Proven in Combat" 

DANIEL 
Isn't that your friend's name? 

MIYAGI 
Popular name in Okinawa. 

DANIEL 
Yeah. Probably a coincidence. 

Daniel passes on. Miyagi takes one last look at the sign. He is not so convinced. 


CUT TO: EXT. AIRPORT 
Miyagi looks for a cab when a voice behind turns him. 

VO 
Miyagi-san. 

Miyagi turns, startled, to the real Yukio, a graceful woman of sixty, and KUMIKO, 
her grand daughter, seventeen, the spitting image. 

YUKIO (in halting English) 
Welcome She hesitates, not sure of the word. 

KUMIKO (whispering) 
home. 

YUKIO 
Home! 

Miyagi is so stunned he cannot reply. 

YUKIO 
So sorry, English. Grand daughter teach. I bad student. 

MIYAGI (gently) 
No. Good student. 

She smiles and bows. He is almost overwhelmed by her presence. 

YUKIO 
Come. 

She takes Miyagi's suitcase and starts off for a nearby taxi. Kumiko and Daniel 
are left facing each other. She smiles, coyly. 

DANIEL 
I'm Daniel. 

He holds out his hand. 

KUMIKO 
Kumiko. 

She bows. He feels funny with his hand out. Pulls it back and bows quickly. When 
she reaches for his suitcase, his hand darts to the handle, touching hers. Both 
hearts skip a beat....


KK 
II 1st Draft Script -Part Eight: The 'Bathing Scene'... 

In 
the following scenes we see the closest thing to nudity that the Karate Kid Series 
is ever likely to portray. Totally cut from the final script...


KUMIKO Please. 

She prevails, lifting the suitcase, following her grandmother. Daniel follows 
her. 

ANGLE ON a THIRD PARTY watching from the group as they enter the taxi and depart: 

SEIKICHI, older, prosperous, stands in front of a fancy black car. His AMERICAN 
CHAUFFEUR and his BODYGUARD, both tall and rangy, with Military haircuts and dark 
sunglasses, stand behind him. Seikichi's mouth is drawn into a tight scowl. Next 
to him, with the same stern face, stands CHOZEN, 18, his grand son, and heir apparent. 


CUT TO: EXT. VILLAGE STREET -- NIGHT 
The entire village is asleep. The houses are dark. The narrow streets are deserted. 
A taxi pulls away from Miyagi's house. Miyagi and Daniel pick up their suitcases 
and enter the gate. Yukio and Kumiko remain outside. 

CUT TO: INT. HOUSE 
Daniel waits at the doorway of the dimly-lit room. Miyagi enters and approaches 
a futon bed where an OLD MAN near death lays with his eyes closed. Miyagi looks 
down at the frail old figure. Sensing a presence, the tired eyelids open, straining 
to focus. After a moment, the eyes spark with recognition. MIYAGI, SR. Chojun-san. 
Miyagi kneels close to the bed. 

MIYAGI (quietly) 
Hai! 

The Old Man struggles to raise himself up. Miyagi helps him. The Old Man says 
a few words and then collapses in his son's arms, dead. Miyagi lovingly lowers 
the body. Tears well up. He smoothes a few loose strands of hair from his father's 
face, and closes the old man's eyes forever. Daniel watches the scene for a long 
moment, fighting back tears of his own. He backs out of the room respectfully 
leaving Miyagi alone with his father and walks down a long hall. He passes a room 
with the Shoji doors open. 

POV Daniel: 
All his clothes neatly unpacked and arranged. He enters the room and examines 
his clothing, the weight of travel and recent events beginning to catch up with 
him. A shuffling from behind him turns him. An ANCIENT WOMAN smiles sweetly and 
bows. Daniel bows back. She says something in Japanese. 

DANIEL (English) 
Sorry. 

The woman repeats the phrase and pantomimes washing her hands, her face. 

DANIEL 
Oh, yeah. I wouldn't mind getting washed up. I mean, Hai, Hai! Pleased, the woman 
bows and bids Daniel follow, which he does. 

CUT TO: INT. BATHING ROOM 
A wooden tub with steam rising from the water's surface sits in the middle of 
the room. Daniel and the Old Lady enter. She speaks in Japanese, telling him to 
disrobe. He waits for her to leave. She doesn't move, commanding again, gesturing. 


DANIEL 
I usually shower in the morning. 

She snaps again and grabs for the buttons on his shirt Daniel steps back. 

DANIEL 
Okay. I'll do it. He unbuttons his shirt slowly, self-consciously, hoping she 
will leave. To his dismay, he reaches the last button and she is still there. 
When he has taken off his shirt, she demands and is given it. Next, she points 
to his pants. 

DANIEL 
You know, Im kind of a private undresser.

In exasperation, the old woman walks over chaterring, puts her hand on his waistband 
and unzips his fly. Daniel jumps back. 

DANIEL 
Okay. Okay. 

He removes his pants slowly, deliberately. 

DANIEL 
See? I'm gonna do it. You can leave now. 

The moment his pants are off she confiscates them, and gives another order pointing 
to his last vestige of propriety, his underwear. 

DANIEL (adamant) 
Listen! I don't mean to be rude, but I don't even do this in front of my own mother. 
Her answer is to grab the elastic and yank. The shorts fall to his ankles. His 
hands shoot to his privates. The old lady now has all his clothes in hand. She 
smiles politely. 

OLD LADY 
Arigato! 

She bows and exits. Daniel, not knowing how to respond, makes a small bow back. 
When she is gone, he looks around. 

DANIEL 
Oh, this is great LaRusso. 

He cannot chastise himself for long, because the door opened abruptly. Daniel's 
hand shoots back ot his privates. TWO SHORT but STRAPPING WOMEN appear, smiling, 
with rows of gold-capped teeth. In their hands are buckets with sudsy water and 
wash cloths. 

DANIEL 
Oh, no. This is where I draw the line. I do this myself. 

The women advance, giggling. Daniel backs up to the wall. The women lift his hands 
from his privates to his head and rest them there. They begin to wash his body 
with the wash cloths chattering away. Daniel stands there, feeling supremely silly, 
his hands atop his head. 

DANIEL 
I don't know if this is like a practical joke or anything, (beat) am I on Candid 
Camera? 

The girls dump buckets of water on him, and then order him into the hot bath. 
Hesitantly, Daniel steps in. The temperature is just right. He sinks in up to 
his neck. One of the women makes a pillow out of a towel and helps him lean his 
head back. When he is comfortable, both women bow and exit. Despite himself, Daniel 
has begun to enjoy the experience. He relaxes and closes his eyes. 
Stay 
Tuned for the next, exciting installment...
