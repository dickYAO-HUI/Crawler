MIDDLETON'S CHANGELING DIALOGUE SCRIPT

EXT. ALICANTE SHORELINE. - NIGHT.

Picture cuts in:


Static view of ALICANTE from the sea. High above, the Castle of Santa Barbara 
dominates the city, silhouetted against a night sky. Waves roll in towards the 
modern-day city and break on the shoreline. Car headlights, street lamps, vibrant 
city. Sea atmosphere surrounds us. We HEAR distant fog horns sounding eerily across 
the water.
MUSIC fades up. A threatening bass note rumbles.

BEATRICE blows out the taper that she has been using to light the candles. ALSEMERO 
opens the heavy church door, and pauses in the entrance. BEATRICE looks round as he 
steps in, and walks slowly towards the altar.  She pauses for a moment and then 
crosses herself.

BEATRICE walks slowly up the church on the far side, with ALSEMERO's eyes firmly 
fixed on her as he stalks her up the aisle. Church pillars pass through frame, 
occasionally obscuring them from view. At the top of the aisle BEATRICE pauses 
momentarily and glances coyly across to ALSEMERO, before moving on out of frame.

CAM TILTS down from the CASTLE high above the church tower to the empty square below. 
The facia and intricate carvings of the building are partially veiled behind chicken 
wire. White doves adorn the stone ledges. We HEAR HORSES' hooves on cobble stones 
approaching. JASPERINO and his COMPANION pass by in the distance on HORSEBACK.
The MUSIC ends.

ALSEMERO exits the heavy doors of the church. He steps down onto the cobbled square 
and walks slowly and thoughtfully away from the building.

ALSEMERO
(v/o)

It was in the church that I first saw her, and now again the same thing.
 

What omen follows that? The place is holy and so is my intent.


The church first brought us together and shall join us into one. 


He turns to look back at the building. We SEE a series of C/Us of the wire-veiled 
statues on the facia of the church. JASPERINO approaches. A dove flies off in fright.
JASPERINO 

Boss, why are you still here?


Come man, the wind's fair.
JASPERINO and his COMPANION slowly enter the square on HORSEBACK, and approach 
ALSEMERO.

ALSEMERO

That's where you're wrong my friend, not in my best judgement.

JASPERINO

For Malta! Man, it couldn't be better.
He dismounts.
(Contd.)

I've never known you to delay travel when the wind is fair, what's wrong?

ALSEMERO

Nothing,


unless there is some hidden sickness in me.

JASPERINO

But this is madness compared to your haste yesterday!

ALSEMERO

I'm still going, man!

jASPERINO

Yeah, backwards. Look, your servants.
To one side of the square two SAILORS lean over a railing. One of them shouts across 
to ALSEMERO.

SAILOR

The seamen beckon, my Lord, shall I load your trunks?

ALSEMERO

No, not today. Keep all on shore!
He turns back to face JASPERINO, who is preparing to mount his HORSE. 

MUSIC FADES IN under the dialogue.

ALSEMERO (cont'd)

I must get to the end of an affair at hand, before I go to sea.
Jasperino turns to pat his HORSE with a shake of his head, surprised by his friend's 
unusual behavior.

A black stretch-limo escorted by two motorcycle out-riders, sirens blaring, turns a 
sharp bend on the road down from the castle.

White painted houses cluster together stacked around the base of the castle walls. We

With the aid of a STICK, DE FLORES who is disabled, awkwardly descends the steps that 
lead down through the houses beneath the castle. He pauses to look ahead into the 
square below. His face is hideously disfigured by a mass of erupting acne and scarred 
skin tissue, and his mangy scalp contains patches of sore looking baldness.

CUT TO:

EXT. Plaza santa maria. - DAY.

BEATRICE and her lady-in-waiting, DIAPHANTA, exit the church. BEATRICE passes her 
prayer book disdainfully back to her servant. JASPERINO watches as ALSEMERO 
approaches BEATRICE and takes her gloved hand to kiss. BEATRICE responds to 
ALSEMERO's advances with a coy smile, and walks away with him. DIAPHANTA looks on 
disapprovingly, then follows.

DE FLORES, who has been watching from afar, continues his arduous journey down from 
the castle.

ALSEMERO and BEATRICE cross the square followed by DIAPHANTA. JASPERINO leaves his 
HORSE in the care of his COMPANION and follows also.

CUT TO:

EXT. ALICANTE. - DAY.

The CASTLE is seen high up above the city. In the foreground a tower of the City Hall 
is seen veiled in blue plastic. It's as if all the main buildings of the city are 
hidden behind surreal veils.

The STRETCH-LIMO and OUTRIDERS screech round a corner as they descend the hill.

CUT TO:

EXT. plaza santa maria. - DAY.

BEATRICE and ALSEMERO walk side by side laughing  flirtatiously as they approach the 
steps that lead down from the church square. DIAPHANTA and JASPERINO follow.

BEATRICE

Are you a scholar, Sir?

aLsemero
(05.11. 20)
A weak one, Lady.

BEATRICE

Which of the sciences is this love you speak of?
In C/U we glimpse that Beatrice is wearing sneakers under her period costume.

ALSEMERO

From your tongue, I take it to be music.

bEATRICE

You are skilful at it, Sir. 'Seems you sing at first sight.

ALSEMERO

And I have shown you all my skill at once.
They pause on the steps.
ALSEMERO (cont'd)

I lack words to express it further, and can only repeat myself.


I love you dearly.
BEATRICE hides her slight smile behind a Spanish fan, and leaves frame.  As   
DIAPHANTA descends the steps JASPERINO picks up some pebbles and throws them down at 
her in an attempt to gain her attention. 
 
CUT TO:

EXT. ESPANADA. - DAY.

White DOVES fly out of the way as the STRETCH-LIMO and OUTRIDERS proceed between the 
palms trees of the ESPANADA, with sirens blaring.

CUT TO:

EXT. plaza santa maria. - DAY.

DE FLORES reaches the top of the steps that lead away from the square and pauses to 
shout after BEATRICE.

DE FLORES

Lady!
DOVES take off in fright.

DE FLORES (cont'd)

Lady! 

(06.14. 04)
Lady!

DE FLORES descends the stairs.

CUT TO:

EXT. ALICANTE CITY HALL. - DAY.

ALSEMERO escorts BEATRICE through the streets as she is mobbed by children that tug 
at her dress playfully. They are followed by DIAPHANTA and JASPERINO. Beatrice cannot 
hear DE FLORES calling her.

DE FLORES (cont'd)

Lady!

DE FLORES tries to catch up. In C/U his hob-nail boots thump down the steps 
awkwardly, in marked contrast to Beatrice's footsteps of earlier.
On hearing  DE FLORES' shouts BEATRICE stops walking, freezes, and turns to face him. 
He approaches her leaning heavily on his STICK.

DE FLORES (cont'd)

Lady... your father...

BEATRICE
( as she walks to him)

Is in health, I hope!

DE FLORES

Your eye shall instantly instruct you, Lady. He's on his way.

BEATRICE

Why bother me then? I would rather he came unexpectedly. Must you stall a good 
presence with your unnecessary blabbing?

With an angry swipe of her fan BEATRICE turns and walks impetuously back to join 
ALSEMERO and the CHILDREN, walking through the city. DIAPHANTA halfheartedly ignores 
JASPERINO's tiresome advances. He claps his hands to disperse the distracting 
CHILDREN.

ALSEMERO

You seem suddenly displeased, Lady.

BEATRICE

I'm sorry. It's an allergy. Just as some must abandon as deadly poison a thing that 
to others is wholesome, such to my eyes is the fellow back there.

We CUT TO DE FLORES who still stands where BEATRICE humiliated him. His eyes follow 
her as she walks on ahead. 

BEATRICE (o/s, cont'd)

But, he's loyal to my father, and well respected by him. 

DE FLORES
(v/o)

Will this scorn never end, one way or another? Must I follow still while she flies 
from me? I know she'd rather see me dead than living, for no other reason than a 
peevish will. 

ext. espanada. - DAY.

Overhead palms reflect vividly in the black bonnet of the stretch-limo as it travels 
up the ESPANADA, flanked by police OUTRIDERS. ALSEMERO, BEATRICE, DIAPHANTA and 
JASPERINO walk along the ESPANADA followed close behind by DE FLORES. JASPERINO puts 
his hand on DIAPHANTA's shoulder. 

JASPERINO
(07. 53.05)
...that would tame the hottest blood in town, for at least two hours.

DIAPHANTA

A little poppy, Sir, would get you to sleep.

JASPERINO

Poppy? I'll give you a pop in the lips!
The stretch-limo reaches the group. DE FLORES thumps his STICK heavily on the ground 
as he catches up with everyone. 

The MUSIC finishes.

We SEE BEATRICE and ALSEMERO reflected in one of the tinted windows of 
the car. It slowly opens to reveal VERMANDERO sitting behind.

VERMANDERO

Joanna, I went to meet you. Is your devotion ended?

BEATRICE

For the time being, Father. Sir, I am beholden to this gentlemen who went out of his 
way to greet me...

JASPERINO eyes DIAPHANTA up and down as they stand together close by. DE FLORES 
listens intently from the other side of the vehicle. 

BEATRICE (cont'd)

...and in talking to him, I find him keen to see your castle. He deserves to, Sir, if 
you would grant it?

VERMANDERO

With all my heart, Sir, but... 


I must know your country. We do not give tours of our chief strengths to strangers.


Our citadels are conspicuous on the outside,


but inside there are... secrets.

ALSEMERO

I'm a Valencian, Sir

VERMANDERO

A Valencian! What's the name, I beseech you?

ALSEMERO

Alsemero, Sir.

VERMANDERO

Alsemero. Not the son of John de Alsemero?

ALSEMERO

Why the same, Sir.

VERMANDERO

My best love bids you welcome. 

MUSIC FADES IN.

Seen as reflections in the tinted windows ALSEMERO and BEATRICE step into the 
vehicle. JASPERINO gives DIAPHANTA another glance up and down. The car screeches away 
through frame, leaving them standing together alone. After a pause DIAPHANTA runs 
away up the ESPANADA laughing provocatively. JASPERINO quickly pursues her.

JASPERINO

Hey... come back here!

BEATRICE and ALSEMERO sit side-by-side opposite VERMANDERO.

VERMANDERO

Sir, I knew your father. We were acquainted long ago.


Well, he's gone... and a good soldier went with him.

ALSEMERO

You were together in that, Sir.

VERMANDERO

No, I was behind him.

MUSIC ENDS.

VERMANDERO turns to speak to his daughter.

VERMANDERO

Oh, Joanna, I should have told you, I saw Piracquo recently. He's hot preparing for 
his day of triumph...


you'll be a bride within the week.

BEATRICE turns to look out of the window as the news sinks in. She opens her fan 
carefully and fans herself. ALSEMERO turns to look at her, surprised at the news, 
then looks away thoughtfully out of the window.

With a roar of engines the stretch-limo and its OUTRIDERS pass through the gates to

Watched by several uniformed POLICE OFFICERS and FRANCISCUS and ANTONIO the vehicles 
move slowly into the castle courtyard. An OFFICER approaches the limo and opens one 
of the doors, as DE FLORES gets out from the front. ALSEMERO and VERMANDERO step out 
into the sunshine.

VERMANDERO

You must see my castle and her best entertainments before we part, otherwise I shall 
find myself unkindly used.

DE FLORES follows BEATRICE as she walks around the limo to join the others. She is 
listening intently as her father talks to ALSEMERO.

VERMANDERO (cont'd)

I had hoped that your stay would be long enough for you to come to my daughter's 
wedding.

ALSEMERO

If I had my way, I would be there.

BEATRICE
(once again from behind her fan)

I shall be sorry if your not there, but must it be so soon, Father?

VERMANDERO

I tell you the gentleman's a courtier and a gallant, 


enriched with many fair and noble qualities.


 I would not change him for as a son in-law for any man in Spain,


and we have great ones as you know.

ALSEMERO

He is much bound to you, Sir.
FRANCISCUS and ANTONIO look on as BEATRICE removes a glove and purposefully drops it 
to the ground in the hope that ALSEMERO might stay behind and pick it up for her.

VERMANDERO

He shall be bound to me! As fast as this tie shall hold him. But, come, on the way 
I'll tell you more about him.


Look, girl! Your glove's fallen. De Flores, come and help!

VERMANDERO and ALSEMERO walk past and into the castle leaving DE FLORES to pick up 
BEATRICE's glove. He stoops and then hands it to her. 

DE FLORES

Here, Lady.

BEATRICE
(11. 57.13)
Mischief on your officious forwardness! Who bade you stoop? 


They touch my hand no more. There! for the other's sake, I part with this. Take them 
and draw your own skin off with them!
BEATRICE flings her other glove at DE FLORES and storms off. He is left once again to 
follow her with only his eyes.

DE FLORES
(v/o)

I know she hates me, yet I can not choose but to love her. No matter, if but to vex 
her I'll haunt her still, though I get nothing else I'll have my will.  

CUT TO:

EXT. ALICANTE SHORELINE. - DAY.

MUSIC.
Shoreline palms and road signs flash by as we travel along the ALICANTE coast road. 
We HEAR John Cooper Clarke's voice above the throbbing sound of a V8 trike engine. 
Via a series of C/Us of the machine we SEE PEDRO driving with ANTONIO hanging on 
behind. Whip-pans of the sea shore and C/Us of the massive engine blast through 
frame. This is intercut with shots of  the POET (Cooper Clarke) performing. 

POET

Suspicious. Vicious. Superstitious.
Genetically defective.
Folks round here get real officious
and they're very well connected.
The Marshall 'aint impartial,
the Sheriff's out of town.
There's no law but the luck of the draw,
and I'm penitentiary bound.

CAM crash-zooms into a barred ground floor window of the circular stone building.

CUT TO:

INT. ASYLUM.  - DAY.

ISABELLA rides a white stallion amongst the insane inmates of the asylum. The 
circular space is lit by shafts of blue light that stream in from  small barred 
windows, and by the warm flames of burning TORCHES that hang from pillars around the 
arena. INMATES hang from the bars of the cage that surrounds them. Some shiver and 
tremble outstretched on the sand that covers the ground, others rock to and fro' 
maniacally, or wander around in a daze. Hooves pound as straw blows into the faces of 
mad children as they search for fleas to eat in the hair of their fellows. PEDRO and 
ANTONIO enter the asylum and hang onto the cage as they look in on the mayhem. On the 
pillars around the pit hang distorted metal mirrors that throw back grotesquely 
hideous reflections of the inmates. The CAM tilts up the legs of an extremely tall 
lady as she strides across the arena and comes to rest on ALIBIUS and LOLLIO who are 
surveying the scene from a balcony above. 
MUSIC FADES.

ALIBIUS

I must trust you with a secret, Lollio, but you mustn't tell.

LOLLIO

I was always close to a secret, Sir.

ALIBIUS

The diligence I have found in you; the care and industry already shown, assures me of 
your good continuance. Lollio, I have a wife.
ISABELLA rides assuredly around the arena throughout the scene.

LOLLIO

That is no longer a secret, Sir. She is known to be married all the town and country 
over.

ALIBIUS

But my wife is young, Lollio.

LOLLIO

All the worse if she's kept a secret, Sir.

ALIBIUS

Now you are beginning to see the point. I am old, Lollio.

LOLLIO

No, Sir. I am old Lollio.

ALIBIUS

Shrewd application. But there's the fear, man. I would wear my ring on my own finger, 
but should it be borrowed, it's no longer mine, but his that use it.

LOLLIO

Then you must keep it on; if it just lies there someone will thrust into it.

LOLLIO thrusts his middle finger phallically through the circle created by the thumb 
and forefinger of his other hand.

ALIBIUS

You understand me, Lollio.

LOLLIO
Umm...

ALIBIUS

But here your watchful eye must find good employment. I cannot always be at home.

LOLLIO

I will try my best. But I cannot see who you should be jealous of.
PEDRO and ANTONIO gaze in at ISABELLA as she rides around, then leave frame.

ALIBIUS

I cannot allow my daily visitors who come to look upon my brain-sick patients, to see 
my wife.

LOLLIO

But if they come to see the madmen and the fools then you and I may leave my mistress 
alone, for she is neither one, nor the other. 

ALIBIUS

Then you must give them no less than they come for, by this constituent they shall 
not see her. I'm sure my wife is no fool.

LOLLIO

And I'm sure she's no madman.

CUT TO:

EXT. ALICANTE SHORELINE. - DAY.

FRANCISCUS fills the frame as he rides a motorbike frantically screaming lines from 
some unknown opera.

CUT TO:

int. asylum. - DAY.

From the balcony above we SEE PEDRO carrying ANTONIO through the crowded asylum. They 
are lit by a large fire burning in the centre of the ring. ALIBIUS and LOLLIO are 
interrupted by a shout from below. 

PEDRO

Save you, Sir. My business speaks for itself. This sight saves the labour of the 
tongue.
PEDRO reaches into his smock.

ALIBIUS

Yes, yes, it's plain enough; you want him to be my patient.
PEDRO throws a small purse up to ALIBIUS on the balcony above.

PEDRO

His name is Antonio, but we call him Tony.

LOLLIO

Tony, To-Tony, that's enough! What a lovely name for a fool! What is your name, Tony? 

ANTONIO
(head bowed, and grunting insanely)

Very well, thank you.

LOLLIO

Thank you, lift up your head, Tony. See! He laughs! He's no animal.
Inmates finger and stroke the new arrival.

PEDRO

But I assure you, Sir, he's a gentlemen.

LOLLIO

Oh, I have no doubts; I took him for a gentlemen... and still do.

PEDRO

Be generous, take good care, I beseech you.
PEDRO turns away and walks back across the pit leaving ANTONIO behind amongst the 
inmates.

ALIBIUS

Go to your charge, Lollio, I will go to mine. 

LOLLIO

You look after your madmen, Sir, and I'll take care of your fools.

ALIBIUS

You, remember our agreement!

ISABELLA crosses the ring now on foot winding her hair round her fingers, obviously 
bored. ALIBIUS and LOLLIO leave frame in opposite directions.

CUT TO:

int. castle.  - DAY.

MUSIC FADES IN.
In the coolness of a room in the castle BEATRICE sits on a window ledge, with strong 
sunlight streaming in from behind, writing a LETTER resting on the knee of her torn 
jeans.

BEATRICE
(v/o)

My dearest friend, I have to see you. My woman will come and bring you to me later 
today.

CUT TO:

ext. GARDENS OF elche. - DAY.

We glimpse JASPERINO strolling quickly through the undergrowth of the tropical 
gardens. Lilies float on dark stagnant water.  With a ripple, palm trees  appear 
reflected on the surface of the water. BEATRICE walks on her own through the gardens. 
DE FLORES stands alone and motionless, surrounded by phallic cacti, appearing only as 
a reflection in the stagnant water. In a secluded spot, hidden by palms, BEATRICE 
takes the letter from her bodice, unfolds it and reads it to herself, checking the 
contents once more, but what we HEAR is DE FLORES. 

DE FLORES
(v/o)

There she is. I might as well be hanged as refrain from seeing her. Twenty times a 
day or more I force errands, frame ways and excuses to come into her sight, and with 
little reason for it, and less encouragement.
Movement on the surface of the water causes DE FLORES' reflected image to gently 
distort.
 

At no hand can she abide the sight of me, as if danger or ill luck hung in my looks. 
I must confess, my face is bad enough, but I know far worse has better fortune, and 
not endured along, but doted on. 
We track and crane up through exotic plants as JASPERINO appears and surprises 
BEATRICE.

JASPERINO

Yo, Sister!

BEATRICE

Fitness of time and place is here set down, Sir.
BEATRICE carefully slips the letter into JASPERINO's hand and leaves frame.

JASPERINO

The joy I shall return shall reward my service!
JASPERINO leaves as BEATRICE dances happily back into frame from behind a flower 
covered bush, and off through the gardens.

DE FLORES
(o/s)

Though the stones pelt me, I'll stand this storm of hail.

BEATRICE's joy is cut short as DE FLORES  steps out from behind a tree. She stops 
dancing and walks on.
MUSIC ENDS.

BEATRICE
(with childish contempt)

Your business! What's your business, you stagnant toad-pool!
We track with them through palm trees.

BEATRICE (cont'd)

Who sent you? What's your errand? Get out of my sight!

DE FLORES

My lord, your father, asked me to deliver you a message.

BEATRICE

What again? Do it and be hanged then. Just get out of my sight!

DE FLORES

Let beauty stay, but in patience, you shall hear all.

BEATRICE

You dallying, trifling, torment. You're wasting my fucking time!
BEATRICE swings around and childishly exits frame leaving DE FLORES all the more 
eager to pursue her.
MUSIC STARTS.
We DISSOLVE through to a wide static establisher of the stagnant pond. A canopy of 
date palms is reflected on the still surface. The CAM tilts up to find BEATRICE 
entering frame on the far side, soon followed by DE FLORES.

DE FLORES
(purposefully pompous)

Signor Alonso De Piracquo, Lady, only brother to Tomazo De Piracquo...
BEATRICE stands with her back to DE FLORES, hands on hips.

BEATRICE
(interrupting)

Slave, when will you finish?

DE FLORES

Too soon I shall. The said Alonso, and aforesaid Piracquo... have just arrived.

BEATRICE

Is there no one else to send me this message?
BEATRICE picks up her skirts and moves around DE FLORES to escape from him over some 
stepping stones.

DE FLORES

It seems my luck to be still in the way.

BEATRICE

Get away from me!
With a series of small leaps BEATRICE disappears across the water and away into the 
tropical gardens. DE FLORES follows with his eyes. His distorted face reflected in 
the stagnant pond.  

DE FLORES
(v/o)

So, am I not an ass to devise ways thus to be railed at? I must see her still. I 
shall have an urge within the hour again, I know it!
The water ripples more forcibly, distorting DE FLORES' reflection completely.

DE FLORES (v/o cont'd)
 
These foul chops may come into favour one day.

MUSIC ENDS.

CUT TO:

int. Asylum.  - DAY.

Two INMATES bring FRANCISCUS through the asylum, pausing  infront of ANTONIO as they  
pass by the metal bars of the cage. 


FRANCISCUS

Antonio, what are you...?
ANTONIO blows a kiss to his friend and waves as FRANCISCUS is carried away.

CUT TO:

EXT. CASTLE OF SANTA BARBARA BATTLEMENTS. - DAY.

Beside a tree up on the battlements ALONSO talks with his brother, TOMAZO. CAM gently 
cranes down as BEATRICE enters frame turning her head away as ALONSO takes and kisses 
her hand. VERMANDERO enters and approaches ALONSO. BEATRICE sits.

VERMANDERO

You are both welcome, but a special welcome belongs to you, Sir, to whose noble name, 
our love presents the addition of a son, our son, Alonso. The two men hug.

ALONSO

The treasury of honour cannot bring forth a title I so rejoice in!

VERMANDERO

You have improved it well. 

VERMANDERO turns and bends down towards BEATRICE, taking her hand.

VERMANDERO (cont'd)

Prepare, Daughter, the day will steal upon you suddenly.

BEATRICE stands and leaves with VERMANDERO.


TOMAZO

Alonso.

ALONSO

Brother?


TOMAZO

I see no welcome in her eye. She lies as if with another in your arms, the half-
father to your children in the conception. It is not to be thought on without 
suffering.

ALONSO

You speak as if she loves some other.

TOMAZO

Do you learn so slowly?
ALONSO

I'm safe enough, save your friendship and advice
for times of more distress, Brother.
VERMANDERO and BEATRICE walk away arm in arm, chatting. They stop and kiss.

ALONSO (cont'd)
I should depart an enemy; a dangerous deadly one, to anyone who thinks that she knows 
the meaning of inconstancy, much less the use and practice of it. 

ALONSO turns to TOMAZO.

ALONSO (cont'd)

But we are friends. Farewell, sweet Brother.
He takes his brother's face between his hands and kisses him on both cheeks.

MUSIC FADES IN.

ALONSO (cont'd)
 
We are bound in heaven to depart lovingly.
He kisses him tenderly on the lips, and leaves.


TOMAZO

Why, here is love's tame madness. Thus a man quickly steals into his own vexation.
TOMAZO turns and thoughtfully walks away.

CUT TO:

INT. COACH HOUSE. - DAY.

ALSEMERO and DIAPHANTA wait in the semi-darkness of the coach house. There is a noise 
outside. 

DIAPHANTA

I hear my lady coming!
DIAPHANTA quickly leaves. A door at the far end of the building opens and BEATRICE 
enters, her head bowed.  She passes a white STALLION tethered near the doorway, and 
approaches ALSEMERO who waits in a pool of light streaming in from windows to the 
left of frame.  She pauses before speaking, slowly and clearly, head still bowed.

BEATRICE

I have within my sights all my desires. Requests that holy prayers ascend heaven for, 
come not more sweet to my necessities, than you to my wishes.
They embrace. ALSEMERO speaks over her shoulder as he holds her.  In the shadows DE 
FLORES observes the scene secreted in an open CARRIAGE, smoking.
ALSEMERO

We are so alike in our expressions, Lady, that unless I borrow the same words, I 
shall never find their equals.

BEATRICE

How happy this meeting would be, this embrace, if it were free from malice.
ALSEMERO takes her face in his hands and draws her lips to his.


This poor kiss has an enemy, that wishes it were 
poisoned. 
DE FLORES exhales.
BEATRICE (cont'd)

How well were I now if there were no such name as Piracquo and no such tie as the 
command of parents!

ALSEMERO

One good deed would strike off both your fears. Remove the cause, and the command 
ceases; so there's two fears blown out with the same blast!

BEATRICE

What do you mean? What deed?

ALSEMERO

The most honourable thing about a man;
ALSEMERO draws his sword and holds it vertically. BEATRICE steps back.
ALSEMERO (cont'd)

valour! I'll send a challenge to Piracquo immediately!

BEATRICE

What! You call that extinguishing fear, when it's the only thing to keep it flaming? 
Won't you be involved in that action? That's the only thing I have. Say you won, the 
law would claim you from me , or obscurity be made the grave in which to bury you 
alive.


I'm glad these thoughts surfaced. Cast them from your mind!

BEATRICE approaches ALSEMERO, tenderly placing her arms on his shoulders. The 
STALLION moves restlessly. She places her arms around his neck.

BEATRICE (cont'd)

The tears would never have dried 'til the dust had choked them.
She turns and moves away from him, thinking out loud. 

BEATRICE (cont'd)

Blood-guiltiness becomes a fouler visage.

And now I think on one, the ugliest creature creation framed for some use.

We SEE DE FLORES exhaling once more. ALSEMERO sheaths his sword and attempts to 
regain BEATRICE's attention.

ALSEMERO

Lady!

BEATRICE
(to herself)

Why, men of art make much of poison, and keep one to expel another. Where was my art?

ALSEMERO

Lady, can you not hear me?

BEATRICE
(looking up and calling)

Diaphanta!

DIAPHANTA enters immediately.

DIAPHANTA

Did you call, Madam?

BEATRICE

Complete your duties and conduct this gentlemen the private way you brought him.

DIAPHANTA

I shall, Madam.

ALSEMERO

My love is as firm as love ever built upon.

MUSIC ENDS.

They hold hands briefly before DIAPHANTA and ALSEMERO leave. BEATRICE is left in the 
middle of the coach house as DE FLORES watches from the side. He takes a deep draw on 
his reefer.

BEATRICE
(to herself)

Say I loathed him as much as beauty hates a sepulchre, 


must I show it? Can't I keep a secret and have my way?
The STALLION seems agitated, and moves position.

CUT TO:

EXT. CASTLE OF SANTA BARBARA BATTLEMENTS. - DAY.

We HEAR a roll of thunder and distant gypsy music drifting up from the streets below. 
VERMANDERO points out over the city skyline then turns to ALONSO by his side speaking 
words we cannot hear. They then leave frame together.

CUT TO:

INT. COACH HOUSE. - DAY.

DE FLORES takes another draw as BEATRICE sees him.

BEATRICE
(disgusted)

Oh... De Flores!

DE FLORES

Lady.

BEATRICE slowly walks across to where DE FLORES is seated in the CARRIAGE. He takes 
another pull on the reefer and blows the smoke into her face.

BEATRICE

What have you done to your face lately?


Have you met a good physician? I think you've preened yourself. I am sure you used 
not look so handsome.

DE FLORES

Not I. It's the same face to a scab and pimple you called scurvy only this morning.

BEATRICE

Come here, man, let me see.
BEATRICE carefully lifts DE FLORES' chin with her middle finger.


It's just a rash. I'll make an ointment for you that shall cleanse this within a 
fortnight.

DE FLORES

With your own hands, Lady?

BEATRICE

Yes, my own, Sir.  In a work of cure I'll trust to no other.
She turns and slowly walks away with her back to DE FLORES.

BEATRICE (cont'd)

When we are used to a hard face, it's not so unpleasing; it gets better by the hour.

In fact, hardness suits a man's face;
She turns to face him.

BEATRICE (cont'd)

it argues service, resolution, manhood; as if it were due to hard work.

DE FLORES
(slowly, and leaning forward)

I would but wish the honour of a service so happy as that mounts to.

BEATRICE

We shall try you.

DE FLORES

If only you knew how sweet it would be for me to be employed in any act of yours.

BEATRICE

Come here, man.

DE FLORES

I'll have the work first.
BEATRICE reaches down for a rich blue velvet purse that hangs from her waist and 
lifts it up to DE FLORES' eyes. She then drops it onto his open hand.

BEATRICE

This is to encourage you, 


and because you are keen, and your task dangerous, your reward shall be precious.

DE FLORES

I'm assured of that beforehand and know it will be precious. The thought ravishes! 

Exit BEATRICE.

CUT TO:

EXT.  BULL RING.  - DAY.

MUSIC.
This is DE FLORES' fantasy. BEATRICE, naked except for bloodstained pants, writhes 
around in the sand of a bullring, covered in dried BLOOD. HORSES hooves pound around 
her, kicking up dust in the heat of DE FLORES' burning sexual ambition.

DE FLORES (cont'd)
(to himself)

Oh my blood! I feel her in my arms already,

DE FLORES lifts his hands up to his face as if praying. The finger tips are capped 
with solid silver tips that he clicks together creating a rhythm. This is inter-cut 
with the bullring .

DE FLORES (cont'd)

...her wanton fingers touching and praising this bad face. Hunger and pleasure will 
sometimes commend dirty dishes and feed heartily from them,


and what is stranger, refuse daintier for them. 


Some women are odd feeders...

DE FLORES lowers his hands and, from his facial expression and physical motion, we 
assume he is masturbating. BEATRICE sits up on her haunches, her hands quickly 
caressing her breasts and then moving down between her legs, as she arches her back. 
She then lowers a matadors' sword down past her breasts and, with her tongue sliding 
up the blade, licks off  BLOOD. MEN on HORSEBACK ride dangerously close around her. 
She turns the sword so that it points downward and gently moves the blade through her 
legs. DE FLORES lurches forward as he climaxes. Liquid drips onto BEATRICE's naked 
stomach. The bull-ring sequence visually introduces the concept of `Beauty and the 
Beast'.

CUT TO:

ext.  castle.  - DAY.

MUSIC ENDS.

DE FLORES steps through a small door set into one of the heavy castle portals. ALONSO 
walks brusquely into frame and up to him.

ALONSO

Ah! De Flores!

DE FLORES

My kind, honourable, Lord?

ALONSO

I am glad I have met you.

DE FLORES

Sir?

ALONSO

Can you show me the full extent of the castle?

DE FLORES

That I can, Sir, and I assure you it will be worth your time and sight, my Lord.

ALONSO

I look forward to it.

DE FLORES

By your lordship's rising I'll have the keys about me.

ALONSO
(tapping De Flores three times on the shoulder)

Thanks, kind De Flores.

ALONSO leaves through the door leaving DE FLORES to contemplate the future. The door 
shuts with a clunk.

CUT TO:

INT. ASYLUM. - DAY.

With arms stretched through the iron bars from beyond the asylum cage, LOLLIO is 
feeding an inmate, whose bare breasts are body-painted with a corset. Another inmate 
trembles and shakes with anxiety. ISABELLA approaches LOLLIO and follows him around 
from within of the caged arena.

ISABELLA

If you keep me in a cage, at least whistle, or let me be doing something.

LOLLIO

I'll whistle to you, if you pipe afterwards.

ISABELLA

Is it your master's pleasure or your own to keep me in this pound?

LOLLIO

Oh 'twas my master's pleasure, 'less you be pounded in another place.
LOLLIO stops and rubs his crotch suggestively, then continues walking, as ISABELLA 
follows within

ISABELLA

That's very well, and he'll prove very wise.
 An inmate dives under the skirts of the TALL LADY.

LOLLIO

There's company enough in the house if you wish to be sociable!
LOLLIO stops and puts his fingers around the bars to the cage. ISABELLA approaches 
him slowly.

ISABELLA

Afford me then the pleasure of your bedlam. What about your most recent lunatic? 
Pray, Sir, let me partake if there be such a pleasure.
An INMATE throws a handful of dust from the floor of the pit at the light streaming 
in from one of the windows, then clings to the bars.

LOLLIO

Oh, if I do not show you the handsomest, discreetest madman, then you may call me a 
fool!
ISABELLA walks off leaving LOLLIO laughing mischievously as he clings to the iron 
bars.

CUT TO:

 

EXT.  ALICANTE SKYLINE.  - DAY.
We SEE the modern day port and city of ALICANTE from high up on the castle 
battlements. A BELL tolls.

CUT TO:

EXT. CASTLE OF SANTA BARBARA BATTLEMENTS. - DAY.

BEATRICE stands with her back to CAM looking out across the city, over the stone 
battlements. Her beautiful dress flaps in the strong wind. VERMANDERO looks down from 
a caged window high up in the CASTLE walls. BIRDS fill the sky. ALONSO and DE FLORES 
approach the foot of a ruined tower and enter.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE.  - DAY.

From his vantage point at the window VERMANDERO watches the action below.

CUT TO:

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY. - DAY.

ALONSO and DE FLORES reach a landing half way up the stone steps of the tower and 
remove their swords in order to move more easily in the confined space ahead. DE 
FLORES leads on.

CUT TO:

INT. TOWER. - DAY.

The CAM glides gently across the wooden floor of the small round room in the tower. 
The space is dark except for daylight coming in through the arrow-slit windows around 
the edge. In the foreground there is a large ornately decorated casket. As a stark 
contrast to the doves seen at the beginning  of the film, now mangy looking PIGEONS 
sit on the window sills and floor preening themselves. With a loud crash the trap 
door entrance to  the tower falls open throwing up a large cloud of dust as it hits 
the floor. PIGEONS scatter. DE FLORES pokes his head up through the hatch. A 
frightened bird flies out of a window, others twitch around nervously across the 
floor. We HEAR a funereal DRUM beat. A black PANTHER sits unseen in the shadows 
watching. DE FLORES is followed up into the tower by ALONSO.

DE FLORES
(pointing outside)

All this is nothing. You will see shortly a place you never dreamed of.

ALONSO
(looking down out of the window)

I am glad of this leisure. All your master's house imagine I'm exploring the city.

We SEE ALONSO's POV of the old city below. 

BACK TO SCENE

Inside the tower DE FLORES leads ALONSO across to another window.

DE FLORES

All but myself, Sir.


My lord, I'll place you a casement here that will show you the full strength of the 
castle. Look out there.

MUSIC.

ALONSO leans forward to see out as DE FLORES steps behind him and draws a dagger that 
has been concealed under a sash around his waist.

ALONSO

It's magnificent, De Flores.
The DAGGER that DE FLORES holds behind his back glints in the light. As he talks DE 
FLORES raises his hand to strike.

DE FLORES

Yes, Sir. Keep your eyes straight, my Lord, take special notice of that battlement in 
front of you.

ALONSO

I am upon it.

DE FLORES

So am I!

DE FLORES sinks the blade deep into ALONSO's back. With a cry ALONSO falls back. 
PIGEONS flee from the windows. Blood hits the stone walls. We SEE the shadow of the 
DAGGER striking ALONSO again and again. We glimpse BEATRICE in a black and blood-red 
dress, running and laughing mischievously through a lemon grove. 

ALONSO

De Flores! Oh...
ALONSO turns to face DE FLORES who thrusts the blade up into his stomach once again.  
He looks up at DE FLORES in disbelief.


Oh, De Flores! Whose malice have you put on?
In the panic to fly out of a slit window a PIGEON gets stuck and falls. 

BEATRICE runs, laughing. BLOOD dribbles down the walls. DE FLORES holds the handle to 
the DAGGER that is embedded in his victim and leans forward as ALONSO slides down the 
wall into a seated position. He then lets go of the DAGGER leaving it buried up to 
its hilt in ALONSO's chest, who raises his hand in vain to pull it out. We watch as 
ALONSO's hand falls to the floor wearing a gold ring, set with a large blood-red 
stone. 

CUT TO:

EXT. ALICANTE. - DAY.

Through a fringe of palms we look up at the tower high on the castle above.

CUT TO:

EXT. BATTLEMENTS. - DAY.

In warm sunlight BEATRICE walks slowly along the length of battlement and looks over 
the edge, knowingly.

cUT TO:

INT. CASTLE.  - DAY.

Looking down from his vantage point in the castle VERMANDERO rubs his beard with a 
disturbed and worried expression. 

MUSIC ENDS.

CUT TO:

INT. ASYLUM. - DAY.

ISABELLA stands in the arena as madmen run around her, some waving burning TORCHES. 
FRANCISCUS approaches her, feigning madness.


FRANCISCUS

Oh, how sweet she looks! Oh, but there's a wrinkle in her brow as deep as philosophy 
itself. Drink to my mistress' health, I'll pledge it.
(grabbing his own forearm)
 Stay! Stay!

ISABELLA

Oh dear, it's too pitiful to be laughed at.

LOLLIO stands beside them listening with amusement.


FRANCISCUS

Luna is now big-bellied, and there's room for both of us to ride with Hecate. We'll 
tear their wolvish skins and save the sheep!
FRANCISCUS grabs LOLLIO around the neck. An INMATE walks through frame bashing a baby 
doll's head with her fist. LOLLIO fights back producing a DAGGER and holding it to 
FRANCISCUS' throat.

LOLLIO

So, it's come to this, has it? Then bring forth my poison again, mad knave, abuse 
your keeper so!

ISABELLA

Get rid of him. Now he proves dangerous.
Two INMATES grab FRANCISCUS by the arms and restrain him.  We SEE an INMATE with a 
serpent entwined around his body.


FRANCISCUS

Sweet love, pity me. Give me leave to lie with thee.

LOLLIO

Not 'til you get wiser first! Go to your kennel!
The two INMATES drag FRANCISCUS away.


FRANCISCUS

Shhh, make no noise... Draw the curtains round...

LOLLIO

Now Mistress, let me show you another sort. Let you be fooled again.


Bring in Tony!

ANTONIO is brought in by two INMATES. LOLLIO grabs him by the scruff of his neck.

ANTONIO

Ha, ha, ha,ha.

LOLLIO

Fear him not, Mistress, he's but a gentle fool, you may play with him as safely as 
with his tassels!

LOLLIO grabs ANTONIO by his testicles and squeezes, laughing bawdily.

CUT TO:

EXT. CASTLE OF SANTA BARBARA BATTLEMENTS. - DAY.

TOMAZO leans against the battlement walls, where he last saw his brother, looking out 
to sea.

MUSIC.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE HALL.  - DAY.

VERMANDERO guides ALSEMERO and JASPERINO through the castle showing them around. A 
dog sits tethered at the far end of the hall. 

VERMANDERO

Valencia speaks so nobly of you, Sir, I wish I had a daughter for you.
BEATRICE enters slowly, some distance behind the others.

ALSEMERO
(referring back to BEATRICE)

The fellow of this creature would be a partner in a king's love.
BEATRICE kneels down and strokes the dog. The others leave up and past CAM.

VERMANDERO
(o/s)

Come, Sir, your friend and you shall see the pleasures which my health chiefly 
enjoys.

ALSEMERO
(o/s)

I hear about the beauty of this castle wherever I go.

VERMANDERO
(o/s)

It falls very short of that, Sir.
BEATRICE watches the others leave, then looks down to the dog, thoughtfully.

CUT TO:

INT. TOWER. - DAY.

We HEAR a flapping of wings.  PIGEONS sit on the window ledge. A beam of light falls 
onto the side of the CASKET, lighting in its path a couple of PIGEONS on the tower 
floor.

CUT TO:

EXT. BATTLEMENTS. - DAY.

TOMAZO stands alone out on a battlement, with the deep blue Mediterranean stretching 
out beyond him. We HEAR ALONSO's echoey voice from earlier.

ALONSO
(v/o)

We are bound in heaven to depart lovingly.
(kiss)

CUT TO:

INT. TOWER. - DAY.

We SEE a C/U of the CASKET. It appears to be decomposing. The design on the facia 
bubbles and fizzes mysteriously.

CUT TO:

INT. HALL. - DAY.

BEATRICE walks slowly up the torch-lit hall, a prayer book clasped between her hands. 
To her surprise DE FLORES appears from behind a pillar to one side, blocking her way. 

MUSIC ENDS

BEATRICE

De Flores!

DE FLORES

Lady?

BEATRICE

Your looks promise cheerfully.

DE FLORES

Piracquo is no more. I have a token for you.

BEATRICE

For me?
DE FLORES hands BEATRICE a parcel of cloth which she unwraps.

DE FLORES

It was sent somewhat unwillingly; 
BEATRICE is shocked to find a severed finger within the bloodstained cloth. The 
phallic image echoing the horror of the murder, and forcing BEATRICE to confront the 
physical reality of the crime she had not troubled to envisage. The ring 
simultaneously suggesting not only Beatrice's engagement vow to Alonso and De Flores' 
sexual intentions, but also recalling Lollio's thrusting gesture whilst discussing 
the subject of wedding rings with Alibius earlier in the film. Thus the past (the 
murder), the present (De Flores' sexual intentions) and the future (the relationship 
between Beatrice and De Flores) are adverted.

DE FLORES (cont'd)

I could not get the ring without the finger.

BEATRICE

Bless me!
She drops her prayer book which lands in the dirt by her feet.
BEATRICE(cont'd)
 
What have you done?

DE FLORES

Why, is that worse than killing the whole man? 


A greedy hand thrust in a dish at court by mistake has had as much as this.

We DISSOLVE briefly through to a bullring in the afternoon heat. The MATADOR stands, 
sword behind back, tempting the blood covered BULL to charge. The bullfight reflects 
the battle of wits taking place between BEATRICE and DE FLORES.

BEATRICE

It's the first token my father made me send to him.

DE FLORES

And I made him send it back again, as his last token.

We cut away to the scene of the murder. DE FLORES lifts up ALONSO's hand and tries to 
pull the ring from it. Finding it stuck, he tries to free the ring with masturbatory 
jerks. The DAGGER in ALONSO's chest moves with the rhythm. DE FLORES fails to remove 
the ring and drops the hand to the floor.

DE FLORES (v/o cont'd)

I was loathe to leave it, and I'm sure dead men have no need of jewels. He was as 
loathe to part with it, for it stuck as if the flesh and it...

BACK TO SCENE

DE FLORES (cont'd)
 
...were one substance.

In a flash we SEE the DAGGER pulled from ALONSO's chest.

BEATRICE

Yes, at the stag's fall the keeper has his fees. 
We cut away to DE FLORES preparing to amputate ALONSO's finger which he has laid out 
using the CASKET top as a chopping block.

BEATRICE(cont'd)

All dead men's fees are yours, Sir. Please,

BACK TO SCENE

BEATRICE(cont'd)

...bury the finger, but keep the stone,
We DISSOLVE briefly through to the bullring as the MATADOR sweeps his cape around the 
charging BULL, and arrogantly walks away.

BEATRICE(cont'd)

...it's true value, take it from me, is near three hundred ducats.

DE FLORES

Well, that would hardly buy protection for one's conscience, fine though it is!

We cut away to SEE DE FLORES severing the finger with one blow. It falls to the floor 
covered in BLOOD.

MUSIC FADES IN.

DE FLORES (o/s cont'd)

But, being my fees, I'll take it. Great men have taught me that.


BEATRICE

You're mistaken, De Flores! It is not given as recompense!

DE FLORES

I hope not, Lady,

We cut away to DE FLORES placing the body of ALONSO into the CASKET. He throws 
ALONSO's feathered HAT on top of the body and then slams the CASKET lid shut. Dust 
blows out from the lid.

DE FLORES (o/s cont'd)
 
you would soon witness my contempt for it then!

BEATRICE(o/s)

You look as if you were offended.

BACK TO SCENE

DE FLORES

That's strange, Lady,

offended? Could you think so? Considering what I have done, how can you offend me?

BEATRICE

It's resolved then. 

BEATRICE reaches for the jewel encrusted cross which hangs around her neck, removes 
it and hands it across to DE FLORES, who does not take it.

BEATRICE(cont'd)

Here, take this, it is of great value. You have done well!

DE FLORES

What! salary? Is anything valued too precious for my recompense?
We briefly DISSOLVE through to the MATADOR teasing the blood-drenched BULL.

BEATRICE

I don't understand.

DE FLORES

I could have hired an assassin at this rate, and my conscience might have slept at 
ease and had the work brought home.
 Brief DISSOLVE through to the Bullfight.

BEATRICE

I'll double your sum, Sir.

DE FLORES

You double my vexation, that's the good you do.

BEATRICE

For my fear's sake, please make away with all speed possible,
Brief DISSOLVE through to a C/U of the BULL's blood-drenched flank.

BEATRICE(cont'd)

and if you are so modest not to name a sum that will content you, paper blushes not.
Again we DISSOLVE through to the dying bull.

BEATRICE (cont'd)

Send your demand in writing and it shall follow you, but please leave now!

DE FLORES

You must leave too, then.

BEATRICE

I?

DE FLORES

I'll not budge otherwise.

BEATRICE

What do you mean?

DE FLORES

Why, are you not as guilty and, I'm sure, as deep as I?
We DISSOLVE briefly through to the MATADOR as he plunges the sword up to the hilt in 
the BULL's neck.

DE FLORES (cont'd)

We must stick together. Come, my absence would draw suspicion on you instantly. 
There'd be no escape.

BEATRICE

This shows not well.

DE FLORES

You are to blame for it. I have eased you of your trouble, remember, I'm in pain and 
you must ease me. 'Tis a charity,
In a quick DISSOLVE we SEE the bloody BULL turn in agony.
DE FLORES (cont'd)

justice invites your blood to understand me.

BEATRICE

I dare not!

DE FLORES

Soft, Lady, soft. The last is not yet paid for. Oh, this act has put me into spirit.
Again the MATADOR sinks his blade into the agonized BULL.

DE FLORES (cont'd)

I was greedy for it as the parched earth for moisture, when the clouds weep. Did you 
not see how I threw myself into it, begged, would have kneeled for it? Why was all 
that pains took?
We SEE the BULL staggering, about to fall.

BEATRICE

You can't be so wicked, or shelter such cunning cruelty, as to make his death the 
murderer of my honour. Your language is so bold and vicious, I cannot see how I can 
forgive it with any modesty.

DE FLORES

Hah! You forget yourself! A women dipped in blood, and talk of modesty! You are the 
deed's creature and one with me.

BEATRICE

With you, foul villain?

DE FLORES

Yes, my fair murderess!

BEATRICE

De Flores! Hear me once and for all. I will make you master of all the wealth I have 
in gold and jewels. Let me go poor to my bed of honour, and I will be rich in all 
things.
MUSIC ENDS.
The MATADOR stands back admiring his handywork as the BULL begins to fall.

DE FLORES
(v/o)

Let this silence you. The wealth of all Valencia could not buy my pleasure from you.
DE FLORES takes BEATRICE by the hand and leads her away. With an awesome, echoing cry 
the BULL falls to the ground, dying in agony.

We pull focus from palms in the foreground up to the tower high up above on the 
castle walls.
MUSIC FADES IN.

DE FLORES waits patiently as BEATRICE moves hesitatingly towards him along the 
battlements. He then leads her to the entrance at the base of the tower.

The GHOST of ALONSO materializes out of nowhere under a tree on the battlements, 
staring towards the tower.

CUT TO:

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY. - DAY.

DE FLORES waits on the landing as BEATRICE timidly makes her way up the stone steps 
of the tower, sobbing.

BEATRICE
(v/o)

Vengeance begins. Murder, I see, is followed by more sins. Was my creation in the 
womb so cursed, it must engender with a viper first?
 DE FLORES patiently shows the way up.

CUT TO:

INT. TOWER. - DAY.

At a low angle the CAM moves slowly away from the CASKET in which ALONSO's body is 
hidden and across to the hatch through which DE FLORES pokes his head. The trap door 
lands back on the floor with a bang, throwing up a cloud of dust. PIGEONS fly to 
safety. DE FLORES stares down towards BEATRICE below. The CAM moves around once more 
to SEE the CASKET across the room. BEATRICE stumbles up wooden steps and through the 
hatch into the room, sobbing. DE FLORES takes her hand and leads her across to the 
CASKET and sits her on it. He then steps behind clearing her hair from her back and 
clumsily starts undoing her corset. The black PANTHER observes from the darkness.

CUT TO:

EXT. BATTLEMENTS. - DAY.

The GHOST of ALONSO appears out of nowhere once again, crouching under trees on the 
battlements. He then fades from view.

CUT TO:

INT. TOWER. - DAY.

PIGEONS wander across the wooden floor of the tower, others preen themselves. DE 
FLORES stands behind BEATRICE as she sobs looking down at the defecating PIGEONS at 
her feet.

DE FLORES
(v/o)

Come, rise, and shroud your blushes in my bosom. Silence is one of pleasure's best 
receipts. Your peace is bought forever in this yielding. You'll love anon what you so 
feared, and dared not venture on.

MUSIC CHANGES TEMPO.

BLOOD oozes from the grouting in the wall of the tower and dribbles to the floor. 
BEATRICE is lying on the lid of the CASKET. DE FLORES pulls her bodice from her 
breasts and feels his way down to her skirts, which he throws roughly up and out of 
his way. BLOOD dribbles down the walls. 

DE FLORES' hand glides up BEATRICE's leg, across a tattooed crucifix. The BLOOD 
streams down the wall. BEATRICE covers her face in shame, sobbing.  The shadow of a 
DAGGER being thrust is cast on the blood stained wall. DE FLORES' hand moves down the 
naked flesh of BEATRICE's thigh to her knee. More BLOOD oozes from the walls. Again 
DE FLORES caresses her flesh. He slowly removes her underwear as she writhes on the 
CASKET bare breasted.

CHOIRS SING.

He rummages within her skirts as more BLOOD dribbles from the  stone walls. The 
richness of Beatrice's garments are like an ornate tablecloth, underneath which lies 
the freshly slaughtered corpse of her husband to be. Beatrice becomes the filling in 
a grotesque carnal sandwich between Alonso and De Flores. The analogies to food and 
sexual appetite within the play are well known. The images of butchery cast as 
shadows on the stone walls of the phallic tower, relating to Alonso's murder, serve 
as a reminder of the slaughter-house which human carnivores wish to forget as they 
devour their meat. The blood that dribbles down the walls not only alludes to 
Beatrice's lost virginity, but flows like red wine.  A small feather is carried past 
BEATRICE's discarded pants by a breeze. DE FLORES now pounds relentlessly. Her skirts 
move to the rhythm. The pain shows on BEATRICE's wretched face. The shadowy knife 
strikes again and again. The CAM moves slowly down from DE FLORES' straining face 
past BEATRICE's tear drenched cheek-bone to her outstretched hand which clutches the 
jewel encrusted crucifix.  The CASKET lid creeks with the movement. BEATRICE's hand 
slowly opens due to the pounding motion and the cross drops to the floor. In a FLASH-
BACK we SEE DE FLORES swipe the DAGGER down as he severs the finger. BLOOD spurts 
onto the wall. We SEE BEATRICE's CRUCIFIX lying on the floor next to her discarded 
pants. The CAM tilts gently up the side of the CASKET, past the blood stain left when 
DE FLORES used the box as a chopping block, and up to BEATRICE's face. 

CUT TO:

EXT.  FESTIVAL DE ChristianOs y moros. - DAY.

In a nightmare-like sequence the haunting image of the dome and towers of Alcoy 
Cathedral shakes due to the use of  SUPER- 8 footage. Down below armour-clad and 
hooded soldiers fire muskets as BEATRICE shields her face and ears from the deafening 
blasts. We SEE flashes of BEATRICE on the CASKET as she is deflowered.  Again she 
reels from the exploding muskets around her. She runs terrified through the mayhem as 
more and more blasts of gunpowder fill the air.

CUT TO:

INT. TOWER. - DAY.

BEATRICE lets out a sigh of relief as she lies still on the CASKET, a stream of tears 
down her face.

Meanwhile, in amongst the other INMATES, ANTONIO drops his disguise of feigning 
madness and talks quickly and frankly to ISABELLA.

ANTONIO

Now's our chance, sweet Lady! No, do not be shocked by this transformation! This 
foolish disguise shrouds your dearest love, the truest servant to your powerful 
beauties, whose magic had this force thus to transform me!
We SEE LOLLIO walking along above the arena. He stops to look down and listen.

ISABELLA
(o/s)

Oh, a forward fool!

ANTONIO
(taking her arm and kissing it)

There's no danger in me. I bring nought but love, and his soft wounding shafts to 
strike you with.
They kiss as LOLLIO licks his fingers obscenely up above, and then marches them off 
along the balustrade.

ANTONIO (cont'd)

Take no notice of these outward follies, there is within a gentlemen that loves you.

ISABELLA

Oh, when I see him I'll speak with him, so in the meantime, stay mad, it suits you 
well enough. As you are a gentlemen, I'll not report you, that's all the favour you 
can expect!

ANTONIO feigns madness once again as LOLLIO wanders back into the arena.

ANTONIO

Ah, ah, I thank you cousin, I'll be your valentine tomorrow morning.

LOLLIO
(grabbing ANTONIO by the hair)

How do'st thou like the fool, Mistress?

ISABELLA

Passing well, Sir.

LOLLIO

Is he not witty enough?

ISABELLA

If he finishes as he begins he is likely to come to something.

LOLLIO

Oh, how I wish my master was here.

ALIBIUS steps in from the shadows beyond the metal cage and looks in at LOLLIO and

BEATRICE stumbles slowly along the battlements, clinging to the stone wall for 
support. The GHOST of ALONSO materializes out of nowhere with a ghastly groan. 
BEATRICE reaches a vantage point on the battlements and crouches down. The GHOST is 
now up a tree nearby and jerks his head round to look. BEATRICE inserts her 
forefingers into her mouth in an unsuccessful attempt to make herself vomit (analogy 
to food and oral sex). The GHOST reels with disdain. That she is unable to empty her 
stomach accentuates the horror that DE FLORES is now inside her mind and body and 
there is to be no escape in the living world.

The wedding reception is in full swing. ALIBIUS and ISABELLA are among the guests 
that form a circle within which BEATRICE is seen dancing around ALSEMERO, who swigs 
occasionally from a beer bottle. FLOWERS are being thrown onto the newly-weds. 
VERMANDERO watches thoughtfully. The GUESTS become a blur as BEATRICE dances in 
circles around the room. Among them DE FLORES looks on, eating a white flower. We 
HEAR De Flores' words from earlier echoing around the room:

DE FLORES
(v/o)

Why, are you not as guilty, and I'm sure, as deep as I? Being my fees I'll take it...

DE FLORES' eyes are SUPERIMPOSED  over the dance footage. DIAPHANTA  throws flowers 
into the circle aiming them at ALSEMERO.

DE FLORES (v/o cont'd)

We should stick together... A greedy hand thrust in a dish at court by mistake has 
had as much as this...

TOMAZO wanders amongst the GUESTS searching for a clue as to his brother's 
whereabouts.

DEFLORES (v/o cont'd)

Is anything valued to precious for my recompense...? My absence would draw suspicion 
on you instantly... Piracquo is no more... There'd be no escape... Misery in her most 
sharp condition...

DE FLORES' eyes again appear SUPERIMPOSED over the footage of BEATRICE dancing. She 
turns and briefly sees DE FLORES as he takes a bite at another white flower.

DE FLORES (v/o cont'd)

Considering what I have done how could you offend me...? What makes your lips so 
strange...?
With each turn BEATRICE sees DE FLORES glaring at her. The joy she showed earlier 
quickly evaporates. VERMANDERO looks on knowingly, then lowers his head.
DE FLORES (v/o cont'd)

Why, are you not as guilty, and I'm sure as deep as I...?
The MUSIC becomes a mush of doom-laden, echoing, drum beats. TOMAZO observes as 
BEATRICE hides her face in shame and then runs out of the hall. VERMANDERO looks

BEATRICE bursts into the small room and slams the door shut. She turns and leans back 
against it with a sigh of momentary relief followed by a look of despair. She then 
puts her hands on her stomach, caressing it. She is wearing her wedding ring.

BEATRICE
(v/o)

This fellow has undone me endlessly, never was a bride so fearfully distressed. The 
more I think upon this ensuing night, and whom I am to cope with in embrace, the more 
I dive into my own distress.
Beatrice looks over to a bed across the room on which there lies a small box, similar 
to a scaled down replica of the casket in the tower.

BEATRICE (cont'd)

There is no venturing into his bed, whatever course I take.
BEATRICE moves slowly across the room to the bed. She picks up a bottle of pills from 
beside the box, and holding them tightly in her hand, turns to sit on the side of the 
bed. She opens the box which contains more bottles of potions, and lifts a few out to 
examine. One bottle has the letter 'M' inscribed on it. BEATRICE then notices a large 
book which lies face down and open on the bed. She lifts it up and reads aloud:

BEATRICE (cont'd)

"How to know whether a woman be with child or not. Give her two spoonfuls of the 
white water in glass 'C'."

VERMANDERO

When did they leave the castle?

DE FLORES

Some weeks ago, Sir. One intending to go to Briamata, and the other to Valencia.

VERMANDERO

The timing accuses them. A charge of murder will be brought within my castle gates, 
Piracquo's murder.
DE FLORES moves uncomfortably.
VERMANDERO (cont'd)

I cannot account for their absence. A warrant of arrest will be issued, and either 
wipe the stain off clear, or openly uncover it.


Go to it!

DE FLORES leaves as VERMANDERO sits under the tree to ponder.

CUT TO:

INT. ALSEMERO'S ROOM. - DAY.

BEATRICE continues reading aloud from the large book on her lap:

BEATRICE

"How to know whether a woman be a virgin or not."
BEATRICE looks up from the book. We cut away to a shot of JASPERINO holding BOTTLE 
'M' in his hand.

BEATRICE (v/o cont'd)

If this should be applied, what should become of me?
BEATRICE looks down to read on. We cut away to a scene in which JASPERINO looks on as 
ALSEMERO asks BEATRICE to sample the potion in BOTTLE 'M'.

BEATRICE (v/o cont'd)

"Give the party you suspect the quantity of a spoonful of the water in bottle 'M', 
which upon her that is a virgin makes her hysterical. Otherside, nothing.

There is a noise outside the room and BEATRICE quickly puts down the book and stands. 
DIAPHANTA bursts in.

DIAPHANTA
(59. 50, 14)
Madam, why are you in here?

BEATRICE
(sternly)

I came in here, wench, to look for my lord.

DIAPHANTA

Why, he's with the guests.

BEATRICE

There let him be!

DIAPHANTA crosses the room and sits on the bed.

DIAPHANTA

It is ever the bride's fashion, towards bedtime, to set light by her joys.

BEATRICE

Her joys? you mean her fears!

DIAPHANTA

Fear of what?
BEATRICE turns away and walks towards the window with her back to DIAPHANTA.

BEATRICE

I will give... a thousand ducats...
She turns to face DIAPHANTA.
BEATRICE (cont'd)

...to the woman who will try what I fear and tell me true, tomorrow, when she arises, 
if it were bearable.

DIAPHANTA

Are you serious?

BEATRICE

You get the woman, then challenge me, and see if I fly from it. 
DIAPHANTA moves as if to leave immediately.
BEATRICE (cont'd)

But I must tell you, she must be a true virgin or else there is no trial.

CUT TO:

EXT. BATTLEMENTS. - DAY.

VERMANDERO sits under the tree contemplating as TOMAZO jumps down the battlement 
steps and runs up to him shouting accusingly.


TOMAZO

I claim a brother from you!

VERMANDERO
(Standing, looking at him with contempt)

You are drunk, Sir, do not seek him here!


TOMAZO

Yes, amongst your dearest, if my peace finds no fairer satisfaction! This is the 
place that must account for him, for here I left him, and the hasty tie of this 
snatched marriage gives strong testimony of his most certain murder!

VERMANDERO

Certain falsehood! This is the place indeed! His breach of faith has too much marred 
both my abused love, the honourable love I reserved for him, and mocked my daughter's 
joy. The prepared morning blushed at his infidelity. He left contempt and scorn to 
throw upon those friends whose beliefs hurt them. It was most ignoble of him to make 
his break, so unexpectedly, and throw such public wrongs on those he loved.


TOMAZO

Then this is all you can say?

VERMANDERO

It is too fair for one of his alliance!
(stepping forward)

And I warn you, that this place may no more see you!
VERMANDERO storms off, leaving TOMAZO alone on the battlement.

CUT TO:

INT. ALSEMERO'S ROOM. - DAY.

MUSIC FADES IN.

DIAPHANTA walks to beside BEATRICE who stands with her back to the window, and speaks 
softly.

DIAPHANTA

Would you resign your first night's pleasure, and give money too?

BEATRICE

As willingly as I live!

DIAPHANTA

I've a good mind to earn your money myself.

BEATRICE

You are too quick, I fear, to be a virgin!

DIAPHANTA

What! Not a virgin! Madam, your honourable self is not truer, with all your fears 
upon you.

BEATRICE

I am glad to hear it. Then do you dare put your honesty to an easy trial?

CUT TO:

EXT. BATTLEMENTS. - DAY.

ALSEMERO's sword and buckles jangle as he walks quickly down the stone steps of the 
battlements.

CUT TO:

INT. ALSEMERO'S ROOM. - DAY.

We HEAR a ghostly sigh as BEATRICE opens the small box of potions and lifts out 
BOTTLE M. She turns to DIAPHANTA.

BEATRICE 

Take no more than I do.
Sitting back down on the side of the bed she takes a sip from the bottle and then 
hands it to DIAPHANTA who also drinks from it. We cut away to the scene where 
ALSEMERO and JASPERINO watch BEATRICE as she drinks the potion.

CUT TO:

ALSEMERO

(whispering to JASPERINO)

It never fails with a virgin.

BACK TO SCENE.

BEATRICE watches without expression as DIAPHANTA starts to sneeze uncontrollably. 
DIAPHANTA then begins to laugh hysterically.

We inter-cut between DIAPHANTA laughing and ALSEMERO and JASPERINO as they watch 
BEATRICE mimic her maid's laughter. We HEAR ALSEMERO's mock laughter.

MUSIC ENDS.

CUT TO:

EXT. BATTLEMENTS. - DAY.

ALSEMERO meets TOMAZO on the battlements, walking up to him with false politeness and 
walking around him in circles.

TOMAZO

Sir.

ALSEMERO

You are most welcome.

TOMAZO

You can take that back. I do not think I am, or wish to be.

ALSEMERO

It's strange you found your way to this castle, then.

TOMAZO

I wish I had never had to. I have not come here to give you joy and swill your wine. 
It is a more precious liquor that must quench the fiery thirst I bring.

ALSEMERO
(laughing)

This is not like you.

TOMAZO

Time and our swords may make us more acquainted.

CUT TO:

INT. ALSEMERO'S ROOM. - DAY.

BEATRICE looks on as DIAPHANTA recovers from the effect of the potion and sits down 
on a chair in the corner of the room.

CUT TO:

EXT. BATTLEMENTS. - DAY.

TOMAZO confronts ALSEMERO.

TOMAZO

This is the business; I should have a brother in your place. How treachery and malice 
have disposed of him, I must ask the person who took his place, which could never 
have come fairly!

ALSEMERO
(drawing his DAGGER and placing it down)

You will apologize for that, Sir.

TOMAZO

Fear you not, I'll have it ready drawn at our next meeting. Enjoy your wedding day. 
Farewell, I disturb it not. I'll bear the pain patiently for a while.
TOMAZO leaves as ALSEMERO shakes his head incredulously.

CUT TO:

INT. ALSEMERO'S ROOM. - DAY.

MUSIC FADES IN.

DIAPHANTA leans forward mischievously.

DIAPHANTA

Please, one more swig, sweet Madam.

BEATRICE
(unamused)

Yes, tomorrow, wench! Come, my honest, Diaphanta, we must devise a plan.

DIAPHANTA

I shall execute it well, for I love the burden!

BEATRICE

Around midnight, you must not fail to steal forth gently, so I may take your place.

DIAPHANTA

Fear me not, Madam, I shall be cool by then.

(standing)

The bride's place, and with a thousand ducats!
DIAPHANTA leaves the room and shuts the door. BEATRICE closes her eyes, her mind in 
turmoil. She then looks down at the box of potions beside her.

CUT TO:

INT. TOWER. - DAY.

We HEAR threatening DRUM beats.

The CASKET containing ALONSO's corpse seems to bubble and fester. We SEE a c/u of the 
blood stain where the finger was severed. The decomposing CASKET then DISSOLVES 
between images of bleeding mannequins. Trickles of BLOOD dribble down the mannequins' 
legs as the CASKET rots into a yellow slime.

MUSIC ENDS.

CUT TO:

INT. ASYLUM. - NIGHT.

A child cycles around the exterior of the asylum cage ringing a bell. Within the 
mayhem continues. ANTONIO tries to get away from ISABELLA who is wearing the disguise 
of a weird moustached man. She is on stilts that make her just taller than ANTONIO.

ANTONIO

Please, let me be!

ISABELLA comes up to ANTONIO and stands behind him, talking over his shoulder. 
INMATES look on.

ISABELLA
(her voice treated so that it is lower in pitch)

Art thou not drowned? About thy head I saw a heap of clouds wrapped like a Turkish 
turban. On thy back a crooked chameleon coloured rainbow hung, like a tiara. Down 
unto thy hams let me suck the billows in thy belly. Hark! How they roar and rumble in 
the straits!

ISABELLA grabs ANTONIO from behind and thrusts herself at him continuously like a 
copulating animal.

ISABELLA (cont'd)

Stay in the moon with me and we will ride those wild rebellious waves, that would 
have drowned our love!

ANTONIO breaks away from her, but she follows him across the arena.

ANTONIO

Touch me again and I will kick you! You wild unshapen freak! I'm no fool, you idiot!

ISABELLA

Oh, but you are, as sure as I am mad! Have I put on this habit of a frantic, with 
love so wild with fury to beguile the nimble eye of watchful jealousy, and...

ISABELLA removes her false moustache and her voice returns to normal.

ISABELLA (cont'd)
 
...am I thus rewarded?

ANTONIO

Huh, dearest Beauty!

ISABELLA
(with contempt)

Oh, no. I have no beauty now, nor ever had, but what was in my garments. You, a quick 
sighted lover? Stay away from me! 
She turns her back on him and walks away, then stops and turns.

ISABELLA

And keep your outfit on, you are aptly clad. I came feigner to return stark mad!

ANTONIO

Stay!

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE HALL.  - DAY.

MUSIC plays under dialogue.
ALSEMERO listens as JASPERINO confides.

JASPERINO

It was Diaphanta's chance to leave me in an ante-room, a private place we chose to 
meet. No sooner was she gone,

We DISSOLVE through to BEATRICE in conversation with DE FLORES.

JASPERINO (cont'd)

...when I heard your bride's voice in the room next to me. And lending more 
attention, found De Flores louder than she.

ALSEMERO

De Flores? 


Exposed at last!

JASPERINO

Then we both listened and they spoke... like lovers do.
DE FLORES kisses BEATRICE's hand, then looks up at her lustfully.
BACK TO SCENE

ALSEMERO

Then truth is full of peril. Such truths are.

CUT TO:

EXT. BATTLEMENTS. - DAY.

TOMAZO looks down over the battlements resigned to his brother's disappearance. In 
the distance can be seen the modern day buildings of San Juan. 

CUT TO:

INT. HALL. - DAY.

ALSEMERO sits alone and thinks  out loud to himself.

ALSEMERO

How can this hang together? Not an hour ago her woman came pleading the lady's fears, 
described her as the most timorous virgin that ever shrunk at a man's name, and so 
modest, that she ordered her to weep out a request to me that she might come in 
darkness to our bed.
MUSIC ENDS


CUT TO:

INT. ASYLUM. - NIGHT.

Everything is quiet except for the sound of dripping water. A WARDEN stands in the 
arena watching over the sleeping INMATES. Somewhere else in the asylum ISABELLA 
sleeps soundly and contentedly in the arms of 
ALIBIUS.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE. - NIGHT.

MUSIC FADES IN.
Lit only by flickering TORCHES, BEATRICE looks into the nuptial suite through a 
secret hatch cut into the door.

BEATRICE

One o' clock and still she lies with him. Oh, my fears!
She closes the hatch and turns away from the door, slowly descending the steps.

This tart serves her own ends, it's clear now, and devours her pleasure with a greedy 
appetite, never mind my honour or my peace, makes havoc of my right.


 She will pay dearly for it!

CUT TO:

INT. DIAPHANTA'S ROOM. - NIGHT.

DE FLORES enters the sparsely furnished room lighting his way with a burning TORCH. 
He stands for a moment looking around.

CUT TO:

EXT. CASTLE OF SANTA BARBARA. - NIGHT.

The CASTLE stands high above silhouetted by an ominous night sky.

CUT TO:

INT. DIAPHANTA'S ROOM. - NIGHT.

DE FLORES walks up to a window and takes a magazine from the window ledge. He holds 
it to his burning TORCH until it catches fire.

DISSOLVE TO:

 
INT. CASTLE. - NIGHT.

BEATRICE is worried. She turns away from the window to look up at the door.

CUT TO:

INT. DIAPHANTA'S ROOM. - NIGHT.

DE FLORES throws a burning magazine into the air and across the room. The moon lights 
up the smoke around him.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE. - NIGHT.

The GHOST of ALONSO watches, then averts his eyes sadly.

CUT TO:

INT. DIAPHANTA'S ROOM. - NIGHT.

DE FLORES throws another burning magazine across the room.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE. - NIGHT.

BEATRICE waits alone.

CUT TO:

INT. DIAPHANTA'S ROOM. - NIGHT.

Flames begin to rise from the burning floor. In SLOW MOTION DE FLORES turns to leave, 
throwing his burning torch into the flames that now fill the screen.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE. - NIGHT.

The GHOST of ALONSO looks across at BEATRICE. She rubs her tired face with her hand 
as she thinks out loud.

MUSIC ENDS. We HEAR a funereal DRUM beat.

BEATRICE (cont'd)

Some ill thing haunts this house. It has left behind a cold sweat on me. I'm afraid 
now, this night has been so tiring. This strumpet, had she a thousand
lives, he should not leave her till he had destroyed the last.
For a moment BEATRICE pauses, then, on hearing DE FLORES shouting, she looks once 
more up to the door.

MUSIC FADES IN.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE corridor. - NIGHT.

DIAPHANTA comes out from the nuptial suite and closes the door behind her. We HEAR DE 
FLORES shouting somewhere in the castle.

DE FLORES

Fire! Fire! Fire!

INT. CASTLE. - NIGHT.

BEATRICE puts on a gown and leaves the room.

DE FLORES enters the burning room and hides behind the open door.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE CORRIDOR. - NIGHT.

BEATRICE enters the corridor and leans on the wall waiting.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DIAPHANTA'S ROOM. - NIGHT.

DIAPHANTA enters her burning room. DE FLORES pushes the door closed behind her. She 
turns to see his evil eyes glaring at her.

DIAPHANTA

De Flores...

MUSIC CRESCENDOS

DE FLORES slowly raises his STICK. DIAPHANTA screams:

DIAPHANTA (cont'd)

 no... no... no... no!

DE FLORES shoots and DIAPHANTA falls to the floor with a scream.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE CORRIDOR. - NIGHT.

BEATRICE wanders up and down the corridor waiting.

CUT TO:

INT. DIAPHANTA'S ROOM. - NIGHT.

DIAPHANTA lies on the floor in the burning room, bleeding  from the gunshot, but 
still alive.

CUT TO:

BEATRICE jumps with fright as ALSEMERO enters the corridor and closes the door to the 
nuptial suite behind him.

ALSEMERO

INT. DIAPHANTA'S ROOM. - NIGHT.

DIAPHANTA begins to get to her feet as the flames roar around her.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE CORRIDOR. - NIGHT.

SERVANTS run in panic down the corridor in nightshirts. VERMANDERO appears in his 
night gown, crossing himself as he shouts.

VERMANDERO (cont'd)

Oh, bless my house and me!

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DIAPHANTA'S ROOM. - NIGHT.

DIAPHANTA sobs as she tries in vain to escape the flames through the locked door. She 
then turns to seek another way out from the furnace.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CASTLE CORRIDOR. - NIGHT.
BEATRICE turns to face ALSEMERO and VERMANDERO, as SERVANTS rush to and fro'.

BEATRICE

It's her chamber!

VERMANDERO

How could the fire start there?

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DIAPHANTA'S ROOM. - NIGHT.
DIAPHANTA confronts the flames licking at her hems, sobbing as she is engulfed in the 
fire.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CASTLE CORRIDOR. - NIGHT.
DE FLORES joins BEATRICE, ALSEMERO and VERMANDERO in the corridor.

BEATRICE

She's escaped disaster twice before!

VERMANDERO

Those sleepy sluts are dangerous in a house!

DE FLORES

Diaphanta's burnt!

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DIAPHANTA'S ROOM. - NIGHT.

DIAPHANTA staggers through the flames towards the window with her gown on fire. 
Finding there is no way out she runs  into the fire itself, her echoing screams 
turning to manic laughter. We DISSOLVE in and out of shots of burning statues filmed 
during the ALICANTE FIESTA. SUPERIMPOSED over the flames we SEE BEATRICE and ALSEMERO 
kiss at the altar. The burning statues fall to the ground as embers.

MUSIC ENDS.

CUT TO:

EXT. HILL-TOP. - DAY.

We SEE the city skyline at dawn. JASPERINO places his top hat on his head and looks 
out over the city, disillusioned. Fading up we HEAR the words of John Cooper Clarke.

POET

Heading out for a hard rock vein
in a 'fifty-three troop transporter,
to wear the stripes, the number and the chains...

CUT TO:

INT. ASYLUM DUNGEON. - DAY.

The POET stands reciting his words.  An INMATE cleans an exhaust pipe with an oily 
rag, as a rat nibbles at his damp jeans.

POET

...to mumble 'why I oughta',
southern hospitality, these syllables resound,
with southern-fried mentality,
penitentiary bound.
We cut away to SEE BEATRICE walking slowly through olive trees, wearing a red dress 
and sunglasses.

POET (v/o cont'd)

Hardware from Heckler Koch
and all the latest gimmicks,
a quarter-bottle of Mexican scotch

CUT TO:

INT. HALL. - DAY.

The castle hall is a burnt out wreck. Smouldering beams are strewn over the floor. 
The CAM tracks through the smoke following the feet of TOMAZO, as he approaches 
VERMANDERO, ALIBIUS and ISABELLA.

POET
(v/o)

...talk about me now that I'm gone,
I shot no citizen down,
'could of fingered anyone-
I'm penitentiary bound.

VERMANDERO

Noble Piracquo!

TOMAZO
(standing still)

Pray keep your distance, Sir. I have nothing to say to you.

VERMANDERO

Comforts bless you, Sir!

TOMAZO

I have forsworn compliment! I haven't got a kind word for you, or any man!

VERMANDERO

But we have news that will make us welcome.

TOMAZO
What news can that be?

VERMANDERO

Two of my senior men I expose to the law and to your vengeance.

TOMAZO

What?

VERMANDERO

You can thank these people. Speak, Alibius.

ALIBIUS

It was my wife's good fortune to find recently, within our hospital, two fools 
disguised as madmen, and their names, Franciscus and Antonio.
We DISSOLVE through to FRANCISCUS being dragged past ANTONIO by two WARDERS in the 
asylum.
BACK TO SCENE

VERMANDERO

Both mine, Sir, and I ask no mercy for them!

ALIBIUS

Now, what draws suspicion to them is that the time of their arrival fits exactly with 
the day of the murder.

TOMAZO

Blessed revelation!

VERMANDERO

More, Sir, more! I'll not spare my own men. They both feigned a journey to Briamata!

CUT TO:

EXT. ALICANTE SHORELINE. - DAY.

We SEE the city of ALICANTE stretching out before us.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CASTLE.  - DAY.

BEATRICE walks down a stone walled corridor towards ALSEMERO, her hands partially 
hiding her face.

BEATRICE

Alsemero!

ALSEMERO

How are you?

BEATRICE

How am I? How are you? You don't look well.
MUSIC FADES IN.

ALSEMERO
(taking a few steps forward)

You're right, I'm not well.

BEATRICE

Not well! Is it in my power to make you better then?

ALSEMERO

Yes.

BEATRICE
(hand hiding a slight smile)

Well then, you are cured.

As BEATRICE approaches ALSEMERO he advances forcing her to step backwards. There 
appear to be small blemishes on her face, and bruises or 'love-bites' on her breast.

ALSEMERO

Just tell me one thing, Lady.

BEATRICE

If I can.

ALSEMERO

Are you honest?
BEATRICE now hides her face with her other hand.

BEATRICE

That's a broad question, my Lord.

ALSEMERO

But that's not a modest answer, my Lady. Why do you laugh?

BEATRICE

It's innocence that smiles.

ALSEMERO

Neither your smiles, nor your tears, shall ever move or flatter me from my belief, 
that you are a... 


whore...

ALSEMERO grabs BEATRICE around the throat and throws her backwards. His words are 
repeated with rapid edits.

MUSIC ENDS.

ALSEMERO (cont'd)

A whore! You are a
 
whore!

BEATRICE
(walking away as ALSEMERO follows)

What a horrid sound that has! It blasts a beauty into deformity upon what face so 
ever that breath falls, it strikes it ugly.

BEATRICE turns to face ALSEMERO and strikes him with her fists.

BEATRICE (cont'd)
 
You have ruined what you can never repair again!

ALSEMERO
(shouting)

I will destroy everything to get the truth from you! If there is any left!

BEATRICE

You may, Sir, but please show me the ground whereon you lost your love, so my 
spotless virtue can tread on it before I perish!

ALSEMERO
(physically threatening)

Unanswerable! A ground you cannot stand on! You fall short of all grace and goodness 
when you set foot on it!

BEATRICE walks quickly away down the corridor, shielding her ears from his words.

ALSEMERO (cont'd)

There was a mask over your cunning face that suited you, now impudence rides in 
triumph on it! And what of this tender reconcilement between you and your loathsome 
De Flores?

BEATRICE
(turning to speak)

Oh, is that all?

ALSEMERO

Worse! Your lust's devil!

ALSEMERO shouts into BEATRICE's face. The action is repeated as before using 
different CAM angles.

ALSEMERO (cont'd)
 
Your adultery!


Adultery! 


Adultery!

BEATRICE strikes back, slapping ALSEMERO across the face.

Beatrice

If anyone but yourself had said that it would turn them into a villain!

ALSEMERO
(shouting)

It was witnessed by Diaphanta!

BEATRICE
(striking ALSEMERO again)

Oh, is your witness dead then?

ALSEMERO

I wager... the wages of her knowledge, poor soul. She lived not long after the 
discovery.

BEATRICE
(quietly with tenderness)

Then hear a story of no less horror. Your love has made me a cruel murderess, a 
bloody one. I have kissed poison for it, stroked a serpent. That thing of hate, 
worthy of no better employment, I caused to murder innocent Piracquo having no better 
means to assure yourself to me... 
 
BEATRICE walks towards ALSEMERO desperately trying to put her arms around him as he 
pushes her away.

MUSIC FADES IN.

BEATRICE (cont'd)

Forget not, Sir, it was done for your sake.

ALSEMERO

You should of gone a thousand miles to have avoided this dangerous bridge of blood.
(backing away)


We are lost!

BEATRICE
(clinging to him)

Remember, Sir, I am true to your bed.

ALSEMERO
(pushing her away)

The bed itself's a morgue! The sheets shrouded with murdered carcasses! 
(now grabbing her arms)


You shall be my prisoner. Get in there! 


Get in there!

ALSEMERO throws BEATRICE violently out of the corridor. We CUT TO DE FLORES entering 
the same corridor from the other end.

CUT TO:

INT. ANTE-ROOM. - DAY.

ALSEMERO flings BEATRICE onto the floor of the empty room, and locks the door behind 
him.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE.  - DAY.

ALSEMERO strides quickly through the castle. On turning a corner he comes face to 
face with DE FLORES. They stand motionless in front of each other.

ALSEMERO (cont'd)

De Flores!

DE FLORES
(insincerely)

Noble Alsemero.

ALSEMERO
(with false politeness)

I've got news for you. My wife has commended you to me.

DE FLORES

Well, that's news indeed, Sir! I think she would commend me to the gallows if she 
could, and I thank her.

CUT TO:

INT. ANTE-ROOM. - DAY.

BEATRICE hides her sobbing face in her hands.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE.  - DAY.

ALSEMERO gestures with his eyes to imaginary blood on DE FLORES' ruff.

ALSEMERO

What's that? Blood on your collar, De Flores?

DE FLORES
(trying to look down)

Blood? No surely not, it's been washed since.

ALSEMERO
(stepping closer)

Since when, man?
de flores


Since the other day. I nicked my self in... in... in fencing.

ALSEMERO

What price goes murder?

DE FLORES

What, Sir?

ALSEMERO

I ask you, Sir.

ALSEMERO continues.

ALSEMERO

My wife's beholden to you, she tells me, for a bloody blow you gave for her sake 
upon... Piracquo?

DE FLORES
(demonstrating)

Upon? It was straight through him, I assure you! But, she's confessed then?

ALSEMERO

As much as death to both of you, and much more than that!

DE FLORES
(quietly)

There could not be much more, except for one thing, that she's a whore!

CUT TO:

iNT. ANTE-ROOM. - DAY.

BEATRICE begins to recover and get to her feet.

CUT TO:

iNT. CASTLE.  - DAY.

ALSEMERO stands with his face very close to DE FLORES and speaks quietly.

ALSEMERO

You cunning devils. How should blind men know you from fair-faced saints?

DE FLORES

Let me go to her, Sir.

ALSEMERO

Take your prey. Go to her, Sir.

ALSEMERO puts his hand on DE FLORES' shoulder and leads him away, finally pushing him 
violently from the corridor.

CUT TO:

INT. ANTE-ROOM. - DAY.

ALSEMERO pushes DE FLORES into the room and locks the door. DE FLORES looks around 
for a moment, then hears BEATRICE shouting somewhere outside.
MUSIC FADES IN.

BEATRICE

Please, Sir, quickly... 
DE FLORES goes to the window and leans out, looking down.

CUT TO:

eXT. CASTLE COURTYARD. - DAY.

BEATRICE runs up to a DRIVER and pleads with him to take her away. He helps her into 
the horse-drawn carriage.

BEATRICE

Please! Quickly!

CUT TO:

INT. ANTE-ROOM. - DAY.

DE FLORES moves away from the window and quickly walks across to another on the other 
side of the room.

CUT TO:

iNT. CASTLE. - DAY.

ALSEMERO strides through the castle shouting with anger.

ALSEMERO

I'll be your go-between now! Rehearse your scene of lust so you'll be perfect when 
you come to perform it in hell!

CUT TO:

eXT. CASTLE COURTYARD. - DAY.

DE FLORES jumps from the window onto the roof of the CARRIAGE passing below. As it 
leaves the gates to the CASTLE he climbs behind the DRIVER and strikes him across the 
head with his STICK. The DRIVER falls from the CARRIAGE and DE FLORES then climbs 
along the side and swings himself into the cab, despite BEATRICE's attempt to stop 
him.

CUT TO:

eXT. COUNTRYSIDE. - DAY.

By now the driver-less CARRIAGE is being drawn at speed and out of control through 
the Spanish countryside. It approaches through the heat haze down a long straight 
road. 

CUT TO:

iNT. HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE. - DAY.

Inside the CARRIAGE BEATRICE and DE FLORES struggle against each other, grunting and 
screaming. We INTER-CUT with footage of them making love. Meanwhile the HORSES gallop 
onwards out of control. Inside the CARRIAGE BEATRICE screams wildly. We SEE flashes 
of bullfighting. The fighting between BEATRICE and DE FLORES, the love making and the 
heat, blood and dust of the bullfight are all INTER-CUT as the HORSES thunder along. 
De FLORES now holds a DAGGER in the CARRIAGE. He raises it to strike. They struggle. 
BEATRICE manages to take hold of the DAGGER and now turns it on herself. DE FLORES 
seems to be trying to kiss her. They slip around because there is BLOOD all over 
them. BEATRICE is seen to climax as she makes love to DE FLORES. The HORSES gallop. 
The BULL charges. BEATRICE and DE FLORES have their bloody heads together. We SEE 
BEATRICE caress the smooth, unmarked skin of DE FLORES' face. She now grabs the blade 
of the DAGGER that DE FLORES is wielding, takes the knife and stabs herself once 
again, screaming. The MATADOR sinks his blade deep into the charging BULL. The 
CARRIAGE wheels throw up dust as the HORSES pull it away into the countryside.

CUT TO:

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. - DAY.

MUSIC FADES.
Bunches of grapes hang in the warm sunshine as a gentle breeze moves through the 
leaves of acres of vineyard. Alongside the wind rustles quietly down rows of OLIVE 
GROVES. The sound of cicadas fill the hot afternoon air.

FADE TO BLACK.

eXT.  CASTLE GATES. - DAY.

PICTURE CUTS IN:

HORSES slowly pull the CARRIAGE through the CASTLE gates. The doors are swinging 
open. As the vehicle passes we SEE DE FLORES hanging out, eyes staring, and covered 
in BLOOD. We HEAR VERMANDERO. 

VERMANDERO
(o/s)

I have a suspicion as near as proof itself for Piracquo's murder.

CUT TO:

EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD. - DAY.

VERMANDERO and ALSEMERO face each other shouting. Behind them stand FRANCISCUS and 
ANTONIO, hands tied.

ALSEMERO

Sir, I have proof beyond suspicion for Piracquo's murder!

VERMANDERO
(pointing)

Listen, these two have been in disguise ever since the deed was done. You'll hear me! 
These, my own servants...

ALSEMERO
(shouting forcibly)

Hear me!

We SEE a TOP SHOT of the CARRIAGE entering the CASTLE courtyard. BEATRICE's BLOOD 
covered legs hang limply out of the side.

ALSEMERO
(o/s)

Those nearer than your servants shall acquit them guiltless...
The CARRIAGE comes to a standstill. BEATRICE's bloody leg  drops from the step of the 
CARRIAGE. VERMANDERO and ALSEMERO stare on with incredulity. A CARRIAGE door swings 
open, BLOOD pouring from it. Rivers of BLOOD dribble down BEATRICE's leg, forming a 
dark puddle in the sand below.

ALSEMERO (cont'd)

 Come forth! You twins of mischief!

With a tug, DE FLORES pulls BEATRICE from the CARRIAGE, She falls out onto the ground 
with a grunt. The others look on as DE FLORES pulls BEATRICE towards them along the 
ground by the hair. Her blood covered red dress is dragged through the dirt. The CAM 
tracks across with the CARRIAGE in the foreground. Behind it we SEE others are 
present, including TOMAZO, ALIBIUS and ISABELLA. DE FLORES drops BEATRICE at the feet 
of VERMANDERO and ALSEMERO, and stands motionless before them.

DE FLORES

Here we are! If you have any more to say to us, speak quickly. I shall not give you 
the hearing, else.

VERMANDERO
(to ALSEMERO, then down to BEATRICE)

A host of enemies within my castle gates could not shock me more! Joanna! Beatrice 
Joanna!

BEATRICE lies on the ground, her bloodstained face filling the screen. VERMANDERO 
steps forward.

BEATRICE
(whispering)

Come not near me, Sir, I shall defile you! Let the common sewer take me away.

MUSIC FADES IN.

BEATRICE turns her face slowly to look up at DE FLORES' bloody face.

BEATRICE (cont'd)

Beneath the stars, on this meteor... hung my fate, amongst things corruptible.

VERMANDERO starts to sob.

BEATRICE (cont'd)

I could never pluck it from him. My loathing assured the rest. My honour fell to him 
and now my life. Alsemero, I am a stranger to your bed. You were cheated on your 
wedding night for which your false bride died.

ALIBIUS

I know!

DE FLORES

Yes, while I coupled with your wife. Now we are both in hell.

VERMANDERO

We are all there. It surrounds us here.

DE FLORES 

I loved this woman in spite of her heart. I earned her love... for Piracquo's murder, 
and her honour was my reward. I thank life for nothing but that pleasure.

VERMANDERO
(to TOMAZO)

Horrid villain! Keep him alive for further torture!
de flores


No! It is but one thread more.
DE FLORES takes the DAGGER from his belt and thrusts it into himself. ALSEMERO holds 
VERMANDERO back.
De flores (cont'd)

 
And now 'tis cut!
DE FLORES falls to the ground dead, his eyes staring upwards. BEATRICE's red face 
fills the screen.

Forgive me, Alsemero.

VERMANDERO kneels beside BEATRICE and takes her small, bloody hand in his.

BEATRICE (cont'd)

All forgive. 

(27. 16, 05)
'Tis time to die when 'tis a shame to live.
With a final turn of her head, BEATRICE dies.

TOMAZO
(to VERMANDERO)

Sir, I am satisfied, my injuries lie dead before me.

TOMAZO turns away as VERMANDERO crosses himself in misery.

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. CASTLE OF SANTA BARBARA BATTLEMENTS. - DAY.

PICTURE CUTS IN:

ALSEMERO runs and jumps up onto a wall that leads up to a look out. As he goes he 
discards his weapons throwing them to the ground. The GHOST of ALONSO looks down from 
a wall as ALSEMERO passes by underneath. ALSEMERO stands on the battlement looking 
out to sea, deep in thought. 

ALSEMERO
(v/o)

Here's beauty changed to ugly whoredom, and obedient servant to master sin, imperious 
murder. And I, a supposed husband, exchanged embraces with a mistress, but that was 
paid for. All we can do to comfort one another, to stay a brother's sorrow for a 
brother, to dry a child from the kind father's eyes, is to no purpose, it rather 
multiplies.
We DISSOLVE through to BEATRICE blowing out a candle in the church.

ALSEMERO
(v/o)

Only your smiles have the power to relive the dead again, or in their place, give 
brother a new brother, father a child; if these appear all things are reconciled.

CUT TO:

EXT.  BEACH. - DAY.

A series of FOGGED and OVER EXPOSED shots of BEATRICE as she runs along a BEACH 
beside rough waves, her dress and hair blowing in the wind,  producing a feeling of 
freedom and nostalgia as the HAND-HELD footage bleaches out and the image fades.
