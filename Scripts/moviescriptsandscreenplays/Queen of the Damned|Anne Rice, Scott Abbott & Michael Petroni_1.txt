'The Queen of the Damned' Unofficial Script - Introduction





































I
have in my very own possession a copy of what is supposedly the unofficial script for
'The Queen of the Damned'.
It
is only a revised draft, and was subject to change several times before and during
filming. However, for the time being, it gives us all a fair indication of what to
expect...
If
you haven't done so already, I recommend you check out my 'Script Information' section
first. Also, after reading the script, feel free to visit my 'Personal Script Analysis'
section.

 

 

  
 
  
  
 
 
  
  


 

 

 
DISCLAIMER:

This may or may not be the *actual* Queen of the Damned script.
The script was readily available via a commercial internet auction site.
Portions are featured here for personal interest only.
