PRACTICAL MAGIC
Aunt Frances:(V.O): For more than 200 years 
                          we Owens women have been blamed by everything that's 
                          ever gone wrong in this town.
(V.O): Is that why people hate us so much, Aunt Frances?
 Aunt Frances (V.O): They don't hate us, sweetheart.
 (V. O): We just make them a little nervous.
Aunt Frances (V.O): Let's face it, Jet, We Owens 
                          women have always created a stir. It all began with 
                          your ancestor, Maria.
 A woman: She was a witch.
 Aunt Frances (V.O): The first in our family. 
                          And you are the most recent in a long and distinguished 
                          line.
 (V.O): Is that why they wanted to hang her? Because 
                          she was a witch?
 (V. O): The fact that she was a bit of a heartbreaker 
                          didn't help. Nor did it help that most of her lovers 
                          had wives on the hanging committee.
 Aunt Frances (V.O): But no, I didn't think 
                          it was either of those reasons. They feared her because 
                          she had a gift a power that has been passed on to you 
                          children. She had the gift of magic. And it was this 
                          very gift that saved her life. She was vanished to this 
                          very island. With her unborn child growing inside her 
                          belly. She waited for her lover to rescue her. But he 
                          never came. No one came. In a moment of despair, she 
                          cat a spell upon herself that she would never again 
                          feel the agony of love. But as her bitterness grew the 
                          spell turned into a curse. A curse on any man who dared 
                          love an Owens woman.
===== EXT. BEACH DAY=====

(V. O): Is that why Daddy died? From the curse?

Aunt Frances (V.O): Yes, my darling.
 Aunt Frances (V.O): Your mother knew She heard 
                          the beetles ticking for your father's death all day 
                          long. She knew that when you hear the sound of the deathwatch 
                          beetle the man you love is doomed to die.
===== EXT. HOUSE =====

Aunt Frances (V.O): That's how you came to live 
                          with us. You tucked you into our lives then. We've raised 
                          you the best way we know how.

Aunt Jet (V.O): In this house we have chocolate 
                          cake for breakfast. We never bother with silly things 
                          like bedtimes or brushing our teeth.

Aunt Frances (V.O): But with the sweets comes 
                          the sour.

Aunt Jet (V.O): So when you find yourself the 
                          center of attention
Young Gillian: Hi! You want to play?
Aunt Jet (V.O): It's not that they hate you. 
                          It's that, well... We're different.
Girls: You witch! Witch, witch! You're a bitch!
=== EXT. GARDEN ===

Aunt Jet: Gillian, Sally. The only curse in 
                          this family is sitting there at the end of the table. 
                          Your Aunt Fanny.

Aunt Jet: Oh come on. You have to admit that 
                          any man who gets involved with an Owens woman is bound 
                          to end up 6 feet under.

Aunt Jet: Spare me.

Aunt Frances: What about my poor Ethan?

Aunt Jet: Fate.

Aunt Frances: Accident.

Young Sally: Mommy died of a broken heart, didn't 
                          she?

Aunt Frances: Yes, my darling girl, she did.

Aunt Jet: My little witch. Let's go inside and 
                          do some spells.

Young Sally: What about my homework?

Aunt Jet: Pish! Tosh! You'll both learn things 
                          in the house. Let's go.

Young Sally: Come on Gilly.

Young Gillian: I'm coming, Sally.
=== INT. KITCHEN ===
 
Aunt Jet: Very good, Sally. You've been blessed 
                          with a gift.

Young Gillian: What about me?

Aunt Frances: We don't worry about you, Gilly- 
                          Bean. Your talents will emerge in time.
=== KNOCKING ON THE DOOR ===

Aunt Jet: Sally, you just stay right there. 
                          Keep working on your spells. Just keep working on your 
                          spells.
Aunt Jet: Get the bird.

Aunt Frances: Get the book.
A woman: I want him so much, I can't think about 
                          anything else. I don't sleep. He has to leave his wife. 
                          He has to leave her now.

Aunt Jet: Perhaps you might find one better 
                          suited.

A woman: I don't want anyone else. He's all 
                          I think about. Why the hell else would I come here?

Aunt Frances: Take the money, Jet.
 A woman: I want him to want me so much he can't 
                          stand it.

Aunt Jet: Be careful what you wish for.
=== INT. STAIRS ===
Young Sally: I hope I never fall in love. I 
                          hope I never fall in love.

Young Gillian: I can't wait to fall in love.
=== INT. ROOM===

Young Sally: " He will hear my call a mile 
                          away. He will whistle my favorite song. He can ride 
                          a pony backwards."

Young Gillian: What are you doing?

Young Sally: Summoning up a true love spell. 
                          called Amas Veritas. " He can flip pancakes in 
                          the air. He'll be marvelously kind. And his favorite 
                          shape will be a star. And he'll have one green eye and 
                          one blue."

Young Gillian: Thought you never wanted to fall 
                          in love.

Young Sally: That's the point. The guy I dreamed 
                          of doesn't exist. And if he doesn't exist, I'll never 
                          die of a broken heart. And if he doesn't exist, I'll 
                          never die of a broken heart.
=== INT ROOM NIGHT===
 
Gillian: Get the door. Sal, you have no idea.

Sally: Do you love him enough to marry him?

Gillian: Oh, come on, Sal, What's enough? I 
                          hate it here. I want to go where no one's even heard 
                          of us.

Sally: I feel like I'll never see you again.

Gillian: Of course you will. You can see me 
                          again. We'll grow old together. It'll be you and me 
                          living in a big house. These 2 old biddies with all 
                          these cats. I bet we even die on the same day.

Sally: You swear?

Gillian: (to her boyfriend) Honey! I need your 
                          pocketknife. (to Sally) Here. My blood. Your blood. 
                          Our blood.
=== EXT. POST OFFICE ===
 
Aunt Frances: Good morning. Hello, boys. Charlie! 
                          Looking good! God, what was I thinking? Oh, Franny, 
                          let it go.

Aunt Jet: Oh My goodness, Gillian's in Orlando! 
                          (to Sally) She's in Orlando!

Aunt Frances: I guess the Roto-Rooter man's 
                          history.

Aunt Jet: Well, according to that.

Sally: This is insane. She keeps going through 
                          all these guys.

Aunt Frances: Hopefully, someday she'l find 
                          a guy who'll go through her.
Aunt Jet: Hello, darling, How are you?

Aunt Frances: Oh, Jet, just give it up.

Aunt Jet: Never.

Sally: God, I miss her.

Aunt Jet: Oh, sweetie! Oh, dear.

Aunt Frances: Oh, Samson! Now, just knock it 
                          off.

Sally: All I want is a normal life.

Aunt Frances: My darling girl, when are you 
                          going to understand that "normal" is not necessarily 
                          a virtue? It rather denotes a lack of courage.

Sally: Well, it's what I want.

Aunt Jet: See this couple? He's having an affair 
                          with the babysitter. And she can eat a cake in under 
                          a minute.
===EXT. GARDEN ===
 
Aunt Jet: What time is it?

Aunt Frances: Any moment now. (to Sally) Where 
                          are you going, dear?

Aunt Jet: Most excellent.
Sally (VO): Dear Gillian, Today is our third 
                          anniversary and all I have to show for it are 2 beautiful 
                          little girls and a husband I just can't stop kissing. 
                          I don't even mind the beard. I wish you could see us. 
                          No more stones being thrown, no taunts cried out. Everything 
                          is just so blissfully normal. Life is perfect. Dear 
                          Sal:
=== EXT. SWIMMING POOL ===
Gillian (V.O.) I'm lying in the sun. I'm hanging 
                          by the pool. I've got a million friends. You might say 
                          that life is perfect. But I don't care about any of 
                          it. In fact, I only have 2 words to say to you: Jimmy 
                          Angelvo.
===EXT. ROAD===
 
Michael: Hey, boys, catch anything today?

Boys: Not much.

Michael: See you in a bit. Hey, Jimmy, What's 
                          going on?
===INT. BEDROOM ===
 
(Sally hears the beetles ticking)

Sally: I hear you. Don't.

Michael: How's Mary doing? She good?
===INT. BEDROOM ===
 
(Sally looks for the beetle)

Sally: That's can't be. No! I know you're in 
                          there.

 A woman: Michael, look out!

A man: Look out behind you! On your right!
 ( A truck hit Michael)
===INT. AUNT'S HOUSE NIGHT===
 
Sally: It was the curse, wasn't it? He died 
                          because I loved him so much!
Aunt Frances: My poor little girl. We had no 
                          idea when we cast the spell.

Sally: What spell? What are you talking about? 
                          Oh, You didn't. Please tell me that my own flesh and 
                          blood.

Aunt Jet: It was just a little push. You wanted 
                          so much to be happy.

Aunt Frances: We never expected that you'd truly 
                          love him.

Sally: Well, I did. And I want him back. You 
                          brought him into my life. You bring him back! I have 
                          never asked you for anything ! I never asked for spells, 
                          but do this! You can bring him back.

Aunt Jet: No, dear. You don't do that!

Aunt Frances: You don't do that.

Sally: You can do this. I know you can. I remamber. 
                          I found here when Mommy and Daddy died.

Aunt Frances: Even if we did bring him back, 
                          it wouldn't be Michael. It'd be something else. Something 
                          dark and unnatural.

Sally: I don't care what he comes back as. As 
                          long as he comes back. Please do this for me. Please!
=== EXT AUNT'S HOUSE DAY===
 
(Sally comes aunt's house with her two chirdren)

Sally (V.O) : This is only temporary, don't 
                          get too comfortable. There'll be no chocolate for breakfast. 
                          Homework will be done after dinner teeth and hair brushed 
                          before bed.

Sally: And as for you two my children will never 
                          do magic. Ever.
 ===INT. BEDROOM MORNING===
 
Kylie: Mom? It's time for us to go to school. 
                          Mommy. It's the same time as yesterday and the day before 
                          that, and the day before that. Out of bed, sleepyhead! 
                          I'm worried about Antonia. Do you know she puts on her 
                          mouse ears, she drives around town all liquored up. 
                          Naked! All right. I'll see you around.

Sally: Come here, you! I'm sorry, baby. I'm 
                          just so tired

Kylie:It's okay, Mommy.
Sally: Gilly.
===INT BEDROOM NIGHT===
 Gillian: Sally.

Jimmy: I was just thinking about you.

Gillian: You are always thinking about me. Honey, 
                          I just have to go to the bathroom.

Jimmy: Let's go together.

Gillian: Jimmy, come on.

Jimmy: I'm just kidding. Go.
===INT. BEDROOM NIGHT ===
 
(Gillian came home)

Sally: I was really, really happy. Sally We 
                          were going to open a botanical shop. Michael'd get the 
                          ingredients. And I'd make the stuff. He really loved 
                          my mint-oatmeal shaving cream. He couldn't stop eating 
                          it. I'm sure all this is really boring to you. But he 
                          really made me lough.

Sally: Angelov? What kind of name is that?

Gillian: Bulgarian.

Sally: Bulgarian?

Gillian: Huh, huh. He's from somewhere near 
                          Transylvania. He has this whole Dracula-cowboy thing 
                          about him. He's just so intense. I mean, he talks about 
                          our rerationship in terms of centuries. Sometimes we 
                          just stay up all night worshipping each other like bats. 
                          Thank God for Jet's belladonna or I'd never get any 
                          sleep.

Sally: Why are you taking that stuff?

Gillian: I'm not using it. I just give it to 
                          him every now and then. That's all.

Sally: So you're drugging your boyfriend to 
                          get a little shut-eye? Doesn't that seem strange to 
                          you?

Gillian: Maybe. And he's strong. So much stronger 
                          than me. He can survive the curse. Do you forgive our 
                          mother?

Sally: Sometimes.

Gillian: You'll never forgive yourself unless 
                          you get up and you get dressed and brush your teeth, 
                          because your breath stinks and you take care of those 
                          little girls.

Sally: Yeah. You're right.

Gillian: I love you.

Sally: I love you too, Gilly-Bean.

Children: Witch! Witch! You're a witch!

A Mother: Really, you troublemaker started this.

Kylie: I hate you!

Sally: Put the finger down, Kylie.

Kylie: I hope you get chikenpox.

Sally: She was just kidding.

Antonia: No, she wasn't, Mom. She was not kidding.

Sally: What's wrong with you? We do not cast 
                          and we do not toy with people's lives. Do you understand? 
                          This is not a game.

Kylie: No, you don't cast. You probably couldn't 
                          even if you tried! She has all this power and doesn't 
                          use it!

Antonia: I think you really hurt Mom's feelings.
===INT. HOUSE===
 
Antonia: Kylie thinks any man who marries us 
                          is going to croak.

Aunt Frances: That's such hogwash. What about 
                          your grandparents, Jack and Regina?

Kylie: grandma Regina died of broken heart, 
                          didn't she? How could she do that? Leave Mom and Aunt 
                          Gilly behind when they were just little girls?

Antonia: Why won't she talk about it?

Kylie: Was Mama good at spells as a girl? Why 
                          won't she do spells now?

Sally: What's going on in here?

Aunt Frances: Nothing.

Aunt Jet: Just making toast, is all.

Sally: Did you guys finish your homework? As 
                          stom's coming. Go check the windows for me, Okay. (To 
                          Aunt Frances) Making toast? I want you both to watch 
                          what you say to those girls. I don't you filling their 
                          heads with any of your nonsense, okay?

Aunt Jet: We'd never tell them nonsense, dear.

Sally: Good night, sweetie.
==INT. SALLY'S ROOM===
 
(Sally writes letter to Gillian)

Sally (V.O.) Dearest, Gilly. Sometimes I feel 
                          there's a hole inside me an emptiness that, at times 
                          seems to burn. I think if you lifted my heart to your 
                          ear, probably you could hear the ocean. And the moon 
                          tonight, there's a circle around it. A sign of trouble 
                          not far behind. I have this dream of being whole. Of 
                          not going to sleep each night, wanting. But still, sometimes 
                          when the wind is warm or the crickets sing I dream of 
                          a love that even time will lie down and be still for. 
                          I just want someone to love me. I want to be seen. I 
                          don't know. Maybe I've had my happiness. I don't want 
                          to believe it but there is no man, Gilly only that moon. 
                          (Phone rings) Gillian.
===INT. HOUSE===

Aunt Jet: It's Gillian.

Sally: I know.

Sally: What's wrong?

Gillian: I'm scared. Can you come and get me?

Sally: Where are you? I'm taking the first flight 
                          out. Watch the kids.

Aunt Jet: Just go to Gilly. The children'll 
                          be fine. We'll take them to the solstic celebration.

Sally: Why can't you two just stay here? 
Aunt Frances: We can't back out. We're on the 
                          committee. We are presenting.

Sally: Fine. But I don't want them dancing naked 
                          under the full moon. 
Aunt Jet: No, of course not, dear. Nudity is 
                          entirely optional, as you well remember!
=== INT. MOTEL ROOM NIGHT ===
 Gillian: The room service here sucks.

Sally: Let's get you out of here.

Gillian: I'm fine.

Gillian: He's been really crazy, you know? We've 
                          been driving for 2 weeks straight. I mean, not even 
                          straight. In these zigzags, back and forth. Damn these 
                          shose! Then today he says he wants a jelly doughnut. 
                          An he says to the kid, "Jelly doughnut, with cream." 
                          And the kid looked confused. And I said, "Jimmy, 
                          jelly's not a cream." And then the kid laughed 
                          and I laughed and then he punched me. He punched me 
                          real hard. The bastard! Blood on the moon!

Sally: I know.

Gillian: Blood on the moon!

Sally: I know. Get in the car.

Gillian: Where's my tiger's eye? It brings me 
                          luck. I left it. I got to get my tiger's eye!

Sally: It's probably in the bag, Gilly! Gillian, 
                          come on!
=== INT. CAR NIGHT ===

Jimmy: You drive.

Jimmy: You want some? Nope. Hey, Sally, you 
                          ever read any books by Louis L'Amour? Okay, Louis L'Amour 
                          is a foreigner and he loved all things cowboy. Just 
                          like me, Jimmy-boy. So Louis would write stories about 
                          rustlers. Rustlers who were really bad guys.

Gillian: (To Sally)The belladonna is in my bag.

Jimmy: They would try to steal the cattle. But 
                          before they could sell them they would try to take away 
                          the brand of the owner with an acid, or by scrubbing. 
                          Unfortunately, they could never get rid of it. So they 
                          would be caught and get hanged.

Sally: What are you doing?

Jimmy: Come on! You can't hide the brand. It's 
                          just you and me. (To Sally) Watch the road!

Sally: Shut up! Rustlers and branding! Louis 
                          L'Amour by the way is not a foreigner! He's from Noth 
                          Dakota, you asshole! Jimmy: Watch the road!

Sally: You're freaking ne out, Dracula freak! 
                          Give me the bottle before I plow you into a truck just 
                          to get you to shut up!

Jimmy: Calm down! You know, girls. I'm feeling 
                          very into sisters right now.
=== EXT. ROAD NIGHT ===
 Jimmy: (Singing) You were always on my mind, 
                          you were always on my mind...
=== INT. CAR NIGHT ===
 Gillian: He should've passed out by now. You 
                          don't give him enough?

Sally: I gave him plenty.

Gillian: What's he going to do?

Sally: Just stay calm.
(Jimmy gets into the car)

Jimmy: (Singing) If I made you feel second best, 
                          I'm so sorry, I was blind. you were always on my mind...

Gillian: Jimmy, please, baby. Come on, baby, 
                          I love you.

Jimmy: I'm sorry, my love. I want to be with 
                          you forever.

Gillian: I love you. Jimmy, please.
Gillian: Sal, He's out. He's passed out.

Sally: Oh, God!

Gillian: Oh, My God! How much did you give him?

Sally: I don't know, you know, I wasn't using 
                          a measuring cup! He tried to kill you!

Gillian: Come on!
=== EXT. ROAD NIGHT ===
 
Gillian: Please, God, if you get us out of this, 
                          I'll be good. I'll have babies.

Sally: I have babies, Gillian. I had normal. 
                          And I worked really hard to get that normal.

Gillian: It's all my fault, Sally. I didn't 
                          mean to ruin your life. I just had no one else to turn 
                          to.

Sally: Get in the car. Get in the car. We have 
                          to go to the police. It was self-defense.

Gillian: The old slowly-poison-him-to-death 
                          self-defense? Come on, Sally, they're never going to 
                          believe us.

Sally: You really should stop smoking so much.

Gillian: Why?

Sally: I'll probably get life. I should smoke 
                          two at once. It'll shorten the sentence. I really don't 
                          want to lose my children.

Gillian: I know. I don't want you to either.

Sally: What are you thinking?

Gillian: When Muchael died, you asked the aunts 
                          to bring him back.

Sally: But they wouldn't.

Gillian: Wouldn't. but couldn't.

Sally: No, They were right. He'd come back as 
                          something dark and unnatural.

Gillian: Jimmy already is dark and unnatural. 
                          I don't care what he comes back as.

Sally: No, that is not an option. That is not 
                          a choice.

Gillian: We don't have a choice, Sally! This 
                          is our choice!
=== INT HOUSE NIGHT ===
 Sally: You owe me big-time.

Gillian: Watch his balls.

Sally: You watch them
(Jimmy's on the table)
 Gillian: Okay, Jimmy, I will get you out of 
                          this but when I do, we are definitely breaking up. It 
                          is over.

Sally: What are you doing?

Gillian: Nothing.

Sally: Are you sure you want to do this.

Gillian: Absolutely.
(They cast spells)
 Sally: "Lips pursed, emit wind over tongue 
                          in motion, teeth on edge.

Gillian: Good enough, good enough.

Sally: "Touch bounded smudge of blue sage 
                          with braided wheat staw. insert needles through eyes 
                          of corpse."

Gillian: Through the eye?

Sally: n the eye. No way.

Gillian: I think we should wait for the aunts.

Sally:It's not like he's going to stay fresh. 
                          It's now or never. I need for you to get me something 
                          white to write on top of the star. Chop-chop! This is 
                          good.

Sally: Midnight margaritas! Come on!
=== INT. KITCHEN MIDNIGHT ===
Aunt Frances: I see a man in your future and 
                          he is gorgeous.

Gillian: He's big. But you're scared to death 
                          and you wind up like a frigid old hag. With your two 
                          frigid old hag aunts. I don't know where that came from. 
                          That was weird.

Aunt Jet: She's never been interested in her 
                          gifts. She just made that all up.

Aunt Frances: Don't lie. Gillian has her own 
                          magic. And we all know what it is.

Sally: Oh, please. Since when is being a slut 
                          a crime in this family?

Aunt Frances: What would you know about it?

Aunt Frances: When we put that spell on you 
                          for Michael we had to bind it with molasses just to 
                          get your legs to open up.

Gillian: You self-centered shrew!

Aunt Jet: Igrate!

Gillian: Witch!

Aunt Frances: A lesson they must learn on their 
                          own.

Aunt Jet: What about the little ones?

Aunt Frances: Not to worry, Jetty. A good piece 
                          of Maria's hanging rope will protect them.

Aunt Jet: You must promise us you won't take 
                          them off. Not until we come home.

Aunt Frances: We'll only be gone a short while.

Aunt Jet: Do you hear us? Promise?

Sally: It was a very personal letter.

Gary Hallet: Yes, ma'am, it was.

Gillian: Hello, there.

Gary Hallet: I'm not going to beat around the 
                          bush. I need to find your boyfriend, James Angelvo.

Gillian: I don't know where he is. I wouldn't 
                          exactly call him my boyfriend. He's more like a bug 
                          mistake.

Gary Hallet: Is that his handiwork there?

Gillian: If a man hits me, he only does it once. 
                          Can I take a peek at your

 Antonia: you came for breakfast.

Gary Hallet: I just came to talk to your mom.

Antonia: Great! She's having pancakes, too. 
                          Do you have a gun? Can I see it? (To Sally) He's here 
                          for breakfast.

Gary Hallet: I have a question or two.
=== INT. KITCHEN MORNING ===
 Antonia: He's going to stay!

Gillian: Oh, good! Good work. Now go back out 
                          there and keep them away from here.
===INT. POACH MORNING ===
 
Sally: Berradonna. It's a sedative. People put 
                          it in their tea to relax, calm their nerves.

Gary Hallet: Some people also use it as a poison.

Sally: Witch people.

Gary Hallet: Witch people. Witches.

Sally: I guess you found me out, huh?

Gary Hallet: Yes, I did.

Sally: You should come here on Halloween. You'd 
                          really see something. We all jump off the roof and fly. 
                          We kill our husband too. Or is that outside your jurisdiction?

Gary Hallet: Do you have any idea how strange 
                          this all sounds to me? I got people telling me you're 
                          here cooking up placenta bars you're into devil worship.

Sally: No, there's no devil in the craft.

Gary Hallet: So what kind of a craft do you 
                          do?

Sally: Do I do? I manufacture bath oils and 
                          soaps and hand lotions and shampoo. And the aunts .. 
                          they like to meddle in people's love lives. Magic isn't 
                          just spells and potions. Your badge , it's just a star, 
                          Just another symble. Your talisman. It can't stop ciminals 
                          in their tracks, can it? It has power because you believe 
                          it does. Wish you could believe in me.

Gary Hallet: Miss Owens, are you hiding James 
                          Angelov?

Sally: Not in this house.

Gary Hallet: Did you or your sister kill James 
                          Angelov?

Sally: Oh, Yeah. Couple of times.

 Sally: Antonia, could you make more of a mess?

Antonia: Mom, I'm cooking.

Sally: I can see that.

Gary Hallet: I assume you don't want pancakes.

Kylie: No, we want them! W e want them!

Sally: Be careful. They tend to use those as 
                          Frisbees.

Kylie: Can you ride a pony backwards?

Gary Hallet: Backwards, forwards, sideways, 
                          you name it.

Sally: Okay, first troll.

Antonia: Look!

Kylie: A star!

Sally: This is not yours.

 Gillian: We just stick to our stories. No body, 
                          no crime. I'm sorry. I'm feeling like shit. I'm not 
                          sleeping. I . Me. Mine.

Sally: That's all you can think about, isn't 
                          it? You.

Gillian: It's all about you. I don't want to 
                          fight.

Sally: Don't walk away from me. I'm sick and 
                          tired of cleaning up your messes.

Gillian: Yeah, you are right. You are always 
                          right. I'm just a mess. Just one big mess! At least 
                          I've lived my life. You hate me for it because it scares 
                          the hell out of you.

Sally: Gillian, I don't hate you.

Gillian: look at you! You spend all your energy 
                          trying to fit in, be normal! But you'll never fit in. 
                          Because we're different! And so are your girls.

Sally: You leave them out of this. Okay?
Gillian: All my life, I've wished I had half 
                          your talent. You're wasting yourself, Sal!

Sally: I want you out of here. I want you done.

Gillian: Okay, fine. I'm gone.

Sally: Good.

=== EXT. GARDEN EVENING ===
 
Gary Hallet: What was that, Sally? That was 
                          him, wasn't it? Is he gone or what?

Sally: Yes, you killed his spirit, but I know 
                          I took his life. I'll tell you all need to know. I'll 
                          tell you how I did it, where I buried him, what I did 
                          it with. I'll tell you how

Gary Hallet: Wow, wow wow, Hold on just a goodamn 
                          second, all right? One step at a time. I took on oath 
                          to uphold the law. I came here to bring in the bad guy 
                          because generally that's what I do. You asked me how 
                          many times I read your letter. I must've read it about 
                          a thousand times. I know now, It was your letter anything 
                          else that brought me here. It was you. And I'm all mixed-up 
                          about that.

Sally: The reason you're here and you don't 
                          know why is because I sent for you. When I was a little 
                          girl, I worked a spell so I would never fall in love. 
                          I asked for qualities in a man that I knew couldn't 
                          possibly exist.

Gary Hallet: One green eye, one blue?

Sally: But you do.

Gary Hallet: You're saying what I'm feeling 
                          is just one of your spells? 
Sally: Yeah. It's not real. And if you stay, 
                          I wouldn't know if it was because of the spell and you 
                          wouldn't know if it was because I didn't want to go 
                          to prison.

Gary Hallet: You know, all relationships have 
                          problem.

Sally: I'm right, aren't I? You don't know, 
                          do you?

Gary Hallet: Why don't you do what you do and 
                          what I do. and we'll see where we end up. Okay?

Sally: Okay.

Gary Hallet: Curses only have power when you 
                          believe in them. And I don't. You know what? I wished 
                          for you too.

Aunt Jet: It seems we've not arrived in the

Aunt Frances: I see our instincts are getting 
                          a little rusty.
Aunt Jet: He's squatting inside her like a toad. 
                          This is what comes from dabbling. You can't practice 
                          witchcraft while you look down your nose at it.

Sally: I know. Just tell me what to do and I'll 
                          do it.

Aunt Frances: We must banish him.

Aunt Jet: Force his spirit back to the grave.

Aunt Frances: We need a full coven. Nine women.

Aunt Jet: Twelve's better

Aunt Frances: Do you have any friends?

Woman D: I got the best news. Sally just came 
                          out.

Woman A: What a fabulous affirmation.

Woman F: Her sister just got out of a bad relationship 
                          and now the guy won't leave her alone. Can you bring 
                          a bloom.

                          a spoon. You can stir right over there.
Aunt Frances: You get right over here and grab 
                          that spoon and dig right in. Doesn't that look great? 
                          And the fumes are great for the pores. Not to mention 
                          sealing his nasty spirit back into the grave. 
Woman A: Once, I was across town, my daughter 
                          had a nightmare. I swear, I could hear her crying.

Aunt Jet:There's a little witch in all of us.

Sally: Everything's almost ready, Aunt Jet. 
                          (to Sara) I didn't expect to see you here.

Sara: Ever since I was a girl, I've wanted to 
                          see inside your house.

Sally: Thank you for coming.

Woman F: Is this okay? It's all I had.

Aunt Frances: Well, ladies, let's begin.
===INT. ROOM NIGHT===
 
Aunt Frances: All right, ladies, pick a broom 
                          from a circle.

Woman A: Holy shit!

Woman B: I've been strung out by a guy before, 
                          but this

Aunt Jet: Would each of you pick up your brooms? 
                          Hold them at staff length, handle to brush. Remember 
                          that as we go forth. It is only with our hearts beating 
                          as one that we can save the life of this child.
(Aunt Frances starts spelling)

Woman C: Are we supposed to say this?
(Everyone spells to get rid of James's spirit from 
                          Gillian)
 Sally: Stop it! We're killing her.

Gillian (James): Fight this, you bitch!

Sally: Oh, God! Oh, God! Gilly! Gilly, Honey!

Gillian: It's okay. I love you.

Sally: Stay with me.

Gillian: Please, just let him take me.

Sally: No, you have to hold on. Gill, you have 
                          to stay with me. Gilly, No, stay with me. Gilly, No, 
                          stay with me.

Gillian: No, he wants me. Just me. Everyone 
                          will be safe. Just let him take me.

Sally: Don't die on me, Gilly Owens, please. 
                          Because we're supposed to die together, remember? The 
                          same time. You promised me that. And this is not that 
                          day.

Gillian: I love you, Sally.
 Sally: Okay, wait. I've got it. Get them back 
                          in a circle.
Sally: Hey, Jimmy, I got a worm with your name 
                          on it. You thirsty? Is this is what you want? Well, 
                          this ...you can't have. My blood. Your blood. Our blood.

Aunt Frances: Maria's blood. Now! Push her in.

Sally: I love you, Gillian.
Woman A: We did it.

Aunt Frances: Hands up. ladies. Ashes to ashes, 
                          dust to dust.

Woman C: I wonder if that would work on my ex-husband?

Woman A: Come on, ladies, let's clean house!

Sally: Through kitchen. Follow me.

Woman A: Well done.

Sally: Sweep him to the roses.
===EXT. GARDEN DAY===
 
Gillian: Hey! There's something for you.

Sally: From Arizona.

Sally (V.O.): "Dear Miss Owens: Any further 
                          investigations. Office hereby concluded James Angelvo's 
                          cause of death was accidental. Jewely in ashes of structure 
                          provided positive indentification. Sincerely, Gary Hallet 
                          special investigator."

Gillian: I don't think he's in there, Sal.

Sally: What would you do, Gilly?
Gillian: What wouldn't I do for the right guy?
(Gary Hallet comes and kisses Sally.)
===EXT. HOUSE HELOWEEN NIGHT===
Sally (V.O.): Can love travel back in time and 
                          heal a broken heart? Was it our joined hands that finally 
                          lifted Maria's curse? I'd like to think so. There're 
                          some things I know for certain. Always throw spilled 
                          salt over your left shoulder. Keep rosemary by your 
                          garden gate. Plant lavender for luck. And fall in love 
                          whenever you can.
THE HAPPY END...
