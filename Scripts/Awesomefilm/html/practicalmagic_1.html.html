                        <p><b>Aunt Frances</b>:(V.O): For more than 200 years 
                          we Owens women have been blamed by everything that's 
                          ever gone wrong in this town.</p>
                        <p>(V.O): Is that why people hate us so much, Aunt Frances?</p>
                        <p> <b>Aunt Frances</b> (V.O): They don't hate us, sweetheart.</p>

                        <p> (V. O): We just make them a little nervous.</p>
                        <p><b>Aunt Frances</b> (V.O): Let's face it, Jet, We Owens 
                          women have always created a stir. It all began with 
                          your ancestor, Maria.</p>
                        <p> <b>A woman</b>: She was a witch.</p>
                        <p> <b>Aunt Frances</b> (V.O): The first in our family. 
                          And you are the most recent in a long and distinguished 
                          line.</p>

                        <p> (V.O): Is that why they wanted to hang her? Because 
                          she was a witch?</p>
                        <p> (V. O): The fact that she was a bit of a heartbreaker 
                          didn't help. Nor did it help that most of her lovers 
                          had wives on the hanging committee.</p>
                        <p> <b>Aunt Frances</b> (V.O): But no, I didn't think 
                          it was either of those reasons. They feared her because 
                          she had a gift a power that has been passed on to you 
                          children. She had the gift of magic. And it was this 
                          very gift that saved her life. She was vanished to this 
                          very island. With her unborn child growing inside her 
                          belly. She waited for her lover to rescue her. But he 
                          never came. No one came. In a moment of despair, she 
                          cat a spell upon herself that she would never again 
                          feel the agony of love. But as her bitterness grew the 
                          spell turned into a curse. A curse on any man who dared 
                          love an Owens woman.</p>

                          </b></p>
                        <p>(V. O): Is that why Daddy died? From the curse?<br>
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Aunt Frances</b> (V.O): Yes, my darling.</p>
                        <p> <b>Aunt Frances</b> (V.O): Your mother knew She heard 
                          the beetles ticking for your father's death all day 
                          long. She knew that when you hear the sound of the deathwatch 
                          beetle the man you love is doomed to die.</p>

                        <p><b>Aunt Jet</b> (V.O): It's not that they hate you.

                          there's a hole inside me an emptiness that, at times 
                          seems to burn. I think if you lifted my heart to your 
                          ear, probably you could hear the ocean. And the moon 
                          tonight, there's a circle around it. A sign of trouble 
                          not far behind. I have this dream of being whole. Of 
                          not going to sleep each night, wanting. But still, sometimes 
                          when the wind is warm or the crickets sing I dream of 
                          a love that even time will lie down and be still for. 
                          I just want someone to love me. I want to be seen. I 
                          don't know. Maybe I've had my happiness. I don't want 
                          to believe it but there is no man, Gilly only that moon.

                          some things I know for certain. Always throw spilled 
                          salt over your left shoulder. Keep rosemary by your 
                          garden gate. Plant lavender for luck. And fall in love 
                          whenever you can.</p>
