</p><p><p ID="act">by Terry Malick
</p><p><p ID="act">REVISED: 6/2/76
</p><p><p ID="act">SETTING<br>
The story is set in Texas just before the First World War.
</p><p><p ID="act">CAST OF CHARACTERS<br>
BILL:  A young man from Chicago following the harvest.<br>
ABBY:  The beautiful young woman he loves.<br>
CHUCK:  The owner of a vast wheat ranch ("bonanza") in the Texas Panhandle.<br>
URSULA:  Abby's younger sister, a reckless child of14.<br>
BENSON:  The bonanza foreman, an enemy of the newcomers.<br>
MISS CARTER:  Chief domestic at the Belvedere, Chuck's home.<br>
McLEAN:  Chuck's accountant.<br>
GEORGE:  A young pilot who interests Ursula. <br>
A PREACHER, A DOCTOR, AN ORGANIST, VARIOUS HARVEST HANDS, LAWMEN, VAUDEVILLIANS, etc.<br>
</p><p><p ID="act">"Troops of nomads swept over the country at harvest time like a visitation of locusts, reckless young fellows, handsome, profane, licentious, given to drink, powerful but inconstant workmen, quarrelsome and difficult to manage at all times. They came in the season when work was plenty and wages high. They dressed well, in their own peculiar fashion, and made much of their freedom to come and go."
</p><p><p ID="act">"They told of the city, and sinister and poisonous jungles all cities seemed in their stories. They were scarred with battles. They came from the far-away and unknown, and passed on to the north, mysterious as the flight of locusts, leaving the people of Sun Prairie quite as ignorant of their real names and characters as upon the first day of their coming."<br><br>						Hamlin Garland, Boy Life on the Prairie (1899) </b></I>
</p><p><p ID="act">DAYS OF HEAVEN
</p><p><p ID="slug">1	INT. CHICAGO MILL - SERIES OF ANGLES
</p><p><p ID="act">WORKERS in a dark Chicago mill pound molten iron out in flaming sheets. The year is 1916.
</p><p><p ID="slug">2	EXT. MILL
</p><p><p ID="act">BILL, a handsome young man from the slums, and his brother
STEVE sit outside on their lunch break talking with an
older man named BLACKIE. By the look of his flashy clothes
Blackie is not a worker.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BLACKIE
<P ID="dia">Listen, if I ever seen a tit, this here's a tit. You understand? Candy. My kid sister could do this one. Pure fucking candy'd melt in your hand. Don't take brains. Just a set of rocks. I told you this already.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">STEVE
<P ID="dia">Blackie, you told me it was going to snow in the winter, I'd go out and bet against it. You know?
<P ID="spkdir">(to Bill)
<P ID="dia">There is nothing, nothing in the world, dumber than a dumb guinea.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BLACKIE
<P ID="dia">Okay, all right, fine. Why should I be doing favors for a guy that isn't doing me any favors? I must be losing my grip.
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">I got to give it to you, though. Couple of guys look like you just rolled in on a wagonload of chickens. You ever get laid?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">STEVE
<P ID="dia">Sure.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BLACKIE
<P ID="dia">Without a lot of talk, I mean? 'Cause I'm beginning to understand these guys, go down the hotel, pick something up for a couple of bucks. It's clean, and you know what you're in for.
</p><p><p ID="slug">3	EXT. ALLEY
</p><p><p ID="act">Sam the Collector's GANG swaggers around in the alley behind a textile plant. ONE of them has filed his teeth down to points and stuck diamonds in between them. ANOTHER wears big suspenders.
Sam and Bill appear to know one another.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SAM
<P ID="dia">Hey, Billy, you made a mistake. You made somebody mad. Nothing personal, okay? It's just gotta be done. You made a mistake. Happens in the best of families.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I paid you everything I have. Search me. The rest he gets next week.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SAM
<P ID="dia">Listen, what happens if I don't do this? I gotta leave town?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I could do something, you know. You guys wanta do something to me, I know who to tell about it. You guys ought to think about that. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SAM
<P ID="dia">You maybe already did something. Maybe that's why you're here, on account of you already done something.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I haven't done anything.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SAM
<P ID="dia">Then you're all right, Billy.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">RAZOR TEETH
<P ID="dia">You got nothing to worry about.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SAM
<P ID="dia">Cut it out, Billy, all right? You know what can happen to a guy that doesn't wanta do what people tell him? You know. So don't give us a lot of trouble. You're liable to get everybody all pissed off.
</p><p><p ID="act">Sam, a busy man, checks his watch.
</p><p><p ID="slug">4	NEW ANGLE
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill puts his hand on the ground. Sam drops a keg of roofing nails on it and, his work done, leaves with his gang. Bill sobs with pain.
</p><p><p ID="slug">5	EXT. LOT BEYOND MILL
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill and Steve drag a safe by a rope through a vacant lot beyond the mill. Blackie walks behind.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BLACKIE
<P ID="dia">You know what I'm doing with my end? Buy a boat. Get that? I had a boat. I had a nice apartment, I had a boat. Margie don't like that. We got to have a house. "I can't afford no house," I said. She says, "Sell the boat." I didn't want to sell my boat. I didn't want to buy the house. I sell the boat, I buy the house. Nine years we had the house, eight of them she's after me, we should get another boat. I give up.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">STEVE
<P ID="dia">Same as always, I do all the work, you gripe about it.
Suddenly FOUR POLICEMEN surprise them from ambush. Bill lets go of the rope and starts to run. Steve does not give up immediately, however, and they shoot him down. Bill picks up Steve's gun and fires back. Three of the Policemen go chasing after Blackie, whom they soon bring to heel. The FOURTH stays behind taking potshots at Bill while he attends to Steve.
</p><p><p ID="slug">6	TIGHT ON STEVE
</p><p><p ID="act">Steve, badly wounded, is about to die.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">STEVE
<P ID="dia">Run. Get out of here.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="spkdir">(weeping)
<P ID="dia">I love you so much. Why didn't  you run. Don't die.
Steve dies. Bullets kick up dust around him. He takes off running. One of the bullets has caught him in the shoulder.
</p><p><p ID="slug">7	INT. SEWER
</p><p><p ID="act">ABBY, a beautiful woman in her late twenties, attends to Bill's wounds in a big vaulted sewer. Her sister URSULA, a reckless girl of14, stands watch.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="spkdir">(weeping)
<P ID="dia">They shot the shit out of him. My brother. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Hold still, or I can't do anything.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I love you, Abby. You're so good to me. Remember how much fun we had, on the roof...
</p><p><p ID="slug">8	EXT. ROOF - MATTE SHOT
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill and Abby flirt on the root of a tenement, happily in love. The city stretches out behind them.
</p><p><p ID="slug">9	INT. BED - QUICK CUT
</p><p><p ID="act">Abby lies shivering with fever.  Bill spoons hot soup into her mouth. Ursula rolls paper flowers for extra change.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL (o.s.)
<P ID="spkdir">(continuing)
<P ID="dia">... even when you were sick and I was in the mill.
</p><p><p ID="slug">10	INT. MILL - QUICK CUT (VARIOUS ANGLES OF OTHER WORKERS)
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill works in the glow of a blast furnace. He does not seem quite in place with the rest of the workers. A pencil moustache lends a desired gentlemanliness to his appearance. He looks fallen on hard times, without ever having known any better--like Chaplin, an immigrant lost in the heartless city, with dim hopes for a better way of life.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">I won't let you go back in the mill. People die in there. I'm a man, and I can look out for you.
</p><p><p ID="slug">11	EXT. SIDING OUTSIDE MILL
</p><p><p ID="act">Along a railroad spur outside the mill, Abby and Ursula glean bits of coal that have fallen from the tenders.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">We're going west. Things gotta be better out there.
</p><p><p ID="slug">12	EXT. TENEMENT
</p><p><p ID="act">A POLICEMAN, looking for Bill, roughs Abby up behind the tenement where they live. Suddenly Bill runs out from a doorway and slams him over the head with a clay pitcher full of water.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">POLICEMAN
<P ID="dia">What'd you do?
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill shrugs, then hits him again, knocking him unconscious, when he reaches for a gun. Abby calls Ursula and they take off running, Bill stopping only to collect some of their laundry off a clothesline.
</p><p><p ID="slug">13	EXT. FREIGHT YARDS
</p><p><p ID="act">They hop a freight train.
</p><p><p ID="slug">14	CREDITS (OVER EXISTING PHOTOS)
</p><p><p ID="act">The CREDITS run over black and white photos of the Chicago they are leaving behind. Pigs roam the gutters. Street urchins smoke cigar butts under a stairway. A blind man hawks stale bread. Dirty children play around a dripping hydrant. Laundry hangs out to dry on tenement fire escapes. Police look for a thief under a bridge. Irish gangs stare at the camera, curious how they will look. The CREDITS end.
</p><p><p ID="slug">15	EXT. MOVING TRAIN
</p><p><p ID="act">Abby and Bill sit atop a train racing through the wheat country of the Texas Panhandle.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I like the sunshine.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Everybody does.
They laugh. She is dressed in men's clothes, her hair tucked up under a cap. They are sharing a bottle of wine.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I never wanted to fall in love with you.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Nobody asked you to.
</p><p><p ID="act">He draws her toward him. She pulls away.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">What's the matter? A while ago you said I was irresistible. I still am.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">That was then.
</p><p><p ID="act">She pushes her nose up against his chest and sniffs around.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You playing mousie again?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">I love how nice and hard your shoulders are. And your hair is light. You're not a soft, greasy guy that puts bay rum on every night.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I love it when you've been drinking.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">You're not greasy, Bill. You have any idea what that means?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Kind of.
</p><p><p ID="act">They share the boxcar with a crowd of other HARVEST HANDS. Ursula is among them, also dressed like a man. Bill gestures out at the landscape.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Look at all that space. Oweee! We should've done this a long time ago. It's just us and the road now, Abby.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">We're all still together, though. That's all I care about.
</p><p><p ID="slug">16	EXT. JERKWATER
</p><p><p ID="act">The train slows down to take on water. The hands jump off. Each carries his "bindle"-- a blanket and a few personal effects wrapped in canvas. TOUGHS with ax handles are on hand to greet them.
The harvesters speak a Babel of tongues, from German to Uzbek to Swedish. Only English is rare. Some retain odd bits of their national costumes, they are pathetic figures, lonely and dignified and so far from home. Others, in split shoes and sockless feet, are tramps. Most are honest workers, though, here to escape the summer heat in the factories of the East. They dress inappropriately for farm work, in the latest fashions.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Elbow room! Oweee! Give me a chance and I'm going to dance!
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill struts around with a Napoleonic air, in a white Panama hat and gaiters, taking in the vista. Under his arm he carries a sword cane with a pearl handle. It pleases him, in this small way, to set himself apart from the rest of toiling humanity. He wants it known that he was born to greater things.
</p><p><p ID="slug">17	NEW ANGLE
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill comes upon a BIG MAN whose face is covered with blood.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Good, very good. Where you from,  mister?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BIG MAN
<P ID="dia">Cleveland.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Like to see the other guy.
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill helps him to his feet and dusts him off. A TOUGH walks up.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">TOUGH
<P ID="dia">You doing this shit?
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">Then keep it moving.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Oh yeah? Who're you?
The Tough hits Bill across the head with his ax handle.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">TOUGH
<P ID="dia">Name is Morrison.
Bill looks around to see whether Abby has seen this. She hasn't. He walks dizzily off down the tracks.
</p><p><p ID="slug">18	NEW ANGLE
</p><p><p ID="act">He takes Abby by the arm.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">What happened to your ear?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Nothing.
She is a sultry beauty--emancipated, full of bright hopes and a zest for life. Her costume does not fool the men. Wherever she goes they ogle her insolently.
EXT. WAGONS
The FOREMEN of the surrounding farms wait by their wagons to carry the workers off. A flag pole is planted by each wagon. Those who do not speak English negotiate their wages on a blackboard.
BENSON, a leathery man of fifty, bellows through a megaphone. In the background a NEWCOMER to the harvest talks with a VETERAN.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON
<P ID="dia">Shockers! Four more and I'm leaving.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">How much you paying?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON
<P ID="dia">Man can make three dollars a day, he wants to work.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Who're you kidding?
Bill mills around. They have no choice but to accept his offer.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON
<P ID="dia">Sackers!
Abby steps up. Benson takes her for a young man.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON
<P ID="dia">You ever sacked before?
</p><p><p ID="act">She nods.
</p><p><p ID="act">Transcriber's Note: the following seven lines of dialogue between the NEWCOMER and the VETERAN runs concurrent with the previous six lines of dialogue between Benson and Bill and Abby. In the original script they are typed in two columns running side-by-side down the page.
</p><p><p ID="act">*****
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEWCOMER (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">How's the pussy up there?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">VETERAN
<P ID="dia">Not good. Where you from?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEWCOMER (o.s.) 
<P ID="dia">Detroit.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">VETERAN
<P ID="dia">How's the pussy up there?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEWCOMER (o.s.) 
<P ID="dia">Good.
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">The guys tough out here?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">VETERAN (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">Not so tough. How about up there?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEWCOMER (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">Tough.
*****
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON
<P ID="dia">When's that?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Last year.
He waves her on. Abby nods at Ursula.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">You're making a mistake, you pass this kid up.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON
<P ID="dia">Get on.
He snaps his fingers at her. Bill climbs up ahead of the women. Anger makes him extremely polite.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You don't need to say it like that.
Benson ignores this remark but dislikes Bill from the first.
</p><p><p ID="slug">20	EXT. PLAINS
</p><p><p ID="act">Benson's wagons roll across the plains toward the Razumihin, a "bonanza" or wheat ranch of spectacular dimensions, its name spelled out in whitewashed rocks on the side of a hill.
</p><p><p ID="slug">21	EXT. BONANZA GATES (NEAR SIGN)
</p><p><p ID="act">The wagons pass under a large arch, set in the middle of nowhere, like the gates to a vanished kingdom. Goats peer down from on top.
Bill looks at Abby and raises his eyebrows.
</p><p><p ID="slug">22	EXT. BELVEDERE
</p><p><p ID="act">At the center of the bonanza, amid a tawny sea of grain, stands a gay Victorian house, three stories tall. Where most farm houses stand more sensibly on low ground, protected from the elements, "The Belvedere" occupies the highest ridge around, commanding the view and esteem of all.
Filigrees of gingerbread adorn the eaves. Cottonwood saplings, six feet high, have recently been planted in the front. Peacocks fuss about the yard. There is a lawn swing and a flagpole, used like a ship's mast for signaling distant parts of the bonanza. A wind generator supplies electric power.
A white picket fence surrounds the house, though its purpose is unclear; where the prairie leaves off and the yard begins is impossible to tell.
Bison drift over the hills like boats on the ocean. Bill shouts at the nearest one.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Yo, Beevo!
</p><p><p ID="slug">23	TIGHT ON CHUCK
</p><p><p ID="act">CHUCK ARTUNOV, the owner--a man of great reserve and dignity, still a bachelor--stands on the front porch of the Belvedere high above, observing the new arrivals.
</p><p><p ID="slug">24	EXT. DORMITORY
</p><p><p ID="act">Benson drops the hands off at the dormitory, a hundred yards below, a plain clapboard building with a ceiling of exposed joists. Ursula sees Chuck watching them.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">Whose place is that?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON
<P ID="dia">The owner's. Don't none of you go up around his place. First one that does is fired. I'm warning you right now.
</p><p><p ID="act">In the warm July weather most of the hands forsake the dorm to spread their bedrolls around a strawpile or in the hayloft of the nearby barn.
</p><p><p ID="act">Abby and Bill slip off to share a cigarette. Ursula tags behind.
</p><p><p ID="slug">25	EXT. ROCK
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill lifts a big rock. Abby applauds. Ursula kneels down behind
him. Abby pushes him over backwards.
</p><p><p ID="slug">26	EXT. BARN
</p><p><p ID="act">Ursula gasps as Abby tumbles off the roof of the barn and falls through the air screaming:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Urs!
She lands in a straw pile.
</p><p><p ID="slug">27	TIGHT ON ABBY AND BILL
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill takes Abby by the hands, spins her around until she is thoroughly dizzy, then grasps her across the chest.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Ready?
She giggles her consent. He crushes her in a bear hug until she is just on the verge of passing out, then lets her go. She sinks to the grass, in a daze of sweet intoxication.
</p><p><p ID="slug">28	EXT. LANTERN - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill looks deeply into Abby's eyes by the light of a lantern that night. They have made a shallow cut on their thumbs and press them together mixing their blood like children.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You're all I've got, Abby. No, really, everything I ever had is a complete piece of garbage except you.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">I know.
They laugh. He bends to kiss her. She pulls away.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Sometimes I think you don't like men.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">As individuals? Very seldom.
She kisses him lovingly.
</p><p><p ID="slug">29	EXT. WHEAT FIELDS - DAWN
</p><p><p ID="act">The sun peers over the horizon. The wheat makes a sound like a waterfall. It stretches for as far as the eye can see. A PREACHER has come out, in a cassock and surplice, to offer prayers of thanksgiving.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PREACHER
<P ID="dia">"... that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of' heaven upon the earth."
The harvesters spit and rub their hands as they wait for the dew to burn off. They have slept in their coats. The dawn has a raw edge, even in summer.
</p><p><p ID="slug">30	TIGHT ON WHEAT
</p><p><p ID="act">Chuck looks to see if the wheat is ready to harvest. He shakes the heads; they make a sound like paper. He snaps off a handful, rolls them between his palms, blows away the chaff and pinches the kernels that remain to make sure they have grown properly hard.
Tiny sounds are magnified in the early morning stillness:
grasshoppers snapping through the air, a cough, a distant hawk.
He pops the kernels into his mouth, chews them up, and rolls the wad around in his mouth. Satisfied, he spits it out and gives a nod. The Preacher begins a prayer of thanksgiving. Two ACOLYTES flank him, one with a smoking censer, the other with a crucifix.
All repeat the "Amen." Benson makes a tugging signal with his arm. A Case tractor--forty tons of iron, steam-driven, as big and as powerful as a locomotive--blasts its whistle. This is the moment they have been waiting all year for.
</p><p><p ID="slug">31	OTHER FIELDS - SERIES OF ANGLES
</p><p><p ID="act">A SIGNALMAN with two hand flags passes the message on from the crest of a nearby hill. In the far-flung fields of the bonanza other tractors answer as other crews set to work.
Abby and Bill join in, Bill reaping the wheat with a mowing machine called a binder, Abby propping the bound sheaves together to make bunches or "shocks."
A cloud of chaff rises over the field, melting the sun down to a cold red bulb.
Abby is well turned out, in a boater and string tie, as though she were planning any moment to leave for a picnic.
Bill, too, dresses with an eye to flashy fashion: Tight dark trousers, a silk handkerchief stuck in the back pocket with a copy of the Police Gazette, low-top calfskin boots with high heels and pointed toes, a shirt with ruffled cuffs, and a big signet ring. While at work he wears a white smock over all this to keep the chaff off. It gives him the air more of a researcher than a worker.
The harvesters itch madly as the chaff gets into their clothes. The shocks, full of briars, cut their hands; smut and rust make the cuts sting like fire. Nobody talks. From time to time they raise a chant.
Ursula, plucking chickens by the cookhouse--a shack on wheels-- steals a key chain from an unwatched coat.
Benson follows the reapers around the field in a buggy. He keeps their hours, chides loafers, checks the horses, etc. The harvesters are city people. Few of them are trained to farming. Most--Abby and Bill are no exception--have contempt for it and anybody dull enough to practice it. Tight control is therefore exercised to see that the machines are not damaged. 
Where the others loaf whenever Benson's back is turned, Bill works like a demon, as a point of pride.
</p><p><p ID="slug">32	CHUCK AND BENSON
</p><p><p ID="act">Lightning shivers through the clouds along the horizon. Chuck looks concerned. Benson consults a windsock.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON
<P ID="dia">Should miss us.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">They must be having trouble over there, though.
Abby, passing by, lifts her hat to wipe her face. As she does her hair falls out of the crown. Women are rare in the harvest fields. One so beautiful is unprecedented.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">I didn't know we had any women on.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON
<P ID="spkdir">(surprised)
<P ID="dia">I thought she was a boy. Should I get rid of her?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">No.
</p><p><p ID="slug">33	MONTAGE
</p><p><p ID="act">A COOK stands on the horizon waving a white flag at the end of a fishing pole. Ursula bounds through the wheat blowing a horn.
Benson consults the large clock strapped to the back of his buggy, then fires a smoke pistol in the air.
Their faces black with chaff, the hands fall out in silence. They shuffle across the field toward the cookhouse, keeping their feet close to the ground to avoid being spiked by the stubble.
</p><p><p ID="slug">34	EXT. COOKHOUSE - STUBBLE FIELD IN B.G.
</p><p><p ID="act">The COOKS, Orientals in homburgs, serve from planks thrown across sawhorses. The hands cuff and push each other around as they wash up. The water, brought up fresh in wagons from the wells, makes them gasp. An ice wagon and a fire truck are parked nearby.
Most sit on the ground to eat, under awnings or beach umbrellas dotted around the field like toadstools. The Belvedere is visible miles away on the horizon.
Bill is carrying Abby's lunch to her when a loutish DUTCH MAN makes a crack.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUTCHMAN
<P ID="dia">Your sister keep you warm at night?
Bill throws a plate of stew at him and they are quickly in a fight. No fists are used, just food. The others pull them apart. Bill storms away, flicking mashed potatoes off his shirt.
</p><p><p ID="slug">35	EXT. GRAIN WAGON - STUBBLE FIELD IN B.G.
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill and Abby sit by themselves in the shade of a grain wagon. Demoralized, Abby soaks her hands in a pail of bran water. Bill inspects them anxiously. They are swollen and cracked from the morning's work.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY

Abby, a basket of cucumbers under her arm, waves goodbye, angling her wrist so that Bill and Ursula can see the diamond bracelet Chuck has given her.
</p><p><p ID="slug">118	EXT. PRAIRIEI

Bill slaps her.

She throws a rock at him and runs off. He catches her, repenting of his meanness.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I know you can't understand this, but there's nothing I want except good things for Abby and you. Go ahead and hit me back.
She hesitates a second, then slaps him as hard as she can. Blood glistens on his lip. He does not say a word in protest. She looks at the wound, horrified, then throws her arms tight around him.

Chuck turns to Abby and, for nearly the first time, smiles.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">He's funny.
Bill holds a plate up for Abby to see. Limoges china. Abby rolls her eyes and spits out a cherry pit. They eat like pigs, with no respect for bourgeois manners.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">You have any talents, Chuck?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">No, but I admire people who do.

<P ID="dia">That's not so. He can do a duck. Show them.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Stand back. Get the women and children someplace safe.
Chuck, feeling it would be wrong not to enter the spirit of the occasion, does his imitation. The likeness is astonishing. Abby wipes a bit of food off his chin with her napkin. Bill drums on the table with his spoon.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">You saw how modest he was?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">How'd you get along so long without a woman?
Chuck shrugs. Ursula makes a gesture as though to say by masturbating. Chuck does not see it. Billy laughs. Abby slaps her. The rabbit jumps out of the way.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Don't you ever behave that way at table!

<P ID="dia">She's adopted. I had nothing to do with her upbringing. I'd trade her off for a yellow dog.
<P ID="spkdir">(to Ursula)
<P ID="dia">Now eat. You want to starve to death?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">That's what you'd like.
Abby, overcome with impatience, throws her food to the dogs. Ursula catches a grasshopper and holds it out to Chuck.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">You give me a quarter to eat this hopper?
Chuck does not reply. She pops it into her mouth anyway, enjoying his look of shock. Bill throws down his fork.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">All right, okay, nobody's hungry anymore. What's the worst thing you ever did, Chuck? Besides missing church and that kind of stuff.
Chuck thinks about this.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">Once I turned a man out in the middle of winter, without a cent of pay. For  all I know he froze.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">If you went that far, he must've deserved it. What else?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">He didn't. I fired him out of resentment.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Well, you're the boss, right? That's how it works. Got to make decisions on the spot. Anyway, this guy-what's his name?--if I know his kind, which I do, he's probably doing okay for himself, got a hand in
somebody else's pocket for a change. Is that all?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">All I can think of right now. How about yourself?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL (con't)
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">Once I punched a guy while he was asleep.
Chuck looks surprised. Bill glances at Abby, worried that he might have said too much.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I was just kidding. Actually a guy I know did, though.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Maybe he did it to you.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Yeah. I think so.
Chuck gets up to ring for Miss Carter. Bill looks him up and down. Chuck, though older, is physically more imposing.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">Can I have the rabbit?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Get serious. I can win money with him.
She licks his ear. He laughs.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">I want that bunny.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You still believe in Santa Claus.
Bill closes his eyes as he feels the soft fur of the rabbit. Ursula looks around to make sure Chuck is gone, then wings a roll at Bill. It bounces off his forehead. He retaliates with a pat of butter.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL

<P ID="dia">Don't worry. I always know to look out for myself, because ifI
I don't, who will? See what I'm driving at?
Chuck sees a sense of honor at work in Bill here, and
though he considers the gesture misguided and a little
grand, admires him for it.
</p><p><p ID="slug">129	EXT. BASESU

Everyone seems happy and congenial. They have reached some kind of plateau. Chuck's ignorance of the ruse does not cause the others to treat him with less respect. They seem themselves almost to have forgotten it. 
</p><p><p ID="slug">131	BILL AND ABBY'S POV - LATERU

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL

</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">Sure. Why?
Bill shrugs, beaming with admiration for this man who does not burden others with his secrets.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I appreciate everything you've done for Abby. I really do. You've given her all the things she always deserved. I got to admit you have.
Chuck looks off, embarrassed but oddly pleased. Bill snatches up a handful of weeds and smells them.

</p><p><p ID="slug">137	EXT. PRAIRIE - SERIES OF ANGLES

</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">What's your mother like?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">Her? Like somebody that just got hit on the head. She used to pray for me. Rosary, the stations, everything. "Hey, Ma," I tell her, "I ain't crippled." They don't know, though. They say you're in trouble. They don't know.

<P ID="dia">Listen, some day all this is going to be mine. Or half is. Somebody like that, you want to get on his good side, not give him a lot of gas. You want to do what he says.
He steps off a few paces of his future kingdom and draws a deep breath.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">This reminds me of where I came from. I left when I was six. That's when I met your sister.
He looks at the land with a new sense of reverence. He snatches up a handful of grass and rolls it between his palms.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I can't wait to go back to Chicago, bring them down for a visit. Blackie and them. There's a lot of satisfaction in showing up people who thought you'd never amount to anything.

</p><p><p ID="slug">141	INT. KITCHEN
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill finds them in the kitchen. Chuck goes into the other room to look for something. Abby lifts the cigarette out of Bill's mouth, takes a drag and does a French inhale. Bill kisses her.

<P ID="dia">Nobody's all bad, are they?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I met a few I was wrong on, then.
Suddenly they hear Chuck's footsteps. They pull back just in time, Abby returning the cigarette to him behind her back. They chat as though nothing had happened.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I have a headache. I probably should've worn a hat.
Abby rolls her eyes at this improvisation. No sooner does Chuck turn his back than Bill's hand darts out to touch her breast. He snatches it away a moment before Chuck turns back.
Together they walk into the living room.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL

Bill catches Abby's eyes. He frowns at the idea of being cooped up with this Mormon all winter.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Relaxation. Look at the girls. Opportunity to see how other folks live.
Chuck looks at him blankly. None of these reasons seems to carry
much weight for him. Bill turns to Abby.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Somebody is nuts. I don't know whether it's him or me, but somebody is definitely nuts.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Why don't I fix tea?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Maybe I should help you.
He follows her back into the kitchen, where he starts to kiss her. She pushes him away and turns to making the tea.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">You're worse than an Airedale.
<P ID="spkdir">(raising her voice)
<P ID="dia">You want jasmine or mint?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">Mint.
Bill lifts up the back of her dress and looks under it, testing the breadth of his license. She slaps it back down. He lifts it again, standing on his right to. She glowers at him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Don't do that.
<P ID="spkdir">(calling to Chuck)
<P ID="dia">How much sugar?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Why not? I'm just seeing what kind of material it's made of.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">One spoonful.
Bill walks around absentmindedly, inspecting Chuck's things, stealing whatever catches his fancy. A book, a paperweight, a bell--things he does not really want and has no use for. His conscience is clear, however; the sacrifices they are making excuse these little sins.
As Chuck walks in, Bill has pocketed a candlestick.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Where's the candlestick?
Chuck shrugs. Bill gives Abby a cold look and goes outside.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">He's a strange one.

<P ID="dia">Why should I regret it? I think they're a pair of scam artists,

Chuck, who of course has seen the same things and more, raises a hand to silence him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">Maybe you'd be happier taking over the north end till spring. I don't say this in anger. We've been together a long time, and I've always felt about you like, well, close. It just might work out better is all. Less friction.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON
<P ID="dia">Don't believe me, then. You shouldn't. But why not check it out, sir? Hire a detective in Chicago. It won't cost much. What's there to lose?
Chuck's brow darkens as Benson goes on. For a moment we glimpse the anger that would be unleashed if ever he woke up. Somewhere he already knows the truth but refuses to acknowledge it.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">You're talking about my wife.
And so Chuck, too, becomes an accomplice in the scheme.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON

Benson turns and walks off. Chuck watches him go, ashamed at himself. What has this man done but a friend's duty?

She holds a hairbrush out for him to see. He looks it over and  gives it back without comment. He finds a stain on the tabletop.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Somebody's been staining this fake inlay with a water glass. Actually I don't blame them.
He walks around trying out more of Chuck's appurtenances. Abby, caught up, models a shawl before an imaginary mirror. She blows a kiss at herself.

<P ID="dia">He likes it, too, is what I'm saying.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Well, it's the style.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I see.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">What do you want me to wear in this heat? A blanket?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">That's your problem.
Abby puts on her wedding bracelet and admires it. Bill softens at the sight of her beauty, properly adorned.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I told you someday we'd be living in style. When this whole thing is over I'm going to buy you a necklace with diamonds as big as that.
He holds out the tip of his little finger. They laugh, as though they suddenly felt the absurdity of all this make-believe.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You're cute. Maybe a shade too cute.
She touches his face sympathetically, as though to say that she knows the pain this was causing him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">This is terrible for us both. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">Abby?
They jump as Chuck calls up from downstairs.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Down in a minute.
She kisses Bill.
</p><p><p ID="slug">148	EXT. BACK DOOR OF BELVEDERE
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill sneaks out the back door of' the Belvedere, only to find Benson drinking at the well. They look at each other in silence for a moment. Benson's horse stands beside him, a suitcase fixed to the saddle.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON
<P ID="dia">I know what you're doing.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">What're you talking about?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON
<P ID="dia">That boy's like a son to me. Don't you forget it. I know what you're doing.
Benson gets on his horse, turns and rides off. Miss Carter waves goodbye from the side of the house. She and Bill exchange a look.
</p><p><p ID="slug">149	EXT. FRONT PORCH
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill finds the others around front. Abby lolls in the hammock writing in her diary and eating a peach. Ursula plays the guitar.
Little by little the newcomers have done the house over from the austere structure that it was. Living room furniture has been moved out onto the front lawn and there arranged as though by a child. Goats sleep on the divan. Archery targets hang from the side of the house. The porch is covered with a striped awning, bird cages and twirls of bunting. Everywhere an atmosphere of drunken ease prevails.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Nice fall day.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">Wish I'd said that.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="spkdir">(to Abby)
<P ID="dia">Watcha doing?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Eating a green peach. 'Spect to die any minute.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Listen, I had a great idea. Let's spend Christmas in Chicago. Break
up the old routine. Rhino's never been to a baseball game or a horse
race. I know guys one month off the boat that have. Don't even
speak the English language, but they eat it right up.
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">You're just a young guy, Rhino; you oughta be running around
raising hell. No offense to the little woman.
He bows apologetically to Abby. She pinches a dead leaf off a plant.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">Abby says that in the poor section people eat cats.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Did you, sis? Well, there's always something doing. I can't
begin to tell you. State and Madison? Mmmm. Lights everywhere.
You'd love it.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">It can be rough, though.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Rough? Listen, you can't walk down the street without somebody
reaching in your pocket! You've got to keep your coat like this
and poke them away.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Bill got shot once. The bullet's still in him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">Really?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Doctor said he took it out, but I never saw it. Hurt like a bastard.
You got no idea how it hurt.
Suddenly he worries this might discourage Chuck from going.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">They won't mess with you, though. Big fella like you. I can see it
now.
He offers a taste of the talk Chuck is like to provoke on the street corners.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">"Hey, hey, hey. Who's this here, fresh out of the African Jungle,
moving down the sidewalk with a whowhowho, taking ten feet at a step
and making all the virgins run for cover? Why, it's Big Rhino, the
King of Beasts. He walks, he talks, he sucks up chalk."
Bill steps back and sees, as though for the first time, how imposing Chuck really is.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You are big, aren't you? Sunny Jim! You must've had a real moose
for an old lady.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Take it easy.
But Chuck holds none of this against him. He knows it comes from respect.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">So what do you say?
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">What a sorry outfit! Bunch of old ladies. You better stay behind.
Your mammas'd probably get upset.
But when the time comes, I'm out of here. Hit the road, Toad!
Ursula passes the sandwiches around until there is just
one left, Miss Carter's. While the others are talking,
she scoops up a handful of dirt and pours it into the middle.
Bill, lighting a cigarette, notices Chuck's hand on Abby's.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Ever seen a match burn twice?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">No.
Bill blows out the match and touches Chuck's hand with
the hot ember, causing him to yank it away.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">That's old.
Chuck starts to cough. Bill looks at Abby, then whips the handkerchief out of his pocket and puts it over his nose, as though to keep from getting Chuck's germs.
Miss Carter's face goes blank as she bites into her sandwich.
She jumps up and rushes back into the house. Chuck frowns.
Bill glares at Ursula, then turns to Chuck and, referring to the dead prairie grass which runs through the front yard right up to the house, continues:
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You ever thought of putting in some fescue here? Some fescue grass?
Of course, it might not take in this soil.
Chuck stands up and winds a stole, a long religious scarf, around his neck.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">You ready?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I still have a little of this sore throat. Where you going, though?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">To kill a hog.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">What's the necktie for?
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">Or does it just come in handy?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">Keeps the stain of guilt off.
Chuck nods goodbye and walks off, taking a stool with him. Bill sighs with admiration.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I try and try.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">What a splendid person! I've never met anybody like him!
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Splendid people make you nervous.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">They do! I breathe a sigh of relief when they step outside the room.
Bill puts on his boater and opens a copy of the Police Gazette. 
They are silent for a moment. 
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">A guy ate a brick on a bet. Must of busted it up first with a hammer. Guy in New York City. Where else?
<P ID="spkdir">(Jumping up)
<P ID="dia">Anybody want to bet me I can't stick this knife in that post?
Nobody takes him up on this. Abby leafs through the
Sears catalogue, her mind dancing with visions of splendor.
</p><p><p ID="slug">150	TIGHT ON CATALOGUE
</p><p><p ID="act">Pictured. in the catalogue are bath oils and corsets and feathered hats. A grasshopper is perched on the page among them, its eyes blank and dumb.
</p><p><p ID="slug">151	TIGHT ON ROSE
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill watches her run her finger slowly around the closed heart of a rose. Suddenly they both look at each other. They have heard the squeals, faint but unmistakable, of a hog being led to slaughter.
</p><p><p ID="slug">152	TIGHT ON STOOL - QUICK CUT
</p><p><p ID="act">Chuck has tied the hog's feet to the inverted legs of  the stool.
</p><p><p ID="slug">153	OTHER QUICK CUTS
</p><p><p ID="act">Ursula, off by herself, skips rope.
A flag on the pole by the front gate snaps in the breeze. From the branch of a lone tree the hog dangles by its hocks into the mouth of a barrel.
</p><p><p ID="slug">154	EXT. BELVEDERE - ABBY'S POV FROM SECOND FLOOR WINDOW
</p><p><p ID="act">Miss Carter storms down the hill with her bags. Fed up, she is leaving the bonanza. Chuck tries in vain to appease her. She keeps walking, out the front gate and into the prairie on a straight course for the railroad tracks.
Chuck will now be alone at the Belvedere with the newcomers and no other point of reference.
</p><p><p ID="slug">155	EXT. CLOTHES LINE
</p><p><p ID="act">Later that afternoon, Bill catches sight of Abby's underthings rustling on the clothes line.
</p><p><p ID="slug">156	INT. STAIRS
</p><p><p ID="act">That evening he watches her from behind as she climbs the stairs to join Chuck at their bedroom door. She nods goodnight, sensing the jealousy that is growing in him.
</p><p><p ID="slug">157	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
</p><p><p ID="act">Chuck looks impatiently through a drawer.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">I can't find anything around here. Last week it was my gloves; this
week my talc. What's going on?
He stands and watches Abby get ready for bed. She fills him with a deep adoration. He feels that in the tulip of her mouth at last he has found heaven.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">You're beautiful.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">You don't think my skin's too fair?
He comes up behind her and touches her long hair.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">You're smart, too, aren't you?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">I know what the Magna Carta is.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">Can I help you brush it out?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Not right now.
She is cold to discourage false expectations in him--and because she feels that she at least owes Bill this. Chuck, however, assumes the fault must be his own. His naivete about women, and the world in general, protects
the conspirators--and protects him, too, for he glimpses enough of the truth not to want to know any more.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">What makes you so distant with me?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Distant? I don't mean to be.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">You know what I'm talking about,  though. You aren't that way
with your brother.
</p><p><p ID="slug">158	INT.ATTIC
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill, eavesdropping in the attic above them, surveys Chuck's dusty heirlooms.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">It must be something I'm doing. I wish you'd tell me what, though.
</p><p><p ID="slug">159	INT. BEDROOM
</p><p><p ID="act">These gentle endearments, so rarely heard from Bill, stir her deeply. She throws herself in his arms.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Oh, Chuck I Please forgive me. Does it mean anything that I'm
sorry?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="spkdir">(pleased) 
<P ID="dia">But I don't blame you. Did I make it sound that way?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">You should. You have a right to.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">It's just that sometimes I feel I don't know you well.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">You don't. It's true.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">I think you love me better than before, though.
She rubs her cheek against his hands. Daily she feels warmer toward him. How much of this is love, how much respect or devotion, even she cannot say.
</p><p><p ID="slug">160	TIGHT ON BILL - LATER - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">The night throbs with crickets. Bill cracks open the bedroom door. Chuck lies asleep in a shaft of moonlight next to Abby. He hesitates a moment, but a strange compulsion drives him on. He has never done anything
so dangerous, or had so little idea why.
</p><p><p ID="slug">161	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">Abby wakes up to find him staring her in the face. He kisses her. Chuck stirs. Abby signals they should go outside.
</p><p><p ID="slug">162	EXT. BELVEDERE - DAY FOR NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">They sneak out of the Belvedere. The night is warm.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Mmmm. But I love you.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">I can't stand it any more. This is just so cruel. We're both no
good. I've got to get drunk with you, Bill. You know what I mean?
Drunk.
Bill wags a bottle. The dogs, awakened, bay from the kennel. They wait a moment to see if a light will go on in the house, then dart off toward the fields. A plaster lawn dwarf seems to watch them go.
</p><p><p ID="slug">163	EXT. FIELDS - DAY FOR NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">They run through the fields, hand in hand, laughing and flirting. The moon makes Abby's nightgown a ghostly white.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">We can never do this again, though. Okay? It really is too dangerous.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">This one night.
He toes a sodden old shoe.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Hey, I found a shoe.
</p><p><p ID="slug">164	SHOE, COYOTES, SCARECROW - DAY FOR NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">The shoe gleams in the moonlight. Coyotes yelp from the hilltops. A scarecrow spreads its arms against the sky. The waving fields of wheat have given way to vast reaches of cleanly shaven stubble, stained with purple morning glories. Odd, large stakes are planted among them.
</p><p><p ID="slug">165	NEW ANGLE - DAY FOR NIGHT
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You want me to spin you around?
She nods okay. He takes her by the hands and spins her around the way he used to--until they go reeling off, too dizzy to stand.
</p><p><p ID="slug">166	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY FOR NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">They lie by the river looking at the great dome of stars. Bill wants to believe things are the same between them as before. So does Abby--but she knows better.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Suppose we woke up tomorrow and it was a thousand years ago. I
mean, with all we know? Electricity, the telephone, radio, that kind of
stuff. They'd never figure out how we came up with it all. Maybe
they'd kill us.
She looks at him, and they laugh.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You sleepy?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">This is the first time we slept together in a while, Bill.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You like it?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Of course.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Kiss me, then.

<P ID="dia">It's so sweet to be able to kiss you when I want to.
</p><p><p ID="slug">167	NEW ANGLE
</p><p><p ID="act">Before the marriage his lovemaking was gentle and soft. Now it has a brutal air, as though he were asserting his right to her for the last time.
</p><p><p ID="slug">168	TIGHT ON ABBY - DAWN
</p><p><p ID="act">Dawn is breaking. Abby jumps to her feet, alarmed. They have slept too long.
</p><p><p ID="slug">169	EXT. BELVEDERE - DAWN
</p><p><p ID="act">They have run back to the Belvedere. It seems they are safe until Chuck appears on the porch, yawning and stretching. Bill drops to the ground while Abby goes ahead.
Abby appears at one side of the house while Bill steals around the other. Luckily, they have come up from the back.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">Abby! I've been looking all over for you. Where have you been?
While she distracts Chuck, Bill slips back in the house. It has been a close call.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Watching the ducks.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">Didn't you sleep well?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">No.
</p><p><p ID="slug">170	TIGHT ON ABBY (DISSOLVE TO PAGE, THEN TO URSULA)
</p><p><p ID="act">Abby looks sympathetically at Chuck. Her face dissolves into a page of her diary and from there to Ursula, balancing an egg on her fingertip.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">Chuck saw Ursula balance an egg. He begged her to repeat this trick,
but she wouldn't.
</p><p><p ID="slug">171	TIGHT ON CHUCK
</p><p><p ID="act">Chuck tries to reduplicate Ursula's feat. Abby, amused, reaches out and touches his face.
We wonder if, despite herself, she might be falling in love with him.
</p><p><p ID="slug">172	EXT. BELVEDERE
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill watches the Doctor walk out the front door and down the steps to his wagon. Chuck follows, smiling.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">The Doctor came. Chuck looked pleased for a change.
</p><p><p ID="slug">173	EXT. PRAIRIE - BILL'S POV

</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">We should have brought a flag.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Does she have time to ride back and get it?
Abby and Bill hold hands. Chuck by now is accustomed to such displays. They seem, however, to make Abby increasingly uncomfortable.
</p><p><p ID="slug">175	MOVING TRAIN - THEIR POVS
</p><p><p ID="act">The train bursts past at twenty yards, its great light rolling like a lunatic eye. Bill's heart pounds with excitement. Chuck holds Abby by the waist. Ursula waves a handkerchief... They cannot make out anything specific in the windows, but there is the sense of people going more important places, getting on with the serious business of their lives - while out here they stagnate.
Dimly visible, on the back platform of the caboose, a MAN in a frock coat salutes them with his cane.
The train has quickly vanished into the declining sun. Everything is quiet again. Ursula rushes up the grade to collect some pennies she laid on the tracks.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Did you see him wave?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">He was shorter than I expected.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">How do you know it was him?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">I saw!  He had a hat on.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You didn't understand my question.
They walk back to the buggy. Ursula holds up a dead snake she found on the tracks.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">You know what I'm going to do with this? Take it home and put it in
vinegar.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">That was the President, shortie. Wake up.
Bill watches Chuck help Abby into the buggy. She is laughing about something or other. His hand lingers for a moment on hers. She does not brush it aside, as once she might have, but to Bill's dismay, presses
it against her breast. Chuck seems to have breathed a hope into her that he, Bill, was never able to.
</p><p><p ID="slug">176	EXT. FIELDS
</p><p><p ID="act">Abby and Ursula race across the fields trying to fly a kite. Ursula rides a tiny Shetland pony. Just as the wind lifts the kite away, they run into Bill. He sits by himself observing a spear of grass. Abby drops off. Ursula rides off over the hill with the kite, leaving her alone with Bill.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">You look deep in thought.
She touches his cheek. He brushes her hand away.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">What's the matter?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Nothing.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY

<P ID="dia">Can't I be alone once in a while without everybody getting all

</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">You're the only person getting worked up.
Some buffalo appear on the crest of the next hill. Abby looks at them. They do not seem quite part of this world but mythical, like minotaurs.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Chuck says they're good for the grass.
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">Stop giving me that look.

<P ID="dia">You know.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">I haven't touched him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">How about the other night? I saw you, Abby. The other night
by the tracks? If only you wouldn't lie! Really, there's
some things about you I'm never going to understand.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">I forgot. Anyway it doesn't matter. What are you doing, always trying
to trap me?
Bill paces around, disgusted with himself and the whole situation.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I can't stand it any more. It's just too degrading.
<P ID="spkdir">(pause) 
<P ID="dia">You and him. Why do I have to spell it out? I thought it would be all
over in a month or two. Guy might go another five years. We've got to
clear out, Abby.
They stare at each other in silence for a moment.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Why stop now?
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">We've come this far.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL

</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">You heard me.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Why stay? Go ahead and tell me! I'm standing here.
Bill trembles with shock and anger. The buffalo cast aware glances at them.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">You want us to lose everything?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I'm telling you I can't stand it.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">You're weak then. What about all I've been through?
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">And what about him? It would be the worst thing we could do. Worse

Bill is silent for a moment.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You're getting to like him, aren't you?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">It would kill him. Leaving now would be just cruel.

<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">In fact you're just leaving us one way out.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">What're you talking about? Murdering him? Ursula comes riding over the hill, without the kite.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You watch and see.  
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">I had to let it go. One of them started following me, and I threw

<P ID="dia">Why?

Chuck gives her a kiss, glad to put aside his suspicions.
</p><p><p ID="slug">179	TIGHT ON POINTERS, QUAIL AND PHEASANTS
</p><p><p ID="act">Tails level, their noses thrust high in the air, a pair of pointers prance through the high uplands grass, following a scent like sailors taking in a rope. Pheasants and quail tremble in their coveys, their eyes big with fear.
</p><p><p ID="slug">180	EXT. UPLANDS
</p><p><p ID="act">Chuck has taken Bill out bird-hunting. They wear heavy canvas leggings and carry shotguns.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Did you ever tell Abby the buffalo help keep up the grass?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">I think so. Why?
Bill shrugs. Chuck welcomes this opportunity to speak of his wife. He considers Bill a good friend, in fact the only person with whom he can talk about delicate matters.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">I want to get her something nice for Christmas.
Bill, who means to kill Chuck the first chance he gets, forgets this intention for a moment to give him advice.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="spkdir">(thoughtfully)
<P ID="dia">She likes to draw. Maybe some paints. Nothing too expensive--
she might want to exchange it. Maybe a coat. She likes to show
off sometimes. She's sweet that way.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">I wish I knew how to make her happy. Nothing I do really seems to.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">That's how they are. They like to make you work for it. I couldn't
ever figure out why.
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">Sometimes you can't go wrong, though. You know that one Abby showed you a picture of? Elizabeth? I took her cherry.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">I know. You told me.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Actually, I didn't, but I could have. The point I'm making is you've got
to understand how they operate. Get them thinking you can take it or
leave it, you're usually okay.
Suddenly the dogs stop rigid, on point. At Chuck's hiss they sink into the  grass.
Bill looks at Chuck's exposed back. Nobody would know. It could be made to seem like a hunting accident. He cocks the hammer of his shotgun. His heart pounds wildly. Chuck talks in a low voice to the dogs.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">All right, put them up, girl.
The dogs rise and inch toward the birds, as slowly as the minute hand of a clock. All at once the quail explode out of hiding. Bill jumps at the noise. Chuck fires twice. Two birds fall. The retriever notes where. Chuck turns around.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">Why aren't you shooting? I left you those two on the left.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">They caught me off guard.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">You have to keep your gun up.
Chuck walks ahead. The music builds a mood of tension. Bill takes a practice shot into the ground. Bill looks around. There is nobody in sight. He turns the sights on Chuck's back. It would be simple enough.
Though only twenty feet away, he closes the gap, to make sure he does not miss.
Chuck whistles the scattered birds back to their covey. "Pheo! Pheo!" Soon, faint and far away, comes a reply-the sweet, pathetic whistle of the quail lost in a forest of grass. The mother bird utters a low "all is well."
One by one, near and far, the note is taken up, and they begin to return.
Bill holds his breath. His finger moves inside the trigger guard. He only has to squeeze a fraction of an inch. Three more birds shoot out of the grass. Chuck fires. At first we think Bill has, but he cannot stoop this low. He does not have the heart. Disgusted, he throws his gun on the ground. Both barrels go off. Chuck snaps around, startled and concerned. Bill is
shaking like a leaf.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">What's the matter? What are you so upset about?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">They surprised me again. Chuck sends a retriever after the fallen birds, then--in an unprecedented gesture-he puts his arm over Bill's shoulder to comfort him, like an older brother.

<P ID="dia">I never have.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Just wondering. I got a pair of gloves I brought with me.
Bill feels oddly better, as though Chuck had backed down.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">Abby bought me this at Yellowstone.
Chuck shows Bill his knife. Bill reads a name off the handle.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">That's what she calls you? 'Chickie?'
He gets up, his nostrils flaring with anger. Chuck thinks this indignance is on his behalf.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">Doesn't bother me. Should it?
Bill throws down the pheasant he was plucking.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">What's the matter?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Don't let her fool you, too. She warms up to whoever says please and thank you.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">What's the matter?
Bill, still angry at himself, considers telling him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You really want to know?
He would like Chuck to know the truth but does not want theresponsibility for revealing it. He must find out by accident.
Luckily they are interrupted as Ursula runs up, pointing over her shoulder. A pair of three-wing airplanes sputters into view low overhead. One seems to be having engine trouble.

Bill, Abby and Ursula approach the aircraft with the greatest caution, like the Indians at Cortez's ships.

then jointly as a slap act. A DOUBLE TALKER weaves sentences of absolute nonsense. After a moment a black and white image appears over his face and he drops out of sight.
The troupe is putting on a show to earn its supper. ONE of them stands behind the viewers -- Abby and Bill, Chuck and Ursula -- cranking a carbide projector by hand. A silent movie appears on the screen, full of extraordinary pratfalls, disappearances and other tricks of the early
cinema. Chuck has never seen anything remotely like this.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">How'd they do that? Where'd he go? There must be a wire. Etc.
He steps forward to inspect the screen, actually just a sheet hung along a clothesline, to see whether the image is coming from behind. Bill and Abby sit rapt as children, nostalgic for Chicago.

George puts his hand on hers. She snatches it away.
GEORGE
What's the matter? Aren't I your

The Doubletalker pokes his fork into a pudding. A balloon, concealed beneath the surface, explodes to general delight. Down the table Abby and Bill chat with the Leader.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY

Bill shrugs, as though to say he can handle whatever Chuck can dish out and a little more.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY

Bill combs his hair to calm himself down.

Abby, in terror of Chuck's finding out, cannot understand why Bill seems to care so little.

Abby hesitates. Bill throws his knife away.

They look at each other for a moment.

This is not what he expected to hear. But now his pride requires that he face the truth and not back down.

Bill takes off the shirt, drapes it over a post and walks off, hurt and angry, but with a sad dignity.
Chuck is not entirely sorry to see him go, nor is Abby; she knows that he is getting out just in time. One more episode like last night's and the fuse would hit the powder.

Seagulls--like strange emissaries from another world--glide back and forth over the fields in search of grasshoppers.

</p><p><p ID="act">Ursula takes curling irons from the chimney of a lantern where she has set them to heat, and applies them to Abby hair.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">Suppose I never fall in love, Abby?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Don't be silly. Everybody does. What do you think all those songs
are about? You need to be careful, though, and not throw it away.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">Throw what away?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">You know, your chances. It's too hard to explain to a little
squirrel like you.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">That sounded just like Bill. Don't you miss him?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Sometimes.
From her tone, however, we sense that she finds it easier with him gone.
</p><p><p ID="slug">222	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
</p><p><p ID="act">Abby whispers something to Chuck in bed that evening.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">You ever said that to anybody else?
She giggles.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">You're lying, aren't you? Well, go right on lying.
The camera moves to the window, beneath the eave. Outside, peacocks strut back and forth.
</p><p><p ID="slug">223	EXT. MUDDY ROAD
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill rides an Indian motorcycle along a muddy road back to the bonanza. His rabbit is strapped to the back. He stops for a moment to look at the new fields.
</p><p><p ID="slug">224	EXT. BELVEDERE - BILL'S POV
</p><p><p ID="act">Abby sings to herself as she beats out a carpet. Bill appears on the ridge behind her. Hope leaves him like a ghost. She looks happily settled into a new life with Chuck. All at once she turns around.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Bill!
She rushes up and embraces him, but her warmth just seems a tease to Bill. She is different. She looks different. The tutors and tailors Chuck has brought in over the winter have given her more polish. Her hair is nicely
coiffed. Where she used to dress in cotton shirtwaists, she wears crinolines now.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">How's everybody been?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Including me? Okay. Gee, you look good.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Thanks. And Chuck?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Still the same.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Actually I didn't mean it that way.
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">I came back to help out with the harvest.
He feels humiliated at not having a stronger excuse. But he loves her. He aches with love. He hoped their last fight was just another storm in the romance. Evidently it was more.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I thought about you a lot. Wrote you a letter, but it was no good, so I tore it up.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">How'd you come?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Train.
He looks her up and down.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Nice dress.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">I'm glad you like it.
He admires her garden. His familiar cockiness vanishes as little by little he sees the old feeling is not there.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">This is new, too.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">The daffodils were already here,  but I put in the rest. You
really do like them?
At a shriek from Ursula, Bill turns around. She runs into his arms, and covers him with kisses.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">I've missed you! I thought about you every day. You should've written. Did Abby show you what she got?
Abby scowls at Ursula. With no choice but to show him, she opens the top button of her blouse and draws out a diamond necklace.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="spkdir">(apologetically)
<P ID="dia">For Christmas.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">Plus a music box. He spoils her. Why don't they spoil me, too?
<P ID="spkdir">(whispering)
<P ID="dia">You oughta be glad you didn't have to spend the winter. You
would've gone crazy.
</p><p><p ID="slug">225	TIGHT ON ABBY
</p><p><p ID="act">The winter's peace is gone. Abby is sick with fear. Now that she loves Chuck, too, she can never again be honest with Bill. The truth of her feelings would crush him. Moreover, there's no telling how he might react. He could ruin everything, even get them killed.
</p><p><p ID="slug">226	EXT. BEDROOM WINDOW
</p><p><p ID="act">Chuck looks on from behind the bedroom window.
</p><p><p ID="slug">227	EXT. DINNER TABLE
</p><p><p ID="act">They dine in awkward silence. Benson has joined them.
Abby, for all her winter's polish, still eats with the back of her knife.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">How was Chicago?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Great.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">How's everybody doing?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Okay.
They are silent for a moment. Bill senses that nobody except Ursula is really glad to see him back.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">How's Blackie?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Still hasn't wised up. Know what I mean? He asked how you were
doing, though.
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">I told him. Ran into Sam, too. He'd been in a fight.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Oh yeah?
Bill can see that her interest is only polite. He knows that he should turn around and leave, but he cannot. The sight of him with his confidence gone is painful to behold.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">His nose was like this.
He pushes his nose to one side. Ursula and Abby laugh.
</p><p><p ID="slug">228	EXT. STOCK POND
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill plants willow slips in the soft earth by the stock pond. Ursula orders a dog around.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">Look at this dog mind me. Sit! You've got to say it like hitting a nail.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Has she asked you anything about me?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">No.
Ursula flirts with him, running the shoots along his back.
She waits to see what he will do. He gets up and after a short chase catches her. He holds her at arm's length for a moment, then kisses her.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">What'd you do that for?
Bill wonders himself. To get revenge on Abby? He touches her breast.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">Don't.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Why not?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">Cause there's nothing there.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I can be the judge of that.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">Then ask first.
He kisses her neck.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Nobody has to know but us  chickens.
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">What do I have to say to convince you? You tell me, I'll say it.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">What makes you think I would?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Nothing.
She giggles and kisses him back. But guilt has caught up with him. He cannot go ahead.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">What's the matter?
No reply.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA 
<P ID="dia">Maybe it would be wrong.
<P ID="spkdir">(disappointed)
<P ID="dia">You still love her, don't you?
Bill hums a rock off toward the horizon.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I should've gone in the church, like my father was after me to.
</p><p><p ID="slug">229	BILL'S POV - OUTSIDE THE BELVEDERE - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">Chuck and Abby sit in their cozy living room playing Parcheesi. The sound of their voices is muffled. The camera draws back to reveal Bill outside the window, watching.
She is comfortable with Chuck now. Apparently, he has lost his place in her heart. He wants to rush in and drag her away.
</p><p><p ID="slug">230	EXT. BEDROOM WINDOW - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">Later that night he stands under the bedroom window and wonders at the meaning of the shadows that flicker across the ceiling. After a moment he withdraws into the darkness.
</p><p><p ID="slug">231	EXT. SMALL PRAIRIE TOWN (DUCK LAKE)
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill has brought Abby into a nearby town to make some purchases. Dressed in a chauffeur's gown and goggles, he sits against the fender of the Overland watching her move from store to store. Ursula is with her.
The TOWNSPEOPLE all speak German. Their peasant costumes are freely mixed with Western dress. The signs are old German script. Two MEN carry a huge bulb through the street, to put atop a church.
</p><p><p ID="slug">232	OVERLAND AUTO
</p><p><p ID="act">Abby walks up with Ursula.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">Listen, I'm going to stay and go back with the laundry wagon.
Abby looks at Bill, then nods okay. Ursula runs off. Bill opens the door, and she gets in.
</p><p><p ID="slug">233	EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE TOWN (DUCK LAKE)
</p><p><p ID="act">They are stopped on the road a hundred yards outside the town.
Abby smokes as Bill checks the radiator. Something in his behavior leads us to suspect he may have staged this stop.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">How you been doing?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Me? Fine.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">We don't talk so much these days.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">I know.
She knows what he wants. She cannot give it anymore.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I said a lot of stupid things before I went off.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="spkdir">(politely)
<P ID="dia">I forgot about it already.
Bill, trying his best to make peace with her, cannot help seeing that she would like to keep things as they are--and not because she harbors any grudge.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">You've forgiven me?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">There was nothing to forgive.
He holds a bottle of liquor out to her.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">What're you worried about?
She takes a swig. He laughs. She laughs back.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">So how'm I doing with you?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Fine.
He takes her hand and holds it like a trapped bird.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">What's happened?
She shrugs, disengaging her hand to brush aside her hair. She is painfully aware of his suffering but doesn't have the heart to tell him how it all is.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I probably ought to leave. I will.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Already? You just got here.
She hasn't really contradicted him. He leans forward as though to kiss her. She lets him. She wishes that she could give herself to him, but she doesn't know what is right. Then, a sudden impulse of panic, she gets up and backs away.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Where you going?
He reaches out to catch her. She breaks away and starts to run. He walks quickly after her, cutting off any escape toward the town.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Why'd you have to come back?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I'm not going to hurt you. I only want to talk with you.
She stops and hides her face in her hands. He gently pulls them away.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I didn't come back to make trouble for you. I guess we were fooling
each other to think it could last. I mean, What was I offering youanyhow? A ride to the bottom. Looking at you now, in the right  clothes and everything, I see how crazy I was and--well, I understand. It's okay. I sort of cut my own throat, actually.
Her eyes close and her legs give in. Bill lets her go and backs off a step in surprise. She sinks to the ground, as though in a trance.
</p><p><p ID="slug">234	TIGHT ON BILL
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill, taken by surprise, goes up and kneels down beside her. He looks to see that she is okay. He picks a fox-tail out of her hair. Her dress has worked up toward her knees. He pulls it back down. He wants to caress 
her face but hesitates.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">How'd we let it happen, Abby? We were so happy once. Why didn't we starve? I love you so much. What have1 done? You're so beautiful. What have I done?
He touches his lips for a fraction of a second to hers, notices another car approaching down the road. He picks her up like a doll and carries her back to the Overland.
</p><p><p ID="slug">235	EXT. BELVEDERE - CHUCK'S POV
</p><p><p ID="act">They have arrived back at the Belvedere.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">I'm sorry.
She touches his face in a surge of sympathy. What has she done to him? He kisses her neck and leads her toward the front door.
</p><p><p ID="slug">236	CRANE TO CHUCK
</p><p><p ID="act">The camera rises to the uppermost story of the Belvedere. Chuck has seen them. Hot tears leap to his eyes. Before Bill left for the winter he often observed such intimacies between them. Now it all looks different.
</p><p><p ID="slug">237	CHUCK'S POVS (HIGH ANGLES)
</p><p><p ID="act">He looks around at his estate--his barn, his auto, his great house and his granary. None of them is any consolation now. Far a moment it seems to him as though he lived here in some time long past.
</p><p><p ID="slug">238	INT. BEDROOM
</p><p><p ID="act">Abby notices Chuck watching her outside the bedroom door.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY

<P ID="dia">No.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Will you hand me that magazine?
He gives her the magazine she wants.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">What's the matter?
He seems for a moment to consider telling her, then shrugs and goes downstairs.
</p><p><p ID="slug">239	INT. LIVING ROOM
</p><p><p ID="act">He stumbles into a bird cage but hardly notices. The jostled birds raise a fuss.
</p><p><p ID="slug">240	EXT. FRONT PORCH
</p><p><p ID="act">He runs into Bill on the front porch.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I've been looking for you. I have to take off again, real soon here, and...
Chuck puts a hand on Bill's shoulder, stopping him. They look at each other for a moment, then he passes on. Bill seems puzzled.
</p><p><p ID="slug">241	EXT. FIELDS
</p><p><p ID="act">Chuck walks out into the deep of his fields. The wheat, a warm dry gold, is almost ready to take in. He sits down and rests his head against a 
furrow, powerless to think. The wind makes a song in the infinitude of sweet clicking heads.
He puts his hands over his heart and breathes in gasps, with the dumb honesty of a wounded animal. He could not himself quite say what it is that he knows.
</p><p><p ID="slug">242	EXT. BONANZA - SERIES OF ANGLES
</p><p><p ID="act">Late that afternoon disaster strikes as a swarm of locusts sweeps down on the bonanza. We do not see where they come from. They seem to appear out of nowhere, unnoticed. Ursula works in the kitchen, Bill by the barn. Chuck lies asleep in the field, Abby upstairs in bed.
</p><p><p ID="slug">243	ANIMALS ON BONANZA
</p><p><p ID="act">The animals sense it first. The buffalo move off in a mass. The horses become uncontrollable. One runs around the barn in a panic. Bill watches it, puzzled.
Two peacocks have a fight.
A dog in the treadmill races in vain to escape, driving the machine to a feverish pitch. The shadow of a giant cloud licks over the hills.
</p><p><p ID="slug">244	EXT. FIELDS
</p><p><p ID="act">Everything seems normal in the fields.
Then, as you listen, a strange new sound begins to rise from them, a wild sea-like singing. As the camera moves over the fields and down into the wheat it swells in a crescendo until...
</p><p><p ID="slug">245	TIGHT ON LOCUSTS
</p><p><p ID="act">Suddenly we see them up close, devouring the stalks in a fever, the noise of their jaws magnified a thousand times.
They slip into the Belvedere, under the sash and wainscoting, turning up first in places it would seem they could never get into: a jewelry case, the back of a radio, the works of a music box, a bottle with a miniature ship inside, etc.
</p><p><p ID="slug">246	EXTREME CLOSEUPS
</p><p><p ID="act">Their eyes are dumb and implacable. They seem to have a whole hidden life of their own.
</p><p><p ID="slug">247	INT. KITCHEN
</p><p><p ID="act">Little by little they gather in numbers. Ursula first sees one on the drainboard. She swats it with a newspaper. Others sprout up. One by one she picks them up with a tongs and drops them into the stove. This method
is too slow. She begins to use her fingers. She moves with a quick, nervous energy, even as she understands this is futile. At last claustro-phobia seizes her. She spins around with a shriek, lashing out at everything in sight.
</p><p><p ID="slug">248	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
</p><p><p ID="act">In the bedroom overhead, Abby wakes up from one nightmare into another. She jumps out of bed and goes to the window. The locusts pelt against the pane like shot. She throws the bolt. Suddenly a crack shoots through the glass. She jumps back and watches in horror as a sliver of the pane falls in. They are free to enter.
</p><p><p ID="slug">249	SERIES OF ANGLES
</p><p><p ID="act">Suddenly they are everywhere: on the clothesline, in the pantry, in hats and shoes and the seams of clothing. Not a nook or cranny is safe from penetration.
</p><p><p ID="slug">250	TIGHT ON CHUCK - SLOW MOTION
</p><p><p ID="act">Chuck, asleep in the deep of the wheat, bolts up in slow motion. His hair is seething with them.
</p><p><p ID="slug">251	EXT. BONANZA - FURTHER ANGLES
</p><p><p ID="act">Panic hits the bonanza. Workers tie string around their pant cuffs to keep the insects from crawling up their legs, then rush out to the fields with gongs, rattles, pot lids, scarecrows on sticks, drums and horns and 
other noisemakers to scare them off.
Some pray. Others run around like madmen, stamping and yelling, ignored by the gathering host. A couple get into a fistfight.
A storm flag is run up the flagpole. A tractor blasts out an S.O.S. The peacocks huddle under the stoop.
</p><p><p ID="slug">252	TIGHT ON CHUCK
</p><p><p ID="act">Chuck gives Benson his orders.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK

See what you can harvest.
</p><p><p ID="slug">253	HIGH DOWN ANGLE
</p><p><p ID="act">The locusts snap through the air. Bill, swatting at them with a shovel, stops to gag. One has flown into his mouth.
</p><p><p ID="slug">254	TIGHT ON GEARS
</p><p><p ID="act">They jam up the gears of the machinery with the crush of their bodies.
</p><p><p ID="slug">255	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
</p><p><p ID="act">Abby throws a sheet over herself, but they get in under it. She thrashes around madly, then with a cry goes limp.
</p><p><p ID="slug">256	CHUCK AND BENSON
</p><p><p ID="act">Benson reports back to Chuck. A team of horses races by, nearly bowling them over.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON
<P ID="dia">We can't get the machines out. They're jamming up the gears.
There's a good chance they'll pass on south, though. Unless...
unless a wind comes up.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">What happens then?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BENSON
<P ID="dia">They'll set down and walk in.
</p><p><p ID="slug">257	SIGNS OF DAMAGE
</p><p><p ID="act">The locusts devour not just the crops but every organic thing: pitchfork handles, linens on the clothesline, leather traces, flowers in the window boxes, etc. Soon a large area of wheat is eaten down to stubble.
Bill looks away from a tree for a second. When he turns back it has been stripped to a wintry bareness.
</p><p><p ID="slug">258	EXT. WIND GENERATOR, OTHER ANGLES
</p><p><p ID="act">The vanes of the wind generator begin gently to stir. Little by little the wind picks up. A dust devil spins across the yard. The grass lists by the well. A power line moans.
</p><p><p ID="slug">259	EXT. FIELDS
</p><p><p ID="act">As the sun dips below the horizon, the locusts pour in like a living river, walking along the ground like a procession of Army ants. The roar of their wings is deafening. The air hisses and pops with their electric frenzy.
</p><p><p ID="slug">260	STOCK AND MATTE SHOTS - SUNSET
</p><p><p ID="act">And these are but the advance elements of a main force which looms like a silver cloud on the horizon.
</p><p><p ID="slug">261	EXT. BONFIRE - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">WORKERS dump bushels of the insects into a bonfire. A MAN with an abacus keeps track of what each is owed.
</p><p><p ID="slug">262	SAME FIELDS - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">The wind has picked up. Chuck, Bill and Abby have come out to the fields with a dozen WORKERS to investigate the extent of the damage. The insects buzz around blindly in the light of their lanterns, which they carry Japanese-fashion at the ends of cane poles.
</p><p><p ID="slug">263	TIGHT ON CHUCK - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">Chuck inspects the grain.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">There's nothing we can do but wait. They're either going to take it all or they're not.
He covers his face with his hands. The others shy back at this display of grief, startling in one so formal. Their jostled lanterns cast a dance of lights.
Bill, moved to real sympathy, takes him by the shoulders.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Come on. They might still lift. Hey, I've seen a wind like this lay
down and die. Don't give up now.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="spkdir">(ignoring him)
<P ID="dia">We could at least make sure they don't get the people on south.
He breaks open the mantle of his lantern, still unsure what he should do. Some of the flaming kerosene splashes onto the crops nearby, setting them ablaze. Bill drops his rattle and swats the fire out with his coat.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">What're you doing? Watch it! What're you, crazy? There's
still a chance, don't you see?
Chuck goes to his horse. Bill grabs him by the sleeve. Does he really mean to set the fields on fire? Chuck pushes him aside. Bill, frantic, turns to the others for support.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Stop him, or it's all going up.
They, however, are too uncertain of their ground to intervene. Chuck turns on Bill.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">What does it matter to you?
Chuck slings fire out of the broken lantern onto the crops next to Bill -- a sudden, hostile gesture that catches them all by surprise. Independent of his will, the truth is forcing its way up, like a great blind fish from the bottom of the sea.
He slings the fire out again. A patch lands on Bill's pantleg. Bill slaps it out.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">What's got into you?
They stare at each other. Bill backs off like a cat, sensing Chuck knows the truth, but at a loss to understand how he could.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHUCK
<P ID="dia">Why do you care? I gave my life for this land.
Chuck walks towards him. Suddenly Bill turns and takes off running. Chuck swings at him with the lantern. Bill escapes behind the building wall of flame that springs up between them.
The whirr of the locusts stops for a moment--they seem at times to have a collective mind--then, just as mysteriously, resumes.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">Stop, Chuck!
Chuck leaps on his horse. She tries to drag him off but is thrown aside and almost trampled underfoot. Now the others join in, trying to knock away the lantern or catch his stirrup. He eludes them and rides off after Bill,  leaving a slash of flame behind him in the grain. They tear off their coats to swat it out, in vain--already it stretches a hundred yards.
</p><p><p ID="slug">264	BILL
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill runs through the night, still carrying his lantern. Chuck bears down on him. Abby chases along behind him, screaming for him to stop.
Bill realizes the lantern is giving his position away He blows it out and vanishes from sight. All we can see is the thundering horseman, sowing fire.
</p><p><p ID="slug">265	CRANE SHOT
</p><p><p ID="act">With a rough idea where Bill is, Chuck begins to lay a ring of fire around him, fifty yards in diameter.
</p><p><p ID="slug">266	BILL AND ABBY INSIDE RING
</p><p><p ID="act">Abby spots Bill against the flames. She rushes up, gasping. They have been caught inside the ring.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">What're you doing? This is a bad place to talk
He throws his coat over Abby's head, picks her up by the waist and crashes through the flame. They have to shout to make themselves understood. The locusts roar like a cyclone.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Did you see that? He was trying to burn me. What's got into him?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">He knows. He must.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">A whole year's work. All wasted! These bugs, once they make up

He leaves. Abby wonders if she ought to run after him.

<P ID="dia">Bill!
But this moment's hesitation has been too long. Already he is swallowed up in the night, her voice swept away in the roar of the flame and the locusts, who seem to wail louder now, and with a great mournfulness--like keening Arab women--as if they knew the fate shortly to envelop
them.
Abby turns back. She, too, has reason to fear Chuck and must escape.

denly Chuck steps from the shadows, blocking her exit.
His face, black with soot, looks gruesome in the gas1ight. The locusts have chewed up his clothes.
Abby is like a frightened deer. Did he see her packing?

Chuck drapes his neck with the stole he used in slaughtering the hog. Her face goes empty. He gets his razor strop from the shaving basin. She shrinks back in the corner. He looks at her for a moment, then leaves the room.

</p><p><p ID="act">Dawn breaks. Chuck rides over the burnt-out fields looking for Bill. The feet of his lank white mare are wrapped to the fetlock in wet burlap, to protect them from the smouldering grass. It prances warily along, without
making a sound, wreathed in a mist of blue smoke. With him he carries a stool. The camera pans up to the smoke which is carrying his fortune off.
</p><p><p ID="slug">280	CHUCK'S POVS
</p><p><p ID="act">Burnt, blind deer stand and look at him in utter terror, as though they understood his intentions. The roasted corpses of sharptail grouse, coyotes and badgers lie scattered here and there. Piles of dung burn on after the grass is out.
A peacock from the Belvedere wanders around, angry and
perplexed.
</p><p><p ID="slug">281	BILL
</p><p><p ID="act">Bill is repairing his motorbike by a rock in the middle of the scorched landscape. The tires are soft as licorice from the heat. Suddenly, he looks up. Chuck has found him.
He jumps behind the handlebars and fishtails off. Chuck breaks into a gallop, rides him down, knocks him to the ground with the stool, dismounts and stamps in the spokes of the front wheel to make sure he goes no further.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Who do you think you are? Now you've ruined it. What's got

<P ID="dia">Why do I have to tell you? I can come and go when I like.

Bill stops when he sees the stool. Chuck calmly strops the razor on his stirrup flap. There are no secrets now.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">What can I say? Too late for apologies. You've got a right
to hate me.
Chuck puts the razor away and advances on Bill with the stool.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I want to leave. You won't ever see me again. I already got what
I deserve.
There is nothing Bill can say to appease him. This will be a fight to the death. Chuck lashes out with the stool. Bill ducks too late.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Watch it!
Chuck comes at him again. Bill throws a punch, but Chuck blocks it and knocks him down again with the stool.
Bill reels back and cracks his head on the bicycle frame. This time he stays down. Satisfied the struggle is over, Chuck goes back to get some rope.
</p><p><p ID="slug">282	NEW ANGLE
</p><p><p ID="act">Chuck shuts his eyes to mumble a prayer of absolution--in Russian.
Bill in a panic, snaps a spoke out of the broken wheel and lays it against his sleeve.
Chuck moves in for the kill. Bill gets to his feet. He wants to run but fear makes his knees like water. Suddenly, they are face to face. Chuck swings at Bill with the stool but misses. Bill lifts the spoke above him and
drives it deep into Chuck's heart.
Chuck gasps. Bill seems just as shocked. Chuck sits down to determine the gravity of his injury. Blood jets rhythmically out the end of the spoke, as though from a straw. Bill circles him, unbelieving.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Should I pull it out?
Chuck puts his finger over the end of the spoke. Blood seeps out the side of his mouth, like sap from a broken stem.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">I better get somebody.
He tries to catch the reins of Chuck's horse, but it shies out of reach, its conscience repelled. He looks back at Chuck in anguish.  What has he done?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Get a doctor! Fast!
How much did he see? Bill does not stay to find out but
takes off running, though not without first collecting his
rabbit.
Benson, meanwhile, bounds down the hill to Chuck's side.
His left sleeve has been burned away. The flesh beneath
is the color of a raw steak.

They look at each other for a moment.
Then, in a rush of compassion for them all, she throws
her arms around him.
Bill wonders if she is taking him back. Might their
differences all have been a terrible misunderstanding?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">We have to hurry. Chuck's out looking right now. Oh, Bill,
what have we done? He took his razor. We need to hurry. He
might be coming back any minute.
Bill mentions nothing of his encounter. She grabs her
bindle, Bill a handful of silverware and an umbrella.
After a moment's hesitation, he puts them back.
</p><p><p ID="slug">288	NEW ANGLE
</p><p><p ID="act">They run down to the barn, where the cars are stored.
The saplings in the front yard have been stripped even

could she expect him to?
Bill grabs her by the hand and tugs her along.

Abby stands in the door. She is reluctant to leave, though she

She notices that Bill's lip is cut, his shirt soaked with

</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">What happened to you? Where's this from?
Bill looks down. He forgot.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BILL
<P ID="dia">Had an accident.
She looks at him for a moment, not quite trusting this
explanation. The engine catches with a noise like start-

are pulling out of the garage, Ursula runs up, black 
as coal from battling the fire all night.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA

He sees that her mind is somewhere else. He wants to tell
her the truth about Chuck, for intimacy's sake, but it
would just put more of a cloud over everything. It might
even cause her to hate him.

things.
He looks at Abby, mouthing silent words in her sleep.
He puts on a white scarf and starts down to the boat. The

He empties out the contents of his pockets -- a watch, a
couple of dollars in change, a ring -- and slaps them down
in front of her.
The Police fan out along the ridge above them. He jams a

Suddenly he runs into a trot line that a fisherman has
left out overnight. The hooks bite into his thigh and
shoulder, yanking a string of startled, thrashing catfish
out of the water.
He keeps running in a panic, not realizing the line is
staked to the shore. All at once, he jackknifes in the

<P ID="dia">They'll teach you poise, too, so you can walk in any room you 
please. Pretty soon you'll know all kind of things.
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">I never read a whole book till I was fifteen. It was by Caesar.
They laugh at her careful pronunciation of "Caesar."
</p><p><p ID="slug">317	EXT. TRAIN STATION
</p><p><p ID="act">Abby's train is about to leave. The CONDUCTOR walks by
blowing a whistle. A five-piece BAND plays Sousa airs.
They are practically the only civilians on the platform.
The rest are SOLDIERS bound for Europe, where America has
just entered the War, on fire with excitement and a sense
of high adventure.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">I like your hat.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">It doesn't seem like a bird came down and landed on my head?
Abby takes the hat off and gives it to Ursula, who lately
has begun to take more trouble with her appearance, comb-
ing her hair free of its usual snarls. They laugh at their reflection
in a window of the train.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">I hardly ever wear it. Be sure and write every week.
Signals nod. A lamp winks. There are leave-takings up
and down the platform as the train slides away. Abby hops
on board. A SOLDIER next to her sheds bitter tears.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">You write me, too!
They wave goodbye.
</p><p><p ID="slug">318	EXT. ARBORETUM - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">Late that evening Ursula lowers herself out a third-floor
window of the Arboretum with a rope made of bedsheets.
</p><p><p ID="slug">319	TIGHT ON GIRLS AT WINDOW
</p><p><p ID="act">The other GIRLS stand in their nightgowns and wave good-
bye, amazed at her boldness.
She slips off into the night.
</p><p><p ID="slug">320	EXT. BACKSTAGE DOOR - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">Ursula looks in a backstage door. She can see, through
the wings, a MAN dancing on stage. There is a feeling of
mad excitement about the place.
The person she is looking for is not here, however.
</p><p><p ID="slug">321	EXT. ALLEY - URSULA'S THEME - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">She runs down an alley. A man steps out of the shadows--
George, the pilot. She throws herself in his arms. This
is our first sight of him since he left the bonanza.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">You're here! Oh, hug me!
They kiss madly, with mystery. The moonlit, midsummer night thrums
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">Aren't we happy? Oh, George, has anybody ever been this happy?
He rocks her back and forth in his arms. They laugh,
thinking what lucky exceptions they are to the world's
misery.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">Hurry.  They'll be looking for me.
</p><p><p ID="slug">322	EXT. AIRPLANE - DAWN
</p><p><p ID="act">George bundles Ursula, giggling, into a biplane.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">URSULA
<P ID="dia">This doesn't even belong to you. Suppose they catch us?
</p><p><p ID="slug">323	EXT. PASTURE -- DAWN
</p><p><p ID="act">From a pasture outside town the plane rises into the vast dawn sky.
</p><p><p ID="slug">324	INT. TEXTILE FACTORY
</p><p><p ID="act">Abby changes bobbins on a huge loom. A pall of lint and
anonymous toil hangs over the factory. Down the way a
handsome MALE WORKER smiles at her. She smiles back,
interested.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY
<P ID="dia">It seems an age we've been apart, and truly is for those who
love each other so. Whenever shall we meet?'
</p><p><p ID="slug">325	TIGHT ON MACHINERY
</p><p><p ID="act">The shuttle rockets back and forth. Off camera we hear
Abby reading what seems part of a letter to Ursula.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">Soon, I hope, for by and by we'll all be gone, Urs. Does
it really seem as though we might?'
</p><p><p ID="slug">326	UNDERWATER SHOT
</p><p><p ID="act">We look from the bottom of a river up toward the light. 
In the foreground, dangling from the tip of a submerged
limb, is the bracelet Abby threw away.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">'The other day I tried to think how I'd look laid out in a solemn
white gown. Closing my eyes I could almost hear you tiptoe inlook down in my face, so deep asleep, so still.
</p><p><p ID="slug">327	EXT. FIELDS - SERIES OF ANGLES
</p><p><p ID="act">The PEOPLE of the Razumihin rebuild the land -- raising
fences and sinking a well, plowing down the stubble and
putting in the seed.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ABBY (o.s.)
<P ID="dia">'I went to Lincoln Park Zoo the other day. It was great as usual.
I enclose a check.'
</p><p><p ID="act">An ANONYMOUS YOUNG MAN, standing on a carpet 
of new-sprung wheat, looks up with a start. From the 
distance comes a ghostly noise--the call of the prairie 
chickens at their spring rites. He listens for just a moment, 
then returns to work.
</p><p><p ID="act">THE END</p>
