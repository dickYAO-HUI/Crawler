<br>24 February 81


</p><p><p ID="act">“Physicists propose that two alternate histories, two equally valid realities, could exist side by side: the one you know, and the one in which you don’t exist. Time itself may have many potential dimensions, despite the fact that we are condemned to experience only one of them.”

</p><p><p ID="act">“Hey, kids, what time is it?”
<br>--Buffalo Bob Smith
<br>“The Howdy Doody Show”


</p><p><p ID="slug">FADE IN:

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. OUTER SPACE

</p><p><p ID="act">The MOTHER SHIP rises above Devil’s Tower and sails off into space to the strains of John Williams. In a moment we realize that we’re watching the end titles of “Close Encounters”, and then we

</p><p><p ID="act">PULL BACK TO REVEAL

</p><p><p ID="act">that the image is on a TV monitor...as we continue PULLING BACK, we discover a bank of video equipment, and “Close Encounters” is being pirated, from 3/4” cassette to VHS and Beta.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. VIDEO WORK AREA – LABORATORY – DAY

</p><p><p ID="act">The video pirate operating this equipment is MARTY McFLY, 17, a good looking kid who has an air of confidence just shy of cockiness. He’s wearing a silver Porsche jacket, and like most typical modern day kids, not a stitch of his clothing is without some brand name or form of advertising. He’s looking at an ad for a guitar amp in ROLLING STONE.

</p><p><p ID="act">With the movie over, Marty shuts down the equipment, ejects the cassettes, and writes on them, “Close Encounters, Original Edition.”

</p><p><p ID="act">He puts the master tape back in a drawer, and we catch a glimpse of a few other titles---“Empire Strikes Back,” “Stir Crazy,” “Superman II.”

</p><p><p ID="act">MARTY

</p><p><p ID="act">packs up his cassettes with his school books and takes us into ANOTHER PART OF THE LABORATORY. The lab is a huge room, and workbenches are all over, covered with chemical and electronic equipment. The place is old and dusty and has the air of a mad scientist lab of the 50’s.

</p><p><p ID="act">An ELDERLY MAN is hunched over an experiment on one side of the lab. Marty calls to him.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Professor Brown! It's almost 8:30---I'm outta here!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Ssshhhh!

</p><p><p ID="act">PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN, late 60’s, is tinkering with a device that looks like a Solar Cell, positioning it under a skylight to catch the sun’s rays. He is eccentric, moody, but basically kindly. And very involved in his work.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty has a closer look at what the Professor is working on. The device is easily 30 years old, and Brown pours a chemical solution into a compartment in the cell. He plugs a patch cord from the Cell into a Voltmeter. An incandescent bulb on the panel glows dimly, and the meter needles move slightly.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Blast it!! 24 measly volts!

</p><p><p ID="act">He throws an Erlenmeyer Flask across the room---it shatters against the wall. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="spkdir">(points to the sun)
<P ID="dia">The power of a million hydrogen bombs...
<P ID="spkdir">(points to his experiment)
<P ID="dia">...and we get 24 measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this Power Converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electrical energy! But no! 33 years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house---we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">A 35mm film chain...I'll see what I can do.... 

</p><p><p ID="act">The Professor ponders his Power Converter.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty is on his way out. He pauses at a door with 5 locks on it and tries it. Of course it doesn’t open.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Won't give up, will you, Marty? 

</p><p><p ID="act">Professor Brown asks without turning around. Marty grins.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="spkdir">(grins)
<P ID="dia">One of these days you're gonna leave this door open and I'll find out what's in there.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Oh---Marty---what time did you say it was?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">8:30.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">A.M. or P.M.?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Pro, the sun's out!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia"> Oh, right, right.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.

</p><p><p ID="act">Indeed there are a number of clocks all over the lab.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">On the contrary. I may not pay much attention to the measurement of time, but I'm very aware of Time itself. 

</p><p><p ID="act">As he talks, Brown walks toward Marty

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN (CONT’D)
<P ID="dia">I believe time to be its own dimension...to be contained...to be controlled...

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty has had enough of the Professor’s rambling. He’s heading down the stairway.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Catch you later!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty is gone.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN (CONT’D)
<P ID="dia">...to be travelled through.

</p><p><p ID="act">Professor Brown unlocks the door and enters.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. LOCKED ROOM

</p><p><p ID="act">The center of attention here is a morass of equipment of 1940’s and 50’s vintage that looks like something out of “Amazing Stories” or “Weird Science.” A series of lenses is the final end to the maze, indicating that a ray of some sort is to be beamed down on...whatever.

</p><p><p ID="act">Professor Brown admires his invention.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">If only I could harness enough power!

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. STAIRWAY – MARTY

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty comes down the stairs to street level and goes out the door.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. ORPHEUM THEATER BUILDING – DAY

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty steps out onto the street from the ORPHEUM THEATER BUILDING, the 3rd floor of which houses the lab.

</p><p><p ID="act">The theater is old and abandoned; on the marquee are the words, “Assembly of Christ.” From outside, the two stories of offices above the theater look just as destitute, with weathered, soot covered walls and an occasional boarded up window.

</p><p><p ID="act">Most of the neighboring businesses are boarded up as well. We get the feeling that this was once a thriving business district...but those days are long gone.

</p><p><p ID="act">A black van is parked a little ways down the street; on its side we see the letters “N.R.C.” TWO MEN are putting samples of gutter water into test tubes. They pay no attention to Marty. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty goes next door into one of the only operating businesses in sight: WILSON’S CAFE, a lunch counter joint on its last legs.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. WILSON’S CAFE

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty enters. The proprieter, DICK WILSON, 35, is behind the counter. Dick is quite overweight...and he’s munching on a Baby Ruth candy bar.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Morning, Dick.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DICK
<P ID="dia">Marty. What's for breakfast?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Gimme some Chili, fries, and a Tab.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty glances at the sports page of a discarded paper on the counter as Dick brings him the Tab.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DICK
<P ID="dia">Hot tip: Rubber Biscuit in the 3rd race at Arlington.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DICK
<P ID="spkdir">(shrugs)
<P ID="dia">3rd time they've been out there this week.

</p><p><p ID="act"> Marty watches them for a moment. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">What's N.R.C.?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DICK
<P ID="spkdir">(shrugs) 
<P ID="dia">I don't know. National Cash Register?

</p><p><p ID="right">CUT TO: 

</p><p><p ID="act">INSERT – SCIENCE TEXTBOOK

</p><p><p ID="act">A PHOTOGRAPH OF A MUSHROOM CLOUD, with the caption, “Last above ground atomic test, March 18, 1952, Atkins, Nevada.” A HAND writes the initials “M.M. + S.P.” in the cloud, draws an arrow through it like a valentine, and then writes, “How about the Dance Saturday? We’ll have a BLAST!”

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM – ON MARTY

</p><p><p ID="act">The hand belongs to Marty, who fakes attention to the lecture being given by MR. ARKY, a frustrated, embittered teacher of 55.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">There were only 3 above ground Atomic Tests in the United States, so the government took every opportunity to study the effects of radiation. Actual single family tract homes were constructed on the test site, totally furnished with refrigerators, TV's, furniture...anything you could find in a typical home...just so scientists could learn what kind of damage an atomic bomb would do to a typical town. They even put mannequins in the houses, just like in auto crash tests...

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty tears the page out of his textbook and winks at SUZY PARKER, the cute girl across the aisle and behind him. They exchange a smile, and Marty tosses the folded page to her.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">But the fact remains that today, 30 years after those early nuclear tests, the threat of nuclear annihilation is as great as it ever was. Certainly, nuclear annhiliation is something you all must have thought about. Any questions, comments, ideas? Anyone?

</p><p><p ID="act">No reaction at all from the class. No one has a hand up, no one seems interested.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">I'm talking about the complete and total destruction of the entire world. Doesn't anybody have <u>anything</u> to say about it?

</p><p><p ID="act">No, no one does.

</p><p><p ID="act">Arky is becoming angered and frustrated.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">How about you, Mr. Jackson? Would you like to share some of your wisdom with the class?

</p><p><p ID="act">Jackson clearly wouldn’t.

</p><p><p ID="act">Now Suzy writes something on Marty’s note, folds it, and tosses it back. It lands on the floor near Marty, and he picks it up.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="spkdir">(frustration rising)
<P ID="dia">Mr. Gomez? Any thoughts? Miss Parker? Mr. Crump, any reaction?

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty unfolds the note.

</p><p><p ID="act">INSERT – THE NOTE

</p><p><p ID="act">Next to the mushroom cloud has been written, “That’s <u>sick</u>.” On the back has been written, “Yes.”

</p><p><p ID="act">BACK TO SHOT

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty smiles.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">How about you, Mr. McFly?

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty quickly folds the note and shoves it in his pocket. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">Did you even hear the question, Mr. McFly?

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty looked up, facing the inevitable. He might as well give his honest opinion.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Yeah. You want to know what I think about atomic bombs. Well, I'd kinda like to see one.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">You'd like to <u>see</u> a nuclear holocaust?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Not a holocaust----- 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="spkdir">(to the class)
<P ID="dia">Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">You know damn well that's not what I meant.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="spkdir">(isn’t interested)
<P ID="dia">All I can say is, that's one helluvan attitude, Mr. McFly. “Let's explode a 100 megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to <u>see</u> it.”

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="spkdir">(pissed, under his breath)
<P ID="dia">Yeah, explode it up your ass.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY (continuing)
<P ID="dia">Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may <u>see</u> the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly <u>see</u> the destruction of all our natural resources. We can already <u>see</u> the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  <u>see</u> all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to---a lot to <u>see</u>.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break! I'm 17 years old! I'm not responsible for all these problems!

</p><p><p ID="act">Mr. Arky sobers up and sighs.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">No, of course you're not. Not for the problems, no. But for the solutions...yes.

</p><p><p ID="act">The bell rings. There is a rush to the door. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia"><u>See</u> you tomorrow.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. HIGH SCHOOL – DAY

</p><p><p ID="act">STUDENTS pour out of the school. It’s a typically middle-American school, brick, idyllic, flanked by oak trees. There is some graffiti and a boarded up window or two.

</p><p><p ID="act">Students begin their after school rituals of smoking, drinking, loitering, eyeing girls or guys as the case may be, showing off their cars.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty is among a group of kids, surreptitiously exchanging video tapes for cash. RAFE NEWTON approaches him.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEWTON
<P ID="dia">Hey Marty, spot me 50 till the weekend, would ya? I'm down to my last 20.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Can't, man. I'm savin' up for that new amp.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEWTON
<P ID="dia">Well, when you're a big rock star, how about loanin' me a grand?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">You got it! 
<P ID="spkdir">(checks his watch) 
<P ID="dia">I gotta go.

</p><p><p ID="act">Next to Marty is his friend DONALDSON.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DONALDSON
<P ID="dia">Hey man, what happened to your digital quartz?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">In the shop. So I'm sporting this antique. Check out this wind-up action.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty shows him a gold wind-up wrist watch. Marty stuffs a wad of cash in his pocket as he and Donaldson descend the steps.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DONALDSON
<P ID="dia">Hey, you wanna come over?  Get high?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Maybe tomorrow. I gotta dupe some more tapes.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DONALDSON
<P ID="dia">Hey, that reminds me: my brother's gettin' married next week and I'm throwin' a party for him. Can you provide some entertainment?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Yeah, I can run something off this afternoon.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. LAB – ON MARTY – DAY

</p><p><p ID="act">as we hear sounds of HEAVY BREATHING, ORGIASTIC PANTING and other Porno sound effects. Marty shakes his head at what he’s seeing (we can’t see it) and turns down the volume. He’s of course copying a porno film.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty puts a big wad of cash into a cigar box on the bench, then walks over to another area of the lab.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. LAB – PROF. BROWN’S QUARTERS

</p><p><p ID="act">Professor Brown is sleeping on an army cot, covered with a horse blanket. Nearby is an old refrigerator, a hot plate, and some clothes hanging from an exposed pipe.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty opens the refrigerator and pulls out a bottle of Coke. He inadvertently knocks an orange out, and it rolls across the floor, under the cot.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty stoops down to get the orange. He moves the blanket and reacts with astonishment at what he sees:

</p><p><p ID="act">A CRATE

</p><p><p ID="act">with purple radioactivity emblems labeled: EXTREME DANGER! RADIOACTIVE PLUTONIUM! AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY! DO NOT HANDLE WITHOUT RADIATION SUIT! And further down, “Property of San Onofre Nuclear Power Plant, San Onofre, California.” The orange is resting right up against it.

</p><p><p ID="act">MARTY

</p><p><p ID="act">takes a deep breath, then uses his foot to roll the orange away from the crate. He cautiously backs away from the cot and tosses the orange into a trash can. Professor Brown continues sleeping soundly.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty twists off the Coke cap, takes a swig, and walks over to a cage with an ORGAN GRINDER MONKEY in it.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Hey Shemp, how ya doin’?

</p><p><p ID="act">Shemp is wearing a red coat and hat. Marty opens the cage and lets Shemp climb on him.

</p><p><p ID="act">Now Marty walks over to where the Power Converter is set up. Nearby is a stack of blueprints, very old. Marty has a look.

</p><p><p ID="act">THE BLUEPRINTS

</p><p><p ID="act">include on top, the “Photo-Electric Chemical Power Converter,” which is the invention on the bench; the “15 Tube Mechanical Home Butler,” which is a robot; the “Aero-Mobile,” (a flying car); and something called a “Write-O-Matic,” which resembles a pen with a wire-attached suction cup.

</p><p><p ID="act">MARTY 

</p><p><p ID="act">studies the Power Converter itself. The last rays of the afternoon sun shine through the skylight and fall on the Photo-cell. A funnel is sticking out of the chemical chamber, and it becomes just too much for Marty to resist: he pours some Coca-Cola in it. Suddenly, a blinding spark crackles from the other end of the device! Marty jumps back!

</p><p><p ID="act">PROFESSOR BROWN

</p><p><p ID="act">awakens with a start! He looks around, then rushes over to the power converter.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">What happened?!?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Well, I'm not sure exactly---I accidentally spilled some Coke in here---just a drop!

</p><p><p ID="act">Brown hooks up the voltmeter and light bulb.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Give me that!

</p><p><p ID="act">He takes the Coke from Marty and pours a little into the funnel. The light bulb glows brilliantly, the voltmeter needle jumps, and the equipment hums!

</p><p><p ID="act">Brown pours in more Coke---the bulb glows with increasing intensity, then explodes! The voltmeter needle goes off the scale! The Power Converter vibrates and falls off the bench!

</p><p><p ID="act">The Professor stares in disbelief; his hands begin to tremble. His reaction would be no different if Jesus Christ himself walked into the room! He checks the ingredients on the bottle.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">What's in this stuff?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Nobody knows the formula for Coca-Cola. It's the most closely guarded secret in the world!

</p><p><p ID="act">The Professor ponders the discovery, then gathers up the Power Converter and goes to the Locked Door. He begins unlocking it, then looks at Marty. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">I'll see you tomorrow.

</p><p><p ID="act">Professor Brown takes the device into the room and locks the door behind him.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. MARTY’S BEDROOM – NIGHT

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty, wearing headphones, is playing his Electric Guitar along with a record on his stereo. His bedroom walls have posters of rock stars; a second bed and bedroom set are testament to an older brother no longer living at home.

</p><p><p ID="act">As Marty plays he walks around using the top of the guitar neck to move objects and lift magazines on the desk and bureaus. He’s looking for something. He moves a Rolling Stone---under it are some tools. He moves an issue of Heavy Metal and the Lampoon---under it, some homework.

</p><p><p ID="act">The record ends; Marty takes off the headphones and yells out the door.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY 
<P ID="dia">Who stole the drill?

</p><p><p ID="act">He is answered by a WOMAN’S VOICE.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WOMAN (O.S.)
<P ID="dia">Dinner’s ready!

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. McFLY HOME – NIGHT

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty goes downstairs into the living room. The furnishings are Montgomery Ward/Sears. GEORGE McFLY, 47, is absorbed in a BOXING MATCH on TV. He’s balding, bored, uninspired; a man who lost at the game of life.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Anybody seen the drill?

</p><p><p ID="act">His father doesn’t react. His mother, EILEEN, 47, sticks her head out of the kitchen. Once she was very attractive. Now she’s in a rut.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">EILEEN
<P ID="dia">I've been calling you for 5 minutes! Didn't you hear me?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">I was practicing. I've got an audition next week---I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">EILEEN
<P ID="dia">You won't get famous if you don't eat, either.

<P ID="spkdir">(to Marty)
<P ID="dia">That was our first date. Remember George? I remember everything about that night. Remember the first time we kissed? It was during the last dance. They were playing that Eddie Fisher song, “Turn Back The Hands Of Time.” I even remember how you asked me out. We were in the cafeteria. You were so scared, you spilled your creamed corn.

</p><p><p ID="act">George just stares at the TV, oblivious to his wife.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">And I probably won't be here when you wake up Sunday morning. Suzy and I are gonna go down to the lake and watch the sun rise.

<P ID="dia">The sun rise? What for?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">To see it.

</p><p><p ID="act">George doesn’t get it. He turns his attention back to the TV.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">EILEEN

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BIFF
<P ID="dia">Look, McFly, I know a lot about tools. This is a cheep-ass drill! You're just lucky I didn't ruin my engine block. Next time you buy tools, let me know. I'll help you pick out some good ones.
<P ID="spkdir">(gives George the drill)
<P ID="dia">Oh--and one more thing: my kid's selling girl scout cookies. I told her you were good for 4 boxes. Don't make me a liar!

</p><p><p ID="act">George nods timidly as Biff exits. He turns and faces his wife and son who meet his gaze with knowing looks.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">How do you like that guy, using wood bits on an engine block?

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty gets up from the table and storms out, into the living room.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty puts on his silver Porsche jacket as he stomps across the front lawn. He punches the beat up old mailbox which has the address: 777; then kicks the family car.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. A RESIDENTIAL STREET – NIGHT

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty is taking a walk with Suzy Parker. Marty’s been talking, and although still frustrated, he’s now much more at ease.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time. People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Yeah....Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.

</p><p><p ID="act">They walk a bit in silence. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SUZY
<P ID="dia">Can you imagine your parents in bed together?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">No way!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SUZY
<P ID="dia">Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Hell, no! The way my Mom carries on about sex---you even say the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday. Always afraid something’s gonna happen.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SUZY
<P ID="spkdir">(flirting)
<P ID="dia"><u>Is</u> something gonna happen Saturday night?

</p><p><p ID="act">Before Marty can answer, he gets hit in the leg by a runaway SKATEBOARD. TWO KIDS down the street have been running an obstacle course, and the loser is picking himself up off the pavement.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty hops on the skateboard and whizzes over to the kid. He can’t resist showing off---he manuevers smoothly through the obstacles, jumps over the last one and lands perfectly on the board, then hops off, flipping the board into the air and catching it. He hands it back to the kid.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">KID
<P ID="dia">Wow! You’re good!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty grins and rejoins Suzy. She too is impressed.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Just like riding a bike---you never forget how to do it.

</p><p><p ID="act">They’re standing in front of a house. Suzy looks at it, then at Marty. Obviously, it’s her house.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SUZY
<P ID="dia">Well...here we are....

</p><p><p ID="act">They look at each other for a moment.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Thanks.

</p><p><p ID="act">He kisses her.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SUZY
<P ID="dia">See you later.

</p><p><p ID="act">She goes into her house. Marty watches her, then continues down the street, alone with his thoughts. As he walks, a black sedan approaches slowly from in front of him and passes by. There appears to be some sort of receiving apparatus on the roof. Now we see the sedan make a U-turn in the street behind Marty and come up right behind him.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty becomes aware of the headlights behind him. He looks at the car and steps over to the side of the street. The car pulls up alongside of him, and TWO GOVERNMENT TYPES get out. There are N.R.C. markings on the car.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">REESE
<P ID="dia">Good evening. Agents Reese and Foley from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
<P ID="spkdir">(Reese displays his ID)
<P ID="dia">Mind stepping over here?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">FOLEY
<P ID="dia">Routine radiation check.

</p><p><p ID="act">Foley takes a Geiger Counter and checks Marty. Nothing unusual happens until Foley checks Marty’s feet. Then there is some noticeable clicking, especially on the foot that went nearest the Plutonium. Reese and Foley exchange a look.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">REESE
<P ID="dia">Have you got any identification?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Yeah. Right.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. ORPHEUM THEATER – NIGHT

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty runs through the street to the Orpheum Theater. The only thing on the street besides him is newspaper blowing along the gutters. Marty tries the door to the upstairs. It’s locked. Marty steps back and looks at the upper floor.

</p><p><p ID="act">Suddenly, 3 upper floor windows are blown out by a tremendous gush of air!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Jesus!

</p><p><p ID="act">He tries the door again. Marty has no other choice: he BREAKS THE GLASS in the door and lets himself in!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty races up the stairs to the laboratory. The door with the locks on it is unlocked, and LIGHT can be seen coming from the crack under the door.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty rushes through the door into

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. THE “LOCKED” ROOM

</p><p><p ID="act">Professor Brown is standing next to a HOMEMADE NUCLEAR REACTOR, made from an old furnace, a hot water heater, and boiler room parts. He has one hand on a rope, and is adjusting some dials and gauges.

</p><p><p ID="act">SHEMP is sitting quietly on a stool directly under the focusing lens of the Professor’s invention. He’s wearing his organ grinder clothes, with a digital watch around his neck.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Professor! 

</p><p><p ID="act">The Professor, although surprised to see Marty, is in command of the situation.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Get behind that lead shield!

</p><p><p ID="act">He points to the shield at one side of the room.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">But Professor----

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty hurries behind the shield.

</p><p><p ID="act">Professor Brown pulls the rope ever so slightly.

</p><p><p ID="act">The Power Converter is activated! The low frequency hum of vacuum tubes becomes more intense---the frequency begins to rise, accompanied by the crackle of static electricity!

</p><p><p ID="act">Shemp looks around, curious about all of these sounds...the sounds grow in intensity...tension builds...and at exactly 9:00, Professor Brown releases the rope. At that moment, a high frequency tone is emitted, accompanied by a FOCUSED BEAM OF BLINDING RED LIGHT---like a spotlight---which hits Shemp!

</p><p><p ID="act">Shemp DISAPPEARS! And the top half of the stool disappears with him, leaving the lower halves of the legs (which were not hit by the beam) to topple to the floor!

</p><p><p ID="act">Air rushes through the lab to fill the vacuum that was created by Shemp’s disappearance!

</p><p><p ID="act">The sound of the equipment dies down, and a stunned Marty McFly steps out from behind the shield.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Jesus!! Professor, you just disintegrated Shemp!

</p><p><p ID="act">Professor Brown shook his head, a smile playing around his lips. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Then where is he?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">The appropriate question to ask is <u>when</u> is he. You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future---two minutes into future, to be exact.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp??

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now. And at exactly 9:02, we'll catch up to him.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Now hold on a minute, Professor. Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this---all of this here---that this is---it's a---a--- 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">A time machine.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty has to sit down to take this one in.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">I always knew it would work. I knew it would work when I built it 33 years ago. But I was never able to harness enough power to test it. Power is the key. Massive amounts of energy to accelerate matter to the speed of light while creating an intense gravitational field. But generating that kind of energy has never been possible...until this afternoon.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Because of that Coke.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Precisely.

</p><p><p ID="act">Brown takes on the characteristics of a tour guide as he explains the machine.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">The Power Converter, now operating at peak efficiency, thanks to the chemical makeup of Coca-Cola, channels energy into the Flux Capacitor, which releases several jigowatts in a fraction of a millisecond. Electron acceleration takes place here...and the result is the temporal displacement beam you saw a few moments ago. The entire process is triggered when I release the rope.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">I thought that Power Converter thing operated on solar energy. There's no sun.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Solar energy would have worked just fine...if I could have placed the Converter about a mile from the surface of the sun. Instead, I've created similar conditions in this reactor here.
<P ID="spkdir">(indicating the rope) 
<P ID="dia">The higher I raise the cadmium rods, the more energy I release from the Plutonium core, and the further through time I can send an object.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">The Plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Why?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">I just got stopped in the street by Federal Agents checking me for radiation! I figure they're after your plutonium!

</p><p><p ID="act">Professor Brown glances at a digital clock in the lab. It’s 9:01:50.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Ten seconds!!

</p><p><p ID="act">He rushes toward the spot where Shemp vanished. Marty follows.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Brace yourself for a sudden displacement of air!

</p><p><p ID="act">It’s 9:01:55...56...57...58...59...

</p><p><p ID="act">There is a SUDDEN DISPLACEMENT OF AIR...and SHEMP REAPPEARS! The legless stool reappears as well, and topples over. The startled monkey jumps onto a nearby bank of equipment.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Shemp!

</p><p><p ID="act">Professor Brown picks up Shemp, looks him over and examines the watch around his neck: 9:00:10. The lab clock says 9:02:10.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Exactly two minutes difference...and still ticking!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Is Shemp all right?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp, the trip was instantaneous.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty has a look on his face---the look of an idea.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Theoretically, yes, if I were to reverse the polarity.

</p><p><p ID="act">Professor Brown indicates the POLARITY SWITCH on the Time Machine, which is in the “+” position.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="spkdir">(very excited)
<P ID="dia">Jeez, Professor, you've got a gold mine here!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">A gold mine?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY (CONT’D)
<P ID="dia">Sure! Listen---we take the racing results from today's paper...

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty rips through a discarded newspaper and finds them.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Here they are---we send 'em with Shemp back to yesterday, we get the information, put our money on the winning horses, and become billionaires!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Marty, that would alter history.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">So what?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">The future, Marty, the future is everything. I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp 24 hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Sure.

</p><p><p ID="act">The Professor exits the Time Machine room into his main laboratory. Marty sees that he’s gone, so he tears the racing results from the Sports Page, circles the date, and sticks the clipping into Shemp’s pocket. Again making sure that the Professor isn’t watching, Marty flips the polarity switch to “-“.

</p><p><p ID="act">Brown sets up the stool and again places Shemp upon it.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Come on, Shemp, this won't hurt a bit.

</p><p><p ID="act">The Professor takes his place at the reactor. Shemp is between him and Marty. He doesn’t notice the polarity switch.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Here we go.

</p><p><p ID="act">Brown makes no effort to move away from the reactor---rather, he pulls the rope a slight bit more!

</p><p><p ID="act">Foley FIRES at the Professor!

</p><p><p ID="act">The noise startles Shemp, who jumps off his stool.

</p><p><p ID="act">Professor Brown takes the bullet in the upper chest! He staggers back, still holding the rope, and as he falls, he pulls the rope as far as it will go!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Professor! 
<P ID="spkdir">(glances at meter)
<P ID="dia">Oh, my God!! Release the rope! It's 4200 rads!!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">REESE
<P ID="spkdir">(can’t hear him)
<P ID="dia">What??

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Release the rope!!

</p><p><p ID="act">The incredible din of the equipment makes the screaming virtually inaudible! Marty rushes toward the Professor, but Foley immediately levels his gun at him!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">FOLEY
<P ID="dia">Freeze!!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty freezes---he’s standing right under the focusing lens! He raises his hands!

</p><p><p ID="act">Professor Brown is lying on the floor, his hand still on the rope. His grip relaxes, and the rope is released!

</p><p><p ID="act">The Time Beam engulfs Marty! This time, it’s BRIGHT WHITE!

</p><p><p ID="act">Reese and Foley are dumbfounded!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty looks up.

</p><p><p ID="act">MARTY’S P.O.V. OF

</p><p><p ID="act">an intense WHITE LIGHT. Then, suddenly, everything goes BLACK! And with the blackness comes dead quiet.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY’S VOICE
<P ID="dia">Professor?? Hello??

</p><p><p ID="act">A match is struck, and Marty looks around and finds himself in what appears to be a STOREROOM.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. STOREROOM – MARTY – NIGHT

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty cautiously looks and walks around, almost tripping over an old chair. There is some dusty furniture and crates in the room. Marty lights another match and makes his way to the door---it’s in the same place as the door in the Time Machine room, because this is the Time Machine room...as it was once. Marty tries the door: locked. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Damn!

</p><p><p ID="act">He goes to the window and opens it. We can hear the sound of muffled traffic. Marty climbs out the window.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. REAR OF ORPHEUM THEATER BUILDING – NIGHT

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty comes out of the third story window onto a fire escape, and descends. Just as he drops into the alley below, he’s hit by a pair of headlights: A LARGE TRUCK is barreling toward him! Marty presses himself up against the wall and the speeding truck passes, narrowly avoiding him!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty sighs relief, then notices the sign on the door he’s standing next to: “Wilson’s Cafe, Rear Entrance.” Marty tries the door---it opens. Marty is surprised at this; nevertheless, he enters.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. WILSON’S CAFE – NIGHT

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty walks in; yes, this is Wilson’s Cafe, all right.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Hey, since when are you open at...

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty stops short. Things are NOT the same. Dick isn’t behind the counter. Instead, there’s a WAITRESS about 30. Everything is shining clean; the fixtures look newer, but older. The prices are different, too: Roast Beef Sandwich, 30¢. Ice Cream Sundae, 15¢. And the customers---men in double-breasted suits...and hats! Women with long skirts---not one female in pants...and hairstyles like Marty has never seen!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty stares open mouthed, walking around, taking it all in. A chubby little BOY of 5 in pajamas, is playing on the floor with toy trucks.

</p><p><p ID="act">Now Marty notices the WAITRESS is staring at him with curiosity and suspicion.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITRESS
<P ID="dia">You want something, kid?

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty decides to sit down at the counter and act like he belongs here.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Uh, yeah...gimme a Tab.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITRESS
<P ID="dia">What?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">A Tab.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITRESS
<P ID="dia">Kid, I can't give you the tab until you order something.

</p><p><p ID="act">People at the counter are looking at him, especially at his silver Porsche jacket. Marty notices that the MAN next to him is drinking coffee.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Uh, coffee.

</p><p><p ID="act">She pours a cup and serves him.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITRESS
<P ID="dia">Did something happen to you, kid? I mean, you been lost in the woods or something?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Huh? 

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty looks at the bowl of sugar cubes on the counter.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY 
<P ID="dia">Say, have you got any Sweet ‘N low?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITRESS
<P ID="dia">Sweet and what?

</p><p><p ID="act">Her suspicions aroused, she takes the coffee away.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITRESS
<P ID="dia">Maybe you’d better pay for this first.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Sure.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty pulls out his wallet and hands the woman a 20 dollar bill. Her eyes nearly fall out of her head.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITRESS
<P ID="dia">A 20? What do you think this is, a bank? I can't break a 20! 
<P ID="spkdir">(suddenly suspicious)
<P ID="dia">Say, what's a kid your age doing with all this money?

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty takes the bill back. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITRESS
<P ID="dia">Dick? Dick who?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">The guy who runs this place.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITRESS
<P ID="dia">I run this place!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">What happened to Dick Wilson?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITRESS
<P ID="dia">Dick Wilson---Dickie Wilson? 
<P ID="spkdir">(laughs)
<P ID="dia">Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!

</p><p><p ID="act">Everybody at the counter starts laughing.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="spkdir">(paranoid)
<P ID="dia">What are you trying to do? Freak me out, or something?

</p><p><p ID="act">The MAN sitting next to him reacts.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MAN:
<P ID="dia">Freak? Are you from some circus? Is that what all that writing on your clothes means?

</p><p><p ID="act">Now the little BOY runs up to the counter.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOY
<P ID="dia">Mommy, I'm hungry!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITRESS
<P ID="dia">Just take a candy bar, then go to bed, Dickie.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty reacts and stares at the 5 year old. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Dickie? That's Dick Wilson?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITRESS
<P ID="dia">That's Dick Wilson.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty looks at him as he grabs a Baby Ruth from the candy counter. Then Marty spots the calendar behind the cash register. In big black numbers, it clearly reads, “1952!”

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">1952?? This is 1952?!? Holy Shit!! You know what this means?? I've gone back in time 30 years! 30 goddamn years!!! I haven't even been born yet!!!!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WAITRESS
<P ID="dia">I'm calling the cops.

</p><p><p ID="act">But even as she goes to the phone, Marty bolts out the front door!

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. STREET – NIGHT

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty stares in astonishment at the sight before him: the run-down Monroe Avenue that he knew is now a bustling, thriving business district! Traffic of 1940’s and 50’s cars pulses through the street, and pedestrians wander about. The storefronts that were boarded up are now shops doing profitable business.

</p><p><p ID="act">Pedestrians eye Marty curiously as they walk past, but Marty is too panic-stricken to notice them.

</p><p><p ID="act">Now he sees the Orpheum Theater. The marquee is lit up, and the place is obviously a first class movie house. The flashing marquee advertises, “John Wayne, Maureen O’Hara, The Quiet Man. In Full Color.”

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY 
<P ID="dia">Dammit!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty sees a pedestrian with a newspaper. He grabs it away from him and looks at the date.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY 
<P ID="dia">1952! Dammit!

</p><p><p ID="act">He throws the paper down in disgust and runs down the street.

</p><p><p ID="act">ON THE STREET

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty stops and looks at the licence plate on a parked car. Once again, there’s the year.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">1952! Dammit!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty runs off.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. TELEPHONE BOOTH – STREET – NIGHT

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty is in a phone booth, frantically tearing through the phone book. He finds the page he’s looking for.

</p><p><p ID="act">INSERT – PHONE BOOK

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty’s finger goes down a list of “Browns,” coming to rest at, “Brown, Emmett L., 788 W. Spruce. Madison 3489.” A BIC PEN circles the name and number.

</p><p><p ID="act">BACK TO SHOT

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty reaches into his pocket. He has a nickel and 3 pennies.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Dammit!

</p><p><p ID="act">He picks up the receiver and pumps the switchhook.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">OPERATOR (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Operator.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime---all I got is a nickel---but you gotta connect me---

</p><p><P ID="speaker">OPERATOR (V.O.)
<P ID="spkdir">(interrupting)
<P ID="dia">Sir, it only costs a nickel.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">What? 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">OPERATOR (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Local calls cost 5 cents. What number do you want?

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty sees the sign on the phone, “Local Calls 5¢.” 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Oh---right! Uh, Madison 3489.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">OPERATOR (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Five cents, please.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty deposits his nickel. The number rings several times.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">OPERATOR (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">I'm sorry, there's no answer.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Operator, what's today's date?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">OPERATOR (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">March 11.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">What year?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">OPERATOR (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Nineteen fifty---

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="spkdir">(interrupts)
<P ID="dia">Dammit! 

</p><p><p ID="act">He slams down the receiver, then tears the page out of the phone book and runs down the street with it.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET – MARTY – NIGHT

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty runs down this residential street, tired, breathless, exhausted. He leans against a mailbox to catch his breath, and then notices the number on it: 777. He turns and looks at the house.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">My house!

</p><p><p ID="act">Indeed, it is Marty’s house---or rather, it will be. The trees aren’t quite as tall as those we saw earlier, and the curtains are different; there’s a 1949 Chevy in the driveway. But it’s the same house.

</p><p><p ID="act">Then, the front door opens, and a WOMAN opens the screen to let out a dog. Unless we’re seeing things, it’s EILEEN, looking nearly identical to when we saw her last, save her different clothes and hair-do.

</p><p><p ID="act">MARTY

</p><p><p ID="act">is stunned!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Mom!!

</p><p><p ID="act">He runs toward the house!

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. HOUSE

</p><p><p ID="act">As Marty runs toward the house, the WOMAN closes the door. Marty runs up the steps and pounds on the door.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Mom!! Open up! It’s me!

</p><p><p ID="act">The door opens. Indeed, the woman appears to be Eileen. But she doesn’t recognize Marty.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Mom, thank God! Thank God you're here!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WOMAN
<P ID="dia">I beg your pardon, young man?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Mom! It's me! Marty! Don't you know your own son!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WOMAN
<P ID="dia">I think you have the wrong house.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty is very intense---sweating, breathing hard. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">No---no---it's not! It's not!

</p><p><p ID="act"> A MAN in his mid-40’s approaches the door. He’s smoking a pipe and seems like a decent sort. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MAN
<P ID="dia">Who's there, Stella?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Stella?!? No! Don't tell me you're Stella! Tell me you're Eileen!! Please tell me you're Eileen!

</p><p><p ID="act">Through the door, we can see a GIRL of 17 coming down the staircase. She’s very attractive. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GIRL
<P ID="dia">I'm Eileen.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty locks eyes with his Mother, aged 17!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">How old are you?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">EILEEN
<P ID="dia">Seventeen.

</p><p><p ID="act">What does one do when he meets his mother in such circumstances? Marty faints!

</p><p><p ID="act">A HAND

</p><p><p ID="act">holds smelling salts and brings them under Marty’s nose. Marty is lying on a couch; he stirs and opens his eyes.

</p><p><p ID="act">MARTY’S P.O.V. OF

</p><p><p ID="act">PROFESSOR BROWN as a young man! He’s well dressed, less eccentric in manner, and seems much more self confident than his older self. It is Brown who is administering the salts.

</p><p><p ID="act">WIDER ANGLE, INT. LIVING ROOM

</p><p><p ID="act">The room is the same as in Marty’s house, with different furniture (in the same basic arrangement) and a different color scheme.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Professor? Professor Brown?  

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BROWN
<P ID="dia">You know me?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Ssshhh! 

</p><p><p ID="act">Brown isn’t sure whether to believe him. Now the FAMILY approaches---MR. BAINES, his wife Stella and daughter Eileen.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. BAINES
<P ID="dia">Is he all right?

</p><p><p ID="act">The Professor straightened up.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BROWN
<P ID="dia">He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol...something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me. His name's Lewis.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="spkdir">(correcting him)
<P ID="dia">Marty.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BROWN
<P ID="dia">Uh, Marty Lewis. I almost didn't recognize him---haven't seen him in years.

</p><p><p ID="act">Young Eileen can’t take her eyes off Marty. Marty too is fascinated by her.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">STELLA
<P ID="dia">It's a good thing he had your name circled in the phone book. I would have called the police.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BROWN
<P ID="dia">Well, Mrs. Baines, Mr. Baines, thank you for your trouble. Both Marty and I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get him home and as good as new.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty and Brown get ready to leave.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. BAINES
<P ID="spkdir">(to Marty)
<P ID="dia">Son, you watch yourself.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Yes, sir.

</p><p><p ID="act">Eileen gives Marty his Porsche jacket which was lying on a nearby chair.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">EILEEN
<P ID="dia">Oh---here’s your jacket.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="spkdir">(nervous)
<P ID="dia">Uh, thanks...

</p><p><P ID="speaker">EILEEN
<P ID="dia">What sort of material is this? I've never seen anything like it.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="spkdir">(matter-of-factly)
<P ID="dia">It's polyester.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">EILEEN
<P ID="dia">Poly-what?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">It's an experimental invention of mine. Sort of a rubberized silver-foil. I just made up a name for it. Come on, Marty, we've got a lot to talk about.

</p><p><p ID="act">The Professor goes out the front door. Marty is behind him, and just as he steps into the doorway, Eileen speaks up. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">EILEEN
<P ID="dia">Marty?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Huh?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">EILEEN
<P ID="dia">Have we ever met before? 

</p><p><p ID="act">Their eyes meet, but before Marty can answer, the Professor’s arm reaches over and yanks him away!

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. VICTORIAN STYLE MANSION – NIGHT

</p><p><p ID="act">A fabulous Victorian Mansion sits on a hill on the outskirts of town. On the mailbox is the name “Brown, Emmett.”

</p><p><p ID="act">A beautiful 1937 PACKARD pulls up to the mansion.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">...and the flux capacitor is hooked into this thing that looks like a condenser with a lens on it... 

</p><p><p ID="act">Now Marty and the Professor get out of the car. Marty stares at the incredible house, very impressed.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Jeez---this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Oh, yeah, well, there's a mall here now---I mean, there will be.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">A mall?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?

</p><p><p ID="act">They are walking toward the front door. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">Ssshhhh---don't tell me these things, Marty. I don't want to know about the future.

</p><p><p ID="act">They enter the house.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. LIVING ROOM – MARTY, BROWN – NIGHT

</p><p><p ID="act">A light goes on in the large living room.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BROWN
<P ID="dia">Do you see it here?

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty looks around the room. The evidence of the Professor’s eccentricity is just beginning---mechanical apparatus laying haphazardly around on antique tables and furniture. There’s something built out of the shell of an old vacuum cleaner, and an old washing machine that might now be a still.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">No.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ANOTHER ROOM – THE STUDY

</p><p><p ID="act">Again a light goes on. Mostly, this is a library, but there are some models of some of the professor’s ideas here, including the Aero-mobile and the Mechanical Home Butler. Professor Brown looks at Marty.

</p><p><p ID="act">Again Marty shakes his head.

</p><p><p ID="act">Now Professor Brown unlocks a door at one end of the room and puts on a light. Marty approaches the doorway.

<P ID="dia">But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone <u>back</u> in time?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened----

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">No! Don't tell me! I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events...your mere presence here...could have devastating effects on the course of history. And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My immediate responsibility is to send you back to your own time.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY

<P ID="dia">What time does school start around here?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">EILEEN
<P ID="dia">9:00---oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Yeah. Maybe so.

</p><p><p ID="act">She smiles, then hurries off to school.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. HIGH SCHOOL – DAY

</p><p><p ID="act">It’s the same school we saw in 1982, but the trees are smaller and there is no grafitti or broken windows. Only a few students are loitering in front---school is in session.

</p><p><p ID="act">MARTY, dressed once again for 1952, goes up the front steps carrying a notebook. As he gets to the door, the BELL RINGS, indicating a passing period.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. SCHOOL HALL – MARTY, STUDENTS

</p><p><p ID="act">Students pour into the hall from the classrooms. Marty marvels at what his “contemporaries” look like.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty proceeds through the corridor and pauses at a classroom door. He decides to enter.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM

</p><p><p ID="act">It’s the same science classroom Marty was in earlier, only everything looks much newer, and the chalkboards are black instead of green.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty goes over to his old desk---of course, it’s now in excellent condition. He runs his hand across the desktop.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VOICE
<P ID="dia">You there! What are you doing in this class?

</p><p><p ID="act">The voice is familiar---Marty looks up: it’s Mr. ARKY, 30 years younger! Marty’s eyes nearly fall out of his head! Young Mr. Arky is energetic and dynamic, the kind of teacher who’s going to change the world.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Mr. Arky? Mr. Arky!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Uh---yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">You have a name?

</p><p><p ID="act">WIDER ANGLE – SCIENCE CLASS

</p><p><p ID="act">as Marty stares with amazement at the STUDENT next to him filling her pen.

</p><p><p ID="act">Mr. Arky is in the middle of his lecture.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia"> ...and it is, of course, due to Science that we Americans enjoy the highest standard of living in the history of the world. When we think of the technological advances made in just the past 30 years, it boggles the mind to imagine what the world will be like in another 30 years. 
</p><p><p ID="act">I think I can safely say that we can all look forward to a world of plenty, a world free of disease and starvation. There'll be entire cities built under the sea, cars that can go 2 or 300 miles an hour.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty can’t believe what he’s hearing. The rest of the class seems pretty bored.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY (CONT’D)
<P ID="dia">You girls will be able to cook an entire meal, clean the entire house, and do all of your laundry and ironing by push-button. You may even have a robot to assist you in all your duties as a wife.

</p><p><p ID="act">A WISE GUY calls out from the back.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">WISE GUY
<P ID="dia">I hope those robots won't be assisting in <u>all</u> my wife's duties! 

</p><p><p ID="act">There is laughter from the back of the class.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">Well, Biff, since you seem so eager to get into this discussion, perhaps you'd like to tell us what you think you'll be doing in 30 years?

</p><p><p ID="act">Yes, it’s young BIFF TANNEN sitting in the back of the class, looking just like what he is: the school’s biggest troublemaker. Sitting around him are his THREE CRONIES: GUMS, so named because he’s missing his two front teeth; MATCH, who is perpetually chewing on wooden matchsticks; and SKINHEAD, who has a crewcut just short of being bald.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty turns around and stares at Biff.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BIFF
<P ID="dia">I know what I <u>won’t</u> be doin’---goin’ to school!

</p><p><p ID="act">Biff’s boys break into hysterics.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GUMS
<P ID="dia">Hey, Biff, good one!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SKINHEAD
<P ID="dia">Ataway, Biff!

</p><p><p ID="act">Now Biff notices that Marty is staring at him. He takes an immediate dislike to Marty. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BIFF
<P ID="dia">What are you lookin' at, A-hole?

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty’s eyes meet Biff’s hateful glare; then Marty turns away.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">Anybody else have any ideas about what life might be like in 30 years?

</p><p><p ID="act">As usual, no one raises their hand.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">Mr. Cusimano? Miss Voyles? Miss Kaner? 
<P ID="spkdir">(pause)
<P ID="dia">So am I to understand that no one has anything at all to say about the future? 

</p><p><p ID="act">Arky looks directly at Marty.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">How about you, Mr. McFly?

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty reacts with shock---somehow he’s been found out! 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Oh, shit...!

</p><p><p ID="act">Several heads turn with shock at Marty’s expletive...including Biff’s.

</p><p><p ID="act">At the same time, the student sitting directly in front of Marty opens his mouth.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Well, I, uh...well...

</p><p><p ID="act">It’s young GEORGE McFLY! And he’s really a mess, too---nervous, hair poorly combed, just not with it.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty realizes who it is.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Jesus Christ! Dad!

</p><p><p ID="act">Mr. Arky tries to ignore it all.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">Continue, Mr. McFly.

</p><p><p ID="act">George stands. Marty reacts with embarrassment for himself and his future father.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Well, I---uh---could you repeat the question? 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BIFF
<P ID="dia">Sit down, McFly, you stupid moron! I can't see! 

</p><p><p ID="act">Biff hits him in the head with a spitball. George immediately sits down. Marty, pissed, turns on Biff.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Hey, lay off!

</p><p><p ID="act">Biff glares at Marty, eyes narrowing with complete hate.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">Did you say something, Mr. Lewis?

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty pays no attention. He keeps staring at Biff.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="spkdir">(louder)
<P ID="dia">Mr. Lewis, I'm talking to you.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="spkdir">(suddenly remembering his name)
<P ID="dia">Who, me?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going 2 or 300 miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">Run out of gas? 

</p><p><p ID="act">He reacts as if it’s the most ridiculous thing he’s ever heard. There is laughter from the class.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MR. ARKY
<P ID="dia">Well, class, it seems we have a doomsayer in our midst. I must say, Mr. Lewis, that's a mighty pessimistic attitude for a young man like yourself. 
</p><p><p ID="act">First of all, with all the studies we have indicating the vast supplies of petroleum in the earth, plus the massive reserves that have yet to be discovered, the likelihood of any such shortage is highly remote. And even if the most improbable, catastrophic circumstances were to occur and we did have a shortage of petroleum, I'm sure that American technology and ingenuity would overcome the problem in no time at all. All in all, I'd say your time would be better spent worrying about the real problems that face our world instead of a shortage of gasoline.

</p><p><p ID="act">Biff and his boys make FART NOISES. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BIFF
<P ID="dia">Hey, we got plenty of gas back here!

</p><p><p ID="act">The BELL RINGS.

</p><p><p ID="act">Students pour out of classes into the hall, including Mr. Arky’s science students.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty steps out into the hall, waits for George to come out and, keeping his distance, follows him.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. HALL INTERSECTION

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty follows George toward a hall intersection where EILEEN is passing by with her girl friend MADGE. Eileen sees George, but not Marty. She smiles at him.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">EILEEN
<P ID="dia">Hi, George.

</p><p><p ID="act">George looks at her and is so at a loss for words that he walks into another student.

</p><p><p ID="act">Eileen and Madge giggle and continue down the hall.

</p><p><p ID="act">AT A DRINKING FOUNTAIN

</p><p><p ID="act">George stops at a fountain, goes down for a drink and gets water sprayed in his face! Marty shakes his head.

</p><p><p ID="act">SCHOOL LOCKERS

</p><p><p ID="act">George dials the combination to his locker, opens it, and is hit by an avalanche of books!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty turns his head, not sure whether to laugh or cry.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA

</p><p><p ID="act">A LARGE POSTER advertises the “Springtime In Paris Dance” on Saturday, March 16.

</p><p><p ID="act">We PAN OVER to the cafeteria line where George is getting his lunch. Marty is right behind him in line and watches as the cafeteria ladies give George the burnt pork chop, the wilted salad, and the green stewed tomatoes.

</p><p><p ID="act">But George isn’t paying attention, because he’s talking to himself.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Eileen, if you're free Saturday night...no...Eileen, would you like to go to the dance...no...

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty hears this, then notices the poster. He perks up, very interested.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. LUNCHROOM

</p><p><p ID="act">George comes out of the cafeteria line and looks around the lunch room. Eileen, Madge, and some other girls are sitting at a table. George takes a deep breath and heads over that way. Marty follows a short distance behind.

</p><p><p ID="act">George is very nervous as he approaches Eileen---in fact, his tray is shaking because his hands are quivering.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Uh, Eileen?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">EILEEN
<P ID="dia">Hi, George.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Eileen, could I ask you something? Ooops---!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Uh, well, the thing is, that is, what I wanted to ask you...

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty draws closer to eavesdrop, but Eileen spots him.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">EILEEN
<P ID="dia">Marty! Hi, Marty! Over here!

</p><p><p ID="act">George whirls around to see who she’s talking to and spills his entire lunch all over himself!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Oh God! Excuse me, please!

</p><p><p ID="act">George starts to walk away, but Marty stops him.

<P ID="dia">Wait a minute---aren't you gonna ask her to the dance?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Huh? How did you know?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Go ahead, George. Ask her.

<P ID="dia">Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">No!!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">George! Wait! Get back here! You're not supposed to run off! It doesn't happen that way!

</p><p><p ID="act">But George is gone. Marty throws up his arms.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">You’d better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty shakes his head.

<P ID="dia">Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here! 

</p><p><p ID="act">George turns around and sees Biff and his gang standing there. George shudders.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">How much do you want, Biff?

</p><p><p ID="act">As Biff starts to walk toward George, Marty sticks out his leg and TRIPS HIM! Biff stumbles to the floor, careening into a chair. Everyone in the malt shop laughs at him. Biff, however, doesn’t think it’s very funny. He picks himself up and goes over to the stool where Marty is sitting with his back facing Biff.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BIFF
<P ID="dia">Listen, A-hole, it's about time I taught you a lesson. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Biff puts a hand on Marty, and with that, Marty whirls back around and slams his fist into Biff’s face!

</p><p><p ID="act">Biff goes reeling backward into a table! Match, Gum and Skinhead face Marty, ready for action!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty doesn’t like the odds---he bolts out of there!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty looks behind him---Biff and his boys are gaining!

</p><p><p ID="act">Then one of the kids on the scooters comes by. Thinking quickly, Marty yanks the scooter out from under him, kicks off the orange crate and creates a homemade SKATEBOARD! Marty hops on it and sails off down the sidewalk!

</p><p><p ID="act">Biff and the boys have never seen anything like it---nor has the kid whose scooter it was! Biff stares as Marty whips down the sidewalk.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BIFF

</p><p><p ID="act">Another car is now coming up from behind Marty. As it passes him, Marty grabs onto the back and hooks a ride!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BIFF

In one is a PAIR OF BOXING GLOVES, and a plaque – “McFly-Liston Fight,” “Madison Square Garden, 1966.” In the next, a silver boxing champion’s belt, engraved with “George M. McFly, World Middleweight Champion, 1963.” And in another, a framed magazine ad with a picture of George McFly holding a very strange device: “The Champ gives tooth decay the One-Two Punch with Son-o-Dent ultra-sonic tooth care system, by E. Brown Enterprises.”

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty is amazed. He cautiously enters his father’s study.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. STUDY

</p><p><p ID="act">George McFly looks up from his desk. He’s a much different George McFly than we saw before: in better shape, more extroverted, more self-assured. After all, he was the middleweight champion of the world!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Welcome home, son! The Professor told us what happened with the experiment---that there might be some side effects...lapses of memory.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty approaches to get a better look at the man who looks like the father he remembers, but isn’t.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Your mom's got one heckuva dinner planned tonight! She's been pushing buttons all day!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty notices a figure out in the yard, through the window. He has a closer look---it’s BIFF, in a Security Guard Uniform, sitting in a chair, sleeping. Now George has a look too and opens the window.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Hey, Biff! What are you doing, sleeping on the job? A security guard's supposed to be alert!

</p><p><p ID="act">A very humble BIFF replies. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BIFF
<P ID="dia">Yes, sir, Mr. McFly.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">What am I paying you 50¢ an hour for? 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BIFF
<P ID="dia">I'm sorry, Champ. It won't happen again, sir.

</p><p><p ID="act">Biff begins patrolling the yard.

</p><p><p ID="act">George resumes his own unfinished business. He attaches a suction cup to his forehead which is connected to a pen-like device by a wire, and waves the “pen” over a blank check---handwriting appears, accompanied by electronic beeps. It says, “Pay to the order of the Coca Cola Company.”

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="spkdir">(wide-eyed)
<P ID="dia">What are you doing, Dad? 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">What's it look like I'm doing son? I'm paying the fuel bill. It's over $2.00 this month---we really oughta try to cut down.

</p><p><p ID="act">George sees that Marty is still staring in amazement.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">What's wrong, son? You act like you've never seen a Write-O-Matic before.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty takes out his own Bic pen and examines it.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Say, what have you got there? An antique pen? Let me see that!
<P ID="spkdir">(takes it, examines it)
<P ID="dia">I haven't seen one of these in...well, this is strange. How do you fill it with ink?

</p><p><p ID="act">George suddenly looks at Marty strangely---does he remember this conversation happening 30 years ago?

</p><p><p ID="act">But then there is a knock on the door and Eileen enters.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">EILEEN
<P ID="dia">Marty, there's someone here to see you.

</p><p><p ID="act">Suzy Parker enters. Her hairstyle is a little unusual, as are her clothes, but she’s certainly the same girl. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Suzy!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SUZY
<P ID="dia">Hi, Marty!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">What did you do to your hair?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SUZY
<P ID="dia">What did you do to yours?

</p><p><p ID="act">They both laugh. Now Professor Brown joins the group. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Hey, how's my favorite girl?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SUZY
<P ID="dia">Fine, Mr. McFly.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Why don't you two get out of here---I'm sure you can find something better to do than watch me pay bills! 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SUZY
<P ID="dia">Marty, you'd better change your clothes. You can't go to Mambo Class looking like that.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Mambo class? You mean people still do the Mambo?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SUZY
<P ID="dia">Sure. Everybody does the Mambo!

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty thinks a moment.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Don't tell me you've never heard of Rock ‘n Roll...?

</p><p><p ID="act">Suzy now directed a blank look at him.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SUZY
<P ID="dia">Rock and what?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PROF. BROWN
<P ID="dia">I've never heard of it either.

</p><p><p ID="act">Marty grins widely.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MARTY
<P ID="dia">Well, maybe it's time you did!

</p><p><p ID="act">They all exit, leaving George sitting at his desk. George is thinking about something. He opens a desk drawer and pulls out a scrapbook...not an ordinary scrapbook...a HYDRAULIC SCRAPBOOK. It says so right on the cover, along with the name of the manufacturer: “E. Brown Enterprises.” George plugs it in, and pnuematic cylinders begin automatically turning the pages. At a particular page, it stops. George stares at the newspaper clipping on the page.

</p><p><p ID="act">INSERT – CLIPPING

</p><p><p ID="act">A story with the headline, “Police Quell Near Riot At School Dance,” along with a photo of the dance that shows Marty on stage!

</p><p><p ID="act">GEORGE

</p><p><p ID="act">stares at the photo, then shakes his head.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GEORGE
<P ID="dia">Nah. Couldn’t be.

</p><p><p ID="act">INSERT – PHOTO

</p><p><p ID="act">But it is....
