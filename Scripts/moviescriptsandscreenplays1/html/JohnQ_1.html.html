</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

</p><p><p ID="act">Mancini's "Ave Maria" fills the screen as a white BMW speeds along the road.

</p><p><p ID="act">CREDITS ROLL

</p><p><p ID="act">A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN is behind the wheel. We never see her face. Hanging from the mirror is a rosary with a crucifix. Her porcelain hand turns up the volume and the music swells. A silver bracelet dangles from her wrist.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

</p><p><p ID="act">A slow-moving semi obstructs her path. The woman leans out the window to see if the road is clear before moving into the oncoming lane. She steps on the gas. She's in the wrong lane and can't get over. There are headlights in the distance and the moan of an airhorn is heard.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

</p><p><p ID="act">Suddenly, the headlights are upon her. And airhorn blasts and she's trapped between two monstrous big rigs. She cuts the wheel hard, but too late. The oncoming truck clips her, sending her car end over end.

</p><p><p ID="act">SLO-MO

</p><p><p ID="act">The accident is violent and horrible. The BMW cartwheels along the highway in a grotesque ballet of destruction. The music crescendos and sparks fly as the car skids along the pavement on its roof. And as the BMW violently smashes headfirst into the embankment, the beautiful woman is slammed into the windshield like a crash-test dummy. 

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. MIDDLE AMERICAN TOWN - PRE-DAWN

</p><p><p ID="act">The indigo horizon shimmers with the first light of morning. Vapor spewing smokestacks dwarf brick and mortar homes. Dairy Queens, Hardee's, and Walmarts line the main drag. Stars and Stripes flutter from lampposts.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

</p><p><p ID="act">A man sits propped up against pillows, his sleeping wife snuggled next to him. His name is JOHN QUINCY ARCHIBALD. His strong, handsome face is beginning to show wear and tear. From across the room, last night's news broadcast drones on the TV. The President is telling everybody how wonderful the country is doing.

</p><p><p ID="act">JOHN Q. watches impassively, the irony not lost on him. Suddenly, he hears a noise. Something's not right. He jumps out of bed, wearing only a pair of BVDs.

<P ID="dia">Honey, what is it?

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - MORNING

</p><p><p ID="act">The screen door bangs open. John Q. bursts onto the porch to find a tow truck parked in front of his house. TWO TRUCKERS are winching a hook and cable to a ten year old Chevy.

<P ID="dia">Hey, what the hell are you doing?

</p><p><p ID="act">TOW TRUCK DRIVER #1
</p><p><p ID="act">Yeah? That's not what the bank says.

</p><p><p ID="act">The truckers quickly circle to the front and hop in. John Q. just watches as the truck speeds away, dragging the car along the cement.

</p><p><p ID="act">The neighbors now stand on their porches, staring. J.Q. turns to see his wife, DENISE, standing in the doorway. She's not a happy camper. 

</p><p><p ID="act">Their nine year old son, MIKE, appears at his mother's side, wiping the sleep from his eyes.

<P ID="dia">You thought.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">What did you want me to do? Have us put out on the street? I'm down to twenty hours a week a the plant. They shipped off half the damn jobs down to Mexico.

</p><p><p ID="act">Denise sets down two plates of hot food.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DENISE

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MIKE
<P ID="dia">Not wrestling, Dad. Body building. There's a big difference.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DENISE
<P ID="dia">Alright, alright. Get your books. You're going to be late.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAYNE
<P ID="dia">Please sit down.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER (CONT'D)
<P ID="dia">There are septal defects here, here, and here, which have induced a myopathy resulting pulmonary edema, and malignant ventricular ectopy. As you can see, Mike's heart is approximately three times normal size.

<P ID="dia">I'm sorry. I don't understand. Could you pout that in layman's terms?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">Of course. Basically, there's not enough blood being pumped by the heart, so it backs up in the lungs. Sort of like a sponge getting wet. Mike's heart is trying, but I'm afraid it's working too hard.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">So what's he need? An operation?

</p><p><p ID="act">Turner gathers himself, takes off his glasses.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">I'm afraid we're considerably beyond the point of corrective surgery, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. Your son's heart is useless. He is going to need a transplant.

</p><p><p ID="act">The room goes silent.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DENISE
<P ID="dia">He's nine.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAYNE
<P ID="dia">Wait a second. There are other options.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">What options?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAYNE
<P ID="dia">To do nothing. Medicate him. Keep him as comfortable as possible. You need to start thinking about quality of life now.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DENISE
<P ID="dia">I don't understand. We were just with him. He seemed fine.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">He's going to seem fine. But as his heart gets worse, he will become increasingly fatigued, need more and more sleep, until one day, he'll go to sleep and he won't wake up.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAYNE
<P ID="dia">I know it's difficult, but you must face the fact that your son may not have much time left. You might want to make it a happy time. Say goodbye.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DENISE
<P ID="dia">Oh my God.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAYNE
<P ID="dia">And transplantation is a high risk operation. You could lose your son on the table. You may not want to take that chance.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">What do you think, Dr. Turner?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">This isn't my decision.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">I know that. I'm asking for your opinion. Without surgery, how long does he have?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">Not long. Months. Weeks. Days.

</p><p><p ID="act">This is too much for Denise. She breaks into tears. John puts his arms around her, steadies her, gathers his thoughts.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">What would you do if it was your son?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAYNE
<P ID="dia">Mr. Archibald...

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">Not you. Him.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">I'd do the transplant. Absolutely.

</p><p><p ID="act">J.Q. looks at Denise, who nods.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">Okay. Let's do it.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">The first step is to get Mike's name on an organ recipient list. Once he does, his chances are very good. Your son's an extremely rare type so there's less demand. With B-positive blood, Mike could go to the top of the list right away.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAYNE
<P ID="dia">It's not that simple. There are other considerations before a prospective recipient is placed on the donor list, Mr. Archibald. The cost of transplant surgery is expensive. In most cases, prohibitively so.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">I've got major medical. Don't worry, I'm covered.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAYNE
<P ID="dia">Actually, we've already checked with your carrier. There's no provision in your policy for a procedure of this magnitude.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">There must be some kind of mistake. My son is covered. I've got full medical. He's covered.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAYNE
<P ID="dia">What about you, Mrs. Archibald? Do you have coverage?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DENISE
<P ID="dia">No. I've only been working at the market a short time. You need to be there two years before you get benefits.

</p><p><p ID="act">Payne flips through the Archibald family file.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAYNE
<P ID="dia">I see that you don't own your own home. No investments, stocks, bonds. And you have a little over one thousand in savings.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">Did you hear what I said? I'm telling you, I'm insured.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAYNE
<P ID="dia">That may very well be, but you'll have to check with your carrier on that. In the meantime, I'm afraid we're going to have to treat you as a cash account.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DENISE
<P ID="dia">How much does a transplant cost?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAYNE
<P ID="dia">Transplant surgery, doctor fees, post operative treatment and immunosuppressant drugs, you're looking at two-hundred and fifty-thousand dollars minimum.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">What are you saying? If I don't come up with a quarter million dollars you're not going to treat my son?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAYNE
<P ID="dia">We have treated him. We continue to treat him. Now I understand how upset you are, sir. But with other options available, we are not obligated to cover a procedure this costly. If you opt for replacement surgery, that's your choice. But the hospital maintains a very strict policy with respect to cash patients. We require a down payment before the patient's name can be placed on the receiver list.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DENISE
<P ID="dia">What kind of down payment?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAYNE
<P ID="dia">Yes, it takes money to provide health service. It's expensive for you and for us. My job is to keep this program alive. For everyone. Now, I'm sorry, but we need you to guarantee payment before we can place your son's name on the list.

<P ID="dia">Yeah, he was. About a week after he was born. But his doctor said that was normal. That it happens all the time.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">He might not have been tested thoroughly enough.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">Why not?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MAGUIRE
<P ID="dia">You got an HMO, right? There's your answer. HMO's pay their doctors not to test. Their way of keeping costs down. Let's say Mike needed additional testing, insurance says they won't cover them. The doctor keeps his mouth shut and no one's the wiser. Little Mike falls through the cracks, and come Christmas, the HMO sends the doc a big, fat bonus check. J.Q. looks at Turner.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">Is that true?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">Possible. Not likely, but possible.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">Then Mike's doctors could have known about his condition all along? And he could have been treated years ago?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">Who knows?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">LESTER
<P ID="dia">Nothing personal, Doc, but you all are a bunch of damn crooks.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MAGUIRE
<P ID="dia">You see,here's the problem. Over here, you've got your insurance companies who basically want you healthy or dead. That's how they make money. And over here, you've got your medical establishment, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, who don't want you healthy or dead. They want you sick. That's the way they make money.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">LESTER
<P ID="dia">It's all about getting paid, man.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MAGUIRE
<P ID="dia">And the individual is caught in the middle of this gigantic tug-of-war. It's a game. And the end result is, people don't get the treatment they deserve.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">LESTER
<P ID="dia">Because then no one gets paid.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JULIE
<P ID="dia">But what about that thing you guys take? That promise? What do they call it?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">STEVE
<P ID="dia">The Hippocratic oath.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">LESTER
<P ID="dia">More like the hipp-crit-cial Oath to me. How's that go, Doc? "I solemnly swear to take care of all sick folk, except those without major medical?"

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MAGUIRE
<P ID="dia">I'm telling you, it's not that far from the truth. The shit happens all the time. Paramedics bring in some accident victim gasping for his last breath. Big boys in accounting find out they can't pay, they send them packing.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JULIE
<P ID="dia">Hospitals can't turn people away.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">STEVE
<P ID="dia">Yeah. I thought there were laws about that.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MAGUIRE
<P ID="dia">There are laws. But there are also ways around the laws. All we have to do is stabilize them. After that, we're off the hook.

</p><p><p ID="act">Turner is getting hot.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">That's not how it works.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MAGUIRE
<P ID="dia">That's exactly how it works. Maybe not up there on the fifth floor, but down here, if you ain't got no money, you get a band-aid, a foot in the ass, and you're out the door.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MITCH
<P ID="dia">Is that how you paid for that Armani suit, Doc?

</p><p><p ID="act">Finally, Turner explodes.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">Shut up. Enough already. I've heard all the bitching and moaning I can stand. Sure, the system sucks. There's red tape and there's worse. There's tough luck. And if you're looking for kindness and compassion, they're in short supply these days. But some of us got into medicine to do something about it. I break my ass every day trying to make a difference, trying to plug the dam. I'm in it up to my elbows. I've seen people live who shouldn't, and the other way around. And when I say I do my best, I mean it. So don't tell me about doctors, because they're the last stop between you and six feet under. And if you all want to regard me as some blood sucking vampire, fine. I'm the bad guy. But who's holding the fucking gun?

<P ID="dia">There's too many unknowns. Matching a donor and receiver is extremely complicated. There's several critical tests that have to be taken.

<P ID="dia">Like what?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">Cross matches for blood type, chest cavity measurements. If both blood tissues aren't compatible, there's a very high likelihood of rejection.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">Come on, Doc. I know all about compatibility. We've been tested up the wazoo. Mike and I are both B-Positive. Our tissues are a match. And his heart is three times normal size which means mine will fit. You know damn well we're compatible.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">No, we don't. You're an adult. Mike is strong, but the amount of blood your heart pumps may be too much for Mike.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">I'll take that chance. It's better than letting him die.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER

</p><p><p ID="act">As J.Q. is pushed into the car, Grimes sees his real identity. It's Lester, dressed in J.Q.'s windbreaker, collar up, baseball cap pulled way down over his eyes. Grimes shakes his head. Top notch policework. Incredulous, he turns and takes the long walk to the hospital.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. OPERATING ROOM - PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY - NIGHT

</p><p><p ID="act">Dr. Turner and the team work with quiet precision as Mike lays on the operating table, his chest wide open. Behind the partition glass, J.Q. and Denise hold on to each other for support as they look on. A figure in a rumpled suit settles in next to them and watches. It's Grimes.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GRIMES
<P ID="dia">It's time, John.

</p><p><p ID="act">J.Q. turns, knows it's over.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">Can you give me a second, Frank? I just need to see this thing through.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GRIMES
<P ID="dia">Sure. Put these on for me, will you?

</p><p><p ID="act">Grimes hands J.Q. a pair of handcuffs. John puts them on and the three watch the surgery. The replacement heart is taken out of its container and placed into Mike's chest. But then, something suddenly is wrong. Mike's vital signs start giving out. The gauges dropping at once. It's bad.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MAGUIRE
<P ID="dia">I don't have a pulse.

</p><p><p ID="act">John and Denise look on, helpless. Dr. Turner barks out commands as the team scrambles to remedy the critical situation.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. KLEIN
<P ID="dia">He's going.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DR. TURNER
<P ID="dia">No! Come on, goddammit! I'm not losing this boy!

</p><p><p ID="act">Nut now the long familiar tone of the EKG is heard. FLATLINE.

</p><p><p ID="act">VIDEO IMAGES FILL THE SCREEN

</p><p><p ID="act">Various news related programming. "Crossfire," "Face The Nation," CNBC, COURT TV and "Larry King Live." Clips dissolve one into the other.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">NEWS REPORTER #5
<P ID="dia">Sure, to a point. Except when it's their life on the line, the Dutch, the English and everyone else go to their private doctors or come to America because we have the best technology. That is if they can afford it.

<P ID="dia">The long awaited verdict is expected today in the trial of John Quincy Archibald, where the jury has been deliberating...  

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. COURTROOM - DAY

</p><p><p ID="act">SUPERIMPOSE: THREE MONTHS LATER

</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE ON

</p><p><p ID="act">A gavel pounding down. The black-robed JUDGE silences the crowd. The courtroom is standing room only. Packed with cops, TV cameras, reporters, etc.

</p><p><p ID="act">We see Denise next to a grim-faced Jimmy and Gina Palumbo. As the jury flies into the jury box, the people take their seats. The bailiff hands the verdict card to the judge who reads it before addressing the FOREMAN.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JUDGE
<P ID="dia">Has the jury reached a verdict?

</p><p><p ID="act">The foreman stands, faces the judge.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JURY FORMAN
<P ID="dia">We have, Your Honor.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JUDGE
<P ID="dia">The defendant will please rise.

</p><p><p ID="act">AT THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE

</p><p><p ID="act">J.Q. Archibald gets up and faces the judge. His attorney, a P.D., by his side.

</p><p><p ID="act">Standing next to Denise, we REVEAL MIKE - he looks healthy and rosy-cheeked. He grabs his mother's hand with anticipation.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JUDGE (CONT'D)
<P ID="dia">The jury foreman will now read the verdict.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JURY FORMAN
<P ID="dia">As to count one, Assault with a deadly weapon, we find the defendant, John Quincy Archibald, not guilty.

</p><p><p ID="act">The courtroom explodes in cheers. In the crowd, we see familiar faces: Debby, Dr. Turner, and Dr. Klein. Behind them, Maguire.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JURY FORMAN (CONT'D)
<P ID="dia">On count two, Armed Criminal Action. Not guilty.

</p><p><p ID="act">The crowd again roars its approval. Steve and Miriam watch from the gallery, holding a baby girl. Even Rebecca Payne cracks a smile.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JURY FORMAN (CONT'D)
<P ID="dia">On the final count, False Imprisonment, we find the defendant, guilty. The crowd erupts in protest. The media rush out to file their stories.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DENISE
<P ID="dia">No!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JUDGE
<P ID="dia">Quiet! Sentencing will be one week from today.

</p><p><p ID="act">J.Q. stares straight ahead and takes a breath. After a moment, the public defender leads him over to the rail, where he is greeted by Jimmy, Gina, Denise and Mike.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PUBLIC DEFENDER
<P ID="dia">He's going to do some time. But there's not a judge in the country that will give him more than a year. And with time served, John will be home very soon.

</p><p><p ID="act">J.Q. leans over to talk to his son.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">You alright?

</p><p><p ID="act">Mike nods and stands there trying to hold back the tears.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q. (CONT'D)
<P ID="dia">It's okay, slugger. I'll be home soon. If you need anything, ask your mother. And Jimmy and Gina will be around.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MIKE
<P ID="dia">Don't worry. If anybody messes with us, I'll take care of it.

</p><p><p ID="act">J.Q. embraces his boy and moves over to Denise.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DENISE
<P ID="dia">A year, huh? I could have lost you forever. I guess I can live with that.

</p><p><p ID="act">A hand taps him on the shoulder. J.Q. looks up. Sees Grimes.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GRIMES
<P ID="dia">Time to go, John.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">DENISE
<P ID="dia">John? I'm proud of you.

</p><p><p ID="act">J.Q. smiles and Grimes starts to lead him away.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">JIMMY
<P ID="dia">Give 'em hell, Johnny. Don't worry about nothing.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MIKE
<P ID="dia">Bye, Dad.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">Not goodbye. Remember? See you later.

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. COURTROOM - MORNING

</p><p><p ID="act">An enormous crowd lines both sides of the granite steps. They cheer their support as J.Q. emerges. Grimes steers J.Q. out through the confusion as reporters stick their mics in J.Q.'s face. They ask ridiculous questions about justice, health care, and politics. J.Q., uncomfortable with all the attention, has no comment. He pushes past politely, head down, his attention joslted when he hears a familiar voice.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">VOICE IN CROWD
<P ID="dia">Hey, John. Good luck, man.

</p><p><p ID="act">J.Q. recognizes the voice, turns and sees LESTER. Both smile to each other as J.Q. is pushed further through when --

</p><p><P ID="speaker">REPORTER
<P ID="dia">John Q.? Do you feel like your country has let you down?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="spkdir">(quietly)
<P ID="dia">No. It's a wonderful country.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">REPORTER
<P ID="dia">I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. Could you repeat that?

</p><p><p ID="act">Grimes steps forward and speaks directly into the camera.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GRIMES
<P ID="dia">He said, "America is the greatest goddamn country in the world." Now excuse us, I have to take this man to jail.

</p><p><p ID="act">They push past the barricades and into the street. 

</p><p><P ID="speaker">MEDIA
<P ID="dia">John Q.! John Q.!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GRIMES
<P ID="dia">Look at all this. You're a celebrity, John.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">Yeah? Check with me in a couple of days.

</p><p><p ID="act">They move to the street and Grimes opens the car door. J.Q. climbs inside. He looks up to see the CROWD, in all its glory, cameras flashing, microphones pointed at J.Q.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q. (CONT'D)
<P ID="dia">This is ridiculous. I don't even know these people.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GRIMES
<P ID="dia">What can I tell you? You're their hero.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">J.Q.
<P ID="dia">I'm not hero, Frank. I'm just a regular guy.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GRIMES
<P ID="dia">Yeah, right.

</p><p><p ID="act">Grimes slams the door. The "cherry" light spins, the siren wops and the cop car rolls through the crowd of people.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS

</p><p><p ID="act">On the street, J.Q. sees Mike wave to him from the sidewalk, trying to get John's attention. Mike is saying something. J.Q. turns to look closer and finally he gets it: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

</p><p><p ID="act">Mike's lips say "Thank you."
