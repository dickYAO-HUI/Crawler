	FADE IN:

	EXT. HONG KONG -- NIGHT

	We're in a HELICOPTER POV flying over Hong Kong's dazzling skyline.

	SUPER - HONG KONG - JUNE 30, 1997

	FADE UP the sound of a RADIO NEWSCAST as we continue to fly over 
	luxury, high rise condos, gleaming corporate headquarters, and
	busy freeways.

				NEWS ANNOUNCER
			(British accent)
		...and now, in something less than 
		three hours, what was once known as 
		the Asian pearl of the British Empire 
		will revert forever to The People's 
		Republic of China... 

	Suddenly, we break out of the lights of the city and FLY LOW over the 
	dark harbor. The newscaster's voice blends with the WHUMP WHUMP of the 
	chopper.

	CUT TO:

	INT. A WAREHOUSE-NIGHT

	We're CLOSE on a huge gleaming DRAGON made of tin. The dragon seems to 
	float effortlessly across a concrete warehouse floor.

	PULL BACK until we see that it's riding on a fork lift toward a SHIP 
	docked at the warehouse.

	As the dragon moves, we see it pass PRICELESS CHINESE ART OBJECTS 
	including ceramics, glass paintings, and huge statues.

	CHINESE MEN move quickly as they load this precious cargo into the hold 
	of the ship.

	INT. THE HOLD-NIGHT

	The dragon is now descending right on top of us as it's lowered by A 
	CRANE. A Chinese man carrying an AUTOMATIC WEAPON looks up at the 
	dragon as he walks by. We hold on the dragon.

	Suddenly, A MAN'S FACE appears in the dragon's mouth. This is LEE, 
	dressed all in black. He dives head first out of the dragon and lands 
	silently on the deck.

	EXT.THE SHIP-NIGHT

	Another GUARD, cradling an M-16, walks around a railing and looks over 
	the side. Suddenly, A HAND reaches up and pulls him over the edge. He 
	disappears and a beat later we HEAR A SPLASH.

	ON ANOTHER GUARD

	He's coming up a LADDER, automatic weapon slung over his shoulder. He 
	HEARS something, turns on the ladder. Nothing. When he starts back up 
	WHACK! A foot kicks him off the ladder and the ship. SPLASH.

	ON TWO GUARDS

	Lee dispatches them with a FLURRY OF HANDS. SPLASH, SPLASH.

	ON THE BOSS

	A handsome Chinese man named SANG stands at the railing watching the 
	loading process. He SHOUTS in MANDARIN and people jump to his command. 
	Then something catches his eye.

	CLOSE ON

	The top of the warehouse. We see another man's FACE peer over the edge. 
	And then disappear again.

	ON THE WAREHOUSE

	Ten HONG KONG COPS, weapons at the ready, are spread out on the roof 
	watching the loading action.

	ON SANG

	He turns and sees A HELICOPTER in the distance bearing down on the 
	boat. Without showing any panic, Sang steps inside his ship office.

	He runs to his desk and grabs a REBREATHER MASK from a drawer. He looks 
	up suddenly and sees Lee standing in the doorway.

	Sang doesn't move a muscle as the two men stare at each other. Suddenly 
	AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE erupts everywhere as the raid beings.

	Sang dives for a Berretta taped under his desk. He grabs it and starts 
	firing. Lee rolls across the office dodging bullets.

	Sang runs out and down a flight of steps. Lee follows on his heels.

	EXT. THE SHIP-NIGHT

	A battle is in full progress as the Cops fire down on the bad guys. The 
	helicopter joins the fray. We see a machine gun spray the warehouse 
	from the chopper's open door.

	INT. THE BOAT-NIGHT

	Sang runs down another flight of steps, deeper in the bowels of the 
	ship. He stops for an instant and fits the REBREATHER MASK over his 
	face. Then he turns and fires four rounds at Lee who has to dive back 
	in another passageway.

	ON LEE

	He comes hurtling down the steps. He stops. We hear nothing except the 
	distant sound of GUNFIRE. Then faintly at first, we hear WATER 
	SLOSHING.

	Lee walks down a dark passageway and stops. He looks down at a round 
	HOLE in the deck, just big enough for a man. Dark harbor water SLOSHES 
	in the hole.

	EXT. DECK-NIGHT

	Lee runs up on deck as the battle is ending. Police arrest dozens of 
	bad guys. But Lee looks out at the water where one bad guy got away.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HAN'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

	We're in a LARGE ORIENTAL GARDEN for a black tie dinner. Tuxedos and 
	gowns.  An assortment of worldly players. HAN, a handsome charismatic 
	man is the focus of attention.  He and his wife CHI-YING are at one of 
	the tables.

	THOMAS GRIFFIN, 50, British, but warm and personable, has the floor.  
	He is at Han's table, holding up a glass of bubbly.

				GRIFFIN 
		-- because in my heart, I look upon it 
		as a tragedy. Yes, ladies and 
		gentlemen, a tragedy.
			(to Han)
		Forgive me, my friend. But I believe 
		Hong Kong cannot afford to lose men of 
		your character. It's understandable 
		that China has envisioned a new role 
		for you in the United States. But 
		those of us here in law enforcement, 
		can only look upon your leave-taking 
		with sadness. And speaking personally, 
		I will sorely miss your unbridled 
		support of British Hong Kong Police.   
	
		So, for all us Brits who ever carried 
		a shield in Hong Kong...
			(lifts his glass)
		We will miss you, but we wish you 
		nothing but happiness in America.

	The glasses clink.  Lee, now dressed in a tuxedo, suddenly appears at 
	Han's side. He whispers something in his ear. Han stands, glass in 
	hand.

				HAN
			(to Griffin)
		Tom, thank you. Very much.
			(to the group)
		I am pleased to be able to leave you 
		and Hong Kong with a gift tonight: 
		less than an hour ago, Detective Lee 
		and his special task force have once 
		and for all crushed the Juntao 
		Criminal Organization. 

	 Shock and then applause all around the table.

				HAN (cont'd)
		This is the kind of legacy I have 
		dreamed about: to leave this city 
		safer than I found it. To Hong 
		Kong...forever.

	Everyone drinks.

	ON LEE

	He's walking back up to the house when he senses someone behind him.  
	He turns and receives a fist to the stomach.

	SOON YOUNG, Han's daughter is pissed.

				SOON YOUNG 
		When were you going to tell me you 
		were not going with us?

				LEE 
		I still have work to do here.

				SOON YOUNG 
		I don't believe you.  My father was 
		explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is 
		how I found out.

				LEE 
		I was trying to find the right time.

				SOON YOUNG 
		After I left?

	And she throws another punch at him.  But he catches her hand.  And 
	holds it tightly, to keep from being hit again.

				LEE 
		I am going to miss you very much, Soon 
		Young. If I ever have a daughter, I 
		hope she is like you.

	 Soon Young yanks her hand away from him.  She glares at 
	 him for a moment, then --

				SOON YOUNG 
		I will not have friends in America.

				LEE 
		Soon Young, don't worry.  You will 
		have many friends very soon.  You will 
		see.  America is a very friendly 
		place.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. A DINER-NIGHT

	We're somewhere in DOWNEY, CALIFORNIA looking at a VINTAGE DINER with a 
	lot of glass windows all the way around it.

	We see two women seated in a booth, looking out at us.

	INT. THE DINER-NIGHT

	One woman is SHIRLEY JOHNSON, beautiful, poised, generally not nervous 
	like she is now. The other woman, LOIS, is in her early 20's, nasty 
	looking, dangerous, and strung out.

	Both women are looking out into the parking lot. After a beat, Johnson 
	gets up.

				JOHNSON
		I gotta pee.

	She walks away. Lois watches her closely.

	EXT. THE DINER PARKING LOT-NIGHT

	We're on JAMES CARTER mid twenties, dressed to impress. It doesn't 
	appear to be working, however, because he has a GUN to his head.

				MAN'S VOICE 
		You don't move, you understand?!  You 
		don't move!

				CARTER 
		Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What 
		you're seeing here?  This is not 
		movement. This is my "still".

	The man who is holding the gun is HENRY LAFONTAINE, thirty, shaved 
	head, expensive clothes.

	Lafontaine pushes Carter until he's leaning forward on a parked JAGUAR. 
	He starts patting Carter down.  With his feet spread apart, hands 
	spread on the trunk, Carter looks like a suspect who is being arrested.

	Lafontaine starts feeling around Carter's legs, moving higher up.

				CARTER 
		Hey, hey, you start touching me there, 
		I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, 
		mother... 

				LAFONTAINE
			(interrupting)
		Shut up!

				CARTER 
		You a cop or something?

				LAFONTAINE
		Or somethin'.

	Lafontaine backs off, pulling the gun away from Carter's head.

				LAFONTAINE
		Okay.

	 Carter straightens himself.

				CARTER 
		This is not a good way to start a 
		relationship, stickin' a gun to a 
		man's head, feelin' around his  
		personal equipment.  Make him think 
		you don't trust him. 

				LAFONTAINE
		I don't trust anybody.  Especially 
		first time deals.

				CARTER 
		I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure 
		you're not a cop.

				LAFONTAINE
		Nobody touches me.

				CARTER 
		Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my 
		hands on you.  That does nothin' for 
		me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no 
		ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know 
		you're not a cop?

	Lafontaine opens the trunk of the JAGUAR.

	Inside are MANY SMALL WRAPPED PACKAGES with U.S. ARMY stenciled on 
	them.

				LAFONTAINE
		Because cops don't have the U.S. 
		Government's finest...at my prices.

	 Carter looks at the merchandise.

				CARTER
		Ooooh. That's pretty.

	CUT TO:

	INT. DINER BATHROOM-NIGHT

	JOHNSON is sitting in a stall, headphones on, talking into a 
	transmitter.

				JOHNSON
		OK, Carter, gimme something here. 
		Start with the color of the packaging.

	ON CARTER

	He sticks a pinky in one ear and scratches.

	INSERT

	A TINY MICROPHONE is in Carter's ear.

				CARTER
		Yeah...beautiful. What would you call 
		that paper there? Kind of a...Robin 
		egg blue color?

	 ON JOHNSON

				JOHNSON
			(into the mike)
		Good. That's standard military 
		packaging for plastique. Get a look 
		under it.

	 ON CARTER

	 He leans over the packages and slits one open.

				CARTER
		You know something? Every time I see 
		this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a 
		double latte grande...
			(still looking)
		With two shots of non-fat milk.

				LAFONTAINE
		What are you talking about?

	 ON JOHNSON

				JOHNSON
			(into the mike)
		That's it. High intensity C-4. We got 
		his ass. 

	CLICK. Carter looks up at a cute little silver plated .38 that Lois is 
	pointing down on her from the next stall.

				LOIS
		Step out slowly. Or I'll blow your 
		hair style into the toilet. Where it 
		belongs. 

	 ON CARTER

	 He sees a wire coming out of one side of the package.

				CARTER
			(speaking loudly)
		What's this little green wire coming 
		out one side of the package?

				LAFONTAINE
		I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

	 Lafontaine pulls a remote DETONATOR out of his pocket.

				LAFONTAINE
		I get the money, you get the 
		detonator.
			(smiles)
		First date's are always scary.

	 Lafontaine shuts the trunk.  Hands the keys to Carter.

				HESS 
		You cross the street, leave the money 
		on the sidewalk.  I'll leave the 
		detonator on my side.  Then we trade 
		places.  Get the picture?

				LOIS VO
		Hey, honey...

	Lafontaine turns to see Johnson, who's wearing a sexy short skirt, 
	walking toward them with Lois bringing up the rear.

				LOIS 
		She talks to herself on the potty.

	Lois shoves Johnson ahead, revealing the GUN in one hand and Johnson's 
	TRANSMITTER in the other.

				LOIS (cont'd)
			(to Lafontaine )
		Let's kill her.
			(cocking the .38)
		I'll flip you for it.  

	Lafontaine turns to Carter, but Carter is already throwing a punch.  
	Connecting.  Lafontaine falls.

	The remote drops as Lois FIRES at Carter.

	The bullet ricochets off the car.  Lafontaine sees the remote, makes a 
	dive for it.  But another hand gets there first.

	Lois turns the gun on Johnson.

				CARTER 
		No!

	Carter is holding the detonator.  Stand-off.

	Carter grabs Lafontaine.  Pulls him up.  Lois grabs Johnson, pulls her 
	back by her hair, shoves the gun to her head.  She's going to shoot 
	anyway.

				LAFONTAINE 
		Lois, don't!

	Lois has the look of a child who hates to be told she can't do 
	something.  Johnson looks at Carter.  She offers the best I'm sorry she 
	can muster with her eyes.

				CARTER 
		Put the gun down.

				LOIS 
		After you're dead.  I promise.

	 Carter tightens his grip around Lafontaine's throat.

				CARTER 
		Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade.  
		You cross the street, leave her on the 
		sidewalk.  I will leave him on this 
		side.  Then we trade places.  You get 
		him, I get her.  Get the picture, 
		Lois?

				LAFONTAINE
			(to Lois)
		Do it!

	EXT. DOWNEY BLVD-- NIGHT

	Lois leads Johnson across the street.  Gun to her side. When she gets 
	to the sidewalk, she turns, looks back at Carter.  He's on the opposite 
	side, holding Lafontaine.

	Lois starts back across the street.  Dodging traffic. And Carter does 
	the same, detonator in hand.  Carter and Lois cross toward each other.  
	HORNS HONK.  But getting hit by a car is the least of their worries.

	They stare at each other as they cross traffic.  Lois wants to kill 
	Carter.  She's got that look.  Johnson and Lafontaine wait on opposite 
	sides.  Then as Carter and Lois are almost opposite each other --

				LAFONTAINE 
		Kill him!

	Lafontaine starts running.  Carter moves.

	Lois starts shooting.  Hitting cars, smashing windshields.  Cars careen 
	into each other.  Carter jumps over one, almost hit by another.

	Lois is in the middle of the street, firing at Carter.

	Another windshield hit.  Car swerving.  Carter falls, the detonator 
	skidding away.  Across the lane.

	Carter is in direct line of fire.  And she takes aim as a TRUCK RUNS 
	OVER THE DETONATOR.

	AN EXPLOSION roars in the parking lot. The Jaguar and SIX OTHER CARS go 
	up in a ball of fire. Lois is knocked into the street.

	The diner windows ALL BLOW OUT AT ONCE.

	Carter SEES Lafontaine running for a car stopped on the street.  
	Lafontaine pulls open the door, grabs the driver.  Then Lafontaine 
	looks up and SEES --

	Carter APPEARING THROUGH THE SMOKE.  Running toward him.

	Lafontaine drops the driver, swings at Carter, but Carter tackles  him, 
	slamming him into the car.  Lafontaine tries to throw a punch.  But 
	Carter spins him around and shoves him into the car window, head first.  
	Window shattering.

	Lafontaine is out.  Carter pulls him out of the car. Lafontaine slumps.  
	Carter kneels next to him, pulling out his identification.

				CARTER 
		Los Angeles Police.  You are under 
		arrest.  Anything you say may be used 
		to put your ass in jail, you piece of 
		shit.

	Carter sits down next to Lafontaine.  He's tired and hurting.

	Johnson runs up, gun in hand.

				JOHNSON 
		You okay?

	Johnson kneels down next to him.  Her short skirt hikes up her legs.  
	Carter looks at one of her thighs.

				CARTER 
		Not anymore.

				JOHNSON 
		Where'd you get it? 

	Carter looks at Johnson and points to his heart. She suddenly looks 
	pissed.

				JOHNSON (cont'd)
		Oh, give it up!

	CUT TO:

	INT. CHINESE CONSULATE RESIDENCE -- MORNING

	A large entrance to the Ambassador's Residence.  Han is waiting by the 
	door, briefcase in hand, as Soon Young sweeps down the grand stairway, 
	backpack over one shoulder, lunch bag in hand.  She stops at the bottom 
	of the stairs.

				SOON YOUNG 
		I forgot --
			(races back upstairs)
		-- something.

	Han starts to protest, but... what's the use?  He looks at his watch.  
	Then up at Chi-Ying as she comes down the stairs.

				HAN 
		Will somebody please tell our daughter 
		that I am the Ambassador?

	Chi-Ying just shrugs.  Nothing can be done about it.

	EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE RESIDENCE, LOS ANGELES -- DAY

	ESTABLISHING.  FLAG of PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA hanging from a 
	standard.  A MERCEDES waiting in front.  DRIVER and BODY GUARD with the 
	car.

	Han and Soon Young finally appear.  Heading for the car. Soon Young 
	gets into the back seat.  And just as Han is about to get in next to 
	her, Chi-Ying comes out after him.

				CHI-YING 
		Telephone.  China.

	The Ambassador holds up his hands in exasperation. What's a guy to do?  
	He turns to the driver.

				HAN 
		Drop her off, then come back.
			(to Body Guard)
		Go with them.
			(to Soon Young)
		I love you.

	Han kisses Soon Young on the cheek, then gets out of the car and rushes 
	back into the house.  Chi-Ying waves to Soon Young as the car pulls out 
	of the driveway.

	INT. CHINESE CONSULATE RESIDENCE -- MORNING

	Han puts down his briefcase, picks up the phone.

				HAN 
			(into phone; in Chinese)
		This is Han... 
			(in English)
		Hello? Hello?

	Nothing. Han replaces the phone with a troubled expression.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. STREETS OF BEVERLY HILLS -- MORNING

	The MERCEDES makes its way down tree-lined streets. Houses, cars, very 
	few people -- this is a very affluent neighborhood.

	It turns onto a bridge leading down into the Beverly Hills FLATS.  A 
	WELCOME TO THE CITY OF BEVERLY HILLS sign flashes past.

	INT. MERCEDES/REAR SEAT -- CONTINUOUS

	Soon Young leans forward and inserts a CD into the deck. As the music 
	comes on she flips the dial to maximum -- total chaos.  The sounds of 
	R&B/HIP HOP fill the car.

	FRONT SEAT

	The Bodyguard and driver look at one another -- what is that racket?  
	The bodyguard turns around and reaches through the partition lowering 
	the volume.

	Soon Young turns the music back up.  The bodyguard reaches through and 
	turns it down again.

	She leans forward, pushing the bodyguard away and turns the music back 
	up.  A staring contest.  She slams the privacy glass shut in his face.  
	The bodyguard shakes his head turns back around.

	EXT. BEVERLY HILLS FLATS -- CONTINUOUS

	The Mercedes turns onto Wilshire Boulevard where cars are backed up at 
	least two blocks.  Farther ahead, a PIGGY BACK OIL TRUCK has jack 
	knifed and turned over, blocking traffic in both directions. Cops mill 
	around trying to create order out of chaos.

	INT. MERCEDES/FRONT SEAT -- CONTINUOUS

	The driver checks the rearview:  Too late, more cars stacking behind 
	him.  Up ahead an ASIAN traffic cop diverts cars onto Dayton Way.  The 
	driver nudges the bodyguard, points at the wreck.

				DRIVER
			(in Mandarin)
		LA drivers.

	The car inches onto Dayton Way.

	A SECOND TRAFFIC COP directs them onto Rodeo.  As the Mercedes pulls 
	alongside him, the bodyguard notices he's Asian too.

	EXT. RODEO DRIVE -- CONTINUOUS

	A DELIVERY VAN waits as the Mercedes stops at the corner. The passenger 
	door opens and an Asian MAN slides out, traffic cop uniform, white 
	gloves, glasses, hat pulled low.

	INT. REAR SEAT -- CONTINUOUS

	Soon Young barely pays attention as she watches the cop knock on the 
	bodyguard's window.

	EXT. MERCEDES -- CONTINUOUS

	The bodyguard cautiously lowers the glass.

				BODYGUARD
		Yes, officer?

	The Cop leans in as if to speak,

	BOOM!

	Blows him away.  The bodyguard slumps forward.  BOOM! The driver gets 
	it. We see now the cop is SANG.

	IN THE REAR

	Soon Young is shocked but she thinks fast, scoots across the seat as 
	Sang jerks the door open.  She flies out the other door, he manages to 
	get a handful of backpack, she quickly wriggles free, slams the door 
	shut behind her and starts running.

	EXT. MERCEDES/STREET

	She turns around, sees Sang making his way OVER the car. She runs 
	through traffic towards a shopping structure, 2 Rodeo Dr.

	Sang curses when he sees he can't reach her and heads back to the van.

	EXT. STREET/2 RODEO DRIVE -- CONTINUOUS

	Soon Young runs around the corner breathing hard.  She hugs the edge of 
	the building.  Peeks back around.  Sees a van making a sharp U-turn, 
	headed her way.  She starts across the cobblestones.  BEHIND HER, a 
	MOTORCYCLE pulls out.  She's in the middle of the street.

	VAROOM!

	The biker scoops her up under his left arm, pulls onto Rodeo.

	THE DELIVERY VAN

	Screeches up.

	ON SANG

	He jumps out and opens the back of the van. Soon Young takes a SWING AT 
	HIM. Sang grabs her arm easily and then viciously PUNCHES HER, sending 
	her flying back into the van.

	Sang slams the doors.  Trots to the front.  They pull out.

	LITTLE SANTA MONICA --

	the van and motorcycle head off in separate directions.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE COMPOUND -- DAY

	UNMARKED CARS roar down the road, racing up to the residence. TWO CARS 
	stay on the street outside.

	SEVERAL MEN IN SUITS get out, head for the residence. Some lugging 
	equipment.  In the lead is AGENT IN CHARGE, WARREN RUSS.  The door 
	opens, they enter.

	INT. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - DAY

	Ambassador Han greets them.  He has obviously been through great 
	strain, but maintains his composure.

				RUSS 
		Ambassador, I'm Warren Russ, FBI Agent 
		in Charge.  This is Agent Whitney.

	DAN WHITNEY, thirty-eight, ex-football type, solid American, shakes 
	hands with the Ambassador.

				RUSS (cont'd)
		I know this is a difficult time but...

				HAN 
			(interrupting)
		You can set up in my office.

	INT. OFFICE -- DAY

	Office off the main entrance.  Elegantly furnished. Chinese Flag.  
	Political photographs.  The FBI is already setting up equipment.  
	Tapping phone lines.

	Han watches them for a moment as his personal life is pushed aside and 
	the Feds take over.  Then he approaches Russ.

				HAN 
		I would like one of my people to help.

				RUSS 
		Ambassador, let me assure you that the 
		FBI has made this a top priority. We 
		have plenty of manpower on the case.

				HAN 
		He is very good.

				RUSS 
		As I said, sir, we've got all the 
		people we need.

	 Russ turns away.

				HAN 
		I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My 
		daughter is not an American.

				RUSS
		I understand, sir. But you are an 
		honored guest of the United States...

				HAN 
			(interrupting)
		He is already on the plane.  I hope 
		you will treat him with the same 
		respect you have shown me.

	Russ stares at Han, not sure how to handle this situation.  Mr. Han 
	bows and exits.  Leaving Russ at a loss.  Whitney comes up behind him.

				WHITNEY 
		What was that all about?

				RUSS 
		He wants his own man.

				WHITNEY
		What?!

	CUT TO:

	EXT. LAPD-DAY

	The entrance is UNDERGROUND and very busy. Carter and Johnson pull up 
	in the sedan.

	INT. DETECTIVE DIVISION ROOM - L.A.P.D. -- DAY

	Overloaded DETECTIVES at desks.  Trying to solve too many crimes in a 
	city with too many bad people.  Din of PHONES, KEYBOARDS, VOICES.

	A pissed off Johnson enters in front of Carter.

				CARTER
		You're killin' me here.

				JOHNSON 
		Carter, just because you saved my 
		butt, doesn't mean it's yours.

				CARTER 
		Oh, baby, you cruel...

	Johnson enters a small office right across from Carter's desk where he 
	now plops down.

	TWO DETECTIVES walk up.

				FIRST DETECTIVE 
		Heard about what happened over there 
		at the diner.  Nice work.

				SECOND DETECTIVE 
			(laughing)
		Not everybody gets to blow up a city 
		block.

				FIRST DETECTIVE 
		Don't worry about it.  Nobody liked 
		the food there anyway.

				SECOND DETECTIVE 
		Probably give you a medal.  For urban 
		renewal.

	 Both Detectives slap hands and laugh.

				CARTER 
		That's good. What did you two do? Work 
		that up in the men's room while you 
		were playing with each other?

	The cops stop laughing. They walk away when Carter's phone rings.

				CARTER
		 Carter... Yeah... uh-huh...now?  Okay.

	 He hangs up and looks at Johnson in her office.

				CARTER (cont'd)
		Captain wants to see me.

				JOHNSON 
			(melting)
		Last night's as much my fault as 
		yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on 
		anybody --

				CARTER 
		Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is 
		why I get the big bucks.

	Carter gets up and crosses toward the CAPTAIN'S OFFICE in the corner of 
	the room.  A brave man facing the Lion's den.  Even Johnson can't help 
	but admire his courage.

	INT. CAPT. DIEL'S OFFICE -- DAY

	WILLIAM DIEL is behind his desk.  Diel is fifty, professional, doesn't 
	smile a lot.  He's not smiling now. Carter enters.

				DIEL 
		I don't know what went wrong last 
		night, but this department could've 
		lost one detective and our only 
		explosives expert.

				CARTER 
		Sir, I can explain.

				DIEL 
		What you did was dangerous and 
		completely outside policy.

				CARTER 
		I know, but --

				DIEL 
		That's probably the only reason 
		Johnson's still alive.

	 This takes Carter a little by surprise.

				DIEL 
		Good job.

				CARTER 
		Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to 
		preserve Johnson's ass. 
			(pause)
		Well...you know what I mean. 

				DIEL 
		I got a call from the F.B.I.  The 
		daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has 
		been kidnapped and they asked for 
		help. You're it.

	 Carter straightens his posture a bit.

				CARTER 
		Feds asked for me?

				DIEL 
		They asked for the best street man I 
		had.

	 Carter tries to be humble, but... damn, that's hard.

				CARTER 
		And that, of course, would be me.

				DIEL 
		Don't push it. You better watch your 
		ass with these Fed types. If there's a 
		screw-up, they won't think twice about 
		burnin' it.

	INT. DETECTIVE DIVISION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

	Carter exits Diel's office, crosses back through the desks to his own.  
	A lot of eyes on him.

	Johnson comes out of her office.

				JOHNSON 
		What happened?

	 Carter just packs up his stuff.

				JOHNSON 
		Did he fire you?  He can't fire you!

	 Carter puts a hand on her shoulder.

				CARTER 
		Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just 
		reassigned me to the Feds.  

				JOHNSON 
		The Feds?!

				CARTER 
		FBI needs a taste of the street. 
		And I'm it.

	 Carter returns to packing up his stuff.

				CARTER 
		Way he put it, I was the only one he 
		thought could handle it. But you know 
		what the worst thing is? 

				JOHNSON
			(caught up in it)
		No...what?

				CARTER
		I could get promoted right out of 
		here.

				JOHNSON
		What's wrong with that?

				CARTER
		I wouldn't be close to you. 
			(sniffing)
		What is that perfume, girl?

	 Johnson comes back to reality.

				JOHNSON 
		No matter how many times you go 
		undercover, you still come out an 
		asshole. 

	CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET -- DAY

	Unmarked car pulls up in front of the Chinese Consulate. Carter sticks 
	his badge out the window to FBI Agents. Carter is wearing shades.  
	Playing it cool.

				CARTER 
		Detective James Carter.  L.A.P.Deee.

	One of the Agents relays the information via his radio. Then they open 
	the gates.  Carter drives in.

	INT. CHINESE CONSULATE RESIDENCE -- DAY

	Carter enters.  The place is under FBI control.  But everything's gonna 
	be okay now.  Carter's here.  Carter is the only one not in a dark 
	suit.

	Interviews of all staff being conducted in one room - we get a glimpse 
	as a door opens and an AGENT with an EAR PLUG exits.  Carter gives the 
	Agent a knowing nod.

				CARTER 
			(re: ear plug)
		Oh yeah, gotta get me one a those.

	Sees ANOTHER FBI AGENT with a high-powered rifle move past.

				CARTER
		 Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.

				WHITNEY 
		Carter.

	Carter sees Whitney motioning him into the office.

	INT. HAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

	Carter enters.  Lots of activity.  All electronic equipment is up and 
	running.  AGENTS are testing the PHONE TAPE.

	Russ is on the phone as Carter walks up.

				RUSS 
			(into phone)
		...yes, sir, I understand. I'll do my 
		best...but there is a question of 
		authority, sir... yes, sir, okay.

	Russ hangs up.  Turns to Carter.  Carter nods.  Confident that Russ 
	knows he's the man for the job.

				RUSS 
		Carter.  I'm Russ.  Agent in charge.

	Carter eyes him.  The suit, the hair, the shine on the shoes.  Russ 
	holds out his hand.  They shake.

				CARTER 
		Any demands yet?

				RUSS 
		At this point we don't have much.  

				CARTER 
		How much they want?

				RUSS 
			(ignoring him)
		You come highly recommended, Carter.  
		And your particular assignment 
		requires a special talent.

				CARTER 
		Interrogation is one a my specialties, 
		but undercover work is my forte.

	Everything about Carter changes; posture, language, attitude, as he 
	morphs into a gang drug supplier.

				CARTER 
		Yo, bro, y'cruisin' fo da go-dee on da 
		hi, u be comin' to da ri-man, say 
		what.  [or something to this effect]

	Russ stares at Carter for a moment.  Carter quickly changes back to 
	himself.

				CARTER 
		Never knew I was a man in blue.

	 EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE RESIDENCE -- DAY

	 Russ and Carter exit.

				RUSS 
		... the director considers this top 
		priority, considering he is a Chinese 
		National and here under difficult 
		circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And 
		he is to be shown every courtesy. 
		Within reason.

				CARTER 
		Sir, he's just gonna get in my way.  
		If I'm gonna handle this situation...

				RUSS 
			(interrupting)
		He is the situation.

	 Carter stops walking.

				CARTER 
		I'm talking about the girl.

				RUSS 
		Don't worry about the kidnapping, 
		Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that.  
		Your assignment is Lee.

	 Carter hesitates a moment, trying to sort this thing out.  

				CARTER
		What kind of assignment is that?

				RUSS
		Bottom line: I don't want some Chung 
		King Cop getting his head blown off 
		and turning this operation into a 
		international incident. 

				CARTER 
			(getting hot)
		Why don't you assign one of your own 
		men to this?

				RUSS 
		Because with your special talents, I'm 
		sure you'll do a better job. 

				CARTER
		What the hell am I supposed to do with 
		him? Take him to the zoo?

				RUSS
		Just make him think you're following 
		leads.  Interview some suspects, look 
		at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I 
		don't care.  I just don't want to see 
		him- or you, for that matter- until 
		this is resolved.
			(hands Carter a file)
		Now, we want to make a good 
		impression, don't we?  His plane lands 
		in an hour. Don't be late. 

	End of conversation.  Russ returns to the house.  Carter sizzles.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- DAY

	Carter's unmarked car pulls into one of the POLICE ZONES.

	INT. CARTERS UNMARKED CAR - PARKED -- CONTINUOUS

	Carter looks at his watch.  His mobile phone rings.

				CARTER 
		Yeah.

	 INTERCUT WITH JOHNSON 

	 She's at her desk.

				JOHNSON 
		So how'd it go?

	 Carter perks up when he hears Johnson's voice.

				CARTER 
		How'd what go?

				JOHNSON 
		With the FBI. What do you think I'm 
		talking about?

	 Carter puts on some exuberance.

				CARTER 
		Oh, you're not gonna believe what they 
		put me in charge of.  They sent for 
		the Ambassador's personal Chinese 
		Investigator type.  He is like the 
		baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, 
		let me repeat that, I am the man who 
		is on the case with him.  Just the two 
		of us, alone, workin' the whole deal 
		as a team.

				JOHNSON 
		They put you in charge?

				CARTER 
		In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No 
		interference.  They don't even want to 
		hear from us until we're done.  I love 
		the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.

				JOHNSON 
		Well...listen, if you need any help, 
		you know, back up, call me, OK? 

				CARTER
		Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. 
		You can count on it.

				JOHNSON
		OK. Well...make us proud.  And be 
		careful.

	That takes a little of the wind out of Carter's sails. We can see it in 
	his face, but he tries his best not to let her hear it over the phone.

				CARTER 
		Yeah, thanks.

	 He hangs up and mutters to himself.

				CARTER (cont'd)
		Yeah, gotta be careful.  Might get run 
		over by a Sky Cap.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. LAX -- AFTERNOON

	The CHINESE AIRLINES JET lands.

	INT. LAX TERMINAL -- AFTERNOON

	Carter is waiting at the GATE, the only one who could bypass Customs.  
	He's watching a parade of ASIAN PASSENGERS deplane, heading for 
	Customs.

				CARTER 
		Mr. Lee.  Is there a Mr. Lee on the 
		plane?
			(no response)
		Does anybody know Mr. Lee?
			(no response)
		Mr. Lee from China.

	Carter is losing his patience.  Passengers continue to deplane.  But 
	their ranks are thinning.

				CARTER 
		Mr. Lee.

	Finally the last of the last.  An ELDERLY ASIAN MAN AND WOMAN.

				CARTER 
		Mr. and Mrs. Lee?

	 They look at him, smile, but continue past.

				CARTER 
		I don't believe this!  First I get 
		stuck with this --

	LEE moves down the ramp and stops as he HEARS CARTER'S VOICE --

				CARTER'S VOICE 
		-- lame ass assignment, now the 
		sonuvabitch doesn't even show up.  
		This is bullshit!  Ain't my fault if 
		this limpdick can't make his plane.

	Carter is about to leave when Lee exits the ramp. Looking at Carter.  
	And Carter looks at him.

				CARTER 
		Mr. Lee?

	 Lee smiles and bows politely.

				CARTER 
		You got bags?

	No response from Lee. Carter assumes he can't speak English.

				CARTER (cont'd)
		Oh shit, you gotta be kiddin'.

	 Carter holds out his FBI IDENTIFICATION.

				CARTER 
		You speaky Eng-lish?

	 Lee looks at Carter for a moment, then smiles and nods.

				CARTER 
		Yeah, right, sure, uh-huh.

	CUT TO:

	INT. CAR -- AFTERNOON

	Unmarked FBI sedan.  Carter drives.  Lee is looking out the window.  
	This is his first time to America.  And despite the reason, he can't 
	help but look.

				CARTER 
		First thing I gotta do is check you 
		in.  So we have to go to L.A.P.D. H.Q.
			(checking Lee )
		You understand what I'm saying?

	 A beat, then Lee says:

				LEE
			(slowly)
		You talk very fast.

				CARTER 
		Okay, I'll slow down.
			(just as fast)
		So we go downtown and we ask you a few 
		questions... you know, like what's 
		your name?  How old are you?  You ever 
		expose yourself in public...shit like 
		that.

	Carter waits to see if he's getting through.  Lee just nods.  Carter is 
	convinced he's just talking to himself.

				CARTER 
		Yeah, good, we also will ask if you 
		have ever worn pink frilly 
		underwear...and what the hell is the 
		attraction of Karaoke to Asian 
		Peoples?

	Lee nods as if he understands everything.  Carter sighs. It's gonna be 
	a long assignment.  Lee points to the RADIO.

				CARTER 
		You want the radio?  RAY-DEE-OHHH.

	 Lee nods.

				CARTER 
		Why not? Beats talking shit to myself.

	Lee smiles, nods.  Carter turns on the radio.  A BEACH BOYS SONG comes 
	on.

				CARTER 
		Oh no...

	 Carter reaches for the radio, but Lee holds out his hand.

				LEE 
		Beach Boy.

				CARTER 
		You're shittin' me.  You know the 
		Beach Boys?!

				LEE 
		Beach Boy America.
			(starts singing)
		Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of 
		my --

	 Carter listens to Lee sing along for a moment, then --

				CARTER
		Beach Boy America my ass.  You don't 
		look like a Beach Boy, you don't sound 
		like a Beach Boy.  And your singin' 
		ability is only gonna make me do 
		something that I could get the death 
		penalty for.  You want America, here's 
		America.

	Carter changes the station.  RAP MUSIC.  Carter drums along with the 
	bass line.  Moving his body to the beat, to make sure he shows the 
	effect of the rhythm.

				CARTER 
		Tell me you can do this to the Beach 
		Boys.

	Lee listens, trying hard to get it. He doesn't. He pushes the other 
	button back to HELP ME RHONDA.

				LEE 
			(smiles)
		Help me Rhonda.

				CARTER 
			(incensed)
		Let me give you a piece of advice: 
		never touch another man's radio. You 
		do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not 
		Yolanda, gonna save your ass.

	 Carter pushes the button back to Rap.

				CARTER 
		That is America, got it?  That is 
		America.

	CUT TO:

	INT. CHINESE CONSULATE - HAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

	Han is reviewing PHOTOGRAPHS with Whitney and Russ.

	The PHONE RINGS.  Attention turns to the desk.  Russ stands.

				RUSS 
		This could be it.
			(to Han)
		Remember: try and keep him on the 
		phone as long as you can.  Ask to 
		speak with your daughter.  Ask how she 
		is... anything.

	They cross to the desk.  Han hesitates.  Nervous.  FOURTH RING.  He 
	picks up the phone.

				HAN 
		Hello.

				MAN'S VOICE 
		Han?

				HAN 
		Yes.

				MAN'S VOICE 
		It's Griffin.

				HAN 
		Griffin?  Where are you.

	Han turns to Russ.  Russ mouths ³Do you know him?² Han nods.

				GRIFFIN 
		Still in Hong Kong. But I'm afraid 
		this is not a social call.  I have 
		just learned some disturbing 
		information.  There is going to be an 
		attempt to kidnap you or a member of 
		your family.  I don't know when.  And 
		I'm not sure by whom.  But I trust my 
		sources.  You should contact the 
		F.B.I. immediately.  They'll know what 
		to do.

				HAN 
		I am afraid your source was very good. 
		They have Soon-Young.

				GRIFFIN 
		Oh God, no. I'm so sorry, my friend.

	 Russ picks up the phone.

				RUSS 
		This is Special Agent Russ, Federal 
		Bureau of Investigation.  Would you 
		please identify yourself?

	INT. HONG KONG APARTMENT - BEDROOM -- NIGHT

	Overlooking downtown Hong Kong.  Griffin is next to the window, phone 
	in hand, looking out at the lights of the city.

				GRIFFIN 
		Yes, of course.  My name is Thomas Ian 
		Griffin, former commander of British 
		Hong Kong police.  The Ambassador and 
		I are old and close friends.  He will 
		confirm this.  But the information I 
		have just relayed to you is sensitive.  
		I'm sure you understand that I cannot 
		provide details over a telephone.  But 
		in lieu of Soon Young's...situation, 
		I'll be on the next flight to Los 
		Angeles.

	CUT TO:

	INT. L.A.P.D. BUILDING -- AFTERNOON

	Carter leads Lee toward the FRONT DESK.  Holds up ID and motions to 
	Lee.

				CARTER 
		He's with me.

	Lee looks at the OFFICER, offering a short bow and a polite smile.  The 
	Officer isn't used to such polite behavior.  Can't help a smile back.

	Carter sees the exchange.  Makes him wanna puke.  He leads Lee to the 
	ELEVATOR.  They get in.

	INT. ELEVATOR -- AFTERNOON

	Carter and Lee enter.  Doors close.  They're alone.

				CARTER 
		You carry a gun?

	Lee looks at Carter as if questioning.  Carter has no patience.

				CARTER 
		A gun, a gun!

	Carter reaches for his weapon, but suddenly Lee's hands move with 
	lightening speed - and Carter is suddenly staring at HIS OWN GUN IN 
	LEE'S HANDS.

				CARTER 
		What're you doing?!  I wasn't gonna 
		shoot you!  I was trying to explain -- 
		ah shit, give me the god damn gun.

	Lee hesitates, then smiles and gives the gun back. Carter fumes.  Holds 
	up his gun.

				CARTER 
		You have one of these?

				LEE 
		No.

				CARTER 
			(holstering the gun)
		Yeah, well you're in American now.  
		Everybody's got guns.  That tricky 
		shit with your hands is gonna get your 
		ass shot to hell.

	Lee smiles.  Carter turns away.  They ride in silence. Suddenly Carter 
	goes for his gun again.

	And Lee's hands fly into action.  And once again -- Carter is staring 
	at HIS OWN GUN IN LEE'S HANDS.  Now Carter is really pissed.  But Lee 
	smiles and hands the gun back.

	Carter forces a smile.  Takes the gun.

				CARTER 
		You try that shit on me one more time, 
		I'll kick your ass.  You understand 
		that?  You know what kick your ass 
		means?

	 Lee smiles, nods.

				CARTER 
		I'll bet you do.

	The ELEVATOR STOPS.  Doors open.  Carter motions politely for Lee to 
	exit first and which direction to go.

	INT. HALLWAY -- AFTERNOON

	Lee exits.  Carter comes out behind him.  Takes a couple of steps.  
	Passing OTHER DETECTIVES getting onto the elevators.  Carter follows 
	Lee, a step behind.  Then he goes for his gun again.

	Lee, as if he has eyes in the back of his head, spins, kicks.

	And Carter is on his back, staring at the ceiling. Looking at his gun 
	in Lee's hands.  Lee holds out his hand to help Carter up.  Suddenly we 
	HEAR --

				MAN'S VOICE 
		Put the gun down now!

	Carter and Lee turn.  A DETECTIVE has his gun leveled at Lee from ten 
	feet away - obviously mistaking the situation.

				THE DETECTIVE 
		Put it down!

				CARTER 
		It's alright.  He's with me.

				THE DETECTIVE 
		With you?  He's pointing a goddamn gun 
		at you.  You call that with you?

	 And now it's Lee's turn to speak - in perfect English.

				LEE 
		He was just showing me how to take a 
		gun away from a suspect.

	Carter looks at Lee in disbelief.  Lee flips the gun around and hands 
	it back to Carter, butt first.  Carter takes the gun, anger building.  
	Then Lee grabs Carter by the hand and pulls him off the floor.

				THE DETECTIVE 
		You must be a helluva teacher.

				LEE 
		Oh yes, he's very good.

				THE DETECTIVE 
			(to Carter)
		Just don't do that shit in the 
		hallway. I could've killed him.

				CARTER 
		Oh yeah, maybe next time you will.

	Lee smiles at the Detective and bows as they move past. The Detective 
	can't help but return the smile.  Carter is pissed.

	INT. MEN'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

	Carter bursts into the men's room. Lee follows him in.

				CARTER 
		You speak English!

				LEE 
		A little.

				CARTER 
		Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.

				LEE 
		I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I 
		didn't.

				CARTER 
		It's the same thing!

				LEE
		 I am not responsible for your 
		assumptions.

				CARTER 
		You're full of shit.  Do you 
		understand what I'm saying to you?  
		Full of shit? 

				LEE 
		Not being able to speak is not the 
		same as not speaking.  You seemed as 
		if you liked to talk.  I like to let 
		people talk who like to talk.  It 
		makes it easier to find out how full 
		of shit they are.

				CARTER 
		Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm 
		full a shit.

				LEE 
			(smiles)
		We are both full of shit.

				CARTER 
		Yeah, that's right.  Now that we 
		understand each other... show me how 
		you did that.

	Carter pantomimes Lee's fast hands.  Whipping them around in a frenzy 
	of activity.  Lee just watches Carter's pathetic attempt to mimic him 
	for a moment, then:

				LEE
		You should keep your gun.

	CUT TO:

	INT. AT CARTER'S DESK -- AFTERNOON

	Carter is sitting on one side, Lee on the other.  Carter is handing him 
	a bunch of brochures and information.

				CARTER 
		... and there's a copy of our 
		insurance packages.

	Carter hands another folder to Lee.  Lee stares at the material.  But 
	it's obvious he's losing patience himself.

				LEE 
		I am afraid I don't understand the 
		importance of this information.

				CARTER 
		Look, you want to work in this 
		country, you gotta know this crap.  
		Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep 
		shit here.  Working the danger zone.  
		And you need insurance.  Cause, you 
		know, you might be starting some riots 
		and shit.

	But Carter sees Johnson coming toward him.  And he quickly puts on the 
	positive.

				CARTER 
		So, my plan is, we hit the scene, walk 
		it --

	Lee doesn't know what the hell Carter is talking about. Johnson glances 
	at Lee, then Carter.

				CARTER 
		-- and get the feel for how it went 
		down.  Then hit the witnesses --

	Carter sees Johnson, smiles, waves.  Lee turns to look, but Carter goes 
	quickly back to talking, as if what he has to say is too important to 
	interrupt.

				CARTER 
		-- see who remembers what and how the 
		action went down.

	Johnson watches for a moment, then she moves past. Realizing the 
	conversation is too important to interrupt. But she smiles at Lee.

				CARTER 
		Because we gotta dig up the --

	 And Lee smiles at Johnson.

				CARTER 
		-- what the hell is that?

				LEE 
		What?

				CARTER 
		That silly-ass look on your face.

				LEE 
		I was being polite.

				CARTER 
		Well don't do that.  Polite don't work 
		here.  You do that polite shit here in 
		America, they'll sue your ass for 
		harassment.

	Lee just stares at Carter.  America, according to Carter, is not what 
	he expected.  But now that Johnson is safely past:

				CARTER 
		Where were we?

				LEE 
		Witnesses.

				CARTER 
		Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be 
		hungry, you just flew in from China.  
		And what'd they feed you, Chinese 
		food, right?  Then you gotta be 
		hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm 
		hungry.  We'll get some food on the 
		way to the Consulate.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE -- AFTERNOON

	A HOT DOG STAND out in front.  Carter is handed TWO HOT DOGS by the 
	COOK.  Gives one to Lee.

				CARTER 
		It's not really dog.  Just called a 
		dog.  Not like in Vietnam where if 
		they made one a these it'd be dog.  
		It's just made from... well, I'm not 
		sure what, but there ain't no dog in 
		it.  

	They move down the street and Carter gestures to the wild quasi-Chinese 
	architecture of the old Grauman Theatre.

				CARTER 
		Just like home, huh?  I never been to 
		China, but...
			(looks at Lee)
		... I guess this must be pretty much 
		it, huh?  Dragons and shit.

	 Lee just stares at the garish design.  He is not happy.

				LEE 
		I thought you were taking me to the 
		consulate. 

				CARTER 
		Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And 
		you gotta see John Wayne's footprints.    
		Everybody does. It's almost like a 
		law. You can't believe how small his 
		feet were for a dude that big. Tiny 
		god damn feet!

	Carter leads Lee to the foot prints in cement.

	But a BUS LOAD OF ASIAN TOURISTS starts to move in, swirling around.  
	Carter looks at the foot prints for a beat, really getting tired of 
	this job.  Then he turns to Lee and... is CONFRONTED BY THE BUS LOAD OF 
	ASIANS.  Lee is no where to be seen.

				CARTER 
		Lee?
			(no Lee)
		Lee!

	A COUPLE of the ASIAN TOURISTS turn to him.  Carter starts searching 
	through the tourists.  Trying to pick him out.

	Lee moves quickly through the Asians, smiling and commenting on the 
	concrete memorials, just like he's a tourist.  And Carter can't pick 
	him out.

				CARTER 
		Lee!

	Carter suddenly sees him.  His back to us.  Grabs him from behind and 
	spins him around.

				CARTER 
		Hey, I was callin' --

	 Then he realizes it's not Lee.

				CARTER 
		Shit!  Where'd he go?!  LEE!

	As Carter turns and confronts more ASIAN FACES, we SEE LEE slip past 
	him in the b.g.

				CARTER 
		This ain't funny, man.  I know you're 
		in there!

	Carter turns, SEES ANOTHER BUS LOAD OF ASIAN PEOPLE unloading.

				CARTER 
		Oh no, man, no!

	Carter pushes through the tourists.  And finally SEES Lee across the 
	street, hailing a cab.  Carter can't believe it.

				CARTER 
		Hey!  What're you doin'?!

	Lee turns, sees Carter.  The cab is still too far away to get into.  So 
	Lee goes running after it.

				CARTER 
		Hey!  Hey!

	Carter takes off after him.

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD -- AFTERNOON

	Lee darts right across traffic - gymnastically moving through the flow 
	of traffic.  HORNS HONK.  A car skids to a stop, almost hitting him, 
	but Lee vaults over it.

	Carter sees the maneuver, can't believe it.  Continues after him, 
	trying not to get flattened.

				CARTER 
		Come back here!

	Lee grabs onto the back of a MOVING BUS, climbs up on top.

	FROM ATOP THE BUS

	Lee looks back at Carter.  Carter is pouring on the speed, catching up 
	to the bus.  He's going to catch Lee. Lee looks off the side at ANOTHER 
	BUS COMING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

	CARTER

	lunges at the bus, grabbing hold.

				CARTER 
		Don't do this!  You're gonna get hurt!  
		We're going to the Consulate, right 
		now, I swear --

	Carter climbs up just in time to see --

	LEE

	-- leap from the bus to the OTHER BUS moving in the opposite direction.  
	He lands hard, grabbing hold.

	CARTER

	He watches in disbelief as Lee is now moving down the street in the 
	opposite direction.  Carter starts back down the bus as fast as he can, 
	jumping the last four feet, right into the path of a CAR, which swerves 
	to avoid hitting him, into the path of ANOTHER CAR.  HORNS HONK.  CARS 
	SWERVE.

	Carter runs down Hollywood Blvd. toward La Brea as we SEE --

	LEE

	-- JUMP ONTO THE TOP OF A MOVING VAN which is next to the Bus.  Then 
	jumps from the VAN to a GARBAGE TRUCK just making the turn down La 
	Brea.  Disappearing around the corner.

	EXT. STREET - HOLLYWOOD AND LA BREA-- AFTERNOON

	Carter reaches the corner in time to watch the Garbage Truck heading 
	toward Sunset Blvd.  But he can't give up. What would he tell Russ?  He 
	lost his assignment?

	He starts running after the Garbage Truck.  And as Carter runs past 
	CAMERA CRANES ACROSS TO ANOTHER DELIVERY TRUCK moving the opposite 
	direction.

	And ON TOP OF THE DELIVERY TRUCK is Lee, staying low, watching Carter 
	run his poor tired ass off in the wrong direction.

	Lee looks around quickly.  A YELLOW CAB is moving down the cross 
	street.

	INT. YELLOW CAB -- AFTERNOON

	The DRIVER is cruising when a MAN seems to DROP from the sky right in 
	front of him.  The Driver slams on the brakes and skids to a stop at a 
	smiling Lee.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE -- NIGHT

	The taxi pulls up in front and Lee exits.  Heads for the entrance.  TWO 
	FBI AGENTS (WILLIS and GEIGER) watching. One speaks into a HEADPHONE.

				FBI AGENT WILLIS 
			(into headset)
		We have a man in a taxi.  License 
		plate 2NRB 998. About five ten.  
		Asian.  

	INT. CHINESE CONSULATE - HAN'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

	Whitney gets the call.  Turns to Russ.  Coffee cups and take out food 
	spread around.

				WHITNEY 
		Got someone dropped off by a cab. 
		Asian.

	Everyone perks up.

	EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS

	FBI Agent Geiger stops Lee.

				FBI AGENT GEIGER 
		Can I help you?

				LEE
		Help. Yes.  I must see the Ambassador.

				FBI AGENT GEIGER 
		About what?

				LEE 
		May I please see him?  It is very 
		important.

	 FBI Agent Willis walks up.

				FBI AGENT WILLIS
		Why don't you tell us why you need to 
		see the Ambassador?  We'll decide if 
		it's important.

				LEE
		It is about his daughter, Soon Young.

	 That's the magic word.  Things happen fast.

				FBI AGENT GEIGER 
		Hands on top of your head!

				FBI AGENT WILLIS 
			(into head set)
		He asked about the Ambassador's 
		daughter.

	 FBI Agent Geiger reaches for his gun.  And Lee reacts.

	 INT. CHINESE CONSULATE - HAN'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

				WHITNEY 
		He asked about the daughter.

				RUSS 
		Get em!

	BACK TO LEE AND THE TWO AGENTS

	Both agents are on the ground looking up at Lee who is holding their 
	guns.  Wondering what happened.  And sure they are about to die.

				FBI AGENT GEIGER 
			(into head set)
		Code nine, code nine!

	The agents are frozen, fear on their faces.  It looks like Lee is going 
	to kill them.  But suddenly he throws their guns into the bushes.

				LEE 
		You just don't understand.  I was 
		invited.

	Lee moves toward the entrance and SEES SIX MORE AGENTS coming at him.  
	Lee can't believe it.  What is going on?!

				WHITNEY 
		There he is!

	Lee darts across the driveway and around the corner of the house.

	ON LEE

	He runs across a patio. Suddenly, a side door on the house opens and 
	TWO AGENTS run into his path. WITHOUT BREAKING STRIDE, he twirls and 
	takes one of them out with a kick.

	The second throws one punch, two and hits AIR. Lee chops four times and 
	the guy ends up in a hedge.

	Whitney, Geiger and Williams come around a corner.

	The agent lying on the patio points.

				PATIO AGENT 
		He went up!

	They look up at a WALL on the side of the house. Beyond it is the 
	Consulate Compound.

				AGENT WHITNEY
			(into mike)
		Secure the area!

	EXT. THE COMPOUND-NIGHT

	Lee is below the wall, in the bushes, silently making his way into the 
	large back yard area.

	He hears someone coming. He hops up onto one of the Jacaranda Trees and 
	starts climbing.

	INT. RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

	The Agents run into the house, head for the doors. Whitney runs up the 
	stairs.  Other agents behind.

	INT. AMBASSADOR'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

	The Ambassador is pacing.  Chi-Ying is sitting.  She has been crying.  
	The commotion outside finally reaches them. We HEAR MEN YELLING.  The 
	door bursts open.  Whitney enters.

				WHITNEY 
		I'm sorry, sir, we have an 
		unauthorized entry.  Please get away 
		from the windows! 

	CUT TO:

	EXT. THE ROOF-NIGHT

	Lee crawls along the steeply pitched roof looking for a way in.

	He gets to a GABLE with a WINDOW. But before he can look inside, an 
	AGENT sticks his head out the window and looks around.

	The agent turns to his left. Nothing. He turns to his right and there's 
	Lee, smiling at him. POW. Lee connects with a right and the agent 
	ACCIDENTALLY FALLS out the window.

	Lee freaks and DIVES for the guy as he slides down the roof.

	ON TWO AGENTS

	They're walking in the back yard, guns drawn. Something makes one of 
	them look up.

	AGENTS POV

	The guy from the window, still out cold, is dangling off the edge of 
	the house.

	ON LEE

	He's out of sight, still on the roof, holding the guy's collar and 
	keeping him from falling over the edge. He peaks down at the agents and 
	then lets the guy go.

	He lands on the two agents like a bomb, knocking both of them down.

	Lee jumps off the roof and starts running across the huge lawn.

	Three agents come out of the POOL HOUSE and try to cut him off.

	Lee KICKS one of them into the pool. He faces off with the other two as 
	more agents come across the yard.

	Lee swings and kicks his way around the pool. Two more AGENTS get into 
	the fray. Lee pops one into the other and pushes both of them into the 
	pool.

	Suddenly the odds are too great as more agents close in. Lee DIVES into 
	the pool and swims under water to the other end.

	He comes up in time to PUNCH two of the guys he threw in. Then he jumps 
	out of the pool.

	Six agents chase him back across the lawn. Lee runs up an outside 
	staircase at the back of the house.

	He disappears in a door just as one of the agents FIRES.

	CUT TO:

	INT. THE AMBASSADORS BEDROOM

	We HEAR the shot ring out.

				WHITNEY 
		Down stairs, sir! Now!

	Whitney shoves the Ambassador and Chi-Ying out of the bedroom.  Then he 
	charges out onto a balcony, gun drawn.

	CUT TO:

	INT. AN UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

	Lee comes down the hall, dripping wet. He moves quickly and quietly. He 
	passes a doorway and immediately RUSS comes out the door, behind Lee, 
	quietly getting ready to pounce.

	Ahead of Lee, Whitney comes out of the bedroom gun drawn.

	Suddenly, Lee takes out Russ behind him with an elbow and does his 
	quick hands routine with Whitney's pistol. Both Whitney and Russ end up 
	on their backs.

	CUT TO:

	INT. THE FOYER-DAY

	Han and His wife are surrounded by agents in the large open foyer below 
	the staircase. Suddenly, Lee drops down from the stairway above and 
	lands right in front of Han.

	SIX FBI PISTOLS all point at Lee.

				HAN 
		Lee?

				LEE 
		Sorry I'm late, sir.

	Lee bows, offers a smile of regret. Then he looks down at his feet 
	where he's now dripping water.

	Russ and Lee appear on the landing above the foyer. Han looks up and 
	sees them.

				HAN 
		Mr. Russ, I think there has been a 
		misunderstanding.

	 Both Russ and Lee are looking embarrassed.

				HAN 
		I would like you to meet, Mr. Lee.

	 Lee looks up and bows to them both. 

				LEE 
		Excuse me very much.

	Agents slowly lower their guns. Lee holds up TWO REVOLVERS.

				LEE
			(to Russ and Whitney)
		Oh yes, your guns.

	 Russ fumes.

	CUT TO:

	INT. CARTER'S SEDAN -- NIGHT

	Pulling up to the Consulate Compound.  Holding out his I.D. and passing 
	FBI AGENT WILLIS.

				FBI AGENT WILLIS 
		Good job, Detective. Real nice piece 
		a work. 

	Carter gives him a look.  No idea what he's talking' about. But he must 
	have done something good.

				CARTER 
		OK. Yeah. Thanks.

	INT. CHINESE CONSULATE RESIDENCE -- CONTINUOUS

	Carter enters, heads for the office when the door opens and Han and Lee 
	come out.  Carter stops, floored.

				CARTER 
		Hey!

	 Lee smiles.  Turns to the Ambassador.

				LEE 
		This is the agent I was telling you 
		about.  Mr. Carter.

	 Han looks at Carter.  But Carter just stares at Lee.

				LEE 
		I'm sure Mr. Carter was only concerned 
		with my best interests.  He did not 
		understand the importance of my 
		getting here quickly.

	Russ exits the office, staring at Carter.  Carter realizes he's in some 
	shit, unless he can do a little fast bullshitting.  Carter suddenly 
	smiles at Lee.

				CARTER 
		Sorry I'm late.  Guess the directions 
		were okay.

	 Carter looks at Lee's wet clothes.

				CARTER (cont'd)
		I see you came via Malibu.

				HAN
			(to Lee)
		Come on. Let's get you some dry 
		clothes.

				RUSS 
		Carter, can I have a moment?

				CARTER 
		Of course, sir.  All the time you 
		want.

	Carter smiles at Lee as he moves past and enters the Lion's den.  The 
	door closes.

	 The PHONE RINGS.  Russ turns to the phone.

				CARTER 
		You want me to take care of this, you 
		gotta use me. 

	Russ ignores him.  Han enters, moving quickly to the desk.

				CARTER 
		You understand what I'm sayin'?

				RUSS 
		Carter, shut up!

	Lee steps into the room.  All attention on Han.  Russ nods to him.  Han 
	answers.  The ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT CLICKS INTO ACTION - 
	recording, tracking.  The phone conversation is in Mandarin.

				HAN 
		Hello.

				SANG'S VOICE 
		Ambassador Han.

				HAN 
		Yes.

				SANG'S VOICE 
		Even if you deny the FBI is there, I 
		will assume you are lying.

	 Han looks at Russ.  Russ hesitates, then nods.

				HAN 
		My daughter.

				SANG'S VOICE 
		She's fine.

				HAN 
		Can I speak with her?

	 INTERCUT WITH SANG - INT. 620 SOUTH MAIN

	 Sang speaks on the phone, seated at an empty table .

				SANG 
		Not yet.

	Sang looks at his watch, in no hurry.

	INT. HAN'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

	Whitney is watching the clock.  They need a few more moments to make 
	the trace.

				RUSS 
			(whisper)
		Keep him talking.

	 Phone conversation continues in Mandarin.

				HAN 
		How do I know she is alive?

				SANG 
		Have to take my word for it.

				HAN 
		What do you want?

				SANG 
		I want you to think for a moment... 
		what is a daughter worth?

	Whitney motions to keep talking.  They're close.  Very close to making 
	the trace.

				HAN
		 Everything.

				SANG 
		Good.  I'd hate to think less.

	 Whitney signals.  They've got the trace.

				SANG 
		But we've talked enough for now.  I'll 
		call later, after you've  had a chance 
		to think about... the mistakes you've 
		made.

	 The phone line goes dead.  Whitney holds up the paper.

				WHITNEY 
		620 South Main. Downtown.

	Russ, Whitney and Agents immediately head for the door, past Lee and 
	Carter.

	EXT. CHINESE CONSULATE -- NIGHT

	Russ, Whitney, other Agents exit, moving to cars.  Lee hurries up 
	behind Russ.

				LEE 
		Mr. Russ --

	 Russ stops, turns to Lee.

				RUSS 
		Mr. Lee, Detective Carter has been 
		assigned to help you.  He is the very 
		best at...
			(pause)
		...what he does. Excuse me.

	A car pulls up.  Russ gets in.  Car pulls away.  Followed by others.  
	Lee watches, anger building, but trying not to show it.  Carter comes 
	up behind him.

	Both of them watch the FBI cars peel out.  Then they turn and look at 
	each other.  Not exactly a match made in heaven.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

	THREE UNMARKED FBI CARS pull out of the Consulate Compound.  Move 
	quickly down the street.  Carter's sedan pulls out a few moments later.

	INT. SEDAN -- NIGHT

	Carter behind the wheel.  Lee next to him.  Both are quiet for a 
	moment, then --

				CARTER 
		You're a regular god damn acrobat, 
		aren't you?  Bet you feel real good 
		makin' me look like an asshole.

				LEE 
		It was not my intent --

				CARTER 
		Right....

				LEE 
		Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire 
		to show me a good time, but that is 
		not the reason I am here.

				CARTER
		 Let me just clarify a few things.  I 
		don't care what kind of cop you are in 
		China, you have no jurisdiction in 
		America.  Without me you are just 
		another tourist.

	 Carter and Lee exchange a look.

				CARTER 
		So don't pull that shit again.

	Carter suddenly turns the sedan in another direction from the FBI cars 
	they're following.

				LEE
		What about them?

				CARTER
		I know a shortcut.

				LEE
		Shortcut?

				CARTER
		You don't know what a shortcut is?

	 Lee shakes his head.

			(to himself)
		Lame ass country.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Carter is repeatedly hitting the speed dial on his CELL PHONE while he 
	drives. We hear that HEE HAW sound you get when you're in cell phone 
	hell.

				CARTER
			(tossing the phone)
		Piece a shit.

	Carter starts looking for a phone booth. Lee, meanwhile, picks up the 
	cell phone and expertly RIPS it open.

	He starts studying the inner workings of the phone.

				LEE
		Accessory board probably burnt out.

	 Carter looks over at his phone and freaks.

				CARTER
		Hey!  What did you do to my phone, 
		man!? You people can't keep your hands 
		off electronics, can you?!

	ON THE SEDAN

	He pulls across the street from a MINI-MART. We see EMPTY PHONE BOOTHS 
	out front.

				CARTER (cont'd)
		Wait here.

	Carter shuts the door.  Starts away.  Stops.  Then returns to the car, 
	reaches in and quickly snaps a hand cuff on Lee's arm and another on 
	the steering wheel.

				CARTER 
		Relax. This is somethin' we do in L.A.  
		Always cuff a friend or a wife or a 
		kid to the steering' wheel so 
		nobody'll steal the car.  It's like a 
		human anti-theft device.
			(big smile)
		Be right back.

	Carter crosses to the Mini Mart.  Lee watches him, then looks at his 
	wrist cuffed to the steering wheel.

	EXT. MINI-MART -- NIGHT

	Carter is HOLDING on the pay phone when a GUY IN A TURBAN comes out of 
	the store.

		Hey, Johnson! It's Carter.  Listen,

	 INTERCUT WITH JOHNSON

	 She's at her desk.

		Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the

		No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back

	 Carter comes back across the street and gets in the car. 

				CARTER
		OK, now I'm gonna show you what a

	Carter reaches down to start the car and finds that his steering wheel 
	is gone. Along with Lee.

		Sonuvabitch!

	CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT

	UNMARKED CARS pulling up.  FBI SPECIAL TACTICS TEAMS arriving and 
	deploying.  The target: the OLD OFFICE BUILDING across the street.  A 
	TEAM OF BLACK CLAD FBI moves into the ground floor.

	A TAXI pulls up.  Lee exits, carrying Carter's steering wheel because 
	he's still attached to it. Whitney sees him first and does a double 
	take.

				WHITNEY
		Jesus H...

	 Lee moves toward Whitney.

				WHITNEY (cont'd)
		Where's Carter?

				LEE 
		Lost I think.  Which building?

	 Russ walks up.

				RUSS 
		Mr. Lee, this is an FBI operation.

				LEE
		I was brought here to help.

				RUSS
		Please stay back.

	 Two AGENTS walk up ready to restrain him.

				LEE 
		She is very important to me.  You must

				RUSS 
		Mr. Lee, the very fact that you know 
		her compromises your judgement.

	 Whitney comes up behind Russ, interrupting --

				WHITNEY 
		Area secured.  Teams ready.

	Another TAXI pulls up.  Carter jumps out.  Storming toward Lee.

				CARTER 
		He stole my wheel! 

				WHITNEY
		This is pathetic.

				CARTER
		 I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!
			(turns to Lee)
		Your ass is goin' to jail!

	 Carter WHISPERS to the two restraining agents:

				CARTER (cont'd)
		Hold me back.
			(yelling)
		After I kick it first!

	The TWO AGENTS PULL Carter away from Lee.  Russ has had enough.

				RUSS

		Get them the hell out of here!

		You are cleared to go.

	ON THE BUILDING

	We can see FLASHLIGHTS moving in the windows as the team moves to the

	INT. OLD BUILDING - OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

	The DOOR is KICKED OPEN.  AGENTS BURST INTO THE ROOM, Drop to

		What do you want me to do?

	 Russ hesitates.  Then starts running for the building.

	FOURTH RING.  FIFTH RING.  Finally he takes off his helmet, picks up 
	the receiver.

	EXT. OLD BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

	The TOP FLOOR OF THE BUILDING SUDDENLY BLOWS UP in a huge fireball.  
	Russ and Agents are knocked down.  Lee and Carter take cover from the 
	debris.  CLOUD OF DUST AND SMOKE roll over them.

	When Lee gets up, he's facing away from the building.  He sees 
	something.

	P.O.V. OF A MAN -- CONTINUOUS

	Standing in a doorway as the FLASH FROM THE EXPLOSION LIGHTS up his 
	face for a moment.  And we recognize him. It's Sang.

	EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

	Lee is stunned.  He gets up quickly, starts running after Sang who 
	disappears down an alley into darkness.

	Carter sees Lee.

		Hey!

		Not this time...

	Carter goes after him.

	Sang is running hard when he turns and sees Lee.

	Sang jumps onto a DUMPSTER in the alley, grabs a FIRE ESCAPE LADDER and 
	starts climbing.

	Lee leaps onto the dumpster, grabs the ladder and goes up.

	Sang climbs two stories, smashes a WINDOW and climbs into the building.

	ON CARTER

	He rounds the corner and sees Lee going up the building.

				CARTER 
		What are you doing, god damn it!?

	Carter runs for the dumpster and the fire escape.

	INT. BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

	We're in an ABANDONED ATRIUM moving down an open, dirty hallway. Lee 
	moves quickly and quietly. He peaks over the edge of the atrium:

	LEE'S POV

	Two floors below we see a TUNNEL filled with trash.

	Lee passes SCAFFOLDING that's been abandoned. He stops and listens. 
	Suddenly, we hear SOMEONE RUNNING. Lee takes off.

	ON CARTER

	He climbs through the window and takes off down the open hallway.

	ON SANG

	He explodes around a corner and runs over a BRIDGE connecting both 
	sides of the atrium. A sign on the bridge says DANGER-UNDER 
	CONSTRUCTION.

	The bridge CREAKS and moves. Sang STUMBLES and drops something. But 
	Sang doesn't stop and he makes it over the bridge.

	Lee runs up right behind Sang but he slows when he sees the bridge and 
	the sign. He starts over slowly and picks up WHAT SANG DROPPED.

	CLOSE ON

	A DETONATOR

	The bridge CREAKS Loudly. But Lee scampers across.

	Carter is right on his heels. He doesn't even see the sign and 
	accelerates as he runs over the bridge. We hear a massive CRACK!

				CARTER 
		Oh shiiiiit!

	The bridge gives way and Carter drops like a brick.

	He falls two stories and hits the tunnel floor on top of a huge mass of 
	debris.

	Dust swirls for a moment. Carter doesn't move and then:

				CARTER 
		...ahhh.

	ON LEE

	He's across the atrium when he sees Carter fall. Lee grabs a PIPE and 
	quickly swings himself down to the floor of the tunnel.

	He finds Carter covered in dust and debris.

				CARTER
		Am I dead? 

	Suddenly we HEAR SCREECHING TIRES.  Both men turn.  A CAR IS SCREAMING 
	DOWN THE TUNNEL toward them.

	Lee looks around. No where to go.

	At the last instant, he grabs Carter and they roll out of the way.

	The car ROARS by and goes out the other end of the tunnel.

				CARTER 
		You make the plate?

				LEE 
		What plate?

				CARTER 
		The license!  You get it?!

				LEE 
		No.

				CARTER 
		What the hell kinda cop are you?!  

				LEE 
		Did you make the plate?!

				CARTER 
		It was my ass that almost got trashed!

				LEE 
		He was trying to kill me, not you.

				CARTER
		 Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in 
		L.A. after what?  Six hours?

				LEE 
		It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.

				CARTER 
		Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my 
		ass again.

				LEE AND CARTER
		I might have...
			(pause)
		It does not matter now.

	 Lee starts walking down the tunnel.

				CARTER 
		Hey, wait a second!

	 Lee keeps walking.

				CARTER 
		You tryin' to make this out to be my 
		fault?  Like it was me who got in the 
		way of you?!  You gotta not be 
		serious.
			(nothing from Lee)
		That what you're thinking'?!  Come on, 
		say it if you think it. SAY IT!

	 Lee stops, turns back.

				LEE 
		When a man steps in dung, it is 
		obvious.  There is no need to rub it 
		in his face.  The smell is the same.

				CARTER 
		What is that, some kind of Chinese 
		proverb?

				LEE 
		No. I just made it up.

		Yes sir.

		Yo, Johnson...

		Look, I don't know what's goin' on

		No, wait!

	He runs after Johnson and catches her as she gets into her car.

		Hey, I don't need that. You just got 
		your last back-up from me.

	She squeals away from the scene.

	Carter looks beat up and defeated.

	We HEAR a PHONE START TO RING.  Once, twice.  Carter turns.

	A PAY PHONE is ringing next to a building.  Three, four, five.  Carter, 
	annoyed, finally crosses to the booth, answers --

				CARTER 
		You're calling a phone booth, asshole.

	Hangs up. He gets five steps away when it starts to RING AGAIN.  He 
	stops, turns back.  Answers.

				CARTER 
		You know what a phone booth is?!

				MAN'S VOICE 
		The bomb was meant as a demonstration 
		of our sincerity.  If you want the 
		Ambassador's daughter back alive, 
		listen and do not talk.

	Carter realizes now who he's got on the other end of the line.  He 
	covers the receiver.

				CARTER 
		Lee!  It's him!

				MAN'S VOICE 
		The first drop will be made tomorrow.  
		At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be 
		fifty million.

				CARTER 
		Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United 
		States dollars?

				MAN'S VOICE 
		In used currency.  Nothing bigger than 
		a fifty.

				CARTER 
		That's some serious poundage in 
		dollars.

	Carter covers the phone and tries to get the attention of the FBI.

				CARTER 
		Hey, it's him.  On the phone.
			(back to phone)
		Where do you think an Ambassador's 
		gonna come up with that kinda cash?  I 
		mean, how much can a guy like that 
		take home, after taxes?  And in China.
			(covers phone again)
		It's him!  Get your asses over here!

	 Lee finally turns and hears him.

				CARTER (cont'd)
			(back to phone)
		I mean I don't think he even gets paid 
		in dollars.  They probably pay in yang 
		or yin or...rice, whatever it is they 
		got there.

	 Lee walks over. Carter holds the phone so Lee can hear.

				MAN'S VOICE
		 What is your name?

				CARTER 
		That's cool.  We're gettin' to know 
		each other. This is a good thing. I'm 
		Carter.

				MAN'S VOICE 
		Carter.  I just want to be able to 
		tell the Ambassador who was 
		responsible for the death of his 
		daughter because he talked too much.

				CARTER 
		Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was 
		gettin' on here!

				MAN'S VOICE 
		Shut up!

				CARTER 
		OK. Say what it is.

				MAN'S VOICE 
		The Ambassador will receive 
		instructions for the drop, half an

		is successful, there will be more.  
		Thank you, Agent Carter.

	 Russ hangs up as Carter approaches.

		Fifty million --

	 Russ turns angrily.

				RUSS 
		I don't think you need to be here!

	Russ turns away.  Whitney gives Carter a look, then follows.

				CARTER 
		That's what the man wants for the 
		girl.  Just called on the pay phone 
		across the street.  With the 
		instructions for the first drop.  Just 
		thought you might be interested.  It's 
		what they call a ransom demand.

	 Carter turns and starts walking away.

				RUSS 
		Carter!

	 Carter turns slowly.

				CARTER 
		Hmmmm?

				RUSS 
		Don't play bullshit games with me.

				CARTER 
		Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador 
		will receive a phone call telling him 
		where the drop is.  He said the bomb 
		was a demonstration of their 
		sincerity.

	 Carter turns to go, then stops, turns back. 

				CARTER 
		Oh yeah.  The caller was a man.  
		Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, 
		Asian.  Anything else I can do for the 
		FBI, sir?

				RUSS 
		Why don't you try the assignment.  Or 
		should I call and ask for somebody who 
		can handle it?

				CARTER
		 No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.

	Carter offers a smile, then starts back toward Lee.  The smile 
	disappears as he turns his back on Russ.

	We watch Carter and Lee get out of a cab in the Los Felis district. 
	Over this we HEAR:

		know where you were goin' if you never 
		been here before?  Huh?

				LEE VO

	INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT-NIGHT

	Carter and Lee come through the door into a dark leather living room 
	set up for one thing: pussy.

	Carter hits a series of switches. Subdued lights come on, a stereo 
	starts with nasty rap, a gas fireplace pops on, and SOFT PORN starts 
	playing on the VCR.

	Carter sees Lee's reaction to the setting.

				CARTER 
		I can't help it. I'm a hopeless 
		romantic.

	Carter disappears into a bedroom.

	Lee wanders over to a shelf with a collection of LOVE OILS.

	Carter sticks his head out of the bedroom as he slips on a clean shirt.

				CARTER 
		Hey, don't drop that shit. It's 
		imported. 

	 He goes back in the bedroom and talks from there.

				CARTER VO
		Look, none of this has gone down

		Forgettin' a man's daughter is gone.

	 He comes back out buttoning up a clean pair of pants.

				CARTER
		I know I been part of it so... I'm 
		sorry.

	 Lee looks at Carter for a beat.

				LEE 
		I worked with Ambassador Han and his

		come with them to America.  If I had, 
		this might not have happened.

				CARTER 
		Don't go there...

				LEE 
		I could not come.  I had other 
		responsibilities.

				CARTER 
		Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up 
		in some bar, drinking' to forget all 
		the things we shoulda done and then 
		you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs 
		again. Then I'll really get depressed.

				LEE 
		I also did not come because I think I 
		would not fit in America. 

				CARTER 
		Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at 
		L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My

	 Carter looks at Lee and makes a decision.

				CARTER 
		Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell 
		me straight: did you really know the 
		guy you were chasin'?

				LEE 
		Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime 
		family. He may be Juntao himself.
			(reaches into pocket)
		And he dropped this.

	Lee retrieves a small BLACK CYLINDER.  Carter glances at it.  Then 
	recognizes the DETONATOR.

				CARTER
		Looks like a clue to me, Detective

	He passes a guy taking a hit off a JOINT. He stops.

				CARTER
			(to the guy)
		That better not be what I think it is. 
		Gimme that.

	Carter swipes the joint out of the guy's hand. He takes a big hit. He 
	holds it and tastes it for a beat.

	Lee is looking at Carter in disbelief.

		Wait a minute.

	 He takes ANOTHER HIT. Gives the joint back.

	holds up his hands.

	Lee looks again at the Asian girl and inadvertently smiles. He catches

	WHACK! Big dude hits the object ball so hard, it hops the table and 
	heads right for Lee's head. Lee catches it like a baseball line drive, 
	right in front of his nose.

	Nobody moves for a beat, mainly because everyone is impressed with 
	Lee's catch.

	pokes Big Dude in the forehead with his tip leaving a blue chalk spot. 
	Then he turns the cue around and belts the guy on the spot.

		By Ambassador Han.

	 Carter flips his cell phone open.

				CARTER 
		Let's get us a photo and description.  
		We'll have an APB out while we stake 
		out the restaurant.  

				LEE 
		That is a problem. There is no 
		description of Juntao. No known 
		photograph.

				CARTER 
		Are you tellin' me nobody knows what 
		he looks like?  Come on, there must be 
		witnesses somewhere.

				LEE 
		Juntao's standing orders were to kill 
		everyone. There were never witnesses.

	INT. CAR-- CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee are watching Fang Shan restaurant, eating from cartons 
	of Chinese food.

				LEE 
		You like it?

				CARTER 
		Yeah, it's good.

				LEE 
		That one is my favorite.  Chicken puff 
		with shark fin.

	 Carter starts chewing a little slower.

				LEE 
		And the Eel is very good, too.  But I 
		have had better Camel's Hump.

	 Carter has trouble swallowing.  Puts down his food.

				LEE 
		You want more?

				CARTER 
		No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and 
		hump, you know, gives me gas.

		scuse me.

	 Silence for a moment, then Lee motions to the radio.

				LEE 
		Music?

	 A beat, then Carter nods.  Lee reaches for the radio.

				CARTER 
		No!  This time I pick.

	Carter turns on the radio.  Dials around until he finds WAR.

				CARTER 
		Now, that's American music.

				LEE 
		Yes, I know this song.

				CARTER 
		You know War?

				LEE 
		Who does not know War?
			(starts)
		³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What 
		is it good for?  Absolutely nothing.  
		Good-God, you all.²

	 Carter just stares at Lee for a moment in disbelief.

				CARTER 
		That's not how it goes.

				LEE 
		Yes, I think so.

				CARTER 
		No, no.  It's not good-God you all!  
		It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!

				LEE 
		Yee-aww.

	 Carter turns off the radio.

				CARTER 
		Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be 
		angry.  Like you're pissed off.

				LEE 
		Good God, ya'll!

				CARTER 
		No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do 
		it one time.  That's it.

	MONTAGE BEGINS

	Carter gets out of the car.  Lee follows.  Carter limbers up for a 
	moment, then starts a dance move to get him into the beat.

				CARTER 
		War!  huuuuhh!  wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh!  
		what's it good for?  absolutely 
		nuthin'  good-gawd ya'll!

	Lee gives it his best shot, trying to mimic Carter's dance move.  But 
	it's more martial arts than dance.

				LEE AND CARTER 
		War!  huuuuhh!  wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh!  
		what's it good for?  absolutely 
		nuthin'  good-gawd ya'll

	Lee tries to get into the rhythm with Carter, undulating his body to 
	Carter's motion.  But Carter watches Lee's martial arts interpretation 
	and he starts to alter his moves to Lee.

				LEE AND CARTER 
		War!  huuuuhh!  wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh!  
		what's it good for?  absolutely 
		nuthin'  good-gawd ya'll!

	Both of them are moving side by side, in step as they sing.  Totally 
	involved.  Rocking out.

				LEE AND CARTER 
		War!  huuuuhh!  wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh!  
		what's it good for?  absolutely

	CARTER his quick move for taking someone's gun away.

				LEE
		Want some?

				CARTER
		No, fish is a PM food.

				LEE
		Excuse me?

	Carter looks out the window.  But the street is already full of ASIAN

	They listen.  CHINESE MUSIC filters out from one of the shops.  SEVERAL 
	CONVERSATIONS are in Chinese.  There is nothing that would suggest this 
	is America.

				CARTER 
		Walk two more blocks and neither of us

	watches her walk past.  He smiles politely. Carter watches him for a 
	beat, then --

				CARTER 
		That ain't gonna get it. Watch this.

	Carter screws up his face as if he's really enjoying watching the woman 
	- like she's the best thing he's ever seen.  A complete politically 
	incorrect slob of a man. The only thing missing is the drool.

				CARTER 
		Like that.

				LEE 
		I am sorry, but I have too much 
		respect for women.

	Carter stares at him blankly, then puts an arm around him.

				CARTER 
		This is nothin' personal with women.  
		We are undercover.  It's okay to be a 
		player when you're undercover.  Okay?

	 Lee hesitates, then nods.  Carter takes out his i.d.

				CARTER 
		You've got no jurisdiction here so I'm 
		gonna give you my i.d.  If we get into

	Carter opens his i.d. - Carter is black, Lee is Asian - that's one 
	difference.

				CARTER 
		Hold it like this, flip it open, flip 
		it closed.  It's the attitude that 
		says who you are, not the i.d.

	Carter flips the i.d. with authority, partially covering his photo with 
	his hand.  We hardly even see the photo. Carter hands the i.d. back to 
	Lee.

				CARTER 
		You got to make people think this is 
		you.
			(re: Carter's photo)
		You gotta believe that face is your 
		face.  

	 Lee tries the flip.

				CARTER 
		More wrist.  It's gotta snap.  Can't 
		be limp. You do limp, they look at the

	Carter points to his face.  Lee tries the flip with more wrist.  
	Snapping it open.

				CARTER 
		Good.  Gimme a couple minutes, then

		No, please, I don't --

	men.

				CARTER 
		I'm tellin' you, when I sue, I win!

	Carter's outburst draws Sang's attention.  And Lee takes advantage - 
	swinging the tray of food at him.  The metal tray smashes into Sang's

		Where's my gun!

	Before Lee can answer, Sang wakes up and pulls a gun.

	Lee dives, rolls, comes up kicking.  Hitting Sang's hand as he FIRES,

	The kitchen panics.  Chefs and waiters try to get out of the way.  
	Carter and Lee head for the back door.  And then it really hits Lee.  
	He staggers.  Stops.  Carter turns.

		 Come on, let's go!

	 Lee weaves as he tries not to fall.

	Lee spins around, falls back into Carter's arms.

				CARTER
		 No, no, don't do this!  This is not

	Carter pushes him up as the men charge into the kitchen. Lee takes a 
	swing, but his hand accidentally hooks a pot of boiling Won Ton soup 
	off the stove, flinging it back at the men as the charge in.  They duck 
	the shower of scalding broth.

	Then Carter starts grabbing every pot off the stove and flinging the 
	hot food at the men.  Lee joins in, throwing a barrage of hot chicken, 
	fish, ribs, bok choi, chow mein, and fried rice at the men.  Lee 
	staggers to keep from falling.

	Then Lee grabs two WHOLE CATFISH on a cutting board as Carter starts 
	throwing boxes of fortune cookies at the men.

	Lee attacks with the two fish.  Hits one in the head, blocks a punch 
	with another.  The fish thud and SMACK with each blow.

	Lee swings the FISH together, slapping one man on both sides of his 
	head.  Two Catfish have never been more deadly.

	Another man comes up from behind, but Lee swings the Catfish under his 
	legs and CATCHES THE MAN BEHIND HIM in the groin -CATFISH MOUTH WIDE 
	OPEN.  Then Lee spins around and slams his hands against the Catfish's 
	mouth. The jaws clamp tight.  The man SCREAMS and buckles.

	A fifth man dives at Lee, but he staggers, grabbing the man and shoving 
	him headfirst into a ROW OF HANGING POTS. HEAD SMACKING into each one.

	A sixth man hits Carter from behind.  Carter spins around, punches the 
	man, knocking him into the hot stove, his hands going down ONTO THE HOT

	Lee turns, slipping, but kicking behind, catching another man and 
	sending him crashing into a sink - pile of DIRTY DISHES CASCADING DOWN 
	ON TOP OF HIM.

	Lee swings wildly.  Another man ducks, comes back up, pulling a gun, 
	but Lee is still spinning uncontrollably and hits the man the second 
	time around.  The gun flies out of his hand and clanks onto the stove - 
	open flame heating the metal.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - FANG SHAN RESTAURANT -- CONTINUOUS

	The FBI now in position.  Watching the restaurant. People coming out in

	INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

	Lee slips, grabbing hold of a refrigerator door to keep from falling.  
	Pulling it open.  Door slamming into the head of number seven, face 
	first.  Then Lee grabs a tray full of knives, slips backward, 
	accidentally flinging them over his head, back at them.

	Everyone hits the floor as the KNIVES impale the wall.

	But one man manages to throw a bottle at Carter.  Carter ducks and the 
	bottle crashes into the stove.  FLAMES ERUPT as the OIL falls onto the 
	gas flames.

	The oil soaked wall BURSTS INTO FLAME.  And the OVERHEATED BULLETS in 
	the gun on the stove start to EXPLODE.

	Carter kicks open the back door as THE KITCHEN starts to FILL WITH 
	BLACK OILY SMOKE.

	EXT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee jump into the alley as the KITCHEN IGNITES.  GAS MAIN 
	BLOWING.  WINDOWS SHATTER.  FLAMES BLOW INTO THE ALLEY. Lee and Carter 
	are knocked down.

	And they get up slowly.  Both are covered in kitchen crap.  Food, oil, 
	dirt.  Now, they move quickly down the alley.

	Then Carter sees his GUN on the ground.  He picks it up.

				CARTER 
		Oh man, I don't even wanna know how it 
		got out here!

	Lee staggers.  Carter grabs him.

	A POLICE CAR roars up in front of them.  POLICE are out, guns drawn, 
	pointing at Carter and Lee.

				POLICE OFFICER 
		Drop the gun!

		I'm L.A.P.D.

		Drop the gun now!

		I've got my i.d.

		No!

	The police crouch, GUNS POINTED AT CARTER.  Carter freezes, hand in 
	pocket.  Then Carter realizes he doesn't have it.

				CARTER 
		No, wait.  I don't have it.
			(to Lee)
		You have it.

				LEE 
		Oh yes.

	Lee, staggering, reaches for his pocket.  The Police IMMEDIATELY TURN 
	their guns on Lee.

				SECOND POLICE OFFICER 
		Nobody move!

	 But Lee suddenly realizes --

				LEE 
		Oh no, I dropped it.

				CARTER 
		You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?

				LEE 
		I'm sorry.

				POLICE OFFICER 
		You lent him your i.d.?

	Lee is completely leaning against Carter to keep from falling over.  
	Carter hangs on, leaning back against him.

				CARTER 
			(angry)
		Yeah, I lent him my i.d.  You got a 
		problem with that?

				SECOND POLICE OFFICER 
		No, I can see the resemblance. GET

	THREE FEDERAL UNMARKED CARS screech to a stop in front. Doors open.  
	Lee and Carter are escorted by a BEVY OF FBI AGENTS.

	Both Lee and Carter are still covered with the mess from the kitchen 
	fight.  Carter still partially carries Lee.

				CARTER
			(to Lee)
		Don't worry. We're gonna make a full

	Carter looks confidently at the bureau boys surrounding him.  They all 
	look straight ahead, no expression, no comment.

		Okay, let me start from the top.  A

		dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after 
		the shit blew up last night...

				RUSS 
			(interrupting)
		I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no

				CARTER
		What?!

				RUSS
		And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way 
		back to China.  Now, get out. Before I 
		file obstruction of justice charges 
		against you. 

	Carter is stunned. TWO AGENTS open the door behind him. Carter 
	hesitates.  He's angry.  But this is not the time or the place.  He 
	exits.

	INT. ANOTHER ROOM - CHINESE CONSULATE -- DAY

	Han is pacing.  Lee is leaning against a wall to keep from falling 
	over.  Ashamed.  Conversation in MANDARIN.

				LEE 
		I have disappointed you.

				HAN 
		My disappointment is not what matters.

	Lee tries to take a step toward Han, but his knees start to get weak 
	and he leans back against the wall.

	Han turns away from Lee.  He can't stand to look at him in his 
	³condition².

				HAN 
		I have no say in it now.  I must rely 
		upon the FBI to get Soon-Young back.  
		They will escort you to the airport.

				LEE 
		It was Juntao.

	 Han turns.

				HAN 
		Juntao?

	Lee nods.  The door suddenly opens and Carter enters with TWO AGENTS 
	trying to keep him from doing so.  Carter pulls away from them.

				CARTER 
		Mr. Ambassador, I just want you to 
		know that whatever you think Lee did, 
		he didn't.  It was my fault.

				AGENT 
			(to Han)
		Sorry, sir.

	 Russ and three agents enter quickly.

	The Agents move to Lee and Carter.  Escorting them out of the room.  
	The door closes.

				RUSS 
		Okay, pick it up.

	Han picks up a phone at the same time Russ picks up a second phone.  
	Russ listens in.

				HAN 
			(into phone)
		Yes.

				SANG'S VOICE 
		You have run out of time.  The amount

	CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

	Shu is leaning against the van in the parking lot.

				MAN'S VOICE 
		You're parked in a red zone.

	 Shu turns quickly at the sound of the voice.  Suddenly 
	 facing Carter who has his gun out, pointed at him.

				CARTER 
		It's not red now, but you try 
		anything, and it's gonna be blood red. 

	 Carter moves up to him, keeping the gun leveled.

				CARTER 
		Only one problem.  I forgot my cuffs.

	He grabs Shu's head and slams it into the side of the van.  Shu drops.  
	Out cold.

	Carter pulls keys from Shu's pocket.

				CARTER 
		You have the right to remain silent 
		alllll night.

	Carter moves to the back of the van.  Looks at the LICENSE.  
	CALIFORNIA.  LIK.

	Unlocks the back door.  Stands back, ready to shoot, as he opens the 
	door.  Looks in.

	ON SOON YOUNG

	She's in the back of the van.  Black hood over her face. She's wearing 
	a BULKY VEST that is covered with plastic explosive.

	Carter pulls the hood off.

				CARTER
		Hi. Detective Carter, LAPD. Let's get 
		this thing off you.

				SOON YOUNG
			(near tears)
		NO! Don't touch it! I heard them say 
		it will explode.

	 Carter hesitates.

	CUT TO:

	INT.CONVENTION CENTER

	Griffin stands at the podium, still holding the detonator high so 
	everyone can see it.

	He speaks quietly into his lapel mike.

				GRIFFIN
		Where are you?

	 INT. HELICOPTER-NIGHT

	 The pilot keys his mike.

				PILOT
		Three minutes.

	INT.CONVENTION CENTER

	Griffin nods to Sang down on the floor. Sang starts moving up the 
	escalator.

				GRIFFIN
		Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We'll 
		be calling this an evening.

	Suddenly we HEAR a CLATTER AND RUMBLE.  Low at first, but building 
	LOUDER and LOUDER.  Everyone turns.

	THROUGH THE PLATE GLASS WINDOW we can SEE THE VAN tearing up the museum 
	steps.  Right toward the window.

	And it's not stopping.

	ON THE VAN

	It crashes RIGHT INTO THE WINDOW.  Everyone scatters. The Van roars 
	into the hall. It knocks over a huge DISPLAY CASE scattering glass 
	everywhere. Finally, it RAMS the refreshment booth and stops in the 
	middle of the room.

	The BACK DOORS OPEN and Carter steps out with Soon Young who is still 
	wearing the bomb.

				CARTER 
			(to Griffin)
		Okay, asshole, here's your bomb.  You 
		wanna blow somebody up, go ahead.  
		Push the button.  Let's blow everybody 
		up.

	Everyone who didn't panic before, does now. People start running.

				HAN 
		Soon Young!

	An FBI AGENT grabs Han and his wife and pushes them down on the floor.

	Lee and Johnson run to Soon Young's side.

	ON GRIFFIN

	For the first time, he looks scared. He turns away from the podium and 
	runs.

	Sang turns on the escalator, pulls a MAC 10 and sprays the room.

	FBI agents on the floor take cover behind the priceless art work, pull 
	guns and start firing.

	Griffin's men return fire as the last of the black tie crowd hit the 
	deck.

	Johnson grabs Soon Young and ducks back in the van with Lee.

	Carter fires several times as he follows them.

	CUT TO:

	INT. THE SECOND FLOOR ROOM

	The last of the money is being loaded from one remaining suitcase and 
	put into the dragons by two agents.  Russ watches.

	Suddenly, Griffin runs into the room and opens fire with a nine 
	millimeter.

	He hits the two agents doing the packing. Russ, totally taken by 
	surprise, reaches for his weapon, but Russ cuts him down.

	Griffin grabs the last full suitcase and runs out.

	CUT TO:

	INT. THE VAN

	Johnson is studying the bomb. Soon Young continues to whimper.

				JOHNSON
			(to Soon Young)
		It's gonna be OK.

	The battle RAGES outside. Occasionally, the van is hit by gun fire.

				CARTER
		Can you get it off?

	Johnson doesn't answer. Instead, she pulls a SWISS ARMY KNIFE out of 
	her dainty purse, flips out the tiny scissors and cuts TWO WIRES 
	leading to one of the CLASPS on the vest.

				JOHNSON
		OK.

	 Lee helps her take the vest off. Johnson hands it to Lee.

				JOHNSON (cont'd)
		Get rid of it. The detonator can still 
		set it off. And this...

	 She points to a SWITCH on the front of the vest. 

				JOHNSON (cont'd)
		Don't touch. It's a back up. Short 
		fuse. Five...maybe ten seconds.

				CARTER
		I'll cover you.

	At that moment, the van is hit hard with automatic fire. Johnson throws 
	herself over Soon Young as Carter and Lee dive out the back door.

	INT.THE HALL

	Carter and Lee jump behind the Buddha. Gunfire erupts from all 
	quarters.

				CARTER
			(to Lee)
		Go! 

	Lee takes off for the escalator. He runs half way up when Russ appears 
	at the top. He's bleeding badly and staggering.

				RUSS
			(to Lee)
		Griffin...the elevator.

	Russ collapses. Lee looks up. A hundred and fifty feet above him, we 
	see a catwalk below the skylights that make up the roof.  The catwalk 
	leads to AN OPEN ROOF DOOR.

	Lee scans the ceiling and spots an ENCLOSED LADDER that leads all the 
	way up to the catwalk. He takes off.

	CUT TO:

	INT. AN ELEVATOR

	Griffin keys his mike.

				GRIFFIN
			(into radio)
		Plan B. Meet me on the roof.

	INT. THE HELICOPTER

	The pilot is just getting ready to set the chopper down in the parking 
	lot. He aborts and pulls full power.

	The chopper starts to rise.

	INT. THE HALL

	Lee reaches the ladder, PUTS THE BOMB JACKET ON and starts climbing.

	ON CARTER

	He runs up the escalator and bends down to Russ. He's alive but hurt 
	bad. Carter turns and sees SANG running and firing BELOW HIM.

	Carter leaps off the escalator and lands on Sang.

	INT. THE ELEVATOR

	Griffin looks down at the detonator in his hand. For a second he looks 
	like he's going to push the button. But he hesitates.

	INT. THE LADDER

	Lee is flying up it at superhuman speed. When the inside ladder proves 
	too slow, he switches to the outside GUARD CAGE and climbs that.

	ON SANG AND CARTER

	Sang is kicking the shit out of Carter. Carter gets in one punch and 
	Sang hits him three times and sweeps his feet out from under him.

	EXT. THE ELEVATOR

	The doors open and Griffin walks out onto the catwalk that runs just 
	below the ceiling. He looks down.

	GRIFFIN'S POV

	Below him, the battle still rages, but FBI agents are getting the upper 
	hand.

	Griffin holds up the detonator. His thumb covers the button.

				LEE'S VOICE
		Looking for this?

	Griffin looks up and sees Lee, breathing hard, on the other side of the 
	catwalk. He's pointing to the bomb that he's wearing.

	Griffin fires two shots at Lee that ricochet off the catwalk railing. 
	Lee hits the floor of the catwalk.

	INT. THE HALL

	Two of Griffin's men are cut down by Whitney as they try to escape up 
	the escalator.

	ON SANG AND CARTER

	Sang KICKS Carter in the face and he goes down. Sang practically 
	stumbles over Carter's gun and picks it up. Carter staggers to his 
	feet.

	Sang points the gun at Carter and cocks it.

				CARTER
		That's my gun, mother fucker.

	Carter's hands fly, doing Lee's routine. Suddenly, the gun ends up in 
	Carter's hands.

	Sang leaps for the gun. Carter drills him in the forehead.

	INT. THE CATWALK

	Griffin fires at Lee as he tries to make his way around to the roof 
	door. Lee CRAWLS. Suddenly, a ROAR starts a second before we see the 
	CHOPPER rise into a hover.

	Griffin runs around the catwalk for the door.

	Lee looks up and sees a ROPE AND PULLEY hanging over the abyss. He 
	leaps for the railing and dives out into space.

	He catches the rope and starts riding it to the other side of the 
	catwalk.

	Griffin sees him coming and fires on the run. He misses. Clicks. The 
	gun is empty.  He throws his gun and hits Lee in the HEAD with it. Lee 
	almost falls and then:

	WHAM! Lee runs right into Griffin. They crumple on the catwalk.

	INT.THE HALL

	Things are under the control of the FBI.

	Carter is holstering his gun when he hears Griffin's shot. And then a 
	second later, the gun smashes into the marble floor.

	He looks up and sees them fighting on the catwalk.

	INT. THE CATWALK

	Griffin tries to push a groggy Lee off him but he won't let go of his 
	legs. Griffin starts beating Lee over the head with the suitcase. It 
	POPS open and ten million dollars flutters out like confetti.

	Lee pushes through the money, stands up and grabs Griffin. Griffin 
	tries to get away and HITS THE SWITCH ON THE JACKET.

	They both stop and look at each other in panic. Then Griffin HEAD BUTTS 
	Lee. Lee starts to go down, but instead, he HEAD BUTTS Griffin back. 
	Griffin crumples.

	Lee holds him, wriggles out of the vest and PUTS IT ON GRIFFIN. Then he 
	looks down, tips them both over the railing and THEY FALL.

	WHACK! Lee grabs THE BOTTOM OF THE CATWALK as he goes by. 
	Unfortunately, Griffin woke up and is holding onto Lee's foot. Lee 
	kicks once. Twice. The third is a charm.

	Griffin falls backwards toward THE BUDDHA POOL. He falls and falls, all 
	the while looking back up at Lee.  He hits with a huge splash.

	CLOSE ON

	Griffin's face under water. He's still alive. KABOOM!

	INT. THE HALL

	A SHOWER OF WATER falls over the hall. Everybody gets wet.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MUSEUM -- LATER

	The FBI is escorting the bad guys out of the building. Sang is escorted 
	out by the CORONER.  Han approaches Lee. Extends his hand.

				HAN 
		I owe you everything.

				LEE
		 Only your friendship.

	 Lee looks around at all the BROKEN ART.

				LEE (cont'd)
		It is so sad. So much beauty ruined. 
		So much of our culture gone.

				HAN
		Yes. But...
			(pointing)
		Life goes on.

	He's pointing to Soon Young who is in the arms of her mother. Lee 
	smiles.

	ON CARTER

	He's standing next to Whitney at the top of the escalator. Both Carter 
	and Whitney are SOAKING WET from the water explosion.

	Whitney is just hanging up a cellular.

				WHITNEY
			(to Carter)
		He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a 
		bitch.

				CARTER
		Tell me about it.

				WHITNEY
		He was just doing his job.

				CARTER
		So was I.

				LEE VO
		And me too.

	Lee is standing behind Whitney. Whitney looks a little embarrassed now.

				WHITNEY
			(mumbling)
		And the FBI appreciates it.

	 Whitney walks away.

				CARTER
		Prick.

	Carter looks at Lee and points up to the ladder that leads to the 
	catwalk.

				CARTER (cont'd)
		You got circus blood in you?

				LEE
		Shortcut.

	Carter laughs and looks down the escalator.

	ON JOHNSON

	She's sitting on the last step. She's SOAKING WET too. Her hair and 
	dress are ruined. She looks depressed.

	Carter walks down to her.

				CARTER
		You OK?

				JOHNSON
		We saved the girl and got the bad 
		guys, didn't we?

				CARTER
		Yeah. So why you look do down?

				JOHNSON
		Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look 
		like shit.

				CARTER
		Not to me. Never to me.

	 Johnson stares at him for a long beat.

				JOHNSON
		How about a lift home?

				CARTER
		Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in 
		the front seat.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. 747 -- NIGHT

	Lee is seated, eyes closed, listening to MUSIC over his headphones.  
	Carter walks down the aisle and takes the seat next to him.

				CARTER 
		Yo, what's up?

	 Lee opens his eyes.  Smiles.

				LEE 
		What a surprise!

				CARTER 
		FBI calls up my ass, says they need 
		help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to 
		drop everything.

				LEE 
		It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country 
		asked for the best.  I told them that 
		was you.  Now I will show you around 
		my hood.  

				CARTER
		 No shark fin, no camel hump.
			(re: CD player)
		What you listenin' to?

				LEE 
		Oh, I think you like this very much.

	Carter puts on the head phones.  We HEAR the first few bars of HELP ME 
	RHONDA.  Carter's face freezes.

	THE 747 -- CONTINUOUS

	glides toward Hong Kong to the All-American music of the Beach Boys.

	FADE OUT:
