</p><p><p ID="act">CU: A MODERN-LOOKING CHRISTMAS BOOK ENTITLED: ELF
</p><p><p ID="act">A Christmas book entitled "ELF" sits on a table, a drawing of 6'2" BUDDY THE ELF (the guy we've seen from all the trailers and posters) is on the cover.
</p><p><p ID="act">We push in on the book and it magically flips open to the first page: a drawing of small Papa Elf in his wonderful work shop.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - NORTH POLE - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">PULL OUT FROM THE BOOK TO REVEAL
</p><p><p ID="act">The real life Elf and Workshop of the drawing we have just seen.  PAPA ELF, 540 years old or roughly 55 in human years, is surrounded by scores of strange and specific tools and some scattered half-built toys.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">So you're here for the story?  Okay.  Just let me wet my whistle.
</p><p><p ID="act">He pours himself a shot of milk in a snow-flake shot glass and downs it.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="spkdir">(like it's liquor)
<P ID="dia">Whoo!  That's strong!  Must be two percent!  Elves love to tell stories, you probably didn't know that, did you?  Well, there's a lot of things about us that people don't know.  For instance, we can't tell a lie.  It's physiologically impossible.  Here's another interesting Elf-ism: There are three jobs available to an Elf.  You can make shoes at night while an old cobbler sleeps...but it's not exactly the most rewarding work.
</p><p><P ID="right">QUICK CUT AWAY TO
</p><p><p ID="act">Two ELVES hammering away at a pile of shoes as a fat shoemaker sleeps with a copy of "Hot Cobbler" magazine on his chest, a busty cobbler lady on the cover.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DISGRUNTLED COBBLER ELF
<P ID="dia">Lazy bastard couldn't even make a flip-flop...
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. ELF TREE - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">The exterior of a tree, we hear cooking going on inside.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">...you can bake cookies in a tree.  But it's dangerous having an oven in an oak during dry season...
</p><p><p ID="act">We hear a yelp and now a siren rings and then the TREE BURSTS INTO FLAMES, ELVES SCURRYING OUT.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">But the third job.  Well, the third job makes being an Elf worthwhile.  Some call it "the show" or the "big dance".  It's the profession every Elf aspires to.  And that's to build toys in Santa's workshop.
</p><p><P ID="right">CUT TO:
</p><p><p ID="act">A TRACKING SHOT OF SANTA'S WORKSHOP
</p><p><p ID="act">The CAMERA whips by a crowd of bustling elves building dolls, toy horses, action figures, squirt guns...everything.  There's even a row of X-boxes being assembled.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">It's a job only an Elf can do.  Our nimble fingers, natural cheer and active minds are perfect for toy building.  They've tried using Gnomes or Trolls but the Gnomes drank too much and the Trolls weren't toilet trained.
</p><p><P ID="right">CUT AWAY:
</p><p><p ID="act">1) A drunk GNOME, stein in hand, vomiting below the table.  2) A TROLL wearing a diaper is chewed out by an Elf cleaning up the floor.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">And no human could ever do this work.  Their hands are too big and they tend to get testy when over worked.  In fact, no human has ever set foot in Santa's workshop.  That is until about thirty years ago.  And in case you haven't guessed it, that's our story.  It was back in 1968.  A particularly successful Christmas...
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">A Christmas tree flickers.  A nurse changes a giggling ten month-old BABY's diaper.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NURSE
<P ID="dia">You're quite a giggler, aren't you?
<P ID="spkdir">(lying him down)
<P ID="dia">Well, it's time for night-night.
</p><p><p ID="act">She tucks the baby in and exits.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">NURSE
<P ID="spkdir">(as she leaves)
<P ID="dia">Merry Christmas, my angel.
</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSE ON
</p><p><p ID="act">The Rocking Crib.  The BABY rises, giggling.  His eyes light up as he stands, holding the gate of the crib.
</p><p><p ID="act">Santa's black boots drop in from the chimney.  The baby shakes the gate.  Quickly, Santa moves to the Christmas tree, where he lays out presents.  There is an OFF-SCREEN CLANG!  Santa LOOKS UP and sees the empty crib.  The gate is down:
</p><p><p ID="act">BABY'S POV
</p><p><p ID="act">He gleefully skitters across the floor towards a large, fuzzy teddy bear in SANTA'S BIG RED BAG.
</p><p><p ID="act">FADE TO:
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP
</p><p><p ID="act">A bevy of ELVES with slightly larger 60's Elf collars and sideburns celebrate another successful Christmas.  Several elves start CHANTING for a speech.  SANTA, seated in his rocker, stands to applause.  Merrily, he gestures for quiet.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SANTA
<P ID="dia">Alright, alright...Well, we've had another successful year.  Prancer was able to control his bladder over Baltimore, and we didn't forget Delaware...
</p><p><p ID="act">A party HORN blows.  LAUGHTER.  Santa cheerfully pats down with his hands for quiet.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SANTA
<P ID="dia">And now after a lot of hard work it's time for a vacation, starting now!
</p><p><p ID="act">Santa looks at his watch as five seconds click off.  The elves all rest their heads on their elbows.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SANTA
<P ID="dia">Alright!  Vacation's over!  Back to work!  Time to start preparations for next Christmas.
</p><p><p ID="act">The elves cheer and get back to work.  When an OFF-SCREEN COOING is heard.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SANTA
<P ID="dia">What in the name of Sam Hill...?
</p><p><p ID="act">More COOING.  Perplexed, Santa looks down to his bag just as a human baby, dressed only in a diaper, crawls out and smiles.
</p><p><p ID="act">Silence.  The elves stare in awe at the strange visitor.  An ELF looks on the back of his diaper and sees the brand name "Little Buddy Diapers".
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF TWIN #2
<P ID="dia">It's name is Buddy.  He must've...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF TWIN #1
<P ID="dia">...snuck into your sack at the orphanage.  What do we do, Santa?
</p><p><p ID="act">Santa looks befuddled.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Santa had a decision to make.  But fortunately when it comes to babies, Santa's a push over.  So Buddy would stay with an older Elf who had always wanted a child, but had been so committed to building toys, he had forgotten to settle down.  Yes, Buddy was raised by me, his adopted father.  My, how I love that boy.
</p><p><p ID="act">MONTAGE: BUDDY GROWING UP AS AN ELF
</p><p><p ID="act">A giant baby is wedged into an extra-tiny crib.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Tough Buddy grew twice as fast, he wasn't any different from the other little elves.  I mean, not really...
</p><p><p ID="act">Video Footage: of 7-year old Buddy riding a really small tricycle around in circles at a birthday party with a laughing Elf child on his back and another Elf under his arm.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">And though it is against the Code of Elves to lie, all agreed that until Buddy asked us, no one was going to bring up the fact that he was actually a human being.
</p><p><p ID="act">A series of Polaroid photos showing Buddy, 12, dunking a basketball over three elves.
</p><p><p ID="act">Buddy in Elf school, wedged in a tiny desk.  The ELF TEACHER is pointing to the black board where "THE CODE OF ELVES" is written.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF TEACHER
<P ID="dia">And before we learn how to build the latest in extreme graphic chipset processors, let's recite the Code of the Elves, shall we?  Number one?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF TEACHER
<P ID="dia">Number two?

<P ID="dia">THERE'S ROOM FOR EVERYONE ON THE NICE LIST!
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF TEACHER
<P ID="dia">Number three?
</p><p><p ID="act">We push in on Buddy as he recites...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY & EVERYONE
<P ID="dia">THE BEST WAY TO SPREAD CHRISTMAS CHEER IS SINGING LOUD FOR ALL TO HEAR!

<P ID="dia">Lum Lum across the line, feeds it to Foom Foom, behind the net, looking, feeds Blinky...Wait!  Rimpo-correction, Wombo.  I think...and - uh-oh! - here comes BUDDY!
</p><p><p ID="act">QUICK CUTS
</p><p><p ID="act">A smiling Buddy pounds tiny elves into the boards with brute force.  The elves are helpless.  Buddy finishes this off with a wicked slap-shot.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ANNOUNCER
<P ID="spkdir">(like an elf Pat Foley)
<P ID="dia">He SCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORES!  And it's 14-zero with eleven minutes left in the first period.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ELF LOCKER ROOM - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">Post game, Buddy's in the locker room.  Elves congratulate him and occasionally reach up to slap him on the butt.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">POM POM
<P ID="dia">Good game, Buddy.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">Thanks!  Sorry about your shoulder, Pom Pom!
</p><p><P ID="speaker">POM POM
<P ID="dia">No sweat.  It's just a collar bone!
</p><p><p ID="act">They're all tossing their jock straps in the bin.  Little Elf jocks land, and then a HUGE ONE, proportionately the size of a large serving tray.  It's Buddy's.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">But as much as Buddy was accepted by his friends and family, there were drawbacks to being a human in an elves' world.
</p><p><p ID="act">RAPID FIRE:
</p><p><p ID="act">A dozen shots of Buddy slamming his face into doorways, beams, cabinets.  These shots look shockingly painful.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">Ow...jeez...yikes...golly...charles dickens!  Sone of a nutcracker!
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">The FINALE: Buddy attempts to put a star on top of the semi-tall Elf Christmas tree.
</p><p><p ID="act">But Buddy's pointy Elf slipper gets hung up in an ornament.
</p><p><p ID="act">The elves step back, preparing for the inevitable: Buddy panics, wiggles his leg and pulls the tree over on top of him, falling into the fire place and engulfing in flames.
</p><p><p ID="act">Pom Pom sprays him with a mini-fire extinguisher.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">And no where were Buddy's differences more obvious than in Santa's toy shop.
</p><p><P ID="right">DISSOLVE TO:
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - NORTH POLE - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">We see an assembly line of elves making Etch-a-sketches with wooden hammers.  We pan finally to Buddy as an ELF SUPERVISOR APPROACHES.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">Gee, I'm sorry, Ming-Ming.  I'm gonna come in a little short on my quota today.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF SUPERVISOR
<P ID="dia">It's okay, Buddy.  How many Etcha-Sketches did you get finished?
</p><p><p ID="act">Buddy is about to answer.  But then his face winces up.  FIGHTING BACK TEARS.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF SUPERVISOR
<P ID="dia">How many, Buddy?  It's okay, you can tell me.
</p><p><p ID="act">Clearly tearing up now, Buddy sets his tiny wooden hammer to the side and reveals a box of his toys.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">I only made...
<P ID="spkdir">(crying)
<P ID="dia">Eighty-five.
</p><p><p ID="act">Eighty-five?  He might as well have said zero.  The elves all look at each other.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF SUPERVISOR
<P ID="dia">Oh, don't worry about it Buddy.  This is a great start!  You're only 915 off pace.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">Oh, why don't you just say it Ming Ming?!  I'm the worst toy maker in the whole world!  I'm a cotton-head ninny-muggins!
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF SUPERVISOR
<P ID="dia">Oh, you're not a cotton-head ninny muggins!  We all have different talents, that's all.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">Actually, it seems like everyone has the same talents.  Except for me.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF SUPERVISOR
<P ID="dia">That's not true, you have lots of talents.  Special talents.  Like, uh...
</p><p><p ID="act">Supervisor Elf looks around to the other Elves for back up.  They try to chime in.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF #1
<P ID="dia">You changed the batteries in the fire alarm!
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF #2
<P ID="spkdir">(absurdly positive)
<P ID="dia">You sure did!  Triple A's!  And in six months, you'll need to check 'em again!  Won't he!
<P ID="spkdir">(everyone agrees)
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF #3
<P ID="dia">And you're the only baritone in the Elf choir.  Without you, we'd sound like a bunch of...I mean, you bring us down a whole octave!
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF #1
<P ID="dia">In a good way!
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ELF SUPERVISOR
<P ID="dia">See?  You're not a cotton-head ninny muggins.  You're Ex-traordinary!
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">Well, you know what?  I'm sick of being extraordinary!
</p><p><p ID="act">Upset, Buddy struggles to get his thighs out from under his desk, and now runs off, tagging his head on the door frame.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. PAPA'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
</p><p><p ID="act">Buddy storms into his tiny house.  Papa Elf looks up from his work, surprised.  Buddy can't speak.  He runs over and locks himself in the bathroom.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ELF BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
</p><p><p ID="act">This bathroom is ABSURDLY SMALL, Buddy squeezes in like Harry Houdini.  The toilet is the size of a Big Gulp cup.  Buddy sits on it and starts to sob.  Washing his face in the tiny sink.
</p><p><p ID="act">KNOCK KNOCK.
</p><p><p ID="act">We INTERCUT with Papa Elf at the door.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">Son?  Are you okay?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">Go away!

<P ID="dia">Buddy!
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">I'm sorry, papa.  May I please have some Buddy time?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">Open up, son.  I think we need to talk.
</p><p><p ID="act">The door finally creeks open, revealing a funny wide shot of him squeezed into this box of a room.  He wiggles out.  Still wiggling.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">Come sit with your papa.
</p><p><p ID="act">Papa sits on the couch, Buddy sits on Papa Elf's knee.  Papa winces.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">Alright, let's hear it.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">Well, everyone knows you're Santa's Master Tinker.  And Grandpapa was Master Tinker before you.  And great Grandpapa before ye.  I'm supposed to follow in your footsteps...but I'm always letting everyone down.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">Well, there's something I should probably tell you, Buddy.  And it's long over due...
<P ID="spkdir">(intense beat)
<P ID="dia">You see...um...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">What is it, Papa?
</p><p><p ID="act">Papa Elf looks into Buddy's beautifully innocent eyes.  He can't bring himself to do it.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="spkdir">(changing the subject)
<P ID="dia">I need your help on something.
<P ID="spkdir">(adjusting Buddy's weight)
<P ID="dia">Up up now, nice and -- ow, OW!... There we are.
</p><p><p ID="act">Papa Elf leads Buddy through a door to reveal the most amazing sight Buddy has ever beheld.
</p><p><p ID="act">SANTA'S SLEIGH
</p><p><p ID="act">A GLOW emanates from the hand-rubbed, red-lacquered wood chassis, illuminating the entire room.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">Wow.  Santa's sleigh!
<P ID="spkdir">(hesitates)
<P ID="dia">Can I touch it?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">Touch it?  You're going to help me make it fly, Buddy.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">I thought the magical reindeer made the sleigh fly.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">And where do the reindeers get their magic from?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">Christmas spirit.  Everyone knows that.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">Yes, but unfortunately, Christmas Spirit is becoming a very limited resource.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">What do you mean?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="spkdir">(hard to break the news)
<P ID="dia">Well, Buddy, as silly as it sounds, there are a lot of people down South who don't believe in Santa Claus.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="spkdir">(shocked)
<P ID="dia">What?  Who do they think puts all their toys under the tree?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">There's a rumor floating around that parents are putting them there.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">That's ridiculous!  There's no way parents could do that all in one night!  And what about Santa's cookies!?  I suppose parents eat them too?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">I know...but every year less and less people are believing in Santa, and today we've got a real energy crisis on our hands.  See how low the Claus-o-meter is?
</p><p><p ID="act">We see a gauge on the instrument panel of the sleigh with CHRISTMAS SPIRIT LEVELS written and a needle resting in the DANGEROUSLY LOW red section.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">That's why I installed this little baby back in the sixties.
</p><p><p ID="act">Papa pushes a RED BUTTON, causing a JET ENGINE to shudder with a high-pitched whir.  Buddy is amazed.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">Oh my Gosh!
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">Watch the language son.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">Forgive me, Papa.  What's that?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF
<P ID="dia">A Viper turbojet with 358 cubic meters of displacement, high volume air intake and customized spark timing.
<P ID="spkdir">(off Buddy's look)
<P ID="dia">I know, it's a little less magical, but everyone's still getting their wish, that's the important thing, right?
<P ID="spkdir">(around him)
<P ID="dia">Listen, the motor mounts are giving me some wiggle.  Do you want to give the ol' man a hand?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="spkdir">(coming around)
<P ID="dia">Do I?!

<P ID="dia">Michael!  Please, I have a terrible voice.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">MICHAEL
<P ID="dia">Dad!!!
</p><p><p ID="act">Then, in spite of himself, WALTER BELTS OUT THE CHORUS in such an awful voice, it draws looks from the singers around him.  As the bad notes rise into the chilly night air...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">WALTER
<P ID="spkdir">(terrible)
<P ID="dia">Santa Claus is coming to town!
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. THE MOVING SLEIGH - CONTINUOUS
</p><p><p ID="act">Walter's singing somehow does the trick.  The CLAUS-O-METER shoots to the MAX!
</p><p><p ID="act">A dash light BLINKS "HO HO HO" as the gauge hits the red zone.  Santa howls in approval.  The SLEIGH flies up into the night air and over the barricade, reporters and on-lookers.  The rangers slide to a stop, foiled at last.
</p><p><p ID="act">As the shadow of the sleigh zips high over them, the whole crowd joins in, singing their hearts out.  Jovie can't believe it.  She sings even stronger.
</p><p><p ID="act">A VOICE BOOMS OUT from a mysterious silhouette into the magical winter night...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SANTA
<P ID="dia">Ho, ho, ho.  Merry Christmas!
</p><p><p ID="act">Santa's sleigh whips down Sixth Ave. and into the Manhattan night sky.  And silhouettes against the moon.
</p><p><p ID="act">FREEZE FRAME
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">And so, with a little help, Buddy managed to save Christmas.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - CHRISTMAS DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">Walter, Michael, Buddy, Emily and Jovie sit happily gathered around their Christmas tree.  Wrapping paper everywhere.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">And his spirit saved a lot of other people, too.  It was quite a Christmas, and quite a New Year.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. WALTER'S NEW COMPANY - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">Walter is stenciling the name 'HOBB'S PUBLISHING'.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Walter started his own independent publishing company.  His first book was written by a brand new critically acclaimed children's author...
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. GIMBELS - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">The 'ELF' book from the beginning of the movie is Buddy's.  He's doing a book signing.  The place is packed.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">The book was called 'Elf'.  A fictional story about an adopted Elf named Buddy who was raised in the North Pole.  Went to New York, ate spaghetti, worked in a shiny mail room and eventually saved Christmas.
</p><p><p ID="act">Buddy and Walter ice skate together at Rockefeller Center in the middle of the night.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">And every year, on Christmas day, after all the presents are opened by children around the world, Buddy and his Dad make up for lost time...
</p><p><p ID="act">Buddy still tries to hold his hand.  Walter slaps it away.
</p><p><p ID="act">INSERT
</p><p><p ID="act">We see an Elfish hand applying white out to Walter's name on the List.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Walter even made the jump from 'naughty' to 'nice'.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. PAPA'S WORKSHOP - DAY
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PAPA ELF (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">And, as for me, I can't complain.  Buddy comes up to visit from time to time.
</p><p><p ID="act">RAPID FIRE FINALE OF BUDDY SLAMMING HIS HEAD INTO DOORWAYS, BEAMS AND CABINETS.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BUDDY
<P ID="dia">Ow!  Yikes!  Golly!  Charles Dickens!  Sone of a Gnome!  Fiddlesticks!  Snow Flickers!
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">Jovie, in real Elf clothes, sets a pitcher of milk in front of Papa Elf.  She sits beside Buddy who cradles a NEWBORN BABY in his arms wearing a pink Elf hat that says SUSIE.
</p><p><p ID="act">This is the last image of the movie and also the last image of the book.  It freezes and now becomes a drawing and we pull out to see it's the last page of Buddy's ELF book, which magically flips closed.
</p><p><p ID="act">We're back in the bookstore from the very first scene.  A little kid grabs the book out of the window.
</p><p><p ID="act">FADE TO BLACK.
