<blockquote>

FADE IN:

DEEP SPACE

Stars blaze against the blackness of deep space.  One star
begins to move, coming closer, moving toward...

EARTH, in space: blue seas, fleecy white clouds.  BEEP-BEEP-
BEEP: a retro-satellite, Sputnik, tumbles past.

Below, near New England, black storm clouds swirl in silence.
Flashes, LIGHTNING FLICKERS.

A SHIP ON A STORM-TOSSED SEA  -  NIGHT

The wind HOWLS, the storm RAGES in the chill waters off the
rocky coast of Maine.  Giant waves tower overhead, then CRASH
over the decks of a fishing ship where desperate FISHERMEN
fight to stay alive.  The CAPTAIN YELLS orders no one can
hear in the deafening ROAR.

INT.  SHIP'S MAIN CABIN  -  NIGHT

The FIRST MATE yells into the radio, their only hope:

                    FIRST MATE
          Mayday! Mayday! This is fishing ship
          "Annabelle"! We're floundering and taking
          on water! Mayday! Mayday!

An enormous WAVE smashes against the bow of the ship,
throwing everyone in the cabin off balance. A glass shatters.

The Captain enters, the two lock eyes: it looks bad.

                    CAPTAIN
          What's our position?

                    SAILOR #1
               (grim)
          I don't know.

                    CAPTAIN
          If you don't know where we are then you
          don't know where we're going!! You could
          be running us right into the rocks!!

Then: a VOICE breaks through the static on the radio.

                    RADIO
          Coast Guard Portland Station to
          Annabelle: Do you read me?

As the mate starts to answer, lightning STRIKES the huge
mast. It CRASHES through the pilothouse window, SMASHING the
radio.  Glass, radio parts FLY.

The Captain's shoulders slump: now they're done for.

ON THE DECK  -  NIGHT

The Captain comes out on deck: his men stare at him, eyes
full of fear, desperation.  Then, impossibly... the WINDS
TRAIL OFF.  In seconds, the sea flattens into a sheet of
glass.  All is DEAD CALM.  It's eerie.  Ropes CREAK.

The men ERUPT in celebration, CHEERING, hugging each other:
it's over!  The angry Captain YELLS:

                    CAPTAIN
          It's not over, you idiots!  It's just the
          eye of the storm!

The men look around: far off on the horizon, the raging storm
still surrounds the ship... but overhead, stars appear.  It's
eerie, strange.

                    FISHERMAN
          <u>Look</u>!

Overhead, a new, brilliant star appears... and it's quickly
growing larger.  The blazing light speeds toward the startled
sailors, impossibly fast, intensely bright, blinding, all
goes white...

KAWHOOSH! The light CRASHES into the sea.  Water flies, the
sea BOILS, CHURNING, ROARING, the water green-lit from below.
Great clouds of steam BILLOW and HISS.

Then, without warning, the raging storm ROARS back with a
vengeance, a huge wave SLAMS into the ship.  Again the
fishermen fight for their lives.

But then a dim light appears, far off in the rain: a barely
visible beam sweeps back and forth in the storm.

                    CAPTAIN
          The lighthouse!  Head for it!

The desperate men struggle to steer their limping ship toward
the light.  Then, CLANG!  The ship shudders, stops instantly:
the ship has SLAMMED into... a wall!  A solid wall, a wall
made of... iron?

The sailors freeze, speechless: they look up the wall, up,
up... flashes of lightning illuminate: a face!  Twin beams of
light comes from what look to be... <u>eyes</u>, in an <u>enormous</u>
face.  A <u>giant</u>?!  Made of <u>metal</u>!

THUNDER BOOMS.  The impossible face seems to turn downward...
and <u>looks</u> at the men.  The men quake.

A HUGE WAVE CRASHES over the ship and throws the men
overboard, into the sea.  The ship begins sinking fast.

IN THE WATER, NEAR THE CLIFFS  -  NIGHT

Men surface, cling to ship debris.  Two men in a lifeboat
pull their comrades from the chill waters.

A wave WASHES over rocks, leaves behind a limp fisherman,
clinging to the rocks.  Barely alive, whipped by wind and
rain, he sees lightning-brief glimpses of the giant <u>thing</u> as
it moves off in the HOWLING storm and dissapears.

The VIEW MOVES up, up the rocky cliff to the lighthouse
perched atop the cliff.  The brilliant beam tries in vain to
penetrate the RAGING storm...

EXT. HOGARTH'S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

We push through the storm towards an upstairs window, and into...

INT. HOGARTH'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A flashlight beam illustrates the STORM SMASHING against a window.



A WIDE-EYED NINE-YEAR-OLD BOY, HOGARTH, GRIPS THE FLASHLIGHT.



AS THE STORM RAGES, HOGARTH EXPLORES HIS ROOM BY FLASHLIGHT.
THE MOVING BEAM GIVES LIFE TO THE ROOM FULL OF TOYS AND
MEMORABILIA, THE WINDS HOWL GROWS LOUDER.

GLASS SHATTERS and a cold wind whips into the room.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Hogarth....?!!

The door flies open and Hogarth's mother ANNIE is there.
Late twenties, attractive.

                    ANNIE
          Are you alright, honey?

                    HOGARTH
          Yeah, Mom, I'm okay...

Annie turns to the shattered window pane, then pushes
Hogarth's bookshelf in front of it to block the wind. Hogarth
stares at his monther. She looks spooked.

                    HOGARTH
          ... are you?

                    ANNIE
          I hate when the power goes out.  But...
          yes, I'm fine.

Outside, the wind howls.

                    HOGARTH
          Wanna stay up with me for a while?
               (coaxing)
          I could tell you a story...

Annie smiles, touched.

                    ANNIE
          A story, huh?  What have you got for me
          this time?

                    HOGARTH
          Well, it's a story about...

Hogarth scans the toys and souvenirs on his bedside table.
With a sudden flash of inspiration, he grabs a baseball card.

                    HOGARTH
          Mickey Mantle.  He had a magic bat, Mom.
          Everybody says so.

As Annie watches Hogarth with motherly adoration, Hogarth
picks up a plastic dinosaur.

                    HOGARTH
          Anyway, this is the story of Mickey's
          adventures with the stegosaurus.  It's
          got action and romance.  And the best
          part is, it's all true.

Annie laughs and touches a fingertip on Hogarth's forehead.

                    ANNIE
          You've got a lot going on in there, don't
          you, Hogarth?
               (wistfully)
          Just like your father...

For a moment Hogarth beams.  He looks over at a framed photo
that sits on his nightstand, that shows a handsome man
dressed in an army uniform.  And as he stares at the photo, a
sad, pensive look comes over Hogarth's face.  Annie sees it.

                    HOGARTH
          I can't wait 'til he comes back.

                    ANNIE
               (gently)
          We've been through this before, honey...

                    HOGARTH
          They found his plane, mom. They didn't
          find <u>him</u>. He's gonna come back.

Annie sees the resolute look in her son's eyes and decides to
change tack.

                    ANNIE
          So what could he do with that magic bat
          of his?

                    HOGARTH
               (lost in thought)
          Huh?

                    ANNIE
          Mickey Mantle.  Could he cast spells with
          it, like a magician?

                    HOGARTH
          Oh...
               (brightening)
          Yeah. Yeah that's <u>exactly</u> what he could
          do. And that's why he was known as the
          Wizard of Sherwood Forest.

                    ANNIE
               (amused)
          Sherwood Forest, huh?

                    HOGARTH
          Right.  And then one day, this
          Stegosaurus shows up. And he says--
               (deep voice)
          "Who thinks he is mightier than me, the
          mighty thunder lizard?"

                    ANNIE
          And this is all true, now?

                    HOGARTH
          Every word, Mom -- I wouldn't make this
          up.  So Mickey says, "I'm the two time
          American League batting champ.  I was MVP
          of the All-Star game three times running.
          I go anywhere I please in this forest..."

We DRIFT BACK from mother and son, hunkered down in a pool of
warm flashlight, surrounded by darkness...

EXT. ROCKWELL - THE NEXT MORNING

The sun has risen on a beautiful Maine morning.

The camera starts HIGH in a tall tree, where a bird is
repairing its storm-damaged nest, and pans down from this
literal bird's-eye view to the streets of Rockwell, where
stoic New Englanders are doing repairs of their own.

Down the middle of the street comes Hogarth, on a bike. In
the wire bike-basket in front of him is a shoebox with holes
punched in the lid.

A couple of LOCALS are clearing a felled tree. We hear their
conversation as they drift across the screen in Hogarth's
travelling POV.

                    FIRST LOCAL
          Strangest storm I ever seen. Swept away
          my best iron wheelbarrow. But left the
          handles behind...

Now Hogarth passes a pair of WOMEN who gossip as they rake up
leaves and branches.

                    FIRST WOMAN
          My husband spoke to one of those
          fishermen this morning.  Fellow wouldn't
          talk about the shipwreck at all. Said
          we'd all think he was mad.

                    SECOND WOMAN
          Now what do you think he meant by that?

                    FIRST WOMAN
          Well, I'm sure I don't know.
               (lowers her voice)
          But it wouldn't surprise me if the
          communists are involved.

EXT.  THE "CHAT `N´ CHEW" DINER  -  DAY

The "Chat `n´ Chew" diner sits near the docks and the town
square: the center of all social life in the village.
Hogarth arrives, at last, and parks his bike. He takes the
shoebox out of his bike basket, opens it a little and speaks
to whatever is inside.

                    HOGARTH
          Remember -- be charming.

INT.  DINER  -  DAY

The diner is packed.  EVERYBODY is here--FARMERS, FISHERMEN --
all swapping storm-stories.  It's LOUD.  And there's no empty
table, no place to sit.

Hogarth enters and looks around.  He spots Annie, now dressed
as a waitress and serving coffee from behind the counter.
Hogarth puts on a big smile and waves at her.

                    HOGARTH
          Hey, Mom! You won't believe our good
          luck! Look what I found...

He makes his way through the coffee shop to the counter.  As
he passes by, various local ladies -- THE BUSYBODIES -- look
up from their breakfasts, mouths downcast and eyes half-
lidded -- ever ready to cast judgement, should the precious
opportunity arise.

Hogarth arrives at the counter opens the shoebox for Annie. A
baby squirrel pokes its head out.  Annie rolls her eyes.

                    HOGARTH
          His tree musta gotten knocked down in the
          storm! Can I keep him?

                    ANNIE
          Hogarth, we've been through this.  No
          pets...

                    HOGARTH
          But he's not a pet, Mom.  He's a <u>friend</u>.
          You're always saying I should have more
          friends come over, right?  Well now I've
          got one.
               (selling it)
          You gotta admit I'm making sense here.

                    ANNIE
          Hogarth, if there's one thing we've
          learned from your many pets, it's that
          claws and furniture do not mix.

                    HOGARTH
          I know but--

                    ANNIE
          No "buts."  We have got to rent a room
          this year if we're going to make ends
          meet...

Nearby a Busybody perks up her ears, elbows her neighbor, and
raises her eyebrows significantly.

                    ANNIE (cont'd)
          ...and no one wants to live in a place
          with shredded upholstery.

                    HOGARTH
          You'll never know he's there.  I'll keep
          him in a cage--

                    ANNIE
          -until you feel sorry for him and "set
          him free" in the house. Remember the
          raccoon, Hogarth?  God, I remember the
          raccoon...

                    HOGARTH
          Please, mom.  At least look at him...

                    ANNIE
               (softening)
          Alright, where is this guy...?

Hogarth grins and reaches down for his box... then notices
there's nothing inside it. The squirrel has escaped.  Hogarth
looks back at Annie, hiding his desperation.

                    HOGARTH
          I... will go get him... okay?

Hogarth turns, his eyes darting around frantically. Finally
he spies a FURRY TAIL disappearing under a four-person table
with a single occupant, hidden behind a newspaper.

                    HOGARTH
          Excuse me...?  <u>Excuse</u> me...

No response.  Behind the paper, smoke rises.

                    HOGARTH
          <u>Sir</u>?

Still no response.  Hogarth is getting exasperated.

                    HOGARTH
          Sir...? Sir? Sir! EXCUSE ME, S--

Hogarth STOPS with sudden realization. He slowly pushes down
the top of the paper, revealing that the person he's talking
to ...

...is ASLEEP. A lit cigarette with an impossibly long ash
dangles precariously from his lips.  This is DEAN McCOPPEN.
35, sporting sunglasses, handsome in a rumpled sort of way.
Unshaved, uncombed, unusual. A beatnik. Here. Hogarth's heard
of them, but this is the first one he's seen up close. The
beatnik's head lolls...

...and his cigarette drops in his lap. He WAKES.

                    DEAN
          I was snoring, right? Sorry, man.  I'm
          just not a morning person...

                    HOGARTH
          Please don't move, sir. My pet's under
          your table--don't look--if you make a
          scene my mom won't let me keep him.

                    DEAN
          Don't worry sonny, I'm cool as a cucumb-
               (SHRIEK OF PAIN)

He LEAPS up, HOLLERING, SLAPPING at his smoking pants.

ON ANNIE

as she turns to watch the COMMOTION from across the room. The
busybodies are all abuzz.  Who is the weird guy with Hogarth?

RESUME DEAN &amp; HOGARTH

as Dean finally gets under control. He looks around. The
whole joint is staring at him. He picks up his cigarette butt
and holds it as he addresses the other diners.

                    DEAN
          Had a little cigarette mishap. It's under
          control. Show's over. Cool yourselves and
          resume breakfasting, people.
               (sitting, to Hogarth)
          What kind of pet, kid?

                    HOGARTH
          A squirrel.  Don't worry, he's friendly.

                    ANNIE
          Is my son bothering you, sir?

Dean stares at Annie, smiling strangely.

                    DEAN
          Yes.  No.  Call me Dean.

As Dean and Annie size each other up, the three Busybodies
whisper cattily back and forth.

                    FIRST BUSYBODY
          Oh! I don't know why they let such people
          in here.

                    SECOND BUSYBODY
          She ought to ignore him.

                    THIRD BUSYBODY
          You forget how single she is, dear.

The busybodies exchange smug, catty grins.

EXT. ROCKWELL STREET - DAY

The camera is very low, as an official-looking car pulls up,
and comes to a stop in front of us, its front grille filling
the screen. The words "U.S. GOVERNMENT" are printed boldly
across the top of the license plate.

THE CAMERA PULLS OUT

And the driver's side car door opens.  A well dressed man in
his mid-thirties, KENT MANSLEY, steps out, puffs on his pipe
and surveys his surroundings with a steely-eyed, square-jawed
gaze.

Now a troubled look comes over him, as he notices the US
COVERNMENT decal on his car door is peeling off. He presses
it flat -- it curls up again. He presses it flat -- it curls.
He licks his fingers, rubs it on the decal and presses it
hard -- and it holds. Kent's look of confidence returns. He
slams the car door with authority; one side of the license
plate unhinges and hangs at an angle. Kent sighs with defeat,
and walks away.

INT. DINER - DAY

Annie speaks gently to Hogarth.

                    ANNIE
          Hogarth.  I thought you were getting your
          pet, honey.

                    HOGARTH
          I will, mom.  After I finish talking to-

                    DEAN
               (still smiling strangely)
          Dean.

                    HOGARTH (CONT'D)
          --Dean.

Annie shrugs, exits.  Hogarth looks at Dean curiously.

                    DEAN
          I found your pet.

                    HOGARTH
          Where?

                    DEAN
               (maintaining clenched smile)
          Up my leg, man.  Squirrel's in my pants,
          Hogarth.  I'm tryin' not to wig out here.

                    HOGARTH
          Don't wig out.

                    DEAN
               (quietly, skin crawling)
          Okay... he's heading north.  (finally)
          I'm sorry, kid...

Dean stands spastically, again addresses the room.

                    DEAN
          I'd like to apologize to everyone in
          advance for this.

He unzips his fly and out pops the squirrel. There is a
collective GASP, then a series of shrieks as the squirrel
scampers around the diner.  Dean zips up and sits back down.

                    DEAN
          Check, please.

Annie GLARES at a sheepish Hogarth.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Kent now holds a clipboard, taking notes as he talks to an
OLD FARMER.  Nearby stands a tractor with a bite taken out of
it.

                    KENT
          And did you see any strange lights in the
          sky last night? Any saucer-shaped flying
          objects?

                    FARMER
          No...

                    KENT
          Were any of your live stock disoriented
          this morning?  Did your cows appear
          anxious or depressed?

                    FARMER
          No...
               (getting suspicious)
          ...who did you say you worked for again?

Kent puffs himself up a little bit.

                    KENT
          Frankly I'm not at liberty to reveal the
          particulars of the agency I work for.

He leans in confidentially.

                    KENT
          But between you and me, I represent the
          United States Government.  U.P.D.  The
          Unexplained Phenomena Department.

The Farmer also leans in confidentially.

                    FARMER
          C.I.A.?

                    KENT
          Huh?  Oh, uh... no.  Our scope is less
          limited than the CIA.  Unexplained
          Phenomena, my friend -- that could be
          anything.

                    FARMER
          You work out of the Pentagon, then?

                    KENT
          Well, sure, we work near the Pentagon,
          yes. You know Radcliffe Street?

                    FARMER
          No.

                    KENT
          Well, trust me, it's pretty much Pentagon
          adjacent.  And all that that implies.

                    FARMER
          So, what do you think got to my tractor?
          Something the commies built? Some kind of
          monster? Something from outer space?

Kent thinks for a moment, then deflates a little.

                    KENT
          No, it's probably something else.
               (sighs wearily)
          It's <u>always</u> something else.

He makes a note on his clipboard.  In the background, Dean
approaches and hooks up the tractor to his tow truck and
hauls it away.

INT. HOGARTH'S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

Hogarth comes home. The phone RINGS, and he picks it up.

                    HOGARTH
               (automatic, without
               inflection)
          Hello this is Hogarth Hughes speaking
          who's calling please.

                    ANNIE
          Hogarth, honey... I'm really sorry, but I
          need to work late tonight. There's some
          cold chicken in the ice box. You can have
          that and some carrots--

                    HOGARTH
          I'm already on it, Mom.

He pulls a box of twinkies from a cupboard.

                    ANNIE
          Good. I'll make it up to you, okay?

                    HOGARTH
          Okay.

                    ANNIE
          I love you honey.  And Hogarth? No scary
          movies, no late snacks, in bed by eight.
          Got it?

                    HOGARTH
          Got it.

							CUT TO:

THE CLOCK

is at 8:47... lit up by the ghostly flickering light of the
television. We hear CREEPY MUSIC filtered through the tinny
t.v. speaker. CAMERA DRIFTS to:

HOGARTH

... taking a TWINKIE from a package. He SHAKES up a can of
whipped cream, jams it into the flat side of the Twinkie,
INFLATING it with additional whipped cream. He CRAMS the
twinkie in into his mouth, never taking his eyes off the
screen.

INT.  HOGARTH'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM  -  NIGHT

Lit by the light of a black and white TV, Hogarth has moved
furniture and piled up cushions, making a TV watching
fortress.

There's a NOISE OUTSIDE.  Hogarth jumps.  Listens.  Must have
been the TV.

ON the TV, a scientist and his assistant are involved in some
kind of drama that includes a murderous brain.

ANOTHER NOISE OUTSIDE, louder this time.  Hogarth freezes:
<u>that</u> didn't come from the TV....

ROAR!  The TV screen goes white with DEAFENING STATIC.

                    HOGARTH
          No!  Not now!

He SMACKS the TV: no effect.  He cranks the big channel knob:
THUNK-THUNK-THUNK.  All channels are static.

                    HOGARTH
          Stupid antenna...!

Hogarth stares at the screen, gathers his nerve.  He hefts
his flashlight and warily heads upstairs.

EXT.  THE ROOF - A LOFT WINDOW  -  NIGHT

Hogarth peers out.  All quiet, just a WHISPER of wind.  He
crawls out onto the roof, his flashlight beam follows the
flat TV wire up the roof toward its peak... and stops: the
antenna is <u>gone</u>, literally <u>torn</u> off the roof!

                    HOGARTH
          Gone.

Now Hogarth pauses and cocks his head, listening. In the
distance he hears a heavy "BOOM."  And then another. He peers
off into the woods. In the distance he seems to see something
moving, just above the level of the trees. Something
enormous.

                    HOGARTH
          Whoa...

INT.  HOGARTH'S BEDROOM  -  NIGHT

Hogarth hurriedly equips himself: he tapes a flashlight onto
a toy BB-gun; puts on a football helmet.  Finally, he looks
in the mirror and salutes himself.

                    HOGARTH
          Hogarth Hughes. Ready for action.

EXT.  HOGARTH'S HOUSE  -  NIGHT

Hogarth hurries out, runs up to the first massive depression
in the grass.  Hogarth places his tiny foot beside the car-
size depression, and very nearly loses his nerve.

He takes a deep breath and hurries into the woods.

INT.  THE WOODS  -  NIGHT

A dark night, fog drifts through trees.  <u>Spooky</u>.  At the
forest's edge, Hogarth looks up, sees broken branches where
<u>something</u> entered the woods... something <u>big</u>.

Hogarth darts from bush to bush, follows the trail.

TIME DISSOLVE: Hogarth creeps on, the forest is now dense.
More and more, the tree-damage begins to take shape, a tall
tunnel formed by broken limbs, until...

Hogarth GASPS: the tunnel forms a perfect outline of a HUGE
man-shaped THING.  He SHIVERS, considers turning back... but
he <u>can't</u>.  He creeps on.

Hogarth hears a deep RHYTMIC HUMMING that VIBRATES the
ground.  It sounds strange... <u>alien</u>.  He creeps on.

EXT.  BUSHES NEAR THE POWER STATION  -  NIGHT

The HUMMING is LOUD.  Hogarth slowly parts bushes to see... a
power station: "DANGER - HIGH VOLTAGE".  Tall power lines
towers march through the woods.  SPARKS SNAP.

THUMP!  A giant metal foot SLAMS into the ground right in
front of Hogarth, he YELPS.  THUMP!  THUMP!  THUMP!  Two huge
feet become two huge legs.  Hogarth looks up, up...

A <u>GIANT</u>.  Made of metal!  Forty feet tall, maybe fifty!
Hogarth can't believe his eyes...

The giant stares at the metal towers, makes a METALLIC GRUNT
that sounds... hungry.  It reaches out and SNAPS off a thick
piece of metal, pops it in his mouth, CHEWS NOISILY, and
SWALLOWS.  BURP.  Mmmm good!

                    HOGARTH
          Wow... it <u>eats</u> metal.  <u>Cool</u>.

Hogarth sits, hidden in the bushes, and watches, fascinated,
as the giant "grazes" the metal towers.  SPARKS fly from now-
loose flailing powerlines.

The giant's eaten all the tower arms: he TUGS at a solid
metal base: it's stuck.  So the giant bends down to EAT his
way down the tall metal tower: CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP.

Hogarth realizes the giant is CHOMPING toward a mass of thick
power cables that HUMM and SPARK.

QUICK INTERCUTS:  EXT./INT. HOGARTH'S HOUSE AND POWER STATION
- NIGHT

Annie grabs a flashlight by the door, illuminates the living
room... what a mess!  And... no Hogarth.

KA-ZAPPP!  Electricity races up and down the giant's metal,
it jerks, flies backward, trailing SPARKING POWERLINES that
wrap around him as he stumbles into a tangle of more power-
lines: KA-ZAP!  It panics, flailing, SCREECHING, tries to
free itself, gets more entangled.

Annie searches through the house by flashlight, for her son,
becoming more and more frantic.

                    ANNIE
          Hogarth...? Hogarth!  HOGARTH!!

SPARKS SNAP AND FLY as the giant SHRIEKS in agony. A tower
totters and falls... smashing into the ground just as Hogarth
jumps clear.

Electricity arcs up and down the Giant's body.  The giant
ROARS, an AWFUL METAL SOUND, falls to its knees, eyes
SPARKING, SHORTING OUT.

Hogarth looks around, desperate: he's got to save him!  He
sees a panel: "EMERGENCY CUT-OFF SWITCH".  Hogarth runs
toward it, sparks raining all around him.  He grabs the
panel... locked.  He swings his BB-gun like a club: CRASH!
The gun breaks, the panel door pops open.  Hogarth grabs the
huge switch and throws all his weight against it.  CLUNK.
The SPARKS slowly die away.

EXT.  THE DEEP, DARK WOODS  -  NIGHT

The dazed giant, looks around, dizzy... he stands, sways,
easily SNAPS free of the wires holding him.  His eyes focus
down (<u>way</u> down) on Hogarth.  The boy and the Giant stare at
each other for a long time.  Now what?

                    ANNIE (O.S.)
          (CALLING) Hogarth!

Hogarth turns: down the hill, through the fog, he sees a
light floating through the trees.

                    HOGARTH
          Mom!


Hogarth runs down the hill towards the light... then stops,
turns back toward the giant....

...but back where the giant stood, seconds before, is now
only dangling SPARKLING power lines.  He's <u>gone</u>.

Hogarth stares: baffled.  Annie rushes up.

                    ANNIE
          <u>Hogarth</u>!

She grabs him by his shoulders, tightly, more out of fear
than anger.

                    ANNIE (cont'd)
          What do you think you're doing?!! Don't
          you know better than to wander off at
          night, alone?? What if something happened
          to you???

                    HOGARTH
          I'm sorry, mom...

Annie throws her arms around him, hugging him tight,
desperately happy to know that her boy is safe.

                    ANNIE
          Don't ever do that to me again, Hogarth.
          I was so scared, I thought I'd lost
          you...

A long moment passes with Annie just holding him and
rocking... then--

                    HOGARTH
               (softly)
          Mom, you won't believe it. Some-thing ate
          our t.v. antenna.

                    ANNIE
          Oh, Hogarth...

                    HOGARTH
          No, I'm serious! And I went out to see
          what it was--

                    ANNIE
               (losing patience)
          Hogarth... please...

                    HOGARTH
          --and it was a Giant metal--

                    ANNIE
          HOGARTH!  Stop it!  I'm not in the mood.
               (gentle, but firm)
          Come on.  Let's go home.

INT. ANNIE'S TRUCK  -  MOMENTS LATER

Hogarth sits in silence as Annie starts the ignition.  As
they drive away, Hogarth can't help but look back over his
shoulder. Backlit by the moon, he can just make out the
outline of the Giant, half-hidden by the trees... watching
them go...

						DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. THE FOREST TREES - THE NEXT MORNING

The North Maine woods, the trees sway, holding their secret
deep within.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCOOL - DAY

The TEACHER is quizzing her students. Hogarth is the smallest
one in the class.  On the chalkboard are written the words
"RUSSIA" and "POLAND."

                    TEACHER
          And who can name another country that is
          part of the U.S.S.R.?

Hogarth raises his hand.

                    TEACHER
          Anyone besides Hogarth?

Hogarth lowers his hand.  No response from the others.

                    TEACHER
          Anyone actually listening to me other
          than Hogarth? Hogarth, are we going to
          have to move you up another grade? Or
          should we move the rest of the class
          <u>down</u>?  Alright, that's it. Everyone in
          the class except Hogarth can write me a
          five page essay. Call it "Allies and
          Enemies of the United States of America."
          It's due <u>tomorrow</u>.

The class groans. A big kid turns around to Hogarth, points
at him, and gives him the "slit throat" sign. Hogarth WILTS.

EXT. POWER STATION - DAY

Workers swarm over the towers, repairing the damage.  Kent is
there, smoking a pipe as he talks to a foreman.

                    FOREMAN
          Yeah, sometimes a line'll snap if the
          weather's bad, sure.  But for a whole
          tower to get twisted up like that?
          (SCRATCHES HIS HEAD) I tell you, it's got
          me beat.

                    KENT
          And not a single witness...

                    FOREMAN
          'Fraid not, sir.

                    KENT
          Could this have been caused by a giant
          metal monster, perhaps?

                    FOREMAN
          Pardon me, sir?

                    KENT
          Nothing.  Just repeating a yarn I heard
          from some fishermen...

Just then, something catches Kent's eye.

                    KENT
          Excuse me.

He walks a few steps away, and hunkers down beside a portion
of the rubble. A trapezoidal piece of wood is sticking out
from beneath it. Kent pulls it out. It's the handle of a B.B.
gun.  On Kent's look we cut to...

EXT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Students pour out of Hogarth's classroom, followed at last by
Hogarth, who is a full head smaller than any of them.  Now
Hogarth's face brightens, as a few kids his size pass by.
Hogarth hurries to catch up with them.

                    HOGARTH
          Hey guys!

The kids turn to Hogarth without much enthusiasm.

                    FIRST KID
          Hey, Hogarth.

                    HOGARTH
          Listen, you're not going to believe what
          happened to me last night. I went walking
          into the forest, and I saw this... giant!

The kids exchange glances.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          It was made out of metal! And it tore
          apart the power station.

For a moment, the kids stare at Hogarth blankly. Finally, one
of them speaks.

                    FIRST KID
          You know what I just remembered? I'm
          suppose to help some people do some
          stuff way over in some other place right
          now.

                    SECOND KID
          Oh those people? Yeah, I'm suppose to do
          that too.

                    FIRST KID
          Nice seeing you, Hogarth.

As the kids walk away, Hogarth hears one of them speak
quietly to the other.

                    FIRST KID
          Boy, I hope they never skip me a grade.

                    SECOND KID
          He's gotten really desperate.

A determined look comes over Hogarth's face we cut to...

THE WOODS - THAT DAY

Hogarth marches purposefully into the forest with a camera
slung over his shoulder, and a sheet of metal in one hand.

                    HOGARTH
          Hellllllooo! Come ouuut!

						DISSOLVE TO:

DEEPER INTO THE WOODS - A LITTLE LATER

The woods are denser now, with shafts of autumn sun
punctuating the darkened light. Hogarth bangs the metal
loudly as he walks.

                    HOGARTH
          Hey, big metal guy!!  It's me, the kid
          who turned off the power for ya!

						DISSOLVE TO:

A CLEARING IN THE FOREST

Hogarth sets the metal down, then retreats a safe distance...

                    HOGARTH
          Metal!  Delicious metal! Come and get it!

...and settles in behind a large log.  He aims the camera,
and waits.

And waits.

And waits.  This is clearly not as exciting as Hogarth
expected. He rubs his eyes, yawns, and lays his head on his
arm.

And the next thing he knows, he's waking up. The afternoon
light has given way to the long shadows of early evening.
Hogarth looks towards the clearing -- the piece of metal is
gone. He gasps.

He reaches behind him for the camera, as he scans the forest,
left and right.  Suddenly he pauses. His hand is not finding
the camera. He turns and looks for it. It's gone.

Above him a flashbulb pops.  A moment later, a roll of film
drops from the sky and lands at his feet.  Hogarth picks up
the film, and swallows hard. He looks up, a long way up, and
sees the Giant standing over him, its jaw moving, and a
crunching sound coming from its mouth.

                    HOGARTH
          Aaaaagh!

Hogarth runs as fast as his legs will carry him.  He covers
twenty feet or so, when --  BOOM! An enormous metal foot
touches down in front of him.  He runs faster, faster, but
with a single step, the Giant covers all the distance between
them.

Suddenly -- WHACK! Hogarth catches a tree limb across the
chin, and is sent sprawling to the ground. The Giant looms
over him. Hogarth sits up, his eyes wide with fear, and
shouts at the fifty-foot metal monster.

                    HOGARTH
          What do you want from me?!!

The Giant sits down with a thud. Then he reaches toward
Hogarth with a closed fist, turns it palm-upward and opens
his fingers.  There, in his hand, is the four-foot metal
handle with "EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF" printed along its length.

                    HOGARTH
          The shut-off switch...

Hogarth looks from the handle to the Giant, in awe.

                    HOGARTH
          You saw me save you.

As boy and Giant stare into each other's eyes, we cut to...

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Some of the BUSYBODIES sit around sipping coffee and
gossiping.

                    FIRST BUSYBODY
          Well, in my opinion, it's a woman's
          <u>obligation</u> to re-marry.  If not for
          herself, than for her child.

The Busybodies murmur their assent.

                    SECOND BUSYBODY
          Do you know she left her little boy all
          alone last night?  My son heard he went
          wandering around all by himself.  Near
          the power plant...

At the mention of this word, a figure at a nearby booth
lowers his newspaper, and narrows his eyes. It's Kent.

                    THIRD BUSYBODY
          Tsk-tsk. On the very night those power
          lines came down? The poor child could
          have been killed.

The Busybodies gasp in shock and disapproval.

                    FIRST BUSYBODY
          It just goes to prove my point. She <u>ought</u>
          to provide him with a father figure, if
          she cares about the boy.

                    ANNIE (O.S.)
          She <u>does</u> care about her boy, for your
          information.

Annie enters, tying on an apron. The Busybodies blush and fan
themselves nervously.

                    ANNIE (cont'd)
          And she thanks you so much for your
          concern.
               (then wearily)
          More coffee, anyone?

                    KENT (O.S.)
          I'd love some.

Annie turns. Kent gives her his best smile. Annie pours
coffee, we see Kent studying her with a thoughtful, almost
sinister look.  He glances at her name tag.

                    KENT
          Annie.  What a very lovely name...

Annie smiles.

INT. WOODS - DAY

The Giant and Hogarth sit facing each other, each staring at
the other with curiosity.

                    HOGARTH
          So... what <u>are</u> you?

The Giant tilts his head curiously but says nothing.

                    HOGARTH
          Do you talk?

The Giant continues staring, puzzled.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          "Talk." You know, words?  "Blah-blah-
          blah," like that. Can you do that --
          "Blah-blah-blah?"

The Giant opens and closes his mouth in imitation of Hogarth.
A series of deep metallic rumblings and clangings come out of
his mouth.

                    HOGARTH
          Well, you get the concept, anyway.  But
          we need to work on your vocabulary.
          Let's see.

Hogarth looks around, sees a rock, and picks it up.

                    HOGARTH
          See this?  This is called a rock. "<u>Rock</u>."
          Try it. "Rooock."

                    GIANT
          Kraaan-chunk.

                    HOGARTH
          "Rooock."

                    GIANT
          Kroooonk.

                    HOGARTH
               (patiently)
          Rock.

                    GIANT
          Rog.

                    HOGARTH
          Good! See?  <u>This</u> is a... rock.

A look of dawning understanding comes over the Giant.  He
looks at the rock in Hogarth's hand.

                    GIANT
          Rog.

He picks up a nearby boulder.

                    GIANT
          Rog?

                    HOGARTH
          Yes!

The Giant pulls a tree out of the ground.

                    GIANT
          Rog!

                    HOGARTH
          No, no. <u>That</u> is a tree.  Tree. (POINTS AT
          ROCK) Rock. (POINTS AT TREE) Treeeee.

The Giant's mouth hangs open in awe.

                    GIANT
          Rog... Treeee-(SOUND OF A TRUCK BEEING
          CRUSHED IN A METAL COMPACTOR)

                    HOGARTH
          Get it?  Everything has a different name.
          Rock. Tree...

The giant's mouth hangs open in awe...

						DISSOLVE TO:

SAME SHOT - HOURS LATER

A very tired Hogarth is still seated (uncomfortably now) in
front of a still awe-struck Giant. The Giant picks up a piece
of wood.

                    HOGARTH
               (tired)
          Branch.

                    GIANT
          Braaannch.

The Giant picks up another piece of wood.

                    HOGARTH
          Yeah, that's a branch, too.

                    GIANT
          Braaannch.
               (picks up a rock)
          Rog?

                    HOGARTH
          Look, we've pretty much covered
          everything in the forest. And if I don't
          get home soon, mom's gonna wonder where I
          am.
               (gets on his feet)
          You stay here, okay? I'll come back
          tomorrow.

Hogarth waves to the Giant and EXITS. Now Hogarth hears a
BOOM behind him. He turns to see the Giant following him.

                    HOGARTH
          And don't follow me, either.

The Giant continues following, happily.

                    HOGARTH (CONT'D)
          I said <u>don't</u>. Don't follow me. Stay. Go
          home. I mean it!

EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS NEAR HOGARTH'S HOME - DAY

A fog is settling in, as Hogarth leaves the forest and
crosses a set of railroad tracks. He points to the house at the
bottom of the hill.

                    HOGARTH
          Look. That's where I live, okay?  I'm
          going there, and you're not, understand?
          So goodbye. Hey...

He turns to see the Giant kneeling curiously beside the
railroad tracks. He pokes at them.

                    GIANT
          (HUNGRY SOUND)

                    HOGARTH
          Hey, wait a minute--

Too late. The Giant bites down on the twin strands of
railroad track and rips them loose like spaghetti.

                    HOGARTH
          WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!!

The Giant freezes, puzzled, long strings of railroad track
dangling from his month.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          Put them back!

Now the Giant looks confused and guilty.  DING DING DING! The
crossing signal blares, red lights flash. The Giant stares at
the pretty lights, entranced.

Hogarth GASPS, looks down the tracks. He hears a distant
whistle blow: WOO-WOOO.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          Oh no... .(HE RUNS TO THE GIANT) Put them
          back RIGHT NOW!!!

The Giant stares, puzzled. Hogarth GROANS, runs to a piece of
track sticking up and pushes down on it with all his
weight... it doesn't budge.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          Like this. Help me!

The Giant sees Hogarth struggling with the curled tracks,
takes one index finger, and helpfully pushes on them: KA-
BLAM! They're down.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          Good! That's it!

The Giant grunts, pleased with himself... Hogarth HEARS the
train, close now. And then he sees--  the pieces of track
don't meet up.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          Put them together! Like this!

Hogarth pantomimes. The Giant lines up one track--

                    HOGARTH
          Now the other one... hurry!

-- then tries to line up the other side, but it's tricky, the
two chewed-on rails stubbornly resist lining up. Finally, the
giant gets them close.

                    HOGARTH
          Good enough! Come on!

Hogarth takes off, racing like the wind to get out of there.
He STOPS, looks back...

THE GIANT

is still fussing with the tracks, trying to get them perfect.

                    HOGARTH
          No! Come on! The train's coming!

The Giant is intent on his puzzle: CLICK. CLICK. Almost.  Now
we see the headlight of a big freight train coming out of the
fog. The Giant continues to fuss.

                    HOGARTH
          The train!

The Giant finally SNAPS the track into place. CLICK. He
grins. A train whistle SHRIEKS! The startled Giant looks up
as Hogarth hits the dirt and--

KA-BLOOM!

EXT. FOREST NEAR POWER STATION - CONTINUOUS

Kent examines the broken branches. Hears the BOOM of the
train wreck.

RESUME TRAIN CROSSING - CONTINUOUS

Steam flies. The EXPLOSION dies away. Hogarth looks up.

The Giant is gone. The train, its front end smashed, coasts
down the track, breaks squealing. Hogarth looks around...
Then, THUMP! The Giant's head lands beside him.

An arm falls here, a leg there. A hand flies down the hill,
toward Hogarth's house.

                    HOGARTH
          Oh no...

Hogarth sees the giant lying around in big pieces.  He
touches the Giant's hand gently, a look of pain and sadness
on his face.

                    HOGARTH
          (WHIMPERS)

And then, behind him, the Giant's head, still attached to its
torso, sits up. Hogarth YELPS. The Giant's eyes spark, flash
and click on. He looks around, dazed, at his scattered parts.

                    HOGARTH
          You're alive!

The torso has one leg and most of one arm attached. The other
pieces seem to come alive and scamper around as if confused.
An antenna rises out of the top of the Giant's head and
begins to "signal".  All the pieces SNAP to attention.  They
crawl toward the Giant, who gathers them up in his arm and
looks at Hogarth, confused. Just then we hear voices coming
from the fog.

                    VOICE
          Hello? Is anyone out there? Are you
          alright?

Hogarth squints into the fog.

                    HOGARTH
          The train Conductor. Oh, we're in trouble
          now...

                    HOGARTH
               (turns to Giant)
          Okay, look.  I've changed my mind. You
          <u>can</u> follow me home.

He hurries off down the hill, with the one-legged Giant
hopping along behind him.

INT. HOGARTH'S BARN - DAY

Hogarth enters the barn, with the hopping Giant behind him.

                    HOGARTH
          You can stay here for now.

The Giant takes a seat and sets his body parts down beside
him. The Giant's arm parts dutifully line up, the arm first.
He picks it up and jams it into its socket.

                    HOGARTH
          And try to keep it quiet okay? My mom's
          not too big on me having any pets right
          now.  "Shhhh" --  get it?

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - CONTINUOUS

The train ENGINEER and a CONDUCTOR are examining the tracks
in the swirling fog.

                    CONDUCTOR
          Whatever we hit, it was something big. A
          tractor, maybe.

                    ENGINEER
          More like a tank, I'd say.

                    CONDUCTOR
          So where the heck did it go?

Out of the fog comes Kent, pipe in hand. He casts a glance at
the Conductor and the Engineer, then turns and looks down the
hill towards Hogarth's house.

INT. HOGARTH'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Annie enters from the kitchen, wiping her hands on her apron.

                    ANNIE
          Dinner's been on the table for twenty
          minutes now. Where have you been all
          afternoon?

                    HOGARTH
          I could tell you, Mom. But I really don't
          think you'd believe me.

                    ANNIE
          Somehow, I don't doubt that.

INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

The Giant finishes attaching his leg, and is now all together
save for a missing HAND. He looks around the barn for it.

INT. HOGARTH'S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

Annie and Hogarth sit at the dinner table.

                    ANNIE
          Would you say grace, please?

Hogarth folds his hands together, and starts to bow his head
when he STOPS: behind Annie, the Giant's hand crawls across
the kitchen floor like a tarantula.

                    HOGARTH
          OH MY GOD!

Annie looks up. Hogarth rolls his eyes to heaven.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          Oh my God, we thank you for the... uh,
          food that Mom has put in front of us and--
          STOP!!!

Hogarth jumps up. The curious hand-- now standing up on two
fingers and reaching for an antique vase-- reacts to
Hogarth's tone and shrinks back. Hogarth sees Annie staring
at him. Again, he covers --

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          -the Devil from doing bad things... and--
               (TO HAND)
          GET OUTTA HERE!...uh, Satan. GO! GO! So
          that we may live in peace. Amen.

                    ANNIE
          Amen. That was...
               (words fail her)
          ...really unusual, Hogarth.

                    HOGARTH
               (leaps to his feet)
          Gotta use the bathroom.

                    ANNIE
          Well... (HE'S ALREADY GONE) Okay.

LIVING ROOM - FRONT ENTRANCE

Hogarth runs up to the hand, blocking it from going to the
cellar. He takes one of the enormous fingers with both hands,
and leads it like a baby elephant to the front door.  He
opens the door revealing--

--KENT, startled, about to knock. He smiles his most charming
smile.  Hogarth GASPS, SLAMS the door. He breathes hard,
panicking.  But when he turns around, the hand is GONE.

The doorbell RINGS. Not knowing what to do, Hogarth opens it.
Kent's still there, smiling, as before.

                    KENT
          Hey there, Scout... Kent Mansley. I work
          for the government.  Your parents home?

                    HOGARTH
          We're eating.

                    KENT
          What's wrong, Scout? You seem a little
          jumpy.

                    ANNIE
          Who is it, Hogarth?

Annie has entered the living room.  Kent REACTS.

                    KENT
          Why, hello there! Annie, isn't it?  From
          the diner?

                    ANNIE
          That's right!  Mr. Mansley?

                    KENT
          Please.  Call me Kent.
               (wheels turning)
          So this is your house...
               (to Hogarth)
          ...then you must be Hobo!

                    HOGARTH
          Hogarth.

                    KENT
          Hobart.

                    HOGARTH &amp; ANNIE
          HOGARTH.

                    KENT
          Yes indeed. I'm terribly sorry to bother
          you at this hour, but I'm looking into a
          little train accident that happened
          nearby and-- my goodness! Is there a blue-
          ribbon pie in the oven, or have I died
          and gone to Heaven?

                    ANNIE
               (smiles)
          We've just sat down to dinner, Mr.
          Mansley. Would you care to join us?

                    KENT
          If it's not too much trouble, I'd be
          delighted!

He flashes her a thousand-dollar smile.  As Annie turns her
back to lead them into the dining room, Kent's smile fades
into a calculating look.

Hogarth sees it all, and glares as Kent walks past him.  Kent
doffs his hat, places it over Hogarth's head as he advances
into the living room.

                    KENT
          Here.  Pretend you're a gangster.

The hat covers Hogarth's head.  He stands there, looking
ridiculous.

INT. HOGARTH'S DINING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Hogarth, Annie and Kent are seated at the dinner table.  Kent
is pouring on the charm to Annie, as Hogarth continues to eye
him suspiciously. Kent pats his stomach.

                    KENT
          Well! It certainly is true what they say;
          the hospitality in these parts is second
          to none.

                    HOGARTH
          Which parts would those be, sir?

                    KENT
          Well, you know, uh... Maine.

                    HOGARTH
          I never heard anyone say that about
          Maine. Have you, Mom?

                    ANNIE
          Hogarth...

                    KENT
          Oh, it's alright.  He's a bright boy.  I
          like bright boys...

He lights his pipe and studies Hogarth closely.

                    KENT (cont'd)
          So tell me, Hogarth. What do you think of
          all the goings-on around here lately?

Hogarth plays innocent.

                    HOGARTH
          Goings-on?

                    KENT
          You know, the power plant being destroyed
          and all.

                    ANNIE
          Careful, Mr. Mansley... he's got a
          powerful imagination.

                    KENT
          Please. Call me Kent.  I like to be on a
          first-name basis with first-class chefs.

Annie smiles.  Hogarth rolls his eyes.

                    HOGARTH
          If it's alright with everybody, I think
          I'll be excused now.

                    KENT
          But you haven't answered my question,
          Hogarth.

Kent leans in toward Hogarth menacingly.

                    KENT
          The powerplant.
               (leans closer)
          The train.
               (even closer)
          Surely you must have a theory, Hogarth.
          A bright boy like you. Surely you must
          have an <u>inkling</u> --

                    HOGARTH
               (blurting it out)
          There's a monster out there!

                    KENT
          What???

                    HOGARTH
          It's a hideous creature, five stories
          tall, and if you go out looking for it
          you won't come back alive!

There's a moment of stunned silence. Then...

                    KENT
          You're... kidding.

                    ANNIE
          Of course he's kidding.

                    HOGARTH
               (shrugs)
          I'm a kid. That's what we do.

Suddenly, a toilet flushes upstairs.  A puzzled expression
comes over Hogarth's face, then Annie's, then Kent's.

                    KENT
          Do you have a guest?

                    ANNIE
          No...

Hogarth leaps from his seat and dashes out of the room.  Kent
raises an eyebrow. Annie looks puzzled.

INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM

Hogarth yanks open the door, revealing:

The giant hand, which crouches on the sink as it unrolls a
pile of toilet paper into a pile on the floor. Hogarth shuts
the door behind him, startling the hand, which leaps to the
floor with a THUD!

BACK TO THE DINNER TABLE

Kent and Annie react to the sound, and stare at the ceiling.

                    ANNIE
          Excuse me.

She exits.

INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM

Hogarth labors as he pulls the giant hand toward the open
window.  The hand resists mildly, like a distracted child--

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM

Annie stands outside the door. She knocks.

                    ANNIE
          Hogarth? Are you alright?

INT. DINING ROOM  - CONTINUOUS

Kent turns his attention to the sounds coming from upstairs.
He exits.

INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM

Using his whole body, Hogarth tries to shove the giant hand
out the open window.

                    HOGARTH
          (GRUNTING SOUNDS)

INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM

Kent has joined Annie, and the two of them listen together.

                    HOGARTH
          (LOUDER GRUNTING)

                    KENT
          This sort of thing is why it's so
          important to really chew your food...

Annie shoots Kent a disapproving look.

INT.  UPSTAIRS BATHROOM  -  CONTINUOUS

With a mighty shove, he finally manages to get the hand out
the window.

                    HOGARTH
          --rrrrrgggggghhhhh!

The hand lands with a terrific crash, Hogarth tumbles to the
ground, and Annie and Kent burst in through the door to
REVEAL--

Hogarth... sheepishly standing there in a large PILE of
unrolled toilet paper.

                    ANNIE
          Good lord, you've been acting strange
          lately.

Kent looks from Hogarth to the open window. In the darkness
outside, he seems to see a shadowy figure moving in the dark.
He turns to Annie, and gives her his patented smile.

                    KENT
          Do you have a telephone I could use?

INT. HOGARTH'S LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Kent, hunkered into a corner in an attempt at privacy, speaks
into a telephone in a loud whisper.  Kent peers around
cautiously, making sure he's not observed.

                    KENT
          --let me put it bluntly, sir. I'm onto
          something big in Rockwell, Maine.

                    CHIEF
               (tired)
          What is it this time, Kent?

                    KENT
          This time -- well, this time it's a
          giant, that's roaming around the town
          destroying things.

                    CHIEF
          Uh-huh. Well, you be sure to file us a
          report, and we'll be sure to process it.

                    KENT
          Excellent, sir.  And in the meantime, I'd
          like to call in my team.

                    CHIEF
          Your... team?

                    KENT
          My backup, my support squad. Half a dozen
          men are all I need to start...

                    CHIEF
          Kent, I know this will come as a shock to
          you, but we can't just give a team to
          anyone who asks.

                    KENT
               (puffing himself up)
          Forgive my saying so, sir, but I'm not
          just anyone, and I've <u>never</u> asked.
          Before.  Until now.
               (there is a long silence)
          Sir?

                    CHIEF
          You haven't <u>really</u> found something, have
          you?

                    KENT
          I think I have, sir, yes.

                    CHIEF
          You think.  Do you have proof?

                    KENT
          Sir, I've got a feeling about this one, a
          <u>gut</u> feeling...

                    CHIEF
          That's lovely, Kent.  But let me try to
          explain how this works.  If you called to
          tell me you'd found, say, a giant
          <u>footprint</u>, I might send over an expert to
          make a plaster cast of it.  If you saw an
                    (MORE)

                    CHIEF (cont'd)
          actual <u>giant</u> with your own <u>eyes</u>, I might
          even send you the team you're asking for.
          Heck, you go so far as to get me a
          <u>photograph</u>, I could probably get the U.S.
          Army over there to Rockwell, Maine. But
          you tell me you've got a <u>feeling</u>--

                    KENT
               (temper rising)
          Alright then, fine. You want evidence?
          I'll get your evidence...

                    CHIEF
          (TIRED) That sounds swell, Kent.

                    KENT
          And when I do, I'm going to want a <u>memo</u>
          distributed!  And I'm going to want that
          memo carbon copied and -- and
          re-distributed and --

The Chief hangs up. As Kent stands with the phone receiver in
his hand, a look of dark determination comes over his face.

And then we pan up through the ceiling above Kent, into
Hogarth's room.  Hogarth also holds a phone receiver, with
one hand cupped over the mouthpiece.  He looks worried.

EXT. HOGARTH'S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

Annie says goodbye to Hogarth at the front door.

                    ANNIE
          Bye, Honey!  Have a good day at school.

                    HOGARTH
          (WAVING) Bye, Mom.

Hogarth pedals his bike away until he's out of sight of the
front house, then zips around the side of the house, ditches
his bike and grabs a little red wagon.

IN A QUICK MONTAGE:

Hogarth pulls the wagon around, collecting metal. He finds
some cans, an old car muffler, a fallen street sign, etc.

INT. HOGARTH'S BARN - A LITTLE LATER

Hogarth enters and finds the Giant sleeping.

                    HOGARTH
          Ahem...

The Giant opens his eyes. He sees the wagon full of metal and
looks delighted.

                    GIANT
          (HUNGRY SOUND)

                    HOGARTH
          It wasn't easy to fill this wagon. So try
          to not to eat it all at once--

The Giant picks the wagon up, and dumps its entire contents
into his mouth.  Hogarth is speechless.

                    HOGARTH
          Do you have any idea what it took to find
          that metal??? I scoured the neighborhood!
          I had to ditch school! I've never done
          that before, I--

The Giant picks up the wagon and eats that too. Hogarth sighs
and takes a seat.

                    HOGARTH
          So... now that we've eaten, how shall we
          spend the rest of our day?

The Giant looks at him, not understanding.

                    HOGARTH
          Okay.  I'll teach you more words.

Hogarth stands up and points at his house.

                    HOGARTH
          That is my "home."  That's where I come
          from . My...
               (points at himself)
          home...

Hogarth points to his house. The Giant looks at it.

                    GIANT
          (METALLIC CLANKING THAT SOUNDS SOMETHING
          LIKE "HOME")

                    HOGARTH
          Right.  Now where is...
               (points at giant)
          ...<u>your</u> home?

The Giant looks at Hogarth's house, then follows Hogarth's
pointing hand, and looks at himself. Then a look of deep
sadness comes over his face. His shoulders shrug, and his
hands turn palm-upward in a puzzled gesture.

                    GIANT
          (PUZZLED, ANGUISHED SOUND)

                    HOGARTH
          You mean... you don't <u>know</u> where you came
          from?

                    GIANT
          (ANGUISHED, INARTICULATE GIANT SOUNDS)

                    HOGARTH
          Wow. You poor guy...

Now we hear a deep rumbling sound. The Giant looks down at
his stomach hungrily.

                    HOGARTH
          I know, I know.
               (thinks for a moment)
          Okay, I know a place where it's all you
          can eat.  But not until after dark.

The Giant stares at him, uncomprehending.

                    HOGARTH
          Let me put it this way.

He points at through the window at the sun.

                    HOGARTH
          "Sun."

                    GIANT
          "Suuughn."

                    HOGARTH
          When the sun goes down...

Hogarth mimes the sun arcing down the sky to sunset. The he
taps on the Giant's iron belly.

                    HOGARTH
          Feeding time. Get it?

                    GIANT
          (COMPREHENDING SOUND)

                    HOGARTH
          Good!

Hogarth starts to leave, then pauses and turns back to look
at the Giant.

                    HOGARTH
          You're smarter than you look, aren't you?

                    GIANT
          (puzzled sound)

                    HOGARTH
               (exiting)
          Never mind.

EXT. ROCKWELL

In a time-lapse, we see the sun arc across the sky and set
over picturesque Rockwell, Maine.

EXT. HOGARTH'S BARN  - NIGHT

Two silhouettes creep into the night -- one small, one
enormous.

EXT.  OPEN COUNTRY  -  NIGHT

A ways off, Hogarth relaxes.

                    HOGARTH
          Come on.  Let's go!

Hogarth starts walking. The Giant moves past him- BOOM BOOM
BOOM! -and with a half dozen strides, is almost out of sight.

                    HOGARTH
          <u>STOP</u>!

On the horizon, the giant turns, looks puzzled: <u>now</u> <u>what</u>?

                    HOGARTH
          Not <u>that</u> fast!  <u>Sheesh</u>! Come back here!

BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  In two seconds, the giant stands at
Hogarth's side and looks down at him, confused.

                    HOGARTH
          Pick me up,  OK?

The giant does as he's told, lowers his huge hand to the
ground.  Hogarth climbs up on it.  The giant carefully raises
up his hand, with Hogarth on it.  Hogarth grabs onto a
finger, and points toward the northwest.

                    HOGARTH
          Okay, now.  <u>March</u>!

Hogarth hangs on for dear life as the giant quickly
accelerates.  Hogarth looks down, and GASPS: they're <u>really</u>
moving!

EXT. POWER PLANT - NIGHT

Kent is hunting around the power plant with a flashlight,
muttering to himself.

                    KENT
               (scornful)
          "Evidence". I'll get your evidence...

He scans the vast expanse of forest with his flashlight, and
sags hopelessly.

                    KENT
          ...somewhere...

EXT. HILLS OUTSIDE ROCKWELL - LATER

Hogarth and the Giant are marching along a back road on the
hills outside town.

FROM HOGARTH'S POV

It's like a magic carpet ride, as the moon-lit countryside
below sails past his vantage point, fifty feet above the
ground.  Hogarth points at a church steeple.

                    HOGARTH
          Church.  Churrrch.

                    GIANT
          Churrr-(CRUNCH)

                    HOGARTH
          Yes. People pray there.
               (points at another building)
          School.  Can you say that? Schooool...

                    GIANT
          Skooo...

                    HOGARTH
          Schooool suuuucks...

                    GIANT
          Skoooo saauuugz...

                    HOGARTH
          <u>Very</u> good.  And that's all you need to
          know about school.

EXT. WOODS

Kent has wandered some distance from the power plant now. His
flashlight beam sweeps across the ground.

                    KENT
          Nothing. <u>Nothing</u>...

Just then, he hears a noise behind him.  He stops. Wheels
around -- and the beam of his flashlight catches--

--a MOOSE. Huge. Enormous antlers. Looking right at him. The
moose SNORTS. Kent backpedals, stumbles backward into a ditch-

                    KENT
          Whooooa!

--loudly enough to scare off the moose.  He gets up, dusts
himself off, shines his flashlight around and discovers what
he's standing in is not a ditch at all, but a--

GIANT FOOTPRINT, perfectly preserved in a patch of dried mud.

Kent GASPS.  The gasp becomes a sound of delight. He begins
to laugh...

And then a single rain drop falls on head.  Kent looks up.
Another drop falls.

The laughter ceases.

EXT. WOODS

Hogarth is still riding on the Giant's shoulder. Rain has
begun to drizzle down now.

                    HOGARTH
          And that building there is the coffee
          shop.

                    GIANT
          Kau-(CLANG) shawww...

                    HOGARTH
          That's where my mom works.  Sometimes she
          has to stay late, to make extra money
          'cause... well, my Dad's away.  You know
          what a "dad" is?  A "father?"

                    GIANT
          "Fa-grrr?"

                    HOGARTH
          Yeah. It's like me...
               (points at himself)
          Only bigger.

He raises a hand indicating somone taller.

                    HOGARTH
          He used to take me to baseball games.
          This <u>one</u> time, we brought binoculars, and
          we tried to figure out what pitch the
          catcher was calling!  One year we want to
          go to <u>every</u> home game!  I mean-- we
          wanted to...

The Giant stops walking and swivels his enormous head to face
Hogarth.  For a moment, they stare at each other in silence,
with the rain pouring down around them. Then Hogarth bursts
out, almost angrily.

                    HOGARTH
          Aw, what am I even talking to you for?
          You can't understand a word I'm saying!

The Giant continues staring.

                    HOGARTH
          Can you?

The Giant speaks --and somewhere within the metal clanging of
his voice, there seems to be a note of sympathetic sadness.

                    GIANT
          "Fa-grrrr."

Hogarth sighs, and pats the Giant on the side of the head.

                    HOGARTH
          Well, I guess it's better than talking to
          myself.

The Giant looks pleased by this.  They continue on their way.

EXT. WOODS

Kent, soaked to the bone, is sitting on the edge of the Giant
footprint, which has become a soggy, nondescript mess.

                    KENT
          God hates me...

He pulls out his pipe, and tries to light it, but his soggy
matches won't strike.

                    KENT
          Damnation!
               (shouting heavenward)
          Can't a guy get a break around here?!!

Suddenly the rain lets up. Kent looks surprised. Then
pleased.  He lights his pipe.  Then turns to heaven again.

                    KENT
          Thank you. Waaagh!

He does a huge double take as he looks up to see the Giant's
smiling head looming above him. The Giant picks up Kent's
metal flashlight, eats it, and in three strides is gone from
sight, leaving the terrified and exhilarated Kent behind.

UNDER THE GIANT'S CHIN...

...Hogarth PEEKS OUT, breathing hard.

                    HOGARTH
          That <u>can't</u> be good.

EXT. DEAN'S JUNKARD - NIGHT

A metal graveyard, sprawling  as far as the eye can see.

                    HOGARTH (O.S.)
          This is it.

The Giant's metal hand sets Hogarth down into frame.

                    HOGARTH
          All you can eat.

The Giant surveys the metal in all directions: MOANING
happily as he spies a huge stack of cars.  He selects one,
and slowly... carefully... bites into it...

                    GIANT
          (DELIGHTED SOUND)

He selects another car, picks it up and bites into it like a
gourmand tasting a fine chocolate.

                    GIANT (cont'd)
          Mmmm...

He tastes another.

                    GIANT (cont'd)
          Ooooooh...

--causing the CAR HORN TO BLAST!

                    HOGARTH
          SHHHH!! Turn it off, turn it OFF!!!

The giant looks around nervously, helplessly, beginning to
PANIC. He tries shaking it, then sitting on it... but nothing
works; the horn is STUCK.

Hogarth looks back toward the house--

AT THE FAR END OF THE JUNKYARD

A light goes on in a little house.

Finally, the Giant takes a monster chomp and snaps the car in
half. The horn strangles into silence.

EXT. JUNKYARD HOUSE

Dean reaches the door, opens it: a GASPING, out-of-breath
Hogarth stands on his doorstep.  Dean studies Hogarth for a
moment. Then breaks into a smile.

                    DEAN
          Hey, I know you.  Squirrel boy.

                    HOGARTH
          Hogarth.

                    DEAN
          By night known as Hogarth.  Got it.
          Well, come inside kid.  Hell, it's
          raining out there, isn't it?

INT. DEAN'S HOUSE

Jazz is playing on the hi-fi of this distinctly bohemian pad.
Dean presses an espresso.

                    HOGARTH
          Listen, you're not going to call my mom
          are you?  She doesn't know I'm out. I
          could get in trouble.

                    DEAN
          Don't worry, kid.  It's not my style to
          report a guy to the authorities.

He brings over two espresso cups and hands one to Hogarth.

                    DEAN
          Espresso for me, Bosco for you. But I
          thought you'd dig the little cup.

Hogarth looks pleased.

                    HOGARTH
          Thanks.

                    DEAN
          My name's Dean. I'm a nobody. And you
          are...?

                    HOGARTH
          Hogarth. I'm... kind of a nobody, too.

                    DEAN
          So what brings you all the way up here,
          Hogarth?  You riding some kind of crazy
          inspiration?

                    HOGARTH
          I've been riding <u>something</u> alright...

The record finishes, and in the silence: LOUD CRUNCHING
NOISES from outside.  Dean jumps up.

                    DEAN
          Did you hear that???

He grabs a crowbar, runs to the door; Hogarth jumps up.

                    HOGARTH
          No, wait!  <u>Stop</u>!

EXT.  DEAN'S HOME  -  NIGHT

The door flies open, Dean leaps out, YELLS:

                    DEAN
          <u>Who's</u> <u>out</u> <u>there</u>?!

He hears a metallic GASP.  He looks up, up, up and sees the
gargantuan Giant, tailpipes sticking out of his mouth,
frozen, a guilty "caught!" look on its face.  Dean YELPS...

                    DEAN
          --my god!  RUN KID, <u>RUN</u>!!!!

                    HOGARTH
               (rolls his eyes)
          It's OK...!

But the heroic Dean seizes Hogarth and turns to duck inside--

--which the giant immediately interprets as a threat and--

--SLAMS his massive hand in front of the door, blocking it as
Hogarth tries to break free of Dean, to explain--

                    HOGARTH
          The giant isn't--let GO!

as the giant GRABS DEAN, hoisting him high in the air.

                    HOGARTH
          DON'T SQUASH HIM!! <u>DO</u> <u>NOT</u> <u>SQ</u>--

The giant STOPS--looks down at Hogarth, puzzled.

                    HOGARTH
          ...squash.... him.  Good boy.
               (beat, heavy sigh, then-)
          His name is Dean. We like Dean. Dean
          good. Put him down.

                    THE GIANT
          Dean.

The giant grins at Dean; he sways, shocked, overwhelmed.

                    HOGARTH
          Dean, meet a friend of mine.  Dean,
          giant.  Giant, Dean.

The giant grins, and kind of "waves".  Dean stands there,
pale, completely overwhelmed.

                    HOGARTH
          More coffee...?

EXT. DEANS HOUSE - SOME TIME LATER

Dean stares, stunned, at the huge, impassive giant.

                    DEAN
          So... where'd he come from?

                    HOGARTH
          He doesn't remember.  He's like a little
          kid...

                    DEAN
          Little.
               (mirthless laugh)
          Yeah.  Huh.

                    HOGARTH
          He needs food.  And shelter.

Dean stares at Hogarth in expressionless shock. Then slowly
stands, pours out his coffee, goes inside, locking the door
behind him.

SAME SHOT - 37 MINUTES LATER

The blinds have been pulled. Hogarth stands at the Dean's
front door, pleading.

                    HOGARTH
          You got <u>plenty</u> of room here!  This place
          is perfect!

                    DEAN
               (from inside, muffled)
          Go away.

                    HOGARTH
          I can have him push the door down.  You
          know I can.

Pause. The door opens and there's Dean, looking annoyed.

                    DEAN
          Hogarth!  I can't hide it <u>here</u>!

                    HOGARTH
          Him.  Not it.  <u>Him</u>.

                    DEAN
          Whatever! You don't even know where <u>he</u>
          came from!  Or what the hell <u>he</u> is!

                    HOGARTH
               (stubbornly)
          <u>He's</u> ...my friend.

Dean stares at immovable Hogarth.  Behind him, dawn breaks.

                    DEAN
               (low mutter)
          Yeah. What am I, am I your friend? Bring
          some frankenbot with out of state plates
          over here and make me change my tune...
          don't like that jazz... God, I'm tired...

Dean gives up, stands, worn-out, exhausted.

                    HOGARTH
          So!  He can stay?!

                    DEAN
          <u>Tonight</u>. Tomorrow, I don't know...
               (wanders inside, muttering)
          ...figure something out....

Dean stumbles toward his home.  Hogarth grins, and looks at
the now-tired giant, YAWNING.

                    HOGARTH
          Let's get you tucked in....

EXT. DEAN'S JUNKYARD - NIGHT

Hogarth smiles to himself, as he watches the giant sleep, now
covered with a layer of junk, a camouflage-comforter.

And then he hears a BEEPING NOISE.  Hogarth looks up and sees
an ARMY PLANE, flying towards him.

The BEEPING gets louder.  Hogarth realizes it's coming from
the Giant.  Suddenly: WHIR, a panel on the giant's arm slides
open. A strange device pops out and starts tracking the plane
overhead.

Hogarth panics: as the plane comes nearer the BEEPING becomes
more insistent, the strange device tracks the plane: it looks
very retro-advanced and scary.

The giant starts MOANING, thrashing in his sleep as if caught
in a bad dream. Suddenly he wakes up and ka-CHUK!--the device
withdraws.  The plane disappears over the trees.

Hogarth looks at the giant, stunned.  The giant, unaware,
looks at Hogarth, puzzled.

                    HOGARTH
          It's okay. Go back to sleep. It was just
          a bad dream.

The giant nods, comforted, and drops off into sleep.  Hogarth
walks away, deeply troubled.

INT. HOGARTH'S HOUSE

Hogarth creeps upstairs to his room, pulls back the covers,
and is just about to dive in...  when Annie enters; spies
Hogarth up and dressed.

                    ANNIE
          You're up <u>already</u>?

Hogarth tiredly replaces the bedcovers.

                    HOGARTH
          ...just making the bed....

                    ANNIE
          That's nice.  Come downstairs.  I have a
          surprise for you...

INT.  HOGARTH'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM  -  LIVING ROOM

An exhausted Hogarth shuffles downstairs, and into the
kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN

He sits down sleepily at the breakfast table and then GASPS:
sitting across from him, reading the paper and looking quite
at home in a fatherly way is --

                    HOGARTH
          Kent...?

                    KENT
          Morning, sport.  Sleep well?

He feels Kent's knowing eyes boring into him.

                    HOGARTH
          Moooooooom!

Annie appears, carrying a plate of waffles.  She sets a plate
down and leans in towards Hogarth, beaming.

                    ANNIE
          Isn't it wonderful, Hogarth? We finally
          got a border!

                    HOGARTH
          (PANICKED) Oh no...

Kent looks at his watch.

                    KENT
          You know, I meant to wake up bright and
          early this morning.  But from the look of
          those waffles, I'm still in bed dreaming!

                    ANNIE
          Oh, Mr. Mansley--
               (Kent wags a finger)
          -- <u>Kent</u>.

Kent and Annie share a meaningful look. Hogarth looks ill.

                    HOGARTH
          Uh... I'm not very hungry.

He exits. Kent watches him go, then picks up the fork that
Hogarth was holding, and surreptitiously drops it in a little
plastic evidence bag.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Hogarth strolls in and takes a seat at the counter next to a
man reading a newspaper. A bored waitress approaches.

                    HOGARTH
          Chocolate malted, please.
               (she exits)
          I've never been in here.  Mom says the
          coffee's weak and they put meat extender
          in the hamburger.

                    MAN BEHIND NEWSPAPER
          It ain't the diner, sparky. But it's more
          private.

The man lowers the paper to reveal his face.  It's Dean.  He
glances around cautiously to make sure they're not being
watched.

                    DEAN
          So. Your friend's got quite an appetite.

                    HOGARTH
          Yeah. When I found him, he was trying to
          eat the power station.

                    DEAN
          So where does he come from?

                    HOGARTH
               (shrugs)
          He doesn't know.

                    DEAN
          You can <u>talk</u> to him???

                    HOGARTH
          Kinda.  He can't say a lot of words yet,
          but he understands things pretty good.

                    DEAN
          I wonder if he had something to do with
          the meteorite that splashed down here the
          other day.  Then again, maybe he <u>was</u> the
          meteorite...

                    HOGARTH
          That's what I was thinking!  He came from
          outer space!!

                    DEAN
          Maybe.  Or maybe he was launched <u>into</u>
          space from earth.

                    HOGARTH
          Hey, maybe the commies made him! You
          know, in one of their secret labs.

                    DEAN
          Or maybe we built him in one of ours.
          Our government has secrets, too you know.

                    HOGARTH
               (getting into it)
          Or maybe he comes from underground, you
          know?  Like, he's this undiscovered
          species, that evolved from minerals or
          something, while we were evolving out of
          monkeys.

                    DEAN
          Maybe, kid.  And then, again, maybe the
          monkeys evolved from us.

Dean laughs and puts his hands behind his head, and strikes a
philosophical pose.

                    HOGARTH
          I wish we knew why he was here.

                    DEAN
          Hey, I wish I knew why <u>I</u> was here.

Hogarth puts his hands behind his head and strikes a
philosophical pose, too. He seems to be enjoying the adult
conversation.

                    HOGARTH
          Yeah.

                    DEAN
          I mean if you think about it, nobody
          really <u>knows</u> where they came from, why
          they're here, or where they're going. We
          <u>believe</u>.  We <u>hope</u>.  But we don't <u>know</u>.

                    HOGARTH
          Right, right...

                    DEAN
          And some cats, that scares 'em, you know?

                    HOGARTH
          You're telling me.

                    DEAN
          They race around,  play the game, chase
          money, chase power...

                    HOGARTH
          Just so they won't have to wonder what
          life's all about.

                    DEAN
          Exactly.
               (beat, suddenly impressed)
          Hey...

Dean lifts his coffee cup, saluting Hogarth.  They sit in
silence for a moment, happily contemplating the universe.

INT. DARK LABORATORY

As Kent looks on, an AGENT in a lab coat studies a spoon --
now dusted with white powder -- under a microscope.

After a moment, he looks up, and gestures at the BB-gun, also
dusted with powder, which lies on the table nearby. The Agent
turns to the man in shadow standing over him.

                    LAB-COAT AGENT
          It's the same fingerprint.

A match is struck. We follow it up to the man's pipe, already
in his mouth. As the match flares it lights up Kent's face.
He smiles diabolically.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Hogarth contentedly slurps the last of his malted through a
plastic straw.  Dean works on a slab of apple pie.

                    HOGARTH
          Hey, Dean?

                    DEAN
          Yeah?

                    HOGARTH
          What <u>is</u> life all about?  For you, I mean.

                    DEAN
          For me? Well...
               (shrugs)
          I guess I'd like to prove there's
          something pure in me, you know?  They say
          the soul is part angel and part monster.
          Sometimes I think life is a chance to set
          the angel free.

                    HOGARTH
          The Giant <u>looks</u> like a monster.  But
          inside he's good. I can tell.

                    DEAN
          I hope you're right, kid.  The world
          could use an angel that size.

                    HOGARTH
          You won't tell anybody about him, will
          you?

                    DEAN
          Nah. He's an outsider. I've got a soft
          spot for outsiders.

EXT. HOGARTH'S HOUSE - DAY

Hogarth comes riding home on his bike.  He parks it at the
side of the house, and starts to go inside, then hesitates.
He holds out a hand, and feels a drop of rain, looks up at
the clouds... then takes his bike and wheels it toward the
barn instead.

EXT. BARN - DAY

Hogarth opens the barn door, and GASPS.

HOGARTH'S POV:

Kent and the labcoat AGENT sit at a small, improvised lab
table. Nearby are four OTHER AGENTS in suits and ties;
studying maps, monitoring listening equipment, generating
artist conceptions of the giant. They look up, aghast.

                    HOGARTH
          Moooom!

INT. KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

Kent and the agents sit stoically at the breakfast table.
Annie stands facing them with folded arms.  Hogarth stands
nearby, scowling.

                    ANNIE
          So you work for the government?

                    KENT
          That's right.

A long PAUSE...

                    ANNIE
          <u>Our</u> government?

                    KENT
          Of course.  Annie, please, let me
          explain.  Every once in a while things
          happen to people that just can't be
          rationalized in a conventional way. The
          Unexplained Phenomena Department was
          created to respond to the bizarre, the
          strange, the--well, <u>unexplainable</u> events
          that happen every day all across this
          great land. From the mountains to the
          prairies, to the oceans--

                    ANNIE
               (interrupts)
          Do you actually work in Washington?

                    KENT
          Yes indeed. Washington D.C...

As Kent begins to wax on about his work, we CUT TO:

FLASHBACK: WASHINGTON D.C. - MORNING

Kent strides briskly through the crisp morning air, making
his way through many equally ambitous go-getters on their way
to do the nations work.  Familiar Washington monuments fill
the background.

                    KENT (V.O., CONT'D)
          ...if you're of a mind to be a mover and
          a shaker, it's the only place to be.

FLASHBACK: GOVERNMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Kent enters an impressive government building. While most of
the workforce heads <u>up</u> the massive marble stairs, Kent heads
<u>down</u> the narrow stairs off to the side.

                    KENT (V.O., CONT'D)
          A place where an individual with pluck
          and ambition can really get ahead...

FLASHBACK: GOVERNMENT BUILDING SUBLEVEL - NARROW HALLWAY

Kent walks down the endless row of identical doors, stopping
in front of one labeled "UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA DEPT." Kent
unlocks the door and enters a sparse, windowless office not
much larger than the desk in the center of it.

                    KENT (V.O., CONT'D)
          ...safe in the knowledge that the vast
          resources of the U.S. Government are at
          ones disposal.

FLASHBACK: KENT'S OFFICE

Kent sits idly at his desk, evenly spacing a row of sharpened
pencils across the desktop. Clearly there's no action here.

                    KENT (V.O., CONT'D)
          Although we're simply inundated with
          calls, we limit ourselves to only the
          most demanding cases. It's a challenge, I
          won't deny it.

The phone finally RINGS and Kent SEIZES it hungrily...

FLASHBACK: APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

A couple of slack-jawed yokels gape as Kent pulls a large
deflated baloon down from a tree, "U.S. WEATHER SERVICE"
stenciled on its side. Kent displays it to them, glaring.
They grin sheepishly.

                    KENT (V.O., CONT'D)
          I could tell you many strange stories,
          but unfortunately, all of them are
          classified.

RESUME ANNIE'S KITCHEN - KENT &amp; COMPANY

Kent leans back in his chair, his story told.

                    KENT
          I hope that helps to calm some of your
          worries, Annie. And you, too, Hogarth.
          Hogarth?

The Agents all look around. Hogarth is nowhere to be seen.

                    KENT
          You're supposed to be watching him!

The Agents hustle out of the room.

                    KENT
               (then smiling, to Annie)
          For his own good, of course.

EXT. ENORMOUS GATES OF IRON - DAY

                    HOGARTH
          Open the blast doors!

The massive gates open: Hogarth, wearing a space helmet and
carrying a plastic ray gun, walks through. WIDEN TO REVEAL:
the gates are actually the giant's two hands.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          Level two. Commander Thruster to base...
          I have found the escape vehicle.

The giant's hand takes him up, up... to a junk car atop a big
junk pile.  Hogarth climbs in, grabs the wheel.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          Main engines: 1, 2, and 3! Blast off!

The giant grabs the car and "flies" it around.

ANGLE ON - DEAN'S HOUSE

Dean sits on his porch, watching.

BACK TO - THE GIANT

Hogarth's face compresses from the G-forces.  He looks green.

                    HOGARTH
          We're landing... we're landing!

From his porch Dean watches, grins.  The car "lands", Hogarth
stumbles out, dizzy.  The giant CHORTLES.

                    HOGARTH (CONT'D)
          Only one creature could create such
          destruction. The hideous, man-eating
          killing machine... ROBOTRON!

Hogarth waits. The Giant just stands there, staring at him.

                    HOGARTH
               (impatienly)
          Robotron...

                    GIANT
          Roarrrr....

                    HOGARTH
          No, no, no. <u>Bigger</u>...!

                    GIANT
          ROOAARRRR!!!!!

                    HOGARTH
          Good!  Okay, Robotron... take THIS!!!

He whips his toy gun out, aims it at the Giant and pulls the
trigger. It WHINES and sparks.

Suddenly the Giant freezes. His eyes lock on the gun, and a
reddish glow comes into his eyes.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          When I zap you, you're supposed to fall
          down.  Remember?  Like I told you...

With his eyes still glowing, the Giant reaches out both
hands, zombie-like, towards Hogarth.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          Hey...

The hands begin closing around Hogarth, who is beginning to
panic.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          Wait a minute! It's me, Hogarth...

He sees that the Giant is staring at his gun, and quickly
slips it behind his back.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          Your <u>friend</u>!

The Giant freezes. The red fades from his eyes.  Then he
looks at his hands which are closed threateningly around
Hogarth.

                    GIANT
          (GASP OF SHOCK)

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          Hey, it's okay. I know you didn't mean
          it.  But, uh, maybe that's enough playing
          for now.

Hogarth gets up and heads for Dean's house. As he turns away
from the Giant, we see that he wears a look of deep concern.

EXT. DEAN'S HOUSE

Hogarth takes a seat on the porch beside Dean, who is
scanning the hills with binoculars.

                    DEAN
          You're sure you weren't followed?

                    HOGARTH
          Yeah. It's not too hard to lose those
          guys.

                    DEAN
          Don't get cocky.  Even guys in suits can
          learn.

                    HOGARTH
          Why do they want to get him, anyway?
          Just because he's different?

                    DEAN
          That's generally all it takes.

                    HOGARTH
          They don't even know him, and they just
          assume he's dangerous.

They stare out at the Giant, as he opens a car hood, plucks
out the engine, eats it, and throws away the "shell."

                    DEAN
          Yeah. I just hope they're wrong.

                    HOGARTH
               (suspicious)
          What do you mean?

                    DEAN
          Look, I saw what happened out there just
          now.  When you drew a gun on him, he got
          a look in his eye...

                    HOGARTH
          It's not his fault!  He can't help it.

                    DEAN
          That's what worries me. We don't know
          what he's capable of. On the surface he
          may be gentle, but on the inside he could
          be a killer.

The Giant looks up curiously. Hogarth shushes Dean.

                    HOGARTH
               (whispering)
          Don't use that word around him!

                    DEAN
          Why not?

                    HOGARTH
          Because he <u>cares</u>. I can't explain it,
          but... he cares about what he is. He's
          getting so he can understand all kinds of
          stuff now.  If he hears you use that word
          around him...

                    DEAN
          Okay, okay. I'm just saying, be careful.
               (pause)
          So... have we got a plan here?  I mean,
          he can't stay here forever.

                    HOGARTH
               (sadly)
          I know...

                    DEAN
          The longer he stays, the better their
          chance of finding him.  We've got to get
          him out of here, Hogarth.

                    HOGARTH
          How?  He's a little too big to smuggle
          out in a suitcase.

                    DEAN
          We could do it in pieces.

                    HOGARTH
          You mean take him apart?

                    DEAN
          You think he'd go for that?  I've got a
          junk-truck -- I'm always hauling scrap.
          In half a dozen trips, we could get him
          to Canada.  There are places in the
          Yukon, old mining sites, no one around,
          plenty of metal.  He could roam the earth
          and live off the land... sounds pretty
          good, actually.

Hogarth thinks about it.

                    HOGARTH
          When?

                    DEAN
          The sooner the better. Tonight if
          possible.

                    HOGARTH
          <u>Tonight</u>???  But I only just met him a
          couple days ago!
               (pleading)
          At least wait until tomorrow...

Dean looks at the Giant, lounging peacefully in the junkyard.

                    DEAN
          Alright, I guess one more day won't make
          a difference.

INT.  HOGARTH'S BEDROOM  -  NIGHT

R&B; BLARES: Little Richard.  Hogarth draws pictures of the
giant, they're <u>good</u>.  He hides the pictures from view,
carefully covering them with a book before EXITING the room.

INT. KITCHEN

Hogarth sharpens some pencils with the sharpener mounted on
the inside of the broom closet.

INT. HOGARTH'S BEDROOM

Hogarth returns, goes to his desk, stops stunned: the giant
drawings are <u>uncovered</u>.  Eyes wide, Hogarth looks around his
room: everything looks slightly askew, as if it's been...
<u>searched</u>.

Hogarth's neck-hair tingles.  He stares at the his bedroom
door, slowly pulls it toward him... REVEALING:

<u>KENT</u> standing behind it... smiling.

                    KENT
          Surprise.

                    HOGARTH
          Kent.  What are you doing in my room?

He holds up a 45 RPM record, still in its sleeve.

                    KENT
          Just being friendly.  And all that that
          implies.  I know how you kids like rocky
          roll, so-

He goes to the phonograph, and puts it on the platter...

                    HOGARTH
          Pat Boone...?

                    KENT
          Yeah, baby.  It's got that jungle rhythm,
          but you can understand the words...

                    HOGARTH
          Uh.... thanks.

Kent starts to undulate awkwardly to the music...

                    KENT
          Come on, Hogarth.  Let's do the happy
          monkey.  You know the one I mean...

Hogarth edges toward the door, Kent follows, still dancing...

                    KENT (cont'd)
          Friends, Hogarth, that's what we ought to
          be. But friends don't keep secrets from
          each other.

                    HOGARTH
          I don't know what you're talking about...

                    KENT
          You don't. Well, let me tell you a little
          story.  Your mom says you like 'em.

Kent steps in front of the doorway, his smile now chilling.

                    KENT
          Once there was a boy who walked into a
          forest.  He wanted to take a picture of a
          metal-eating giant -- but lo and behold,
          the giant ate his camera alllll up!!

Hogarth looks baffled.

                    HOGARTH
          How did you -- ?

                    KENT
          Because in the process, the Giant snapped
          a picture of himself.
               (holds up a roll of film)
          And the little boy brought the film home.

Hogarth lunges for the roll of film.

                    HOGARTH
          Give it back!

Kent dangles the film over Hogarth's head for a moment, then
drops it into Hogarth's hands.  Hogarth looks at it.

                    HOGARTH
          Empty...

Kent slips a black-and-white photo from his coat, and hands
it to Hogarth. It shows the Giant's face, its mouth wide
open.

                    KENT
          The Army arrives in twenty-four hours,
          Hogarth. Just thought you'd like to know.

Kent dances out of the room.  Hogarth stares, helpless.

INT. HOGARTH'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Kent puffs on his pipe, as Annie knits.  Hogarth sits in a
chair studying them.  Kent breaks the silence.

                    KENT
          Well, isn't this a fine way to spend an
          evening?  We're like one big happy
          family...

Hogarth looks up, staring darkly at Kent.

                    HOGARTH
          You're <u>not</u> family. And when my Dad finds
          out you sat in his chair, he'll hunt you
          down like a dog--

                    ANNIE
          Hogarth!

Kent turns to Annie.  He makes a half-hearted gesture of
getting out of his chair.

                    KENT
               (starting to rise)
          I'm sorry, should I...?

                    ANNIE
          No, no, don't get up.  My husband --
          Hogarth's father -- he's... he <u>was</u> an
          Air Force Pilot in Korea.  A casualty.

                    HOGARTH
          He's coming back.

Ignoring Hogarth, Kent puts on a look of deep sympathy, and
turns to Annie.

                    KENT
          I'm <u>so</u> sorry.

                    HOGARTH
          No you're not!

                    ANNIE
          <u>Hogarth</u>!

                    HOGARTH
          But, Mom, this guy doesn't care about
          anything -- cats like him race around,
          play the game, chase money, chase
          power...but he keeps buttering you up so
          you won't see that!

                    ANNIE
          Hogarth, that is enough!  I think you owe
          our guest an apology.

                    KENT
               (chuckling)
          Oh, now, there's no need for that.
          Hogarth is right in a way.  I'm certainly
          ambitious. Yes...
               (looks pointedly at Annie)
          Ambitious, career-minded, stable --

                    HOGARTH
          He's doing it again!

Kent gives Hogarth a patronizing smile.

                    KENT
          Hogarth. I would have thought a good
          American boy like yourself would have
          more respect for the work I do. The world
          has become a dangerous place, you know.
          The balance of power is delicate.  I
          gather information.  And the side that
          has the information is the side that will
          win.

Hogarth fixes his eyes on Kent with an intensity that's
unnerving.

                    HOGARTH
          They say the soul is part angel and part
          monster.  One look at you and I know the
          monster is gonna win.

                    ANNIE
          That's it. You either apologize or go
          right up to bed right now!

Hogarth throws up his hands and marches out of the room.

                    ANNIE
          Honestly, I don't know <u>where</u> he's getting
          these wild ideas.  He's starting to talk
          like that beatnik...

                    KENT
          Beatnik...?

INT.  HOGARTH'S BEDROOM  -  NIGHT

Hogarth is in bed, the lights are out. Annie appears in his
doorway, silhouetted by the light in the hall. She lingers
for a moment, thoughtful...

                    ANNIE
          Have you been out at the junkyard,
          Hogarth?

                    HOGARTH
               (after a long pause)
          Which junkyard?

                    ANNIE
          The only junkyard. Dean's junkyard.

                    HOGARTH
               (another pause)
          If I had ...would you be mad at me?

                    ANNIE
          No...
               (more quietly)
          ...no.
               (sad smile)
          Tell him "hi" for me.

She EXITS.  Hogarth stares at the ceiling... and sighs.

EXT. TOWN - NEXT DAY

A convoy of Army vehicles is pouring into town. Kent watches
them enter, euphoric.  He glances at his watch, and
remembering an appointment, rushes off.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

An Army General sits at a booth, studying a map.  Kent sits
across from his, positively glowing with pride.

                    GENERAL
          Hills, valleys, woods, ravines.  Lot of
          places to hide, around here.

                    KENT
          Yes, it's remarkable isn't it, sir?

Kent looks around at the various coffee-shop Busybodies, and
speaks loudly, for their benefit.

                    KENT (CONT'D)
          That one man, working alone, could have
          single-handedly found a <u>monster</u> in a
          place like this?

The Busybodies coo and murmum amongst themselves.

                    GENERAL
               (still studying map)
          Hard to know where to start, really...

                    KENT
          Well, sir, perhaps I can be of some help
          in that regard. You see, I've had my eye
          on an odd little boy who seems to be
          connected to the creature in question.
          And I have reason to believe he's been
          spending some time at a local scarpyard.

From behind the counter, Annie looks sharply at Kent, finally
understanding his attentions.

                    GENERAL
          Can you take me there?

                    KENT
          But of course, sir.
               (loudly, for the busybodies)
          When a <u>five-star general</u> needs my help,
          I'm only too eager to oblige.

Annie comes by and refills their coffee.

                    ANNIE
          I'm the mother of that "odd" little boy.

                    KENT
               (uncomfortable)
          Oh yes, ahem.

                    ANNIE
          And if you're going up to the junkyard,
          I'm coming along.

INT. DEAN'S STUDIO - DAY

Dean is welding a sculpture of a hooded executioner. Instead
of an axe, the executioner wields a flag -- part Hammer and
Sickle, part Stars and Stripes.  There's a knock at his door.

                    DEAN
          Come in.

In walks the General and Kent followed by a few soldiers.
Annie comes in last.  Dean takes off his welding goggles, and
studies all the uniforms.

                    DEAN
          I assume you're here for the Lenny Bruce
          albums.

                    KENT
          Watch the wise cracks, Beatnik. We
          represent America.

                    DEAN
          We <u>all</u> represent America, man.

                    GENERAL
          Sir, my name is General Shannon Rogard.
          We have reason to believe you are
          harboring a large...
               (finding this hard to swallow)
          ... creature whose interest run counter
          to those of the United States. Do you
          deny it?

                    DEAN
               (shrugs)
          Hey, man, if a cat needs to flop, my pad
          springs eternal.

The General and the Soldiers exchange puzzled glances. One of
them leans towards the General and speaks in hushed tones.

                    SOLDIER
          As I understand it, sir, a "cat" is a
          member of the counter-culture.

                    GENERAL
          What rank?

                    SOLDIER
          Well...

As the General and the Soldiers continue to confer, Annie
steps forward and speaks to Dean.

                    ANNIE
          Is Hogarth here? Is he alright? These
          people say he may be in some kind of
          trouble.

                    DEAN
          He's not here, Annie. But he <u>is</u> alright.
               (then, gently)
          Believe me, I would never let anything
          happen to that little guy.

Annie and Dean share a look.  Kent sees this and loses his
cool.

                    KENT
          Alright, I've had enough!

He turns to the soldiers.

                    KENT (CONT'D)
          You and you! Start rummaging around! Tip
          some tables over! Kick open doors!  Break
          stuff! You know the drill!

Kent claps his hands.  The soldiers don't move.

                    DEAN
               (to Kent)
          We all hear you yacking, daddy-o, but no
          one's listening.

Kent seethes.

                    KENT
               (under his breath)
          Not yet.  Not yet.

Annie looks from one to the other, comparing.

INT. WOODS - DAY

The Giant strolls through the forest, with Hogarth on his
shoulder.

                    HOGARTH
          I know this is hard for you to
          understand, but...well, it might be a
          real long time before we get to hang out
          like this again.

The Giant is oblivious to anything but the beauty of the day.
He turns his face up towards the sun as it ours through the
trees.  Birds are singing. All is peaceful.

                    GIANT
          (CONTENTED SOUND)

                    HOGARTH
          Yeah, it <u>is</u> beautiful, isn't it?

Through a patch in the trees, they spot a deer.

                    GIANT
          (CURIOUS SOUND)

                    HOGARTH
          It's a deer.  "Deeeer."

                    GIANT
          Deeeer...

The Giant takes a step towards it.  It darts away.  Hogarth
points.

                    HOGARTH
          That way!

Full of childlike curiosity, the Giant follows, and a game of
hide and seek begins.  Hogarth laughs happily, as they dart
in and out of the trees. At last he finds the deer grazing in
a clearing. The Giant is FASCINATED.

                    HOGARTH
               (whisper)
          Shhhhh... let's get closer...

The Giant tries to sneak nearer, leaning on a pair of tall
trees, which begin to teeter. He grabs one, and as he quietly
pushes it back into place... <u>the other crashes to the ground</u>.
The treetop lands near the deer,  who bolts away from it and
directly toward the Giant--almost into the Giant's foot.

The deer STOPS, puzzled by the strange metal obstacle. He
looks up... right to the Giant's face.  The Giant SMILES--

--which SPOOKS the deer, who darts off in the other direction.

The Giant reaches out and catches it, in one huge hand, like
a kid trapping a butterfly.

                    HOGARTH
          You caught it!

The Giant laughs and opens his hand. The deer lies
motionless.  The Giant and Hogarth look stunned.  The Giant
tenderly lays the deer down on the ground, kneels, and nudges
the deer with a big finger.  Nothing.  It doesn't move.

                    HOGARTH
          It's... dead.

                    GIANT
          Deh...?

There is a long silence. The Giant nudges the deer again.

                    HOGARTH
               (suddenly vehement)
          Don't do that! It's <u>dead</u>. Okay?? That
          means it's not going to move! It's gone!
          And it's not coming back, understand??
               (softly, tears flowing)
          It's not ever going to come back...

It begins to snow, softly.  From high above, through the trees,
the boy and the giant stare down at the lifeless deer. They bow
their heads in sorrow.

EXT. JUNKYARD - LATER

The snow falls harder now.  The depressed giant sits on a
hillside, snow piling up on his motionless bulk, staring out
into the forest.  Dean and Hogarth watch him, worried.

                    DEAN
          This is bad.  This is very bad. The
          Army's on it's way. We've got to get him
          out of here!

                    HOGARTH
          He doesn't know how to think about it.

                    DEAN
          You've got talk to him.  You've got to
          get through to him.

                    HOGARTH
          Me? I don't know about this stuff...

                    DEAN
          You know as much as anyone does, kid. And
          he trusts you.  Speak from your heart.
          It's the only chance we've got.

Hogarth looks at the Giant.

                    HOGARTH
          Alright.  I'll try.

He walks over to the Giant, climbs up his leg, and sits on
his knee.  The Giant turns and looks at Hogarth, with weary
eyes. Hogarth sighs.

                    HOGARTH
          It wasn't your fault.

No response from the Giant.

                    HOGARTH
          Things die.  It's part of life.

Hogarth reaches for the overhanging branch of a nearby tree
and picks two leaves -- a brown on and a green one.  He holds
up the green leaf.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          Life...

He holds up the brown leaf.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          ...and death...

He gestures at the forest around him.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          ...they're part of the way things are.

He points at the Giant and shakes his head.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          <u>You</u> didn't make it that way. Do you
          understand? It's not your fault.

The Giant gazes at Hogarth for a beat, then takes the leaves
from the boy's hands and studies them. Hogarth hops down and
stands by Dean.

                    DEAN
          What's he doing?

                    HOGARTH
          He's thinking. It's not an easy thing to
          understand.

Dean looks at Hogarth with empathy.

INT.  THE ARMY'S TEMPORARY COMMAND CENTER - DAY

Kent is on the phone with the chief. He's visably PALE.
(INTERCUT the following with the CHIEF in Washington, D.C.)

                    KENT
          But Sir... you're making a big mistake!
          We're close... I have a real gut fee--

                    CHIEF
               (CUTTING HIM OFF)
          Mansley, if I hear about your gut
          feelings one more time I'm going to vomit
          through the phone lines!! The press has
          got ahold of this thing and now I'm a
          laughing stock for spending tax dollars
          on your IDIOTIC plan!  I'm pulling those
          troops out THIS MINUTE!  Before MY career
          is as dead as YOURS!!

The Chief SLAMS the receiver down so hard, it hurts Kent's
hand in Maine.

EXT. DEAN'S JUNKYARD - DAY

The Giant still ponders.  Just then, a pair of Army planes
comes into view.  We hear a beeping sound.

                    HOGARTH
          Oh no...

                    DEAN
          What is it?

The panels on the Giant's arms slide open, and the strange
tracking device pops out again.

                    HOGARTH
          I was going to tell you...

The Giant looks confused as another panel opens, and what
appears to be a rocket launcher pokes out, tracking the
planes. As they pass, the weapons recede and the panels
close.  The Giant looks distressed.

                    DEAN
          Good God, Hogarth he's armed??! How could
          you keep this from me?

                    HOGARTH
          Would you have let him stay?

                    DEAN
          No!

                    HOGARTH
          That's why.

                    DEAN
          Oh, man. Oh man, Hogarth! This is
          serious! What are we doing?? He's not
          some lost puppy...he's a weapon!!

Dean is pointing at the Giant now. Hogarth sees the Giant
watching Dean with eyes wide.

                    HOGARTH
          Dean, shh--

                    DEAN
          He's a machine, Hogarth!  He was made,
          designed--to <u>kill</u>!

The Giant stands up.  He looks at himself, and then at Dean.
And then, with a terrible roar, he runs away.  Dean and
Hogarth share a look of panic.

                    DEAN
          This is bad.

                    HOGARTH
          We gotta find him!

                    DEAN
          Come on!

They run for his house.

EXT. ROCKWELL - SAME TIME

Kent watches in despair as the ARMY pulls out of Rockwell,
taking his credibility, and hopes for the future, with them.

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The Giant wanders through the falling snow, deeply disturbed
and depressed, not knowing, or caring, where he's going.

INT. DEAN'S GARAGE

He wheels a motorcycle out.  Hogarth jumps in the sidecar.

EXT.  THE DEEP WOODS  -  DAY

The Giant blindly marches on, agitated, grieving.

EXT.  DEAN'S MOTORCYCLE - MOVING - DAY

Dean and Hogarth speed into the driving snow, following the
Giant's quickly filling footprints.

                    DEAN
          He's headed right toward town.

EXT.  THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN  -  EVENING

FILLING THE SCREEN: a woman SCREAMS.  <u>LOUD</u>.

REVERSE: the Giant peers down at a tiny woman, her TINY
SCREAM barely heard from his viewpoint.  He waves meekly.

BACK TO: the woman SCREAMS... runs in, SLAMS the door.

The Giant wonders...  He looks behind him, is something back
there...?  Nope....  He shrugs.  He wanders on, the streets
largely deserted, the snow falls heavily.

LOOKING IN A SECOND-STORY WINDOW

A TODDLER watches a TV monster movie.  Bored, he looks out
the window... and sees a <u>real</u> monster.  He blinks, isn't sure
whether to be scared or not.

The Giant sees the kid staring at him.  The Giant smiles, and
waves.  The kid grins, waves back.

The kid HOLLERS, in silence.  TWO OLDER KIDS join him at the
window, look out, see a waving giant.  They look stunned, and
wave back.  One YELLS a silent "MOM!".

MOM appears at the window.  The Giant waves.  She turns
white, SCREAMS silently, YANKS down the window shade.

The Giant blinks, disturbed.

BOW-WOW-WOW!  He looks down: a tiny TERRIER BARKS ferociously
at him, then NIPS at his foot... and YELPS in pain.

                    GIANT
          Rock.

The giant reaches down for the terrier: it YIPES and runs
away.  The giant looks disappointed.

He looks up: nearby, several VILLAGERS stand in the falling
snow, staring up at him.  He waves.

The villagers run inside, SLAM their doors.  The giant MOANS,
depressed.

WITH DEAN AND HOGARTH - MOVING

In the snow, Dean drives flat-out.  In the side-car, Hogarth
hangs on for dear life. They blow past--

KENT... going the other way. Kent SLAMS on his breaks, his
suspicions aroused, and hangs a U-TURN, almost colliding with
the last of the TROOPS. Their truck screeches to a stop. Kent
jumps out, waving his arms as he runs up to the driver.

                    KENT
          STOP!  I know this'll sound crazy, but--

THE MIDDLE OF TOWN

A scene out of a 50's horror movie: a dozen VILLAGERS run
SCREAMING from a huge giant behind them....

But <u>this</u> giant just stands there, his shoulders droop,
heartsick.  He realizes that <u>everyone</u> is terrified of him...
and he doesn't understand <u>why</u>.

If the Iron Giant could cry, he would.

SIRENS sound in the distance, getting closer.

The giant turns around and heads back out of town, toward the
junkyard and home.

<u>SHREEEEEK</u>!  Right in front of him, A WOMAN SCREAMS, her hands
fly up... releasing her baby carriage which rolls right up
against the giant's feet.

The giant looks down... sees an INFANT inside.  The baby COOS
and waves at the giant, who grins and waves back.  At last, a
friendly face!

Two police cars SCREECH up, TWO COPS leap out and fumble out
their guns.  The mother SCREAMS.

                    MOTHER
          It's got my baby!

The cops stare, stunned, at the Giant towering over the baby.
One cop RADIOS for help.  Annie exits the diner, sees the
scene, joins the crowd, terrified, watching:

The Giant seems to be... <u>making</u> <u>faces</u> at the baby.  The
fascinated giant CHORTLES and leans way down to look closer
at the GIGGLING infant: which looks threatening to onlookers.
The mother SCREAMS.

                    MOTHER
          Shoot it!

Alarmed, the cops raise their guns.  Dean and Hogarth SCREECH
up on Dean's motorcycle....

                    HOGARTH
          No!

The cops FIRE.  The bullets bounce off the Giant's sides.
The Giant turns: what was that?  His eyes zero in on the
cop's guns--and turn BRIGHT RED.  With a heavy machinery
WHIRR ...

... a FUTURISTIC WEAPON springs up out of the Giant's right
arm, which he instinctively swings toward the police car.
Cops and soldiers leap aside as a GREEN RAY shoots and--

KA-THOOOOOOM!

--the police car EXPLODES in an unearthly blast that sends a
blue fireball roiling into the sky. The Giant's arm jerks
round, catching the helpless cops and soldiers in its cross-
hairs...

...but the Giant's eyes suddenly clear: alarmed, he knocks
his arm aside before it FIRES: KA-THOOOOOOM! The RAY rips
through the air, destroying a grove of trees on the far side
of town.

The Giant RECOILS, horrified by his own destructive power.
He forces the gun back into his arm and rushes away,
vanishing into the night.

Dean and Hogarth exchange glances. They turn to go and---

--run straight into KENT and a group of SOLDIERS.  They've
seen the whole thing, and Kent has never looked more SMUG.

                    KENT
               (to soldiers)
          Seize them.

The soldiers do as they're told, grabbing Dean and Hogarth.

                    HOGARTH
          Hey! Get your hands off! Let go of me!
          You're hurting me! Help!!

As they pass through frame we see that KENT is holding a
MICROPHONE, and recording Hogarth's protestations on a tape
recorder. He SMILES.

EXT. FOREST  -  DUSK

The Giant hides, anxious and watchful. Then he hears a
distant sound echoing through the trees, a voice...

                    HOGARTH
          Let go of me! You're hurting me! Help!!

That's all the Giant needs to hear. He's off... moving
swiftly through the dark forest in the sounds direction.

EXT.  ROCKWELL  -  DUSK

The Giant moves to the edge of the forest, and pauses
distrustfully.  The town is oddly still.

Hogarth's voice can still be heard calling for help. Then the
Giant spies--

HOGARTH-- gagged and tied to the top of a radio tower on the
roof of the five story Cross building, the tallest in
Rockwell.  He squirms.

The moment the Giant starts to move toward the building the
Army (camouflaged) OPENS FIRE. Suddenly the Giant is being
hit from all sides (rifles, machine guns, bazookas): ARMOR
(which we haven't seen before) slides out of his body and
locks into a covering around him.

A stray shot takes out of chunk of the base of the tower that
Hogarth is tied to, and it starts to TOPPLE.

The Giant SEES THIS and rushes directly into the line of fire
to SHIELD Hogarth from being crushed by the tower. The Giant
pulls the tower loose, sliding Hogarth into his metal hand.

                    GENERAL
          He's got the boy!!  HOLD YOUR FIRE!

                    KENT
          It's KILLED the boy!! Don't let it get
          away!!

A wall of artillery closes the entrance to town... and begins
to fire away at Giant. The Giant looks toward the sea--but
sees armed ships out there, their guns pointed toward land.

Once again, various weapons begin to pop out of the Giant's
arms. He presses them back in. He turns, and RUNS straight at
the wall of Artillery. And JUMPS OVER IT.

Everyone stares gape-jawed, then quickly tries to swivel
their guns in the opposite direction. But the GIANT is
already GONE. The general calls to the AIR FORCE.

                    GENERAL
          This is General Rogard!  Code red!
          Repeat-- code red!

COUNTRYSIDE - MOVING WITH THE GIANT

The Giant, carrying Hogarth, hustles through the snow,
slipping occassionally, but moving with surprising swiftness.
Behind them, JET FIGHTERS appear on the far horizon.

And in a moment they're on top of them... strafing the ground
with machine gun fire, launching rockets, etc...

The Giant bursts through the trees, and suddenly finds
himself on a two-lane highway--about to step on cars and the
terrified people driving them!

The Giant SIDESTEPS to avoid them, losing his balance at full
run and SLAMMING into the snowy ground --SLIDING thunderously
for the better part of a mile, and cutting a very large swath
through whatever happens to be in the way.

EXT. ROCKWELL STREET - DAY

Annie struggles with two Agents, who hustle her into a car.

                    ANNIE
          Let me go! I have to get to my son! What
          is going on?

                    AGENT #1
          I'm afraid that's classified, ma'am.

                    ANNIE
          Classified?  What do you mean?

She tries the door. It won't open. She pounds on the window.

                    ANNIE
          Open this door! Hey!

And then she notices that she's not alone in the car. Beside
her is Dean, who sits with his head in his hands.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE

The Giant tries to swat at the fighter planes as they fly
overhead, but they are just out of his reach. He grabs a
fallen tree, swinging it like a club, clipping off most of
one fighters' WINGS. The pilot EJECTS just before the jet
plows into the earth, bursting into a fireball.

More and more fighters appear --too many-- BLASTING away at
the Giant. He veers toward a high cliff--and JUMPS---

--INTO THE SEA

UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Imagine a five story building smashing into the sea and you
might conjure the explosion of bubbles caused by the Giant...
only moments before the fighters swoop the waters surface,
strafing it with machine gun fire. The bullets pull-up short,
impotently.  The Giant feels safe. Then he looks to his hand--

<u>Hogarth is drowning</u>.

The Giant is stuck; he can't surface because of the jets, but
he can't let Hogarth drown. He reaches up with his other
hand, cupping it above the waters surface, and pulls it down
below, allowing Hogarth to breathe in the pocket of air.

Just then-- A SUB catch the Giant in their sights. They
launch torpedoes. The Giant dodges them, but they explode
into the base of the cliffs not far away--causing an
avalanche of rock to splash into the ocean--which the Giant
has to dodge while still holding Hogarth in his pocket of
air.

More ships appear and they launch DEPTH CHARGES, which
explode around the fleeing giant, convincing him he'd best
take his chances above water.

INT. AGENT'S CAR

Annie stares out the window.  Dean slumps in his seat.

                    DEAN
          It's my fault.  I should've done
          something... something different...

                    ANNIE
          I know the feeling.

                    DEAN
          I just thought the kid could use a
          friend.

                    ANNIE
          You were right, Dean.  You were right.

THE CLIFFS

With great difficulty, the Iron Giant climbs the rocky,
crumbling cliff face one-handed as the military keeps the
heat on. Finally, unable to find purchase on the cliff face,
the Giant stays on a small outcropping, turning to face the
onslaught.

Military helicopters descend into view, shining blindingly
bright spotlights on the Giant, who is now showing a lot of
wear and tear.

Weapons break out like hives all over the Giant's body; it's
clear that the Army is about to get the worst end of the
deal.

CLOSE - THE GIANT'S FACE

Something changes in the Giant; he WILLS the weapons to
retreat back into his body, and--haltingly--they DO.

INSIDE CHOPPER

The pilot trains his weapons on the Giant and shouts into his
radio.

                    PILOT
          We have him in our sights sir!


EXT. TOWN STREET

Kent is rabid.

                    KENT
               (to General)
          What're you waiting for?? FIRE!!

THE CLIFF FACE

The Giant turns-- but he's surrounded.  It looks bad. Then...

... a low RUMBLING SOUND BEGINS... and BUILDS to a ROAR...

                    HOGARTH
          What's happening...?

                    THE GIANT
          (PUZZLED SOUND)

Both look down; the Giant's feet begin to flame like rockets
as he BLASTS OFF INTO THE NIGHT SKY!

EXT.  THE GIANT FLYING THROUGH THE AIR  -  NIGHT

The Giant and HOGARTH are FLYING... kind of.  They BLAST
along, out of control, the Giant's arms flailing.

                    HOGARTH
          Steer that way!

                    THE GIANT
          (MORE PUZZLED SOUNDS)

                    HOGARTH
          I don't know!!  Point your arms, maybe--
          like Superman!

The Giant does as he's told... and they fly (more or less) in
that direction.  The Giant grins.

                    HOGARTH
          OK!  Now land!
               (Giant looks blank)
          Uh... drop your arms!

The Giant lowers his arms to his sides... and the ROCKETS
SPUTTER out.  The two PLUMMET to the ground.  KA-THUMP!

EXT.  THE WOODS  -  DAY

HOGARTH and the Giant, dazed from their "landing", collect
their wits.  And here come the spotter planes.

EXT. CLIFF - DAY

Hogarth and the Giant stand together, and watch the Army
close in.

                    HOGARTH
          It's no good.  There's too many of them.
          We'll never get away.

He sits down in despair. The Giant sits down too.

                    HOGARTH
          They're going to take you away, Giant.
          There's nothing we can do.

For a long moment they sit in silence. Finally the Giant
speaks.

                    GIANT
          Rock.

                    HOGARTH
               (looks up)
          Huh?

                    GIANT
          Roooock.  Treeee...

Hogarth smiles.

                    HOGARTH
          Yeah.  Remember when I taught you that?

                    GIANT
          Churrrrch. Skoooo saauuugz.

                    HOGARTH
               (laughs)
          That was a great night, too.

                    GIANT
               (quietly)
          Faa-grrrr...

                    HOGARTH
          Yeah...

                    GIANT
          Deeer.

                    HOGARTH
               (tearfully)
          I know. We've been through a lot
          together, haven't we?

He puts his hand in the Giant's hand.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          I'm going to miss you so much.

SUBMARINE PERISCOPE POV

Through a long periscope lens, as the sub rounds the point,
we see the cliff and the Giant come into view.

INT. SUBMARINE

The first mate looks up from the periscope--

                    FIRST MATE
          I've got a visual on the monster, sir!

                    CAPTAIN
          Do we have a clear shot?

                    FIRST MATE
          Not yet, sir.

                    CAPTAIN
          Get closer! Don't surface until the last
          minute!

INT. NAVAL CRUISER - BRIDGE - SAME TIME

                    SPOTTER
          Monster sighted off the port bow!

                    CAPTAIN
          We'll only get one shot!! Full speed
          ahead!

UNDERWATER - THE BAY - CONTINUOUS

The sub begins to RISE to the surface, unaware that the
cruiser is speeding toward the same position.

The cruiser SWERVES to avoid collision, but it's too late;
the cruiser CLIPS the submarine aft, causing a fatal BREACH
that splits the sub.

INSIDE THE SUB

CHAOS!  The ocean RUSHES IN, as electricity ARCS up the
severed wiring of the sub's MISSLE SYSTEM.  It FIRES--!!

EXT. ROCKWELL - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

THREE POLARIS MISSILES break the water surface, one of which
sports a large GASH in its side, its circuitry sparking;
clearly malfunctioning.  Their second stage rockets fire,
causing several clusters of townsfolk to turn to watch,
mouths agape, as the missiles climb up into the night sky.

EXT. CLIFF - DAY

Hogarth and the Giant watch the missiles streak into the sky.

                    HOGARTH
          What's happening-- ?

Hogarth looks out at the sea.  On the decks of one of the
warships, he can see people panicking.

                    HOGARTH
          There must be some mistake.

He looks up at the sky again.  A look of fear comes over him.
He begins to pace.

                    HOGARTH
          Oh no... oh no...

In his voice is a note of desperation we've never heard
before. The Giant seems to notice.  He looks at Hogarth
puzzled, trying to understand.  Hogarth points at the sky.

                    HOGARTH
          The missiles. <u>Missiles</u>!  They're nuclear.
          Nu-cle-ar. When they come down...

He mimes a missile coming down and exploding.

                    HOGARTH (cont'd)
          <u>Death</u>...

The Giant reacts.  Hogarth gestures at the town around him.

                    HOGARTH
          ...<u>everything</u>...

The Giant looks at the sky, then at the town, and after a
moment, back at Hogarth.  He picks up two leaves, one green
and one brown.

He gives Hogarth the green leaf, keeping the brown one for
himself.

                    HOGARTH
          What?  What do you mean? I don't
          understand!

The Giant looks at Hogarth, gently touching the side of his
face with a massive finger. And with that, the Giant blasts
off into the sky.  Hogarth looks at his leaf again, and a
look of dawning comprehension comes over him

EXT. SPACE - UPPER ATMOSPHERE OVER EASTERN U.S. COAST

The Giant BLASTS ALONG at full power to catch up. His radar
tracking, the giant spots the missiles. Suddenly TWO of the
missles' rockets fire, sending them off toward separate
targets on the earth's surface...

...while the DAMAGED MISSLE just FIZZLES, and slowly starts
to drop straight down toward Maine far below.

INT. AGENT'S CAR

Annie and Dean look out the back window.

                    ANNIE
          What is it?

                    DEAN
          Polaris missile, I think.

                    ANNIE
          Shouldn't we get to a shelter?

                    DEAN
          It wouldn't matter.

They look at each for a long, silent beat.  Then he reaches
out and takes her hand.

EXT. ROCKWELL

A deathly HUSH has fallen over all assembled.  Kent, looking
ASHEN, starts slowly backing toward the jeep, and escape.
Without turning around, the General barks loudly at Kent.

                    GENERAL
          This is your party, Mansley.  Don't even
          think about leaving early.  Lieutenant??

The Lieutenant pulls his sidearm and levels it at Kent.  Kent
WINCES, caught.

EXT. SPACE  - UPPER ATMOSPHERE

The Giant takes off after the first missile. He concentrates,
and the panel on his arm opens up, revealing the now familiar
weapon. He FIRES at the distant glare of the missile rockets
... igniting the warhead on the second shot. There is a
blinding FLASH, followed by a shockwave, but the Giant
remains intact.

He doubles back in pursuit of the second missle.  Sighting
it, he FIRES --and MISSES repeatedly, losing valuable time as
he moves closer and closer to the missile.

Finally he hits it. It EXPLODES too near him, pummeling him,
throwing him back. The Giant recovers and tries to shoot the
remaining missile.

EXT. CLIFF

Several jeeps pull up beside Hogarth who is staring at the
sky.  The General and a group of soldiers jump out.  Kent,
flanked by soldiers with pistols on him, sits silently in the
back of the jeep. The Captain scoops up Hogarth in his arms
and stares at the sky as well.

IN SPACE - ABOVE THE ATLANTIC OCEAN

The Giant spots the third missile arcing down toward Maine
and his beloved Rockwell.  He CUTS IN HIS AFTERBURNERS, zooms
toward it.

The giant catches up to the third missile, but his weapons
are CHARRED, unable to fire.  There's only one option left...

WITH THE GIANT

The ROAR of his engines fades into silence as a look of peace
falls over his iron face. He wraps his arms around the nose
of the missile, closing his eyes...

...and slams his fist into the tip of the bomb--

FROM EARTH

The blackness of the night sky goes brilliant WHITE.

EXT.  ROCKWELL  -  NIGHT

Lining the streets, the town people see the brilliant white
sky darken, turn back into night... as one, the crowd CHEERS.

EXT.  OUTER SPACE OVER ASIA  -  NIGHT

Pieces of the giant rain all over the Eastern Hemisphere, in
a spectacular display.

EXT. CLIFF

The General gets the word over his headset:

                    GENERAL
          He did it!

The soldiers cheer. The General approaches Kent, still
flanked by military officers.

                    GENERAL
          As you for you, Mansley.  You're under
          arrest... "and all that that implies".

Kent visably WITHERS.

                    HOGARTH
          But... the giant...

The General looks at Hogarth with great sadness... and shakes
his head.  Hogarth hides his face and SOBS.

The CHEERS TRAIL OFF, as the soldiers, realize the great
sacrifice that the big metal monster has made for them... and
mankind.  The General looks at his men.

                    GENERAL
          Let's go home.

The General carries Hogarth to the Jeep.  Hogarth stares at
the GREEN LEAF in his hand. We CLOSE ON on the leaf and...

						MATCH CUT TO:

THE SAME LEAF

It is now brown. We pull out to reveal that we're in...

HOGARTH'S BEDROOM

Where the leaf sits on Hogarth's bookshelf beside the picture
of his father. We pan out the window to Rockwell itself.
It's springtime. And everything old is new again.

EXT.  ROCKWELL STREETS  -  DAY

Dean and Annie walk hand in hand with Hogarth alongside.
Everyone smiles and waves.  All three are now celebrities,
and even Dean seems well-liked and respected.

The busybodies spot the trio, and whisper to each other.

                    MYRTLE
          Why, don't they make a lovely family!

Dean and Annie exchange a smile.  This time Hogarth smiles
and nods, too. Then something on the ground catches his eye:

A scorched piece of iron.

Hogarth picks it up, examines it, a bittersweet expression on
his face.  Hogarth carefully puts the piece in his pocket,
and looks up into the sky....

EXT.  NORTHERN INDIA  -  NIGHT

A lonely kid from India, SASHI, a tinkerer, sits in his room
working on an electronics project.  It's a poor but well-kept
home.  Out a window, a METEOR plows into their field: KABOOM!

THE METEOR CRATER

Ropes lead down into the crater; PULL BACK TO REVEAL Sashi
has an elephant pulling out the meteor.

                    SASHI
          Pull!

The elephant strains, pulls: it's the head of the Giant.  The
boy leaps into the air, shouting, overjoyed.

INT.  A "BARN" IN INDIA  -  EVENING

In an India-version of Hogarth's barn, Sashi cleans the giant
head.  But it looks dead.

                    INDIA MOTHER
          Shashi!  Dinner!

                    SHASI
          Coming!

Sashi walks out... then CRACKLE!  Lights flicker in the
Giant's eyes... and the eyes light up.

The Giant looks around, comes to his senses, sees his
predicament... and the antenna rises up out of his head.

ANGLES: ALL OVER THE WORLD

--giant parts, wherever they've fallen, suddenly snap to
attention.

Several NUTS and BOLTS dig themselves up out of sand.  The
pieces start hopping away.

Part of a FINGER surfaces in the sea and WORMS toward shore.

A sign by an ocean liner reads "India".  Several parts sneak
up the gangplank.

INT. HOGARTH'S ROOM  -  NIGHT

Hogarth is awakened by a RATTLING SOUND. He looks to see the
scorched PIECE OF IRON on his dresser as it drops to the
floor and starts moving toward his window.  Hogarth BEAMS...

...and opens his window to release it.  MUSIC SOARS as the
boy watches the piece of metal GO, his mind swimming with new
possibilities.

ABOVE THE PLANET

The Giant's scorched HAND orbits listlessly. Suddenly it
WAKENS... and slowly turns away from us.  Burning as it hits
the atmosphere, the hand reaches toward earth...

FADE EVERYTHING TO BLACK... except the tiny flaming dot...



                      THE END
