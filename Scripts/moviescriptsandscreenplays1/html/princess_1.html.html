lying in bed, coughing.  Pale, one sick cookie.  Maybe he's seven or eight or nine.  He holds a remote in one hand, presses it, and the video game moves a little bit.  Then he's hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down.

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.  We're in the present day and this is a middle class house, somewhere in the suburbs.

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>BUTTERCUPS FARM - DAY</H4>

<P>
BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the most beautiful woman in the world.
</P>

<CENTER>BUTTERCUP</CENTER>

<P>
Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup.  And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful.  He gazes at her as she walks away.

She leaves; his eyes stay on her.  She stops, turns -- he manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.

<CENTER>GRANDFATHER</CENTER>

<P>
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, a man of incredible power and bearing, standing in his royal robes on a castle balcony.  Three others standing behind him: an OLD COUPLE with crowns, the aging KING AND QUEEN, and a dark bearded man who seems the Prince's match in strength: this is COUNT RUGEN.

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<P>
THREE MEN, standing close together in the path.  Beyond them can be seen the waters of Florin Channel.  The three men are not your everyday commuter types.  Standing in front is a tiny man with the most angelic face.  He is Sicilian and his name is VIZZINI. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as a blade ofsteel.  His name is INIGO MONTOYA. Beside him is a giant.  His name is FEZZIK.

He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over, touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a scream is all she manages -- unconsciousness comes that fast.  As she starts to fall --

The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board.

<P>
Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse.  There is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill and precision.

<CENTER>VIZZINI</CENTER>
<CENTER>(not stopping or turning)</CENTER>

The horse takes off.  They start for the boat.

<CENTER>VIZZINI</CENTER>

<P>
Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them.

During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very distressed at the insults he's just received.  As Inigo casts off.

Inigo is at the helm, FEZZIK stands near the body of the princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they?  Vizzini sits motionless.  The waves are higher, there are only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds.

			<BLOCKQUOTE>You're sure nobody's following us?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>VIZZINI</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>As I told you, it would be absolutely,

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER>INIGO</CENTER>

It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now.  But the wind whistles.  And the waves pound.  And suddenly it's all gone ominous.

Then --

The moon slips through and --

<P>
Inigo was right -- something is very much there.  A sailboat.  Black.  With a great billowing sail.  Black.  It's a good distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the gap.

Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the swords-crossing "en garde" garbage.
</P>

<P>
No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and there is silence, and as they start to circle --

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>THE TWO MEN,</H4>
<P>
 finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest.
</P>

<P>
Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes so fast it's almost continual.  Inigo presses on, the Man In Black retreating up a rocky incline.

<P>
The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated castle ruin.  No where to go, he jumps to the sand.  Inigo stares down at him.
</P>


<CENTER>INIGO</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa-</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and lands facing his opponent.
</P>

<CENTER>INIGO</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>-- which I have.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain, never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more that that.  This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate" battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly, the action begins going even faster than before as we

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>INIGO. </H4> 
<P>
And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity.  Inigo fights and ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage, keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.
</P>

<CENTER>INIGO</CENTER>
<CENTER>(happy as a clam)</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>You are wonderful!</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>MAN IN BLACK</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you --  I've worked hard to

<P>
The Cliff edge is very close now.  Inigo is continually being forced toward it.
</P>

<CENTER>INIGO</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>I admit it -- you are better than I am.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>MAN IN BLACK</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>Then why are you smiling?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles.
</P>

<CENTER>INIGO</CENTER>

<CENTER>MAN IN BLACK</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>And what is that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>INIGO</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>I am not left-handed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and immediately, the tide of battle turns.
</P>

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>



<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>THE MAN IN BLACK,</H4> <P>stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff edge.  But no use.  Slowly at first, he begins to retreat.  Now faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate.
</P>

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>INIGO. </H4> 
<P>
And the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.
</P>

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<P>
A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigoo -- and in a frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every thrust, lets go with all he has left.  But he fails.  Everything fails.  He tries one or two final desperate moves but they are nothing.
</P>

<CENTER>MAN IN BLACK</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>You're amazing!</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>INIGO</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>I ought to be after twenty years.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar, pinned there under the six fingered sword.

<CENTER>MAN IN BLACK</CENTER>
<CENTER>(hollering it out)</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>There's something I ought to tell you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>INIGO</CENTER>

<CENTER>MAN IN BLACK</CENTER>

<P>
And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully joined.
</P>

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>INIGO.  </H4>
<P>
And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps.  He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control.  And before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked clear out of his hand.
</P>

<P>
Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and scrambles to his sword and we

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>THE MAN IN BLACK</H4>
<P>
 who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the landing where it sticks in perfectly.  Then the Man In Black copies INIGO.  Not copies exactly, improves. He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus performer and dismounts with a 9.7 backflip.
</P>

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>

Dodging, blocking, and again he thrusts forward, faster even than before, and again he slashes but --

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>INIGO.  </H4>

<P>
And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember, and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with the six-fingered sword.
</P>

<P>
On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's feet moving with the grace and speed of a great improvisational dancer.

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>

Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far below the Man In Black can be seen running.  FEZZIK, carrying the Princess, stands alongside.  It's a little later in the morning.

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>A COUPLE OF ROCKS</H4>

Nothing gigantic.  Vizzini points to them.  There is a large boulder nearby.
</P>

<CENTER>VIZZINI</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>Pick up one of those rocks, get behind

As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away.

<CENTER>FEZZIK</CENTER>
<CENTER>(little frown; softly)</CENTER>

He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and we --

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>DISSOLVE TO:</H4>


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>THE MAN IN BLACK, </H4>
<P>
racing up the mountain trail.  Ahead is a bend in the trail.  He sees it, slows.  Then he stops, listening.
</P>

<P>
Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a boulder inches in front of him.
</P>

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>FEZZIK.  </H4>
<P>
He moves into the mountain path.  He has picked up another rock and holds it lightly.
</P>

<CENTER>FEZZIK</CENTER>

<CENTER>MAN IN BLACK</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe you --  So what happens now?</BLOCKQUOTE>

			<BLOCKQUOTE>We face each other as God intended.

<CENTER>FEZZIK</CENTER>
<CENTER>(gently)</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>I could kill you now.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head, takes off his sword and scabard, begins the approach toward the Giant.
</P>

<CENTER>MAN IN BLACK</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>Frankly, I think the odds are slightly 
			in your favor at hand fighting.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>FEZZIK</CENTER>

<P>
He flips the rock away.

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN. </H4>
<P>
The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp.  But it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so much.
</P>

<P>
There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any number of terrific wrestling moves.
</P>

<P>
FEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery.  Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at the Giant.
</P>

<CENTER>MAN IN BLACK</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>Look are you just fiddling around with

<CENTER>FEZZIK</CENTER>

They get set to begin again.  Then suddenly --
</P>

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<P>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>FEZZIK,</H4> as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees, spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.
</P>

<CENTER>FEZZIK</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>You're quick.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>MAN IN BLACK</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>And a good thing too.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>FEZZIK</CENTER>
<CENTER>(getting set for another onslaught)</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>Why do you wear a mask?  Were you burned 
			by acid, or something like that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>MAN IN BLACK</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>Oh no.  It's just that they're terribly 
			comfortable.  I think everyone will be 
			wearing them in the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one behind.  The Man In Black begins to squeeze.  Tighter.
</P>

<CENTER>FEZZIK</CENTER>
<CENTER>(standing, talking as 
he does so)</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>I just figured out why you give me so

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<P>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>FEZZIK,</H4> as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black.
</P>

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<P>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>THE MAN IN BLACK.</H4>  And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous, but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe.
</P>

<CENTER>MAN IN BLACK</CENTER>
<CENTER>(his arms never leave 
FEZZIK's throat)</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>Why is that, do you think?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>FEZZIK</CENTER>
<CENTER>(his voice just beginning to 
get a little strained)</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>Well, I haven't fought just one person 
			for so long.  I've been specializing 
			in groups.  Battling gangs for local 
			charities, that kind of thing.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<P>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>ANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH.</H4>  Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the rough boulder.
</P>

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<P>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>THE MAN IN BLACK. </H4> And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of FEZZIK's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't, he holds on.
</P>


<CENTER>MAN IN BLACK</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>Why should that make such a difference?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>FEZZIK</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>Well ... </BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER>(And now his voice is definitely 
growing weaker) </CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>... you see, you use different moves

<P>
Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished and FEZZIK starts to slowly collapse.

</P>

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<P>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>THE MAN IN BLACK,</H4> holding his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand, halfway makes it, but there is no air.  Back to his knees he falls, holds there for a moment, and pitches down to all fours.  The Man In Black increases the pressure.  FEZZIK tries to crawl.  But there is just no air.  No air.  FEZZIK goes to earth and lies still.
</P>

<H4 ALIGN=RIGHT>CUT TO:</H4>


<P>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>FEZZIK,</H4> as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's heart.  It beats.  The Man In Black stands.

Count Rugen mounted, watches.  Behind him, half a dozen armed WARRIORS, also mounted.  A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless in front.  Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world.  Then again, maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is miming the fencers.

			<BLOCKQUOTE>Now, a clever man would put the poison

<P>
The two of them have by now crossed the pond.

<CENTER>WESTLEY</CENTER>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>So we sailed ashore, took on an

Inigo does.  Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and starts to pump.

Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do, just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left shoulder.

Again, Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.
