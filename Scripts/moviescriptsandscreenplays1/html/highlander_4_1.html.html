</p><p><P ID="act">A FACE reflects in the window glass. It's RACHEL ELLENSTEIN, early 60's now, a graying, maternal beauty.
</p><p><P ID="act">She moves to the front door, reaches out to unlock i.t.
</p><p><P ID="act">It falls open at her touch. Even though the hanging placard is still flipped to "WE’RE CLOSED"

</p><p><p ID="act">Her gaze settles on the one exception to the impeccable order of things. An open wooden case, empty.

</p><p><p ID="act">A MUSIC BOX
</p><p><p ID="act">spools a faint, tinny madrigal.
</p><p><p ID="act">She climbs the stairs, padding softly upward.
</p><p><p ID="act">The music grinds EVER LOUDER in its maddening repetitions. Every so often, it's punctuated by a CHILD'S GIGGLE.
</p><p><p ID="act">AT THE SECOND FLOOR LANDING
</p><p><p ID="act">Rachel edges around the corner. Her breath catches in her throat.  BEFORE HER stands a locked wooden cabinet. It's been cleaved nearly in half by the BROADSWORD that still juts hilt-first from the base of the splintered front panel.  PHOTO ALBUMS and leather-bound DIARIES have been shredded and scattered across the floor--
</p><p><p ID="act">--except for several selected PHOTOGRAPHS, skewered onto the sword tip like a Medieval message spike. Rachel struggles to breathe. Like she's taken that sword in her own gut.
</p><p><p ID="act">INSIDE THE CABINET A TELEVISION flickers with videotape of GRAINY HOME MOVIES.  A LITTLE GIRL (RACHEL) is entranced by a PORCELAIN MUSIC BOX held out by an AGELESS CONNOR MACLEOD.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">YOUNG RACHEL 
<P ID="dia">Let me see, Connor! Let me see!

</p><p><p ID="act">CONNOR with RACHEL outside an English boarding school. In a train station. At her college graduation.

</p><p><p ID="act">In each new clip, Rachel has aged further. Connor has not.
</p><p><p ID="act">Rachel steps up to the broadsword, wraps both hands around the grip and jerks it clean of the cabinet.
</p><p><p ID="act">THE SKEWERED PHOTOGRAPHS (flutterd to the floor like dead leaves)
</p><p><p ID="act">THE VIDEOTAPE ENDS, CLICKS OFF...
</p><p><p ID="act">and a NEW IMAGE burns itself onto the screen in perfect digital clarity. Rachel. Staring back at herself, terror-stricken.
</p><p><p ID="act">She hadn't even noticed it before now. The tiny CAMCORDER on the shelf above the TV with the glowing red light.  
</p><p><p ID="act">MOVE IN ON THE TV as Rachel SLOWLY BACKS AWAY. Keep moving in on the TV until the PIXELS SWIM...
</p><p><p ID="act">THE PHONE RINGS shattering the stillness. The old rotary phone on the little Louis XIV stand. It's not just beckoning her.  It's taunting her.
</p><p><p ID="act">Gathering up the photos and hugging them to her breast, Rachel slowly approaches the phone.  Any second now, you'd expect it to stop ringing, nobody home. But  whoever's on the other end knows better. It keeps right on RINGING. Insistant.  Trembling fingers reach out for the receiver. Slowly lift it off the hook.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">RACHEL

</p><p><p ID="act">BEYOND THE FIRE Connor MacLeod and his young wife, HEATHER, watch from the steps of their simple, isolated home. Connor betrays no emotion. Heather looks on in horror.

<P ID="dia">God help you.
</p><p><p ID="act">FATHER ALASDAIR RAINEY, the local priest and inquisitor, steps inside, bent over a silver cane. He's gross, corpulent and perpetually short of breath. A nasty NOSE BOIL figures prominently in his overall appearance.
</p><p><p ID="act">VILLAGERS of varying stripe crowd nervously behind them.
</p><p><p ID="speaker">FATHER RAINEY 
<P ID="dia">In the name of the Holy See and the rule of law, you are hereby charged, Connor MacLeod, with heresy and the practice of black magic.

</p><p><p ID="act">Connor stirs awake in a centuries-old dungeon, a dark hole, crumbling and damp.
</p><p><p ID="act">VOICES seem to drip through the porous mortar. Taunting, vengeful, expectant.
</p><p><p ID="act">He crosses to the barred window that affords him a narrow, ground-level view of THE TOWN COMMONS  where a well-attended EXECUTION is now underway.
</p><p><p ID="act">Connor squints, craning to make out the identity of the condemned.
</p><p><p ID="act">TOWNSPEOPLE mingle and mill in front of him, obstructing his line-of-sight. 
</p><p><p ID="act">Even as A FAMILIAR VOICE rises above the surrounding chatter.
</p><p><p ID="speaker">JACOB KASE'S VOICE 
</p><p><p ID="dia">The curse that afflicts one generation will invariably pass its mark onto the next. The ties of blood cannot be severed by word or deed, if in fact your blood is that of your son.
</p><p><p ID="act">Several villagers STEP ASIDE to reveal:
</p><p><p ID="act">CONNOR'S MOTHER bound to an UPRIGHT STAKE atop a mound of shorn timber. CONNOR siezes with the impossible horror of recognition.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CONNOR
<P ID="dia">No.. . NO! !
</p><p><p ID="act">JACOB KASE Makes the sign of the cross as he reads from a writ of
execution. He stands atop a primeval CELTIC MONOLITH worn down to the form of a pedestal. Father Rainey wobbles behind him, sniffing ammonia to spell his chronic angina.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">KASE 
<P ID="dia">Through the infinite compassion of our Lord God, you are entitled one final opportunity to renounce all that is unholy, to declare Connor MacLeod not of your loins and help put an end to the darkness that has been cast upon this land. How say you, Caiolin MacLeod?
</p><p><p ID="act">Caiolin lifts her head, pale and beatific.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CAIOLIN 
<P ID="dia">If your god should persecute me into the next world, then I shall simply have to find myself another.
</p><p><p ID="act">Shocked murmers of outrage shudder through the crowd.
Kase steps up and RIPS AWAY Caiolin's cherished silver CRUCIFIX, with its distinctive wooden Christ figure.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">KASE 
<P ID="spkdir">(holding up Caiolin's crucifix) 
<P ID="dia">You won't need this where you're going.
</p><p><p ID="act">CONNOR grabs at the iron window-bars. Shakes them until the mortar chips from their moorings. THE RUDDY-FACED EXECUTIONER solemnly approaches Caiolin. Unseen by the bloodlusting crowd, he takes out a small leather sack and drapes it around her neck by the drawstring. He tucks it under her coarse woolen robe and pats it flush against her chest.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">EXECUTIONER 
<P ID="spkdir">(softly)
<P ID="dia">Black powder. It will make short work of your suffering.
</p><p><p ID="act">Caiolin nods.  He steps down off the pyre. Reaches for a BURNING TORCH. CONNOR strains against the bars like a madman. Mortar continues crumbling until one bar actually RIPS AWAY COMPLETELY.  THE EXECUTIONER touches torch to kindling. It ALIGHTS.  CONNOR tries to squeeze through the window gap. Too tight. So he winds back with the iron bar and swings with mindless fury. Iron strikes unyielding stone, SPARKING and CHIPPING...
</p><p><p ID="act">THE PYRE BENEATH CAIOLIN ENGULFS IN FLAME. Heat ripples her face, distorts her body. CONNOR hammers harder, quicker, louder. Bits of stone fly everywhere. But the bulk of it remains spitefully intact. Still, it's enough to convince ALL FOUR GUARDS to intervene. They throw open the heavy iron door and descend upon Connor with swords and axes. >Wielding the iron bar like a battle mace, Connor splits the first guard's head, catches his sword mid-air and slices into the next. Third guard's axe catches on a ceiling beam. Connor runs him through like an overstuffed feedsack.
</p><p><p ID="act">The fourth guard drops his sword and BOLTS.
</p><p><p ID="act">THE PYRE is now fully ABLAZE. Caiolin looks out through the rippling wall of flame...
</p><p><p ID="act">. . . and smiles weakly.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CAIOLIN 
<P ID="dia">My water horse... 
</p><p><p ID="act">AS CONNOR splits the crowd like a battering ram. He reaches the pyre, hurling flaming timbers aside with his bare hands. Initially stunned, the townsfolk shrink back, watching Connor desperately scatter the fire.  Caiolin buries her face in her shoulder, biting back the agony as... 
</p><p><P ID="act">Sword in hand, Connor stretches upward, hacking away the ropes that bind her, oblivious to the fire now crawling in serpentine coils around his own arms and legs.  Freed of the ropes, Caiolin begins to slump forward.  Connor grabs for her arm as THE BLACK POWDER EXPLODES in a CONCUSSION of FIRE that renders any further hope of rescue futile.
</p><p><p ID="act">Connor stands atop the burning pyre, wicked tongues of flame leaping off his back and shoulders like fiery wings.  He throws back his head and HOWLS to the heavens.  Fire dances across Connor's skin and clothing as he raises his broadsword and steps down into the crowd.
</p><p><p ID="act">PANDEMONIUM breaks out. This isn't just a common witch. This is one of Hell's very own.  Those few foolish enough to attack are cut down where they stand.  The rest scatter in mindless PANIC. Father Rainey blocks Connor's path. Lifts his cross... 
</p><p><p ID="act">. . . as he's CUT DOWN by the blind SLASH of Connor's sword. Connor steps over Rainey's body and keeps coming, driving the mob fleeing into their dwellings.  Kase crouches blustering over Rainey.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">KASE
<P ID="dia">Father... Father, please--
<P ID="spkdir">(tries to staunch the bleeding) 
<P ID="dia">Father--!

<P ID="dia">Who are you...?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">KASE 
<P ID="dia">Your son. It's your son-- Jacob.
</p><p><p ID="act">Rainey stares back as if a veil has suddenly been lifted. And what he now sees terrifies him to death.

<P ID="dia">Who are YOU?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">KASE
<P ID="dia">I'm your--
</p><p><p ID="act">He stops. Rainey's eyes are frozen. Dead.
</p><p><p ID="act">CONNOR returns to the flaming pyre, refueling his rage with the
sight of his mother's blackened corpse. >KASE
</p><p><p ID="act">scoops up a discarded sword, leaps to his feet and CHARGES CONNOR, bellowing like a madman.  >Connor whirls around with his sword, making Kase IMPALE HIMSELF on  the blade. Kase stares wide-eyed and gagging at Connor's smoldering visage-- the depthless black pools of hate that shroud his eyes. It's the last thing Jacob Kase will ever see.  Connor opens his fingers and lets him DROP, the sword hilt still jutting from Kase's chest.  Gathering up several chunks of flaming timber, Connor HEAVES them onto the straw-covered rooftops, setting them instantly ABLAZE.  In short order, the village is transformed into a giant swirling INFERNO.  Silhouetted against the crimson sky, Connor lifts Caiolin's body and turns his back on Glenfinnan for the last time.

</p><p><p ID="act">Easy choice. Monk levels his gun and BLOWS the Jamaican right off his feet.  And sure enough, he GAGS before his next trigger-pull. A very nasty SERRATED BLADE retracts into a wooden hilt. Monk drops in a heap as his assailant, a WIRY ASIAN, turns for the door, joined by the others.  IN THE VERY NEXT INSTANT the heavy oak-and-iron door SWINGS OPEN with a BARRAGE of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE--

only a brief glimpse of a PRIEST‘S COLLAR. Guard #l whips his rifle toward the Stranger. Stranger diverts it with the tip of his sword. Bullets go nowhere. One slash and the guard is gone. Two more slashes and his comrades fall.  Stranger kicks the body of the dead Jamaican as he steps through the open doorway.

He KICKS THROUGH a DOOR into AN INNER ROOM cavernous and dripping, where even the air seems septic. A few dim candles illuminate A DOZEN MEN bound to complicated, almost Giger-esque chairs. Arms, legs and faces have been immobilized by crossing flats of metal BOLTED into flesh and wood. From the wild overgrowth of hair and beard, and the impossibly long, curled fingernails, it's a good guess none of them have moved a muscle in years.
</p><p><p ID="act">Except for a pale CUSTODIAN standing in a corner, trembling silently.  Stranger stands at the threshold, his face obscured by flickering shadows. He scans the living corpses.

THEY BATTLE
in the middle of the shallow river. Nine maniacal thieves against two sporting Immortals.
The spray of water, the slashing of swords and the pounding of hooves all build to an operatic crescendo.
Duncan's improved since Ravenna. He easily scatters three of his adversaries before engaging the blood-crazed LEADER.
This time it's Connor who finds himself in trouble. He tumbles from his horse and goes down, losing his sword in the river.
DUNCAN
suddenly winds back and FLINGS his sword at his opponent like a throwing dagger.

The door CREAKS OPEN, casting a single ribbon of light across the room.
It WIDENS to REVEAL THE SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN.
Duncan closes his eyes. Feigns sleep.
She pads silently inside. Pulls the door closed.
Duncan remains still, breathing heavily.
The woman steals slowly up to the bedside. Pauses, as if quietly studying Duncan--

Even in the murky halflight, he can still make out the familiar painted eyes framed by a tangle of bleached hair.
She says nothing, her expression lost under a veil of darkness. Only her rapid breathing betrays her tension.

Kate lays Duncan's rainsoaked clothing across a nightstand then turns, regarding him naked for the very first time.
Duncan reaches out to touch her. She trembles.
Gently, as if unwrapping an object of unimaginable fragility, Duncan removes her clothing down to a simple floating chemise.
Then guides her down onto a canopied bed encircled by a hundred fresh-cut wildflowers.

clasp, fingers dig into skin.
Whatever refinements Kate displayed in public are now happily abandoned.

</p><p><p ID="act">He hobbles off, sword hanging limp at his side.
Kase starts TREMBLING WITH RAGE.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">KASE 
<P ID="dia">MACLEOD!
</p><p><p ID="act">Duncan ignores him, keeps walking.
About now, we should have a pretty good idea what Duncan has in mind.
But Kase doesn't have a clue.
</p><p><p ID="act">DUNCAN'S POV:
</p><p><p ID="act">For a fleeting moment, Connor stands before Duncan, more
mist than flesh.
He opens his arms wide.
CONNOR'S APPARITION 
Remember weil, old friend.
He DISSOLVES AWAY as Kase hoists sword over shoulder...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">KASE (cont'd)
<P ID="dia">MAC-LEOD!!
</p><p><p ID="act">. ..and CHARGES...
</p><p><p ID="act">Which is exactly what Duncan expected.
USING THE SAME MOVE CONNOR TAUGHT HIM--
</p><p><p ID="act">--Duncan PIVOTS WITH the THRUST, catching Kase completely off guard and off balance.
This time, no force of man or nature can keep Duncan's sword from hitting home.
He SLICES UPWARD with a ROAR OF DEFIANCE...
</p><p><p ID="act">. ..and FOLLOWS THROUGH.
</p><p><p ID="act">ON KASE:
</p><p><p ID="act">He stands there, head miraculously still intact, a look of bewildered relief.
Duncan simply POPS his sword butt into Kase's face.
The head comes easily away from the neck and falls.
</p><p><p ID="act">KASE'S POV spins END OVER END through the air, bounces twice and comes to a rest SIDEWAYS.
And that's how we first see his HEADLESS BODY, sprawled across the ground.
KASE'S SEVERED HEAD
blinks with sudden recognition. And now he knows. This is the worst part of losing your head-- those last few seconds of cold lucidity.
</p><p><p ID="act">DUNCAN
opens his arms to
HEAVES UNDERFOOT.
</p><p><p ID="act">WIDE - THE QUARRY
</p><p><p ID="act">the ULTIMATE OUICKENING as THE EARTH
WALLS
EXPLODE like a circle of VOLCANOES venting into the center.
Duncan CLAWS UPWARD on a GROUNDSWELL OF RAW ENERGY as DIRT, ROCK, ASH and SMOKE OBLITERATE THE BASIN.
The SEISMIC CONVULSIONS GRADUALLY SUBSIDE.
The dust settles.
And the blighted landscape falls into an unearthly SILENCE, blind to its own buried secrets.
HOLD on the trailing wisps of smoke as
THE GROUND SHUDDERS
and DUNCAN'S KATANA BREAKS THE SURFACE.
It PLUNGES UPWARD ONE, TWO, THREE MORE TIMES, pulverizing dirt and stone.
HANDS FOLLOW, clawing their up way through the loosely- mounded earth until DUNCAN'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS APPEAR.
As if the earth itself is giving birth to a new generation of Immortal.
He rolls out onto the ground, gasping, triumphant. Reborn.
One inch at a time, he slowly rises to his feet.
As we KEEP ON RISING up into a FIERY HIGHLAND SUNSET.

</p><p><p ID="act">Duncan stands over a freshly-dug grave. Onto the simple stone, he's chisled:
</p><p><p ID="act">HEATHER MACLEOD
</p><p><p ID="act">BELOVED WIFE OF CONNOR
</p><p><p ID="act">And beneath it:
</p><p><p ID="act">CONNOR MACLEOD
</p><p><p ID="act">BELOVED HUSBAND OF HEATHER
</p><p><p ID="act">Duncan's eyes glisten with an unspeakable loss. And a comfort in knowing that his friend has finally found the peace of eternity.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN 
<P ID="dia">yours is the greater prize my friend. Welcome home.
</p><p><p ID="act">LINGER ON DUNCAN as we DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO...
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT - MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAWN
</p><p><p ID="act">FAITH stands sentinel-like atop a bluff overlooking the Hudson River and the insignificant island of Manhattan beyond.
Her trademark slashes of facepaint and hair dye have been shed like molted skin. What remains is a serene beauty that defies fashion or vanity.
Her faraway eyes BLINK with a sudden, frightening clarity.
THE BUZZ sets her reflexes snapping as she SPINS AROUND--
</p><p><p ID="act">--and CATCHES the COLICHMARDE, handle first.
DUNCAN
follows, strolling toward her with hands loose at his
side.
Faith runs her finger down the shimmering blade.
</p><p><p ID="speaker">FAITH 
<P ID="spkdir">(considers) 
<P ID="dia">So... what am I supposed to do next -- kiss you or take your head?
</p><p><p ID="act">Duncan steps up to her, smiling enigmatically.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">DUNCAN
<P ID="dia">The choice is yours.
</p><p><p ID="act">FADE OUT:
