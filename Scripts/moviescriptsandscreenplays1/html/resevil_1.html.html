</p><p><p ID="act">A pretty secretary in her cubicle. LISA. A cute paperweight on her desk:

</p><p><p ID="act">“LOVE IS .... NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOU’RE SORRY”

</p><p><p ID="act">She cradles the phone, whispering, not wanting to be overheard. In front of her sits a carry case for glass vials. Similar in design to the one we have already seen, but this one is empty. LISA toys with it nervously.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LISA
<p ID="dia">I went to the pick up, but there was nothing there .... no serum, no nothing.
<p ID="spkdir">(looks around nervously)
<p ID="dia">I’m worried.
<p ID="spkdir">(hesitates)
<p ID="dia">Easy for you to say, I’m the one in here!

</p><p><p ID="act">A fire alarm sounds.

</p><p><p ID="act">LISA almost jumps out of her skin. All around the worker bees look up from their computer screens. In an orderly fashion, they take their jackets from the backs of their seats and head for the door.

</p><p><p ID="act">Been through this drill a hundred times before.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LISA (cont’d)
<p ID="spkdir">(relieved)
<p ID="dia">I’ve got to go. It’s nothing .... fire drill. Meet me tonight .... the usual place.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. LAB

</p><p><p ID="act">The men and women of science look up from their experiments. Annoyed at the disturbance. A scientist with GREEN eyes lowers her face mask.

<p ID="dia">Another day, another drill.

</p><p><p ID="act">The elevator stops. A young man seems confused. He wears a GREY suit which looks brand new.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GREY
<p ID="dia">What is that?

</p><p><p ID="act">A kindly woman in a BLACK skirt and jacket smiles.

<p ID="dia">Fire alarm new boy. We’re going to have to take the stairs.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. OFFICE

</p><p><p ID="act">A crowd that has formed by the doors. LISA is amongst them. A man in a crisp WHITE shirt pushes his way to the front. He’s handsome. Looks like he works out.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WHITE
<p ID="dia">What’s the matter?

</p><p><p ID="act">A woman with long GOLD hair smiles coyly at him. Playing helpless. We smell office flirtation in the air.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GOLD
<p ID="dia">The doors won’t open.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. SECURITY ROOM

</p><p><p ID="act">The guard dogs are in frenzy. Barking and snarling. Throwing themselves against the cage doors. Sensing that something is wrong. A uninformed guard attempts to calm them. His badge identifies him as CLARENCE.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">CLARENCE
<p ID="dia">Easy there .... easy there boys!

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. LAB

</p><p><p ID="act">The overhead sprinklers go off, showering the science bees with freezing cold water.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLUE
<p ID="dia">Damn It! What happened to the halon system?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GREEN
<p ID="dia">Quick get something over the experiments!

<p ID="dia">Forget the doors. Get those slides in a safe place.

<p ID="spkdir">(worried)
<p ID="dia">Shouldn’t the doors open or something?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLACK
<p ID="dia">It’s supposed take us to the nearest floor.

</p><p><p ID="act">Then the lights go out.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GREY
<p ID="spkdir">(very worried)
<p ID="dia">Is that supposed to happen?

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. OFFICE

</p><p><p ID="act">The worker bees are starting to panic. LISA is amongst them.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">LISA
<p ID="dia">What about the doors at the back?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">WHITE
<p ID="dia">Locked as well.

</p><p><p ID="act">Without warning the Halon system goes off. Pillars of high-pressure gas flood into the room, sucking the oxygen out of the air, making it impossible for a fire to breathe. A fire. Or people.

</p><p><p ID="act">The worker bees begin to choke.

</p><p><p ID="pg">5
</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. ELEVATOR

</p><p><p ID="act">The emergency lights have activated. Their surreal red glow makes everything seem ten times worse.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GREY
<p ID="spkdir">(rising panic)
<p ID="dia">What’s going on? Has this happened before? We have to get out of here!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLACK
<p ID="dia">Quiet.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GREY
<p ID="dia">What?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLACK
<p ID="dia">Quiet!

</p><p><p ID="act">They hear a distant roaring sound. Rapidly approaching, like an express train.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GREY
<p ID="dia">What is that?

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

</p><p><p ID="act">The stalled car is in the foreground. Beyond it, we see that the shaft is wide enough for another two elevators. Out here, the roaring sound is even louder.

</p><p><p ID="act">The roaring reaches a crescendo and the source of the noise races past in a blur. It’s another elevator. In free—fall.

</p><p><p ID="act">Inside it, people are screaming.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. ELEVATOR

</p><p><p ID="loc">CLOSE on Black as she realizes what the sound is.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLACK
<p ID="dia">Oh my god!

</p><p><p ID="act">Then the elevator drops. Like a stone.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. LAB

</p><p><p ID="act">Water is still pouring from the sprinkler system. GREEN waves hopelessly at a close circuit camera mounted in the ceiling. We see her image reflected in the lens.

</p><p><p ID="pg">6
</p><p><p ID="loc">CONTINUED:

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GREEN
<p ID="dia">There’s no fire here! No fire!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLUE
<p ID="dia">You know this water isn’t going anywhere.

</p><p><p ID="act">GREEN looks down at the floor. The water level is rising.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLUE (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">This is a sealed room.

</p><p><p ID="act">Suddenly things become more urgent.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GREEN
<p ID="dia">We have to get these doors open.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. ELEVATOR

</p><p><p ID="act">The car is in free—fall. People are screaming. A man has wet himself.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

</p><p><p ID="act">The emergency brakes kick in. One on each corner of the car. Sparks fly. Metal screams.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. ELEVATOR

</p><p><p ID="act">The car shudders to a halt. People sprawled on the floor. Crying.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. LAB

</p><p><p ID="act">The water is rising.

</p><p><p ID="act">GREEN and Blue struggle with the door. Without warning a chair bounces violently off the labs glass window, just missing GREEN. The glass isn’t scratched.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GREEN (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">Jesus! What the hell are you doing?

</p><p><p ID="act">BROWN advances on the glass with a fire axe.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BROWN
<p ID="dia">Stand clear!

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLUE
<p ID="dia">Stop!

</p><p><p ID="act">BROWN halts. Holding the fire axe aggressively. Ready for a fight.

</p><p><p ID="pg">7
</p><p><p ID="loc">CONTINUED:

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLUE (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">Use the other side.

</p><p><p ID="act">He indicates the other side of the axe head. A single steel point. Sharp as an ice pick.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLUE (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">Better chance of getting through it.

</p><p><p ID="act">BROWN hefts the axe and strikes the window with as much force as he can.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE LAB

</p><p><p ID="act">The axe penetrates the glass. Just. A pea sized piece of glass pops out and bounces across the floor.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. OFFICE

</p><p><p ID="act">The Halon system switches itself off. The worker bees lie sprawled across the floor. Sprawled across their desks, Sprawled across one another. Not one moves.

</p><p><p ID="act">THE HIVE is dead.

</p><p><p ID="loc">CLOSE ON LISA

</p><p><p ID="act">amongst the bodies, still and lifeless.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. HALL WAY

</p><p><p ID="act">Three shiny steel doors stand at the centre of the hallway. Bodies are everywhere. Killed as they waited for an elevator.

</p><p><p ID="act">The eerie silence is broken by a scratching sound. One of the elevator doors pops open an inch. Hands force their way out.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. ELEVATOR

</p><p><p ID="act">The car has stopped between floors. BLACK has to lie on the carpeting to peer out of the gap in the elevator doors.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLACK
<p ID="dia">My God!

</p><p><p ID="pg">8
</p><p><p ID="loc">CONTINUED:

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GREY
<p ID="dia">Let me see.

</p><p><p ID="act">He too sees the bodies in the hallway.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GREY (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">We have to get out of here. We have to get out of this building.

</p><p><p ID="act">A man with RED tie tries to force the doors open wider.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RED
<p ID="dia">Here .... give me a hand.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GREY
<p ID="dia">That’s as far as they’ll go.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RED
<p ID="dia">They’re caught on something.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLACK
<p ID="dia">That’s wide enough.

</p><p><p ID="act">She takes her jacket off.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLACK (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">I think I can squeeze through.

</p><p><p ID="act">She gets down on her knees in front of the doors. The gap is barely 18 inches. It’s going to be tight.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLACK (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">I’ll get help.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. HALLWAY

</p><p><p ID="act">BLACK squeezes her head through the doors, She’s a slim woman, but the gap between the elevator floor and the top of the doorway is also very narrow. Even if she gets out, she’s going to have to drop six feet to the floor.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLACK
<p ID="dia">I’m stuck .... you’re going to have to push.

</p><p><p ID="act">She inches through a little more.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLACK (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">That’s it. A bit more.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. ELEVATOR

</p><p><p ID="act">CRACK! A sharp metallic sound echoes around the car.
</p><p><p ID="pg">9
</p><p><p ID="loc">CONTINUED:

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GREY
<p ID="dia">What is that?

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

</p><p><p ID="act">The roof of the elevator. Only three of the four emergency brakes are now holding on. CRACK! Another brake unhooks. All by itself.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. ELEVATOR

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RED
<p ID="dia">Oh Christ! It’s the brakes.

</p><p><p ID="act">GREY begins to push frantically at BLACK. Still trapped half in and half out of the elevator.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">GREY
<p ID="dia">Get out! We’ve got to get out.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLACK
<p ID="dia">I can’t .... I’m stuck!

</p><p><p ID="act">CRACK! The third brake goes.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">RED
<p ID="dia">Push her out of the way .... we have to get out.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">BLACK
<p ID="dia">I can’t move!

</p><p><p ID="act">CRACK! The last brake unhooks. The car begins to drop again.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. HALLWAY

</p><p><p ID="act">BLACK'S P.O.V. We see the floor of the hallway race up at her head. The concrete lip is going to decapitate her. She screams. And at the moment of impact we ....

</p><p><p ID="right">SMASH CUT TO:

</p><p><p ID="loc">CLOSE UP EYES

</p><p><p ID="act">Blue eyes snap open. Woken from a bad dream. WIDEN to reveal a woman’s face to go with the eyes. It’s not perfection, but it’s close. We’ll call her ALICE.

</p><p><p ID="pg">10
</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. BEDROOM DAY.

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE sits up. Looks around. Four poster bed, oak paneled walls, painting of George Washington. Through the window she sees the ornate grounds of a manor house. There’s even a maze. This could be the 19th maybe even 18th Century.

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE steps out of bed. She’s twenty one. Naked. I take it back, she is perfection.

</p><p><p ID="act">Something tumbles from the bedclothes and lands on the floor. ALICE picks it up. A handwritten note:

</p><p><p ID="act">“TODAY ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE”

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE shakes her head. She moves through the room like someone who doesn’t know where she is. She stops in front of a full length mirror. Stares at her own naked body. Touches it. Like it was all strange to her. Like she doesn’t know who she is.

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE stands before an ancient wooden dresser with three drawers. She opens them one at a time.

</p><p><p ID="act">The first contains crisp starched linens.

</p><p><p ID="act">The second, neatly ironed women’s underwear. Very white, very conservative. 

</p><p><p ID="act">The third, a pair of Uzis with laser sighting, under-slung with miniature grenade launchers.

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE stares at the weaponry. The look on her face says it all. Who am I?

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. MANSION — ENTRANCE HALLWAY DAY.

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE descends a sweeping staircase. She’s found some clothes. A tight pair of ski pants and a T—shirt. They fit like they’re hers, but she can’t remember ever having worn them.

</p><p><p ID="act">The hallway is luxurious and tasteful. Tapestries and paintings of old relatives that ALICE doesn’t recognize adorn the walls. But this isn’t a quaint old house. There’s something in the air.

</p><p><p ID="act">Something intangible. Something evil.

</p><p><p ID="pg">11

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. MANSION - DINING ROOM DAY.

</p><p><p ID="act">The table is set for dinner, but there are no guests. No sign of life.

</p><p><p ID="act">Creepy.

</p><p><p ID="loc">INT. MANSION — STUDY DAY.

</p><p><p ID="act">A dark oak lined study. The only sound is the ticking of a grandfather clock. ALICE takes a framed photograph train the desk. It’s of her and a handsome man. They are standing in front of rose bushes in the garden. He has his arm around her. He wears a wedding ring.

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE looks at her own hand. She too wears a sample gold band. This man is her husband?

</p><p><p ID="act">A sudden shadow falls across the desk. ALICE jumps, startled. Something is moving out in the garden.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">ALICE
<p ID="dia">Hello!

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE seems surprised by the sound of her own voice. So that’s what she sounds like.

</p><p><p ID="loc">EXT. MANSION — GARDENS - DUSK

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE emerges from the study. In front of her is a huge marble statue. A series of bizarre gothic characters dancing round a maypole. A walrus wearing a waistcoat, a rabbit carrying a pocket watch, a bald beaded knight in armor. Both beautiful and also strangely unsettling.

</p><p><p ID="act">In the distance, she sees movement at the entrance to the ornate hedge maze.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">ALICE
<p ID="dia">Hello!

</p><p><p ID="act">But there’s no reply. In the distance the sky is starting to darken.

</p><p><p ID="loc">EXT. MAZE - DUSK

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE is following someone or something deeper and deeper into the maze. Dusk is turning rapidly to night, and the shadows within the maze are beginning to deepen. With every corner ALICE turns, the tension mounts.

</p><p><p ID="pg">12
</p><p><p ID="loc">EXT. MAZE — CENTER - DUSK

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE is about to turn back when she suddenly stumbles upon the middle of the maze. At the very center point is a chair. And in the chair, a man sitting with his back to her.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">ALICE
<p ID="dia">Hello.

</p><p><p ID="act">The man doesn’t reply.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">ALICE (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">I’m not sure if I belong here.

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE cautiously approaches him.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">ALICE (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">I woke up .... and I can’t remember.

</p><p><p ID="act">The man still doesn’t speak. Doesn’t even move. She reaches out to touch his shoulder.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">MACE (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">Are you alright?

</p><p><p ID="act">He is cold to her touch. Very cold.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">ALICE (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">I ....

</p><p><p ID="act">THE CAMERA tracks around to reveal that she has her hand on the shoulder of a statue. ALICE sighs. With relief. With embarrassment. The statue is of an old man with a top bat in his lap. The hat has a price tag — “In This style 12/6”.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">MATT (V.0.)
<p ID="dia">Freeze! Don’t move.

</p><p><p ID="act">The sudden voice SCARES THE SHIT OUT OF US.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">MATT (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">Now put your hands on the chair. Do it!

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE does it. This guy sounds tough.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">MATT (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">What are you doing here?

</p><p><p ID="act">MATT frisks her. We still haven’t seen his face.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">ALICE
<p ID="dia">I think I live here.

</p><p><p ID="pg">13
</p><p><p ID="loc">CONTINUED:

<p ID="dia">You think.

<p ID="dia">I just woke up .... I don’t remember anything.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">MATT (O.S.)
<p ID="dia">You’re clean. Turn around.

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE finally sees him. Smart blue uniform, fresh faced. Not what she was expecting.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">ALICE
<p ID="dia">You’re a little young for a policeman aren't you?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">MATT
<p ID="dia">I get a lot of that.

</p><p><p ID="act">He holsters his gun.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">MATT (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">Who else is in the house?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">ALICE
<p ID="dia">No one .... but I didn’t look everywhere.

</p><p><p ID="act">MATT starts to head back to the mansion.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">MATT
<p ID="dia">Come on .... I got a call to check the place out.

</p><p><p ID="act">Below MATT'S police badge is the name of a town - RACCOON CITY.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">ALICE
<p ID="dia">Where is that?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">MATT
<p ID="dia">What?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">ALICE
<p ID="dia">The town.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">MATT
<p ID="dia">You’re kidding right?

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE shakes her head.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">ALICE
<p ID="dia">What were you doing in the maze?

</p><p><p ID="speaker">MATT
<p ID="dia">Thought I saw someone.

</p><p><p ID="act">MATT looks up at the mansion. We get the feeling he wants to change the subject.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">MATT (cont’d)
<p ID="dia">How can you live here? Place looks haunted.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">ALICE
<p ID="dia">Wait.

</p><p><p ID="speaker">MATT
<p ID="dia">What?

</p><p><p ID="act">ALICE turns to face the dark sky. A sudden breeze blows through her hair.

The tanks are made of circular plexi and reach from floor to ceiling. There are literally hundreds of them, and with no clear way through the room, they form a grotesque kind of maze.

Mesmerized by the freak show, she doesn’t realize that she is being slowly separated from the others. This room does indeed function like a maze, and ALICE is becoming lost.

</p><p><p ID="act">The liquid the dead Creature is kept in is being constantly circulated, and the movement makes the three foot long tongue sway. It shines past the Plexiglas, as though it were licking it. Up close, the pink fleshy tongue is covered in a thousand tiny barbs.
