<P>EXT. WORKOUT AREA – SAME NIGHT</P>

</B><P>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MASTER KWAN'S SCHOOL, A RAMSHACKLE BUILDING IN A BURNED OUT ROW OF STORES.</P>
<B>
</B><I><P>His is the only one still occupied, and it doesn't look that permanent. In the window is a cardboard, handwritten sign that reads "Kwan's Shaolin Kung Fu". What remains visible behind the poster and the security grate is an </I>IMPRESSION<I> of people moving and milling around.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>INT. WORKOUT AREA – SAME NIGHT</P>

</B><P>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF KWAN'S SHAOLIN KUNG FU SCHOOL.</P>
<B>
</B><I><P>The students are doing their own thing, and they are a mixture of old and young, men and women. They are not dressed alike, as they would be in a Karate school: they are dressed in old T-shirts and tattered sweat pants. This is not a wealthy school, by any means, and that is typified by the appearance of </I>SIFU KWAN<I>, who is walking through the students as they train. He is wizened old man, 70 years old if he is a day, and he is dressed in a fraying Chinese jacket, scruffy cloth shoes and a discolored Chinese T-shirt.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON A YOUNG ADULT</P>

</B><I><P>Struggling through a horse stance, his face in real pain. He is trying his best to hold the stance, but his legs are quivering. He drops out of the stance onto his knees. Master Kwan is right beside him.</P>

</DIR>

<P>Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger!</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

</B><I><P>He moves on, studying the room with his eyes, often glancing toward the door, and then toward the small clock on a table near the door. It is late, and Kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive. As he is waiting, a young </I>STUDENT<I> comes up to Kwan.</P>

<P>Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce Lee... </P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>KWAN</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Bruce Lee actor, we fighters, warriors. A sparrow in flight is beautiful, but a side kick to the ribs is effective. Show me.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

</B><I><P>The boy shrugs and then starts throwing side kicks. Kwan is half looking at the boy and half looking towards the door and the clock. The boy throws three or four kicks and then stops. He is watching Kwan watching the door. Kwan sees him, and turns back to him.</P>

</I><B><P>A Shaolin warrior lets nothing intrude. Continue, never mind.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

</B><I><P>He continues to kick, and Kwan continues to look at the door. Finally, the student stops kicking, half-heartedly bows to the master, and then moves to the side of the workout room. Kwan doesn't know he's gone. Kwan turns around, forgetting for a moment what he is doing, and comes face to face with the mother of a student, </I>MRS. RODRIGUEZ<I>, and she is holding a uniform of some sort. She smiles widely at him and holds up the uniform. It is beautiful, obviously hand made, and on the back is embroidered: "Kwan's Shaolin" and underneath that is "Drew Carson". Kwan takes in the entire outfit, while the rest of the class is gathering around to have a look. They are all very impressed.</P>

<P>Never in my days at the Shaolin Temple have I seen uniform as beautiful as this. Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez. I wish Drew were here to thank you himself. Ta ma de!</P>

<P>KWAN</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors depend on heart and soul – that's how they saved the T'ang emporer.</P>
</DIR>

</B><I><P>During my time training at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the martial arts, I was lucky (glance at Mrs. Rodriguez)... er... fortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me. But, there was also time for individual training – where skills were honed like the blade of a sword. Now, it is that time for you.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>He turns to go.</P>

<P>EXT. DREW GARAGE – SAME NIGHT</P>

</B><P>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF OLD GARAGE.</P>
<B>
</B><I><P>It is kind of spooky, and there are no lights on outside. There is candlelight inside, and it is moving around – an effect not unlike a ghost carrying a candelabra.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>INT. DREW GARAGE – SAME NIGHT</P>

</B><P>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR.</P>
<B>
</B><I><P>The area is dilapidated, but very clean, with all kinds of kung fu and Chinese paraphenalia lying around. Around the corner comes the spooky light, and (with music building to a crescendo), we see </I>DREW CARSON<I>, a muscular 16/17 year old, bowls of flaming wax on his bare shoulders, moving through the garage, practicing his kung fu maneuvers. He is kicking, punching, etc., occasionally spilling hot wax on his skin (</I>INSERT<I>).</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>In the background is a TV, and on it is showing a martial arts movie.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON KWAN</P>

</B><I><P>Who is quietly settling into a shadowy corner of the garage, watching Drew.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON DREW</P>

</B><I><P>As he continues to move around the workout area, his arms and body moving as he tries to match the movements on the TV.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Suddenly, Kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking. Drew reacts instantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in the bowls but not spilling (</I>INSERT SHOT HERE<I>). Kwan continues the attack, and Drew evades, their movements matching the movements on the TV almost move for move. It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping Kwan down to the ground. When Kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is lit by the TV screen.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON DREW</P>

</DIR>

</B><I><P>He hurries over to his master, a concerned look on his face.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>He leans down to help Kwan up, forgetting about the bowls of hot wax. It pours down on Kwan, scalding him, as well as running down Drew's chest. Kwan struggles to get up, while at the same time trying to wipe the hot wax off.</P>

<P>DREW</P></DIR>

<P>I'll still win. Besides, the Shaolin monks never had tapes to study... they did it this way... right?</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>KWAN</P></DIR>

<P>Not quite – our drills at the temple had meaning. If we had tapes, we would have watched them.</P>

</B><I><P>The grounds are immaculate and huge, exquisitely kept and beautifully laid out. A gathering is around the pool and lawn area, where TREVOR and his team are having an exhibition for their guests. Polite applause is</P>

<P>I saw a Shaolin monk once. I was only 5 years old at the time, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I was coming back from the market with my father. Soldiers stopped us and were taking the food we had just bought. It was all we had left to eat – no more money. These were hard times in China, people were selling their children for food, and the soldiers had no right. Who can stop soldiers with guns, though? Yes?</P>

<P>Just as the soldiers were leaving, a monk stepped out of the crowd and told them very calmly to put the food back. Well, naturally, they didn't. They pushed the monk, and the next thing I knew the soldiers were in the street, and the food was back in my father's arms. 5 soldiers, and they were in a heap on the ground, their blood mixing with the dust of the street.</P>

<P>The crowd whispered "Shaolin", and he bowed to us, touched my cheek and smiled, then just walked on. I watched him until he disappeared in the distance. He was larger than life, a hero to a little boy of 5. I vowed then and there to become like him, fight for right like the Shaolin.</P>

He takes off sprinting, with Gao covering him like a blanket. San De throws the ball to him in a perfect spiral, to a spot where Gao has no play on the throw, and Drew catches it in stride.</P>

<P>EXT. WATERFALL – EARLY MORNING</P>

</B><P>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THUNDERING WATERFALL.</P>
<B>
</B><I><P>Drew stands at the side of the waterfall, studying his map. From his expression, we know that he has to go through the waterfall to get where he is going.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Drew pockets the map, checks that the box is safely in place, then starts toward the waterfall. The drop off the side of the waterfall is incedible – steep and deadly.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON DREW</P>

</B><I><P>As he enters the waterfall. The water hits his back, almost pitching him into the abyss. Drew concentrates and moves forward, slowly but surely.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>He emerges on the other side, only to be confronted by a swamp. Jutting out of the swamp are rocks and tree stumps.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Drew examines the distance between the objects, realizing that he can jump from place to place and make it across.</P>

</B><I><P>He starts out, jumping onto the first stone, then moving on to the others. He almost falls a couple of times, but regains his balance. He gets a rythm going, and is soon almost halfway across.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>He gets to one particular rock, only to find out that it's the head of an alligator! Its mouth opens to bite him!</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Drew jumps off it quickly, onto a tree stump. When he lands on the stump, he examines it carefully to make sure it isn't something else.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>He continues across, more careful this time. </P>

<P>ANGLE ON DREW</P>

</B><I><P>As he comes up onto a rope bridge over a deep gorge, the way to the arhat. Drew smiles, stashes the map and starts across the rope bridge, hand over hand. He looks down once, at the DROP, then forces himself to look straight ahead.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>He just starts across when the rope bends and jumps. Drew turns around to see a man </I>RIGHT BEHIND HIM<I>.</P>

<P>INT. WOODEN MAN CHAMBER – SAME DAY</P>

</B><P>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF WOODEN MAN CHAMBER.</P>
<B>
</B><I><P>Drew pauses for a moment, examining the room. It is filled with wooden statues of monks, all in different fighting positions. The carvings are precise and incredibly beautiful. Their arms, open hands, fists and legs are fashioned out of hard wood, and they look very dangerous indeed.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Drew gathers himself for a moment, then starts into the chamber.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON DREW'S FOOT</P>

</B><I><P>As it presses down on one of the stones of the floor.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>The attacks start – from all sides, as the wooden statues </I>COME TO LIFE<I>, spinning, lunging and striking.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Drew is caught off guard, and is hit several times, driven back to the door of the chamber. The statues stop moving.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Drew, a little scared, tries to remember the sequence of the statues, letting his arms practice for the attacks.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>There is fear in his eyes.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>He starts in again, and the attacks come again, but they are different this time.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Drew is clobbered.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Driven back to the door, Drew slumps against the wall. His face is already bruised and bleeding.</P>

</B><I><P>He enters the chamber again, and the attacks start again.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Drew, however, is prepared (both mentally and physically).</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>He blocks, avoids, rolls, jumps and redirects the attacks on him, making his way across.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>He is about halfway across when an especially fierce and large statue comes crashing towards him. Drew, caught a little off guard, quickly adjusts and manages to jump and spin out of the way.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Suddenly, as he turns and tries to get his breath, two huge, deadly spears are streaking towards him. Drew blocks the </I>SPEARS<I> with his arms, misdirecting them into the wall behind him.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>They </I>THWOCK<I> into the wall, sticking there.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>As he rounds a particularly difficult series of statues, a volley of </I>ARROWS<I> comes </I>HURTLING<I> towards him. Drew blocks some, avoids others, and catches one in each hand. He throws them down and continues on.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>He goes past the few remaining statues, and is out of the Wooden Man Chamber. All that is left is to walk down a little hallway and out the door.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Drew looks behind him, then starts to walk. He goes cautiously, expecting a trap or a trick.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Nothing happens.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>He gets to the door and looks for a handle on the door. He spots a handhold near the top of the door, and pulls it with his hand.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Immediately, his hands is locked in and a panel in the ceiling </I>DROPS<I> right onto his arm, forcing it down. Drew fights back with his muscles, the veins popping out in his arms and neck.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Behind him, a statue has started coming towards him, spinning like a dervish. Its fists and legs are extended, and they are deadly.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>The panel drops lower and lower.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>FLASHBACK TO UNBENDABLE ARM SEQUENCE</P>

<P>ANGLE ON DREW</P>

</B><I><P>As he relaxes his face, and forcibly relaxes his arm and entire body, letting his inner energy take over.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

</B><I><P>As it slows with a </I>GRINDING NOISE<I>, then stops.</P>

<P>ANGLE ON DREW</P>

</B><I><P>Holding up the heavy stone panel with his arm, his face and body completely relaxed.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>The panel goes back up into the ceiling, and the door opens.</P>

<P>Master, the American is insulting the Temple, and the fighting monks.</P>

<P>GAO (CONT'D)</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Someone should face him in combat. For the tradition of the temple.</P>

<P>There are some times when a Shaolin must fight, and some people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson.</P>

<P>ANGLE ON DREW</P>

</B><I><P>Who understands the implication of what he is saying. He starts to smile slowly.</P>

</B><I><P>Drew nods, then turns to face the ring, where Trevor is still standing, trying to get someone to fight him.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Drew walks with Gao back to the side of the ring. He turns to Gao and Li and together they high-five.</P>

</B><I><P>Drew climbs into the ring.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>The crowd is going crazy. Trevor has a predator's grin on his face as he sits down in his corner to get ready to start the match. Immediately, his contingent of people start to work on him – massage, drinks, etc.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON DREW</P>

</B><I><P>Who sits alone in the other corner.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON LI AND GAO</P>

</B><I><P>Who see the difference. Immediately, they mobilize the other monks.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON GAO</P>

</B><I><P>Who pulls a drink from one of the men in the crowd, and rushes up to give it to Drew.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON DREW'S CORNER</P>

</B><I><P>As it is flooded with monks. Some of them are massaging Drew (painfully), others are stretching his legs out, others waving towels to bring air to him, etc.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>The referee signals for the fighters to come to the center. They do, and he motions for them to bow to each other.</P>

<P>DREW</P></DIR>

<P>Nothing exists but the moment, and...</P><DIR>

</B><I><P>(beat)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><B><P>... I'm going to enjoy it.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

</B><I><P>They back up, and the fight begins.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Trevor attacks hard, but Drew avoids easily, using all soft gong fu. He continues to attack, throwing flashy technique after flashy technique, but he can't touch Drew.</P>

</DIR>

</B><I><P>And he dances out of the way. Trevor is getting more and more angry.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Soon, Drew tires of this game and decides to end this quickly. He goes after Trevor, and it is immediately obvious that Trevor is completely outclassed. Drew scores on Trevor at will, and soon has Trevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of high kicks, takedowns, flips and punches.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Trevor drops to one knee, his hands down at his side, note even bothering to defend himself.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Drew grabs Trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his right hand in a fist. He is going to put him out with a good old-fashioned roundhouse punch.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON LI AND GAO</P>

</B><I><P>Yelling for the knock out blow.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON D.S. AND SAN DE</P>

</B><I><P>Worried about this latest development.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Instead, however, Drew smiles and lifts Trevor up and shakes his hand, putting an arm around him to steady him in front of the crowd.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Trevor looks into Drew's face, wondering why Drew would do such a thing. When he sees Drew's friendly face, he knows.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>To teach him a lesson.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Trevor smiles and holds up Drew's hand as the champion.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>The crowd goes crazy.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON LI AND GAO</P>

</B><I><P>Who also get the message.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S.</P>

</B><I><P>Who knew the message all along.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>WIDE ANGLE OF ENTIRE RING</P>

</B><I><P>Drew and Trevor standing together in the center. The monks on the side climb into the ring to celebrate with Drew. </P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>EXT. GREAT WALL – MORNING</P>

</B><P>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW STANDING ON THE GREAT WALL, THE SUNSET OVER HIS SHOULDER.</P>
<B>
</B><I><P>He is doing the beginning of a Shaolin form. When he finishes the salute, a figure comes toward him.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>It is San De, and he has something in his hands.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>Drew bows to San De, and San De holds </I>THE GOLDEN SASH<I> out to him. Drew takes it and San De bows to him. Drew can't stand it anymore, and rushes up to San De. He gives him a hug.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON SAN DE</P>

</B><I><P>Who is not used to shows of affection. He is lost for a moment, then his face softens and he returns Drew's embrace.</P>
</I><B>
</B><I><P>They break and bow again, and San De moves off. Drew stands there holding the Golden Sash, the rising sun of the first day of the rest of his life shining in the b.g.</P>
</I><B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ANGLE ON ASHEMA</P>

</B><I><P>Who comes up to Drew, taking his arm and walks with him along the Great Wall.</P>
