  <dt><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, NewBrunswick" size="-1">As 
    soon as 1 month after the release of The Karate Kid, it had become clear to 
    the filmmakers and the studio that they had a bonefide hit. The movie would 
    go on to cross the magic $100 million mark and, as far as Hollywood was concerned, 
    was the greatest kind of mega hit --One made on a shoestring that returned 
    the same kind of ticket sales as one made for </font></b><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, NewBrunswick"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, NewBrunswick" size="-1">ten 
    times the cost.<br>
    <br>
    It was only natural, therefore that the producers and studio start work immediately 
    on a sequel to their 'sleeper' hit about a teenage kid and his wise, Okinawan 
    mentor.<br>
    <br>
    Robert Mark Kamen, who penned the first movie's script was immediately hired 
    to work on a sequel. When he delivered his 114 page 1st Draft, on November 
    20 1984, the producers would ask for many changes but essentially the story 
    was set.<br>
    <br>
    Now, with eternal thanks to <font color="#FFFFFF">Tom Funch</font>, we are 
    very proud to be able to bring you a serialisation of the script to the new 
    movie, as first envisioned by it's original writer...<br>

  </u></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, NewBrunswick" size="-1" color="#FF9900">You 
  may recall that it was originally planned that the confrontation between Kreese 
  and Miyagi would take place at the end of the first film, (it was in the draft 
  scripts) but then when they saw what a great movie they had, the producers changed 
  their mind and left it for a sequel. This 1st draft of the sequel only casts 
  more doubt on this theory. Readers of the site like <font color="#FFFFFF">Chris 
  Lozano</font> have written in noticing discrepancies with the Cobras during 
  this scene. It would be nice to know what was filmed originally, and what was 
  added later -does anyone know?<br>
  <br>
  We pick up the action as the group emerge from the Tournament building...<br>

  TO EXT: ARENA <br>
  Miyagi waits on the outskirts of the crowd, by the locker room door as one contestant 
  after another exits. A booing goes up from the crowd. A moment later, Kreese 
  exits, scowling, bulling his way through the gathered people, followed by his 
  team and a trail of boos and hisses. He steams past Miyagi, brushing against 
  him on purpose, catching the old man off balance. Miyagi falls to the floor. 
  Last in Kreese's line is Johnny, who stops, looks and offer Miyagi a helping 
  hand up. At that moment, Kreese turns and sees the gesture. Johnny turns and 
  sees Kreese waiting, his anger building. He looks at Miyagi and smiles, a hurting 
  smile, and runs to catch up with his group. Miyagi watches the boys go, pitying 
  them. LUCILLE and ALI exit. <br>
  <br>
  LUCILLE <br>
  He come out yet? <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  Not yet. <br>
  <br>
  ALI <br>
  We're gonna go ahead and buy some things. <br>
  <br>
  LUCILLE <br>
  Champagne and cheesecake. But give us a chance to get set up. <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  Don’t worry. We'll take long way home. <br>
  <br>
  The crowd at the door begins to cheer and whistle. Ali looks over in that direction. 
  <br>
  <br>
  ALI <br>
  We better go. <br>
  <br>
  Lucille and Ali take off for the parking lot. Miyagi turns his attention to 
  Daniel exiting, besieged for autographs. Daniel basks in his moment of glory, 
  signing autographs, shaking hands, taking the congratulations and adulation 
  of the crowd. After a moment, he works his way through to Miyagi. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  Being a celebrity is hard work. <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  Then good thing career ended. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  Until next year. <br>
  <br>
  Miyagi gives Daniel a stern look. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  Just kidding. Where's Mom and Ali? <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI<br>
  Oh. Went on ahead. Come, let Miyagi help. Miyagi relieves Daniel of his trophy. 
  <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  How feel? <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL Not so hot. How do I look? <br>
  <br>
  Miyagi looks Daniel up and down, focusing on his bruised face. <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  Not so hot. <br>
  <br>
  VO <br>
  Excuse me! <br>
  <br>
  Daniel and Miyagi turn to an ORIENTAL MAN of about 35, WEBSTER MIYAGI and his 
  FIVE YEAR OLD SON, DEXTER, both distinctly American in dress and posture. There 
  is an uncanny resemblance to Miyagi. <br>
  <br>
  WEBSTER <br>
  You were really terrific. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  Thanks. <br>
  <br>
  WEBSTER <br>
  I know you must be in a hurry and all, but would you mind? <br>
  <br>
  He extends a program and a pen. <br>
  <br>
  WEBSTER <br>
  For my kid. He's kinda shy. <br>
  <br>
  Daniel looks down at the boy, who pushes close to his father's leg and smiles. 
  <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  What's your name? <br>
  <br>
  DEXTER (shy) <br>
  Dexter. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  Dexter what? <br>
  <br>
  DEXTER <br>
  Miyagi. <br>
  <br>
  Daniel looks up at Miyagi who for some reason grows uncomfortable. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  Miyagi? That's my teacher's name. He's from Okinawa. Where are you from? <br>
  <br>
  DEXTER <br>
  Sherman Oaks. <br>
  <br>
  Webster's curiosity is aroused. <br>
  <br>
  WEBSTER <br>
  I bet we're relatives. <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI (uncomfortable) <br>
  Don't think so. <br>
  <br>
  WEBSTER <br>
  I bet we are. My mom and pop told me everyone with our last name from Okinawa 
  is related. <br>
  <br>
  Miyagi shakes his head. Daniel looks at all three Okinawans. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL<br>
  You know, you do look alike. <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  To you we all look alike. Come. Mother waiting. <br>
  <br>
  Webster unexpectedly pulls out a camera and snaps two pictures of Miyagi. <br>
  <br>
  WEBSTER <br>
  There we go. I'm gonna ask my folks to check into it. They're always in touch 
  with my Aunt who still lives on the other side. <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  Good luck. <br>
  <br>
  Miyagi and Daniel walk off. <br>
  <br>
  WEBSTER <br>
  Where can I find you? <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI (over his shoulder) <br>
  <br>
  In book. <br>
  <br>
  Webster, a little perplexed, but unperturbed, watches Daniel and Miyagi wend 
  their way through the cars in the parking lot. <br>
  <br>
  CUT TO: INT. PARKING LOT <br>
  Daniel and Miyagi walk through rows of cars. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  How come you don't want to hear from that guy? <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  Why say that? <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  You told him you were in the book. <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  So? <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  You don't even have a phone. <br>
  <br>
  VOICES coming from the other side of a black van interrupt their conversation. 
  Daniel and Miyagi stop to listen. <br>
  <br>
  ANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF KREESE'S BLACK CUSTOMIZED COBRA VAN. <br>
  All the other Cobras are loaded in the van. Kreese blocks Johnny's way as he 
  attempts to enter. <br>
  <br>
  KREESE<br>
  Beat it. <br>
  <br>
  JOHNNY <br>
  I tried, sensei. <br>
  <br>
  KREESE <br>
  I had him crippled and you still couldn't beat him. <br>
  <br>
  JOHNNY <br>
  It wasn't my fault. <br>
  <br>
  Kreese, angered by the statement, grabs Johnny by the shirt front and pulls 
  him within inches of his face. Johnny trembles in fear. <br>
  <br>
  KREESE <br>
  You inferring it was mine? <br>
  <br>
  A VOICE from the side turns Kreese. <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  Why you no pick on someone your own size? <br>
  <br>
  KREESE <br>
  Mind your own business, old man. I've had enough of you. <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  Who you calling old man, monkey face? <br>
  <br>
  Kreese throws Johnny aside like a rag doll and rushes Miyagi, lunge punching 
  for his face. At the last moment, Miyagi side steps. Kreese's punch goes up 
  to his elbow through a car windshield Miyagi was standing in front of ripping 
  the fist to shreds. Kreese pulls his mangled hand out and looks at it, his fury 
  growing. Miyagi stands in front of a 14-foot U-Haul truck. Kreese charges again 
  with his good hand. At the last moment, Miyagi sidesteps. Kreese's fist crumbles 
  against the truck side. He screams in agony and anger. He turns to face Miyagi 
  cradling both his hands. Miyagi is right there and delivers a short undercut 
  to Kreese's stomach. Kreese doubles over. Miyagi hits him on the back of the 
  neck with an elbow. Kreese falls to his knees. Miyagi pulls his head up by the 
  hair exposing his throat. On his knees for the first time in his life, Kreese's 
  eyes flicker with fear. As Miyagi's smile dies, his eyes turn to stone. He cocks 
  his fist back slowly, still holding Kreese's throat, exposed. <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  Mercy is for the weak! We do not train to be merciful. A man faces you he is 
  the enemy. An enemy deserves no mercy. Miyagi's fist is cocked as far as it 
  can go behind his head, his face a mask of vengeance. <br>
  <br>
  ANGLE ON <br>
  The Cobra Kai students, their mouth fairly trembling with fear. <br>
  <br>
  ANGLE ON <br>
  Daniel, astounded by what is happening. He cannot believe his teacher would 
  abandon what he has taught him. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL (whispered) <br>
  No! <br>
  <br>
  ANGLE ON <br>
  Kreese. He looks up at Miyagi, his face rattled with fear, his eyes closed. 
  Miyagi's eyes flash. His fist cuts through the air, whistling towards Kreese's 
  unprotected head. <br>
  <br>
  CLOSEUP <br>
  Kreese's face, his eyes shut tightly expecting the death blow. When it does 
  not come, he opens his eyes slowly. Miyagi's fist is less than an inch from 
  his nose, trembling with power. Miyagi's forefinger flicks out, nubbing the 
  end of Kreese's nose in the lowest form of insult. He drops Kreese's head. His 
  body slumps forward. Miyagi turns to Daniel and winks. With a wave of relief, 
  Daniel rushes into his teacher's arms. The two of them embrace. One by one, 
  the Cobra Kai students exit from the van, dropping their belts in front of the 
  still kneeling Kreese, and walking off, leaving him alone. <br>
  <br>
  CUT TO: <br>
  <br>
  EXT. PARKING LOT <br>
  Daniel and Miyagi are climbing into Miyagi's truck. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  You could have killed him, couldn't you? <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI<br>
  Sometimes living is more punishment. <br>
  <br>
  Miyagi starts the engine and drives out of the parking lot.</font><font size="-1" color="#FF9900"><br>

  <br>
  EXT. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION DAY <br>
  <br>
  All the pomp and circumstance of an outdoor graduation. The graduating class 
  sits in cap and gown listening to the graduating address. ANGLE ON Daniel, Ali, 
  and SUSAN, all sitting next to each other. Susan leans over to Ali and whispers. 
  <br>
  <br>
  SUSAN <br>
  Have you told him yet? <br>
  <br>
  ALI <br>
  Shhhh! <br>
  <br>
  The words produce a pained look in her eyes. At that moment, Daniel looks up 
  and smiles lovingly. She smiles back and he slips his hand into her's. They 
  both listen to the speaker. <br>
  <br>
  SPEAKER <br>
  …and as you leave here today, I exhort you to open yourselves to new experiences 
  so that you can grow as individuals into strong self sufficient adults. God 
  Bless you all… (pause) graduates! <br>
  <br>
  On the word, a WHOOP and hundred of mortar boards go sailing into the air. <br>
  <br>
  EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS <br>
  Parents and children mingling after the graduation ceremony. Lucille and Miyagi 
  come upon Ali and Daniel. Lucille is bursting with pride and sentimental reminiscence. 
  <br>
  <br>
  LUCILLE <br>
  You graduated high school. I can't believe it. <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  Me, either. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  You didn’t think I'd graduate? <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  Didn’t think you'd live to graduate. <br>
  <br>
  Daniel looks at him sideways. <br>
  <br>
  LUCILLE <br>
  Here! Congratulations. <br>
  <br>
  She hands Daniel a small present. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  Thanks, Mom. <br>
  <br>
  Daniel opens it. <br>
  <br>
  LUCILLE <br>
  And one for you, too, Ali. Congratulations. <br>
  <br>
  Ali is touched. She kisses Lucille on the cheek. <br>
  <br>
  ALI <br>
  Thank you. <br>
  <br>
  She begins to open her's as well. Daniel displays his: an imitation alligator 
  skin wallet with a fifty dollar bill neatly stuck in the bill fold. <br>
  <br>
  LUCILLE <br>
  I wish it could be more. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  No. Thanks, Mom. This is great. <br>
  <br>
  Ali's parents, MR. and MRS. MILLS, appear. Their smiles taper as they notice 
  the company present. <br>
  <br>
  MR. MILLS <br>
  Here she is. <br>
  <br>
  LUCILLE (effusive) <br>
  Oh, hi. <br>
  <br>
  MRS. MILLS (reserved) <br>
  Hello. Congratulations, darling. <br>
  <br>
  Ali and her mother kiss, politely. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  Hi, Mr. Mills. <br>
  <br>
  MR. MILLS <br>
  Hello, Daniel (beat) Congratulations. <br>
  <br>
  The feeling behind the words is halfhearted. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  Thanks. <br>
  <br>
  MR. MILLS <br>
  Congratulations, darling. <br>
  <br>
  He kisses Ali and hands her an airplane ticket envelope. She looks up at it. 
  Her face lights up. A wish come true. <br>
  <br>
  ALI <br>
  Paris? <br>
  <br>
  Her parents smile affirmatively. She hugs both of them. <br>
  <br>
  ALI<br>
  Oh, I can't believe it. Thank you. Thank you. I never thought. <br>
  <br>
  Susan comes running up with the exact same envelope. <br>
  <br>
  SUSAN <br>
  Ali! Ali! <br>
  <br>
  The girls are all over each other, squealing with delight. <br>
  <br>
  GIRLS <br>
  You won't believe it. A whole summer. We have a whole summer in Paris. <br>
  <br>
  ANGLE ON <br>
  Daniel: he looks down at his wallet and the fifty dollar bill, suddenly not 
  so excited. <br>
  <br>
  MR. MILLS<br>
  Well, let's go girls. Club Luncheon starts at one, and you know how prompt they 
  are. <br>
  <br>
  MRS. MILLS <br>
  Nice seeing you again. <br>
  <br>
  LUCILLE <br>
  I'm sure. <br>
  <br>
  She smiles, a smidgen of sarcasm in the corner of her mouth. <br>
  <br>
  ALI <br>
  I'll see you at eight? <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL<br>
  Okay. <br>
  <br>
  Ali and Susan, their enthusiasm trailing after them, walk off with their parents. 
  Lucille and Miyagi see a cloud creeping over Daniel. <br>
  <br>
  LUCILLE <br>
  So! Where are we celebrating this momentous event today? <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL (despondent) <br>
  How about Paris? <br>
  <br>
  Lucille feels for her son. <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  So sorry. Don’t want to go to Paris. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL<br>
  What's wrong with Paris? <br>
  <br>
  MIYAGI <br>
  Everybody goes there. <br>
  <br>
  Miyagi's joke puts everything back into perspective for Daniel. He shakes off 
  his malaise. <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  Thanks. <br>
  <br>
  Miyagi bows his head. <br>
  <br>
  LUCILLE <br>
  Well, that takes care of Paris. How about the Thousand Oaks Shopping Mall? <br>
  <br>
  DANIEL <br>
  Sounds good to me. <br>

    EXT. MIYAGI'S HOUSE -- DAY CLOSEUP: <br>
    <br>
    A large frosty glass of iced tea with a mint sprig on a tray moves outdoors. 
    The sound of deliberate one-stroke hammering fills the air. <br>
    <br>
    PULL BACK TO MIYAGI <br>
    returning to the shade of a beach umbrella with his tea and Daniel, pounding 
    nails, one at a time, into the under-construction addition to Miyagi's house. 
    Daniel is sweating bullets, his method peculiar. He sets up a nail and tries 
    to drive it in with one blow of the hammer. He is not concentrating and consequently, 
    not succeeding. Miyagi sees this and approaches. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI<br>
    Daniel-san. Purpose exercise build focus. <br>
    <br>
    DANIEL <br>
    I thought it was to build a new room. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    That too. Now watch. <br>
    <br>
    Miyagi sets up a nail, draws the hammer back no more than twelve inches and 
    hammers the nail through the wood with one deft shot. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    Now you. <br>
    <br>
    Daniel sets up a nail. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    Focus. Concentrate power. <br>
    <br>
    Daniel swings. The blow is misdirected, off. The nail bends. Daniel's spirit 
    seems to collapse. Miyagi removes the hammer from his hand. <br>
    <br>
    DANIEL <br>
    Sorry, Mr. Miyagi. I can't concentrate. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    What problem? <br>
    <br>
    DANIEL <br>
    I don't know. I feel like I'm losing my balance, like every- thing's just 
    floating away. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI<br>
    Only thing matter, Daniel not float away. <br>
    <br>
    DANIEL <br>
    I don't know how to stop it. <br>
    <br>
    Miyagi presses Daniel's hands together in a prayer position at chest level. 
    <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    When fear losing focus always return to basic of life. <br>
    <br>
    DANIEL <br>
    Praying? <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    Breathing. No breath -- no life. Now, breathe. In and out. <br>
    <br>
    On the exhale, he raises Daniel's hands still clasped above his head until 
    the arms are fully extended. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    In. <br>
    <br>
    On the intake, he returns Daniel's hands to the prayer position. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    Out. <br>
    <br>
    On the exhale, he leads Daniel's hands straight out in front of him, still 
    clasped. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    In. <br>
    <br>
    He returns Daniel's hands to the prayer position, removing his own. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    Out. <br>
    <br>
    Daniel does the movement solo. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    In. <br>
    <br>
    His breathing is deep, measured. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    Out. <br>
    <br>
    His face calm, his eyes focus. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    In. <br>
    <br>
    The exercise has come full circle. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    How feel? <br>
    <br>
    DANIEL (pleased) Better. <br>
    <br>
    Miyagi slaps the hammer back in his hand. <br>
    <br>
    MIYAGI <br>
    Good. Back to work. <br>
    <br>
    Miyagi returns to his shade and his tea. Daniel, with renewed vigor, sets 
    up the first nail, and without hesitation drives it straight home. <br>
    <br>
    CUT TO: EXT. ALI'S HOUSE -- NIGHT <br>
    Daniel and Ali pull up in front of her house, home from what looks like a 
    disastrous date. She sits against one door and he sits against the other, 
    both waiting for the inevitable. <br>
    <br>
    ALI <br>
    Daniel? There's something we have to talk about. <br>
    <br>
    Daniel lets out a sigh. <br>
    <br>
    DANIEL <br>
    Does it have to do with us growing as individuals? <br>
    <br>
    ALI <br>
    Yes. <br>
    <br>
    DANIEL <br>
    I already heard this speech today. <br>
    <br>
    Daniel turns the engine back on. <br>
    <br>
    ALI <br>
    Don't be like this. <br>
    <br>
    DANIEL <br>
    You're breaking up with me. How should I be? <br>
    <br>
    ALI <br>
    A little understanding. <br>
    <br>
    DANIEL <br>
    Right. <br>
    <br>
    ALI <br>
    We're not gonna be together all summer and then I'm going away to school. 
    It's not fair to either one of us. <br>
    <br>
    Her words fall on deaf ears. He turns and looks through the windshield, his 
    face a mask of indifference. <br>
    <br>
    DANIEL <br>
    Goodnight. <br>
    <br>
    ALI (sorrowful) <br>
    Daniel -- ! <br>
    <br>
    She goes to stroke his cheek. He moves his face away. <br>
    <br>
    DANIEL <br>
    Please don’t. <br>
    <br>
    The hurt in his voice stops her cold. After a moment's hesitation, she exits 
    from the car. Daniel slams the accelerator to the floor, leaving rubber all 
    the way dwon the block, as Ali stands at the curb watching him go, her pain 
    as genuine as his. <br>
    <br>
    CUT TO: EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE -- NIGHT <br>
    Daniel stands in front of his car looking out over the valley, his emotions 
    raging. He joins his hands in the prayer position and starting breathing in 
    and out, trying to foucs, trying to retain control. Despite the effort, tears 
    come, and keep coming as he breathes in and out, striving to keep everything 
    from floating away.<br>

INT. APARTMENT -- DAY <br>
Daniel is sitting on an armchair, listlessly watching one rock video after another, 
moping. There is a knock at the door. <br>
<br>
DANIEL (listless) <br>
Come in. <br>
<br>
Miyagi enters. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI<br>
Daniel-san. Miss training appoint- ment three days now. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Oh, yeah. I guess I forgot. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
What matter? <br>
<br>
DANIEL Nothing. <br>
<br>
Miyagi looks at his young friend and turns the TV off. He goes over to Daniel 
and lifts him out of the chair. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI (commanding) <br>
Come! Up! <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
I really don't feel like it. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Come! Clear brain. <br>
<br>
Miyagi grabs two batting practice helmets from a shelf, puts one on Daniel and 
the other on himself. He pushes Daniel towards the door. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
I really don't feel like batting practice, either. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Who said anything about batting practice? <br>
<br>
CUT TO: <br>
<br>
EXT. BATTING CAGE <br>
An automatic pitch-and-swing range with dozens of high netted batting cages lined 
up. Daniel and Miyagi stand in one, batting helmets in place. Miyagi places Daniel 
directly in the strike zone. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI<br>
Like riddles, Daniel-san?<br>
<br>
Daniel looks around for a bat. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Sometimes. Don't I need a bat? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI<br>
Need pay attention. Now, what karate technique remind you of bird? <br>
<br>
DANIEL<br>
I don't know. What? <br>
<br>
Miyagi pushes a button on the control box by his hand. A ball comes hurtling forward 
from the pitching machine. Daniel sees the ball in the knick of time. He ducks. 
The ball whizzes past where his head was and flacks into the canvas backstop. 
That gets his attention. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Duck. (pause) Good block. Good defense. Good duck, even better. Try again. <br>
<br>
Not really sure about this, Daniel nonetheless sets himself in the strike zone, 
staring out at the auto pitch. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI<br>
When Miyagi say move, move. Not before. Now focus, concentrate. <br>
<br>
Daniel's mind locks into the auto pitch. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI<br>
Focus. <br>
<br>
CLOSEUP: <br>
Miyagi's finger hits the button. <br>
<br>
CLOSEUP: <br>
The pitching arm. The ball fires. <br>
<br>
CLOSEUP: <br>
Daniel's face, tense as the ball hurls toward him. <br>
<br>
ANGLE ON <br>
Miyagi. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI<br>
Move. <br>
<br>
The sickening thud of a baseball against flesh makes Miyagi grimace. <br>
<br>
DANIEL<br>
Oww! <br>
<br>
Miyagi walks over to a doubled up Daniel, his hands across his stomach. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI<br>
Okay, Daniel-san? <br>
<br>
DANIEL<br>
Really clears the mind. <br>
<br>
He straightens up slowly. Miyagi, proud of him. He stands in the strike zone again. 
<br>
<br>
DANIEL (determined) <br>
Do it! <br>
<br>
ANGLE ON <br>
Miyagi, pressing the button. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI<br>
Move! <br>
<br>
But again there is a sickening thud. Miyagi helps Daniel up a second time. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI<br>
Maybe take little rest. <br>
<br>
But Daniel is determined.<br>
<br>
DANIEL<br>
No. I'm okay. <br>
<br>
He stands facing the autopitch bravely. <br>
<br>
DANIEL<br>
Go. <br>
<br>
Miyagi presses the button. Daniel gets hit again.<br>
<br>
DANIEL (rising) <br>
Again. <br>
<br>
And again the same thing happens. Miyagi now grows concerned. Miyagi comes to 
the batting cage, straightening Daniel up after his last debacle. Daniel rubs 
the center of his chest this time. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI<br>
Try again tomorrow, maybe. <br>
<br>
But Daniel has his mind set on succeeding or dying trying.<br>
<br>
DANIEL<br>
No. <br>
<br>
He sets himself up. <br>
<br>
DANIEL<br>
Okay. <br>
<br>
Miyagi, with misgiving, presses the button.<br>
<br>
ANGLE ON<br>
Daniel waiting for the ball.<br>
<br>
MIYAGI<br>
Move!<br>
<br>
Daniel waits a second longer. He ducks to the side at the last moment. The ball 
sails by, flacking harmlessly against the canvas. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI (excited)<br>
Hoi, Daniel-san! <br>
<br>
DANIEL (cocky)<br>
Give me another one. <br>
<br>
Daniel sets himself up immediately. Miyagi is only too happy to comply. <br>
<br>
ANGLE ON<br>
Daniel waiting till the last moment, and then casually slipping away from the 
ball to the left. Daniel places himself in the batters box, immediately, focusing 
on the autopitch. <br>
<br>
DANIEL<br>
Another.<br>
<br>
Miyagi complies again. This time Daniel moves to the other side, a fancy little 
head move. The ball hits the canvas behind him. <br>
<br>
DANIEL (cocky)<br>
Well, okay! He walks over to the speed-selector box and turns the dial from three 
to ten.<br>
<br>
MIYAGI (cautioning)<br>
Daniel-san.<br>
<br>
DANIEL<br>
Don't worry. I'm in focus. <br>
<br>
Miyagi presses the button. The ball comes out like a comet.<br>
<br>
DANIEL (O.S.)<br>
Owww! <br>
<br>
Miyagi grimaces at the sound. Daniel comes hobbling over a moment later, and returns 
the speed lever to three. He hobbles back to the batter's cage.<br>

INT. MAINTENANCE SHACK <br>
Daniel sits on a bench with his shirt off, his body covered with bruises and welts. 
He talks to Miyagi, who is in the next room. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
You know, after a while, watching the ball today, I felt better. (beat) When it 
was just me and the ball right there. You know? Locked in? I didn't have a care 
in the world. <br>
<br>
Miyagi exits, holding a covered jar. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Know what I mean? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Called focus. <br>
<br>
He examines Daniel's bruises. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Why can't I transfer that to the rest of my world? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Can. Called practice. <br>
<br>
Miyagi opens the lid on the jar. Daniel screws up his nose at the horrible odor. 
<br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
What's that called? <br>
<br>
Miyagi slaps some on his most pronounced bruises. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Don't want to know. <br>

Lucille enters. <br>

LUCILLE <br>
Hello. <br>

DANIEL <br>
Hi, Mom. <br>
<br>
She sees Daniel's bruises. <br>
<br>
LUCILLE <br>
I won't even ask. (beat) Will he survive? <br>

MIYAGI <br>
Training will survive. Treatment not so sure. <br>
<br>
LUCILLE <br>
50-50 odds. I can live with that. <br>
<br>
She kisses Daniel. <br>
<br>
LUCILLE <br>
Are you ready for the news of the year? (pause) I was selected to attend the Company 
Training School for Regional Managers. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Congratulations. <br>
<br>
LUCILLE <br>
Thank you. <br>
<br>
Lucille picks up Daniel's silence. <br>
<br>
LUCILLE <br>
Don't show your enthusiasm all at once. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
I'm waiting for the back end. <br>
<br>
LUCILLE <br>
What back end? Your Mom's being kicked upstairs. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
And where am I getting kicked to? <br>
<br>
This is the part Lucille has been dreading. <br>
<br>
LUCILLE <br>
Chicago. It's where the course is given. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Just where I wanted to spend my summer. <br>
<br>
LUCILLE (weakly) <br>
It's only a month. <br>
<br>
Daniel turns his head. <br>
<br>
LUCILLE <br>
You can't stay here by yourself, honey… <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
No. I have to go all the way to Chicago for that. <br>
<br>
He fixes his mother with a stare, rises, pulls on his shirt and heads for the 
door. Lucille looks at Miyagi for help in the long silence. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
You know, I just had extra room built on house. <br>
<br>
Lucille catches the drift. <br>
<br>
LUCILLE <br>
I didn't know that. <br>

MIYAGI (pointed) <br>
Guest room. <br>

Daniel stops before exiting. He turns, slowly, to a smiling Lucille and Miyagi. 
<br>
<br>
LUCILLE <br>
He never makes his bed, you know? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>

Daniel, excited, runs out. <br>

Lucille lingers. She looks Miyagi directly in the eye. <br>
<br>
LUCILLE Thank you. He needed someone. <br>
<br>
Miyagi returns her look. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
So did I. <br>

CUT TO: <br>
INT. MIYAGI'S HOUSE <br>
Miyagi and Daniel are cleaning the house. Daniel removes a cigar box from the 
side table near Miyagi's bed. <br>
<br>
POV Daniel: <br>
Miyagi's war medals and decorations. Daniel examines these. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
You should make a display for these. You know. To hang up. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
For what? <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Well, it says something about you, winning the medal of honor. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
What does it say? <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
That you're brave. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
No, Daniel-san. Only this… <br>
<br>
Miyagi taps his heart. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
says you're brave. <br>
<br>
Daniel peruses the medals. Miyagi is about to exit. Daniel holds up the Medal 
of Honor. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Then what does this say you are? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Lucky. <br>
<br>
Miyagi exits. Daniel looks from the medals to his tournament trophy, wondering 
if the same applies to him<br>

EXT. MIYAGI'S FRONT YARD -- DAY <br>
<br>
Daniel is sanding Miyagi's boat down, using on his fingertips for pressure on 
the sant paper, not a very comfortable procedure to say the least. Miyagi exits 
with a lunch tray. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI<br>
Lunch time. <br>

Daniel, glad to stop, approaches, rubbing his aching fingertips. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
I'm hurting. <br>

<br>
DANIEL <br>
I don't know what I'm going to attack with them. They're the weakest part of my

<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Always something weaker. <br>
<br>
Daniel looks at his fingertips, touches them. They are very sensitive. He recoils, 
and then thinks. His face lights up with a minor revelation. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Mr. Miyagi. <br>
<br>
Miyagi turns. From the table, Daniel mock-rakes his fingertips across his eyes. 
<br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Right? Something weaker? Miyagi smiles. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Pretty soon won't need Miyagi for anything. <br>
<br>
Daniel grabs a sandwich. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
You still make the best tuna fish I ever ate. <br>
<br>
Daniel is about to take the first bite, when a car pulls up in the driveway. Miyagi 
and Daniel look up to Webster, exiting. Webster approaches, formally, dour, unlike 
his former self. <br>
<br>
WEBSTER <br>
My mother, Machiko, your father's second cousin's oldest child, sends you her 
regards. Miyagi is stunned into silence for a moment, but then his good manners 
prevail. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
I send her mine. <br>
<br>
WEBSTER <br>
They all thought you died in the war. (beat) I'm sorry it took so long to find 
you. <br>
<br>
He hands Miyagi a telegram from his shirt pocket. <br>
<br>
WEBSTER <br>
You weren't in the book. <br>
<br>
Miyagi reads the telegram and rises, almost distracted. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Thank you. <br>
<br>
He turns to go inside, forgetting about Daniel and Webster. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
What's the matter? <br>

WEBSTER <br>
His father is dying. <br>
<br>
Webster departs. Daniel looks towards the house, feeling for his friend. <br>
<br>
CUT TO: INT. HOUSE -- NIGHT <br>
<br>
Miyagi sits, eyes open, but staring inward, in front of his shrine. <br>
<br>
Daniel sits in a corner, hugging his knees to his chest, keeping the vigil. <br>
<br>
<br>
CUT TO: INT. HOUSE -- MORNING <br>
<br>
Daniel, asleep in the same position, wakens to find himself alone in the room. 
He gets up and exits to Miyagi's bedroom, where he finds Miyagi moving back and 
forth, packing a suitcase. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Mr. Miyagi? <br>
<br>
Miyagi is more cheerful than one would expect. <br>

Fine. Fine. <br>
<br>
DANIEL (down) <br>
You're going to Okinawa, huh? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Son's duty. <br>
<br>
Miyagi continues packing. Daniel's mind clouds with visions of Chicago. <br>
<br>
DANIEL (crestfallen) <br>
I guess I'll go pack too. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI Good idea. (pause) Don't want to wear the same clothes in Okinawa every 
day. <br>
<br>
The answer is not what Daniel expected. He stops, stunned. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
You're going to take me? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Can't leave you. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
We should call my Mom, maybe. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Already did. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
What did she say? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Sayonara. <br>
<br>
Daniel lets out an involuntary whoop, so excited at the prospect of traveling 
to the mythical land of Okinawa. But then he remembers the reason why. He tones 
down, somber. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
I'm sorry, Mr. Miyagi. I -- I didn't mean that. I wish we were going for another 
reason. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Thank you. So do I. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
I'll go pack. <br>
<br>
Daniel exits. Miyagi reaches under his bed and takes out a box untouched for a 
long time. He wipes the dust away from the cover and lifts it. Inside is an old 
photo album. His hand brushes across the cover. His mind brushes across time....<br>

INT. AIRPLANE -- NIGHT <br>
<br>
Daniel comes back from the toilet to find Miyagi looking through the photo album, 
at yellowed pictures. Daniel sits and looks. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Is that your village? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Hai. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
This you? <br>
<br>
Miyagi nods. <br>
<br>
CLOSEUP: <br>
A picture of two young men, one slight, the other built like a bull. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
You were pretty handsome. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
What mean were? <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Who's the other guy? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Seikichi. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
You did karate together? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Father's only other student. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
You were friends? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI Best friends. (beat) Once upon a time. <br>
<br>
Before Daniel can ask what happened, a picture slips out of the album onto the 
floor catching his attention. He retrieves it. <br>
<br>
CLOSEUP: <br>
The picture of a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Who's this? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI (soft) <br>
Yukio. <br>
<br>
When he says her name there is music in his voice harkening intimacies of long 
ago. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Special, huh? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Very special. <br>
<br>
He looks at the picture, remembering. The STEWARDESS interrupts his reverie with 
a blanket and a pillow. Daniel takes a seat also. Miyagi puts the picture away 
in his album and spreads out the blanket as the cabin lights go out. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Goodnight, Daniel-san. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Goodnight. <br>
<br>
Miyagi goes immediately to sleep. Daniel looking for a comfortable position, turning 
back and forth in his seat, notices that two pictures have fallen out of Miyagi's 
album. He picks them up. <br>
<br>
POV Daniel: <br>
The two pictures: The one of Yukio, and the other of Yukio standing at Seikichi's 
side as a couple, Miyagi standing several feet off. On the back of Yukio's picture 
is some calligraphy. <br>
<br>
STEWARDESS <br>
Can I get you anything? <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Can you translate this? <br>
<br>
He shows her the inscription. <br>
<br>
STEWARDESS "To my beloved with high hopes for the future." Anything else? <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
No, thank you. <br>
<br>
She leaves. Daniel looks at the two pictures again and over at Miyagi. <br>
<br>
CUT TO: CLOSEUP: <br>
Of Yukio, or her look alike, in real life, amidst a crowd of people, outside the 
customs area at an airport. Her POV: Miyagi and Daniel in a crowd clearing customs. 
There are many American GIs moving along with them. ANGLE ON Miyagi and Daniel 
<br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Boy, I didn't expect so many Americans. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Yes. Very big military bases on Okinawa. Biggest in all Pacific. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Look at that. <br>
<br>
Daniel points to a large advertisement on the wall in English: "LEARN KARATE AT 
OKINAWA'S BIGGEST DOJO FROM MASTER SEIKICHI. Instruction in English. For forty 
years, official instructor to the United States Military. Proven in Combat" <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Isn't that your friend's name? <br>
<br>
MIYAGI <br>
Popular name in Okinawa. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Yeah. Probably a coincidence. <br>
<br>
Daniel passes on. Miyagi takes one last look at the sign. He is not so convinced. 
<br>
<br>
CUT TO: EXT. AIRPORT <br>
Miyagi looks for a cab when a voice behind turns him. <br>
<br>
VO <br>
Miyagi-san. <br>
<br>
Miyagi turns, startled, to the real Yukio, a graceful woman of sixty, and KUMIKO, 
her grand daughter, seventeen, the spitting image. <br>
<br>
YUKIO (in halting English) <br>
Welcome… She hesitates, not sure of the word. <br>
<br>
KUMIKO (whispering) <br>
home. <br>
<br>
YUKIO <br>
Home! <br>
<br>
Miyagi is so stunned he cannot reply. <br>
<br>
YUKIO <br>
So sorry, English. Grand daughter teach. I bad student. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI (gently) <br>
No. Good student. <br>
<br>
She smiles and bows. He is almost overwhelmed by her presence. <br>
<br>
YUKIO <br>
Come. <br>
<br>
She takes Miyagi's suitcase and starts off for a nearby taxi. Kumiko and Daniel 
are left facing each other. She smiles, coyly. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
I'm Daniel. <br>
<br>
He holds out his hand. <br>
<br>
KUMIKO <br>
Kumiko. <br>
<br>
She bows. He feels funny with his hand out. Pulls it back and bows quickly. When 
she reaches for his suitcase, his hand darts to the handle, touching hers. Both 
hearts skip a beat....<br>

</font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="-1"><br>
<br>
KUMIKO Please. <br>
<br>
She prevails, lifting the suitcase, following her grandmother. Daniel follows 
her. <br>
<br>
ANGLE ON a THIRD PARTY watching from the group as they enter the taxi and depart: 
<br>
SEIKICHI, older, prosperous, stands in front of a fancy black car. His AMERICAN 
CHAUFFEUR and his BODYGUARD, both tall and rangy, with Military haircuts and dark 
sunglasses, stand behind him. Seikichi's mouth is drawn into a tight scowl. Next 
to him, with the same stern face, stands CHOZEN, 18, his grand son, and heir apparent. 
<br>
<br>
CUT TO: EXT. VILLAGE STREET -- NIGHT <br>
The entire village is asleep. The houses are dark. The narrow streets are deserted. 
A taxi pulls away from Miyagi's house. Miyagi and Daniel pick up their suitcases 
and enter the gate. Yukio and Kumiko remain outside. <br>
<br>
CUT TO: INT. HOUSE <br>
Daniel waits at the doorway of the dimly-lit room. Miyagi enters and approaches 
a futon bed where an OLD MAN near death lays with his eyes closed. Miyagi looks 
down at the frail old figure. Sensing a presence, the tired eyelids open, straining 
to focus. After a moment, the eyes spark with recognition. MIYAGI, SR. Chojun-san. 
Miyagi kneels close to the bed. <br>
<br>
MIYAGI (quietly) <br>
Hai! <br>
<br>
The Old Man struggles to raise himself up. Miyagi helps him. The Old Man says 
a few words and then collapses in his son's arms, dead. Miyagi lovingly lowers 
the body. Tears well up. He smoothes a few loose strands of hair from his father's 
face, and closes the old man's eyes forever. Daniel watches the scene for a long 
moment, fighting back tears of his own. He backs out of the room respectfully 
leaving Miyagi alone with his father and walks down a long hall. He passes a room 
with the Shoji doors open. <br>
<br>
POV Daniel: <br>
All his clothes neatly unpacked and arranged. He enters the room and examines 
his clothing, the weight of travel and recent events beginning to catch up with 
him. A shuffling from behind him turns him. An ANCIENT WOMAN smiles sweetly and 
bows. Daniel bows back. She says something in Japanese. <br>
<br>
DANIEL (English) <br>
Sorry. <br>
<br>
The woman repeats the phrase and pantomimes washing her hands, her face. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Oh, yeah. I wouldn't mind getting washed up. I mean, Hai, Hai! Pleased, the woman 
bows and bids Daniel follow, which he does. <br>
<br>
CUT TO: INT. BATHING ROOM <br>
A wooden tub with steam rising from the water's surface sits in the middle of 
the room. Daniel and the Old Lady enter. She speaks in Japanese, telling him to 
disrobe. He waits for her to leave. She doesn't move, commanding again, gesturing. 
<br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
I usually shower in the morning. <br>
<br>
She snaps again and grabs for the buttons on his shirt Daniel steps back. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Okay. I'll do it. He unbuttons his shirt slowly, self-consciously, hoping she 
will leave. To his dismay, he reaches the last button and she is still there. 
When he has taken off his shirt, she demands and is given it. Next, she points 
to his pants. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
You know, I’m kind of a private undresser.<br>
<br>
In exasperation, the old woman walks over chaterring, puts her hand on his waistband 
and unzips his fly. Daniel jumps back. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Okay. Okay. <br>
<br>
He removes his pants slowly, deliberately. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
See? I'm gonna do it. You can leave now. <br>
<br>
The moment his pants are off she confiscates them, and gives another order pointing 
to his last vestige of propriety, his underwear. <br>
<br>
DANIEL (adamant) <br>
Listen! I don't mean to be rude, but I don't even do this in front of my own mother. 
Her answer is to grab the elastic and yank. The shorts fall to his ankles. His 
hands shoot to his privates. The old lady now has all his clothes in hand. She 
smiles politely. <br>
<br>
OLD LADY <br>
Arigato! <br>
<br>
She bows and exits. Daniel, not knowing how to respond, makes a small bow back. 
When she is gone, he looks around. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Oh, this is great LaRusso. <br>
<br>
He cannot chastise himself for long, because the door opened abruptly. Daniel's 
hand shoots back ot his privates. TWO SHORT but STRAPPING WOMEN appear, smiling, 
with rows of gold-capped teeth. In their hands are buckets with sudsy water and 
wash cloths. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
Oh, no. This is where I draw the line. I do this myself. <br>
<br>
The women advance, giggling. Daniel backs up to the wall. The women lift his hands 
from his privates to his head and rest them there. They begin to wash his body 
with the wash cloths chattering away. Daniel stands there, feeling supremely silly, 
his hands atop his head. <br>
<br>
DANIEL <br>
I don't know if this is like a practical joke or anything, (beat) am I on Candid 
Camera? <br>
<br>
The girls dump buckets of water on him, and then order him into the hot bath. 
Hesitantly, Daniel steps in. The temperature is just right. He sinks in up to 
his neck. One of the women makes a pillow out of a towel and helps him lean his 
head back. When he is comfortable, both women bow and exit. Despite himself, Daniel 
has begun to enjoy the experience. He relaxes and closes his eyes. <br>
