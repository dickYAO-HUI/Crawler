</p><p><p id="act">A WHITE SCREEN

</p><p><p id="act">We sense this is someone's P.O.V.  The WHITE slowly disperses as hints
of BLUE SKY peek through.  We are DESCENDING through the CLOUDS as the
evening sunset weaves a blanket of orange and red hues over a LARGE CITY
which slowly comes INTO FOCUS.

</p><p><p id="act">Floating HIGH ABOVE the peaks and valleys of CHICAGO'S SKYLINE, as if
being mysteriously moved to a letter on a Ouija Board, WE ARE DRAWN to
an unfinished STEEL-FRAMED SKYSCRAPER.  The hum of the construction work
below fills our ears.  Gradually, WE CLOSE IN on a small yellow dot that
dances on one of the exposed beams... CLOSER STILL... Just as the
detailed creases of a yellow hard hat become evident, it tilts OUT OF
FRAME as the face of the MAN wearing it looks up into the sky.

</p><p><p id="speaker">BOB
<p id="dia">It's a shame we have to put roofs on 'em.

a magnetic personality.  He walks along the high beams with ease as he
makes his way to the service elevator.

<p id="dia">It's looking good, Mike.  I'm outta here...

<p id="dia">Okay Bob, have fun tonight.

</p><p><p id="speaker">BOB

</p><p><p id="slug">INT. PRIMATE HOUSE

</p><p><p id="act">A young woman wearing a lab coat exits a side door of the glass enclosed
structure.  This is DR. KATHERINE RUELAND, early thirties, smart, regal,
perfect-posture-pretty.  Securing the lock on the door behind her, she
stops and looks through the glass at the large GORILLA.  Using sign
language, Katherine encourages the Gorilla to eat the food.

<p id="dia">Hey, Sidney...
<p id="spkdir">(back to Katherine)
<p id="dia">I need your signature to change the Polar's diet...
<p id="spkdir">(hands her a clip board)
<p id="dia">And it's already five, I'll check in on the calf.  You go home and get

<p id="dia">Oh, thanks Chuck.
<p id="spkdir">(thinking out loud)
<p id="dia">Bob's picking up my dress... I have stockings... I have to take Mel to
<p id="dia">the park for a quick run, my hair, make-up...

</p><p><p id="speaker">CHARLIE
<p id="dia">See what this lady does for you, Sidney?

</p><p><p id="act">Katherine laughs and presses her hand against the glass. Sydney returns
the gesture, pressing his palm against hers.

</p><p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE
<p id="dia">Look at him Charlie, we'd go nuts in a place this small...

</p><p><p id="speaker">CHARLIE
<p id="dia">I know... But we're getting there.
<p id="spkdir">(friendly pat on the back)
<p id="dia">Pour on the guilt during your speech...

</p><p><p id="act">Charlie opens the door for Katherine as they walk out of the building.

</p><p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE
<p id="dia">I intend to.  Who're you bringing tonight?

</p><p><p id="speaker">CHARLIE
<p id="dia">Haven't decided yet.  Still got two hours.

</p><p><p id="act">The door closes behind them.

</p><p><p id="act">A door opens into...
</p><p><p id="slug">INT. BOB AND KATHERINE'S APARTMENT

</p><p><p id="act">An upscale old fashioned brownstone, with large rooms and hardwood
floors.  Scattered antique rugs...classy but comfortable.

</p><p><p id="act">Bob enters with their dog, "MEL", a yellow lab, unhooks the dog's leash
and slips out of his wet trench coat.  He's perfectly handsome in his
tuxedo.  Grabbing an old towel from the hat stand, he dries off Mel.

</p><p><p id="speaker">BOB
<p id="spkdir">(walking to the kitchen)
<p id="dia">I know you're hungry...

</p><p><p id="act">Mel follows Bob half way down the hall then turns back and sits at the
front door.  Bob leans back into the hall, watching Mel...

</p><p><p id="speaker">BOB (cont'd)
<p id="dia">She'll be home any minute.

</p><p><p id="act">We hear an ELECTRIC CAN OPENER... Mel looks towards the kitchen -- but
he waits for Katherine.  We hear a SET OF KEYS in the door.  Mel's tail
starts a-wagging.  Katherine enters, Mel whimpers with delight.
Katherine immediately bends down to greet him.

</p><p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE
<p id="spkdir">(dog talk)
<p id="dia">Hi, my baby, you're such a good boy.
<p id="spkdir">(Mel kisses her face)
<p id="dia">Oh, I know, I love you too.

</p><p><p id="speaker">BOB (O.C)
<p id="dia">Hey, Babe.

</p><p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE
<p id="dia">Hey, honey.  It's pouring out.  You get my dress?

</p><p><p id="act">Bob comes down the hall out of the kitchen.  Katherine is taking off her
shoes.

</p><p><p id="speaker">BOB
<p id="dia">Yep, and I took Mel out.

</p><p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE
<p id="spkdir">(looks up)
<p id="dia">In your Tux?
<p id="spkdir">(noticing)
<p id="dia">Your pant legs are soaked.

</p><p><p id="act">Bob disappears into the bathroom off the hall.

</p><p><p id="speaker">BOB
<p id="dia">Yeah.
<p id="spkdir">(he leans back with a blow dryer aimed at his ankles)
<p id="dia">Tell Mel to eat.

</p><p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE
<p id="spkdir">(dog's right next to her)
<p id="dia">Mel honey, eat.

</p><p><p id="act">Mel immediately heads for the kitchen.  Katherine walks up to Bob,
watching him blow drying his pant legs.  She grabs his face and kisses
him.

</p><p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE (cont'd)
<p id="dia">You're cute.

</p><p><p id="speaker">BOB
<p id="dia">You spend all day with an Ape, what do you expect?

</p><p><p id="act">Katherine smacks him on the butt.

</p><p><p id="right">CUT TO:
</p><p><p id="act">A BLACK SCREEN

</p><p><p id="act">We hear the sound of a SLIDE PROJECTOR.  CLICK-CLICK.

</p><p><p id="act">UP ON:

</p><p><p id="act">A SLIDE of a large GORILLA, eating a dish of pasta with his hands, FILLS
THE SCREEN.

</p><p><p id="act">We hear polite laughter, from a large group of people.  KATHERINE'S
VOICE, speaks softly into a microphone...

</p><p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE (V.O.)
<p id="dia">As you can see in this photo of Sydney, he is sometimes "too much" like
<p id="dia">man.

</p><p><p id="act">More laughter.  PULL OUT to reveal we are at...

</p><p><p id="slug">INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

</p><p><p id="act">A black tie affair in full swing.  The annual "ARTS DINNER" (Animal's
Right to Survive) has once again attracted Chicago's "upper crust" and
young hopefuls.

</p><p><p id="act">CLICK-CLICK.  Another SLIDE, FILLS THE SCREEN.  This time, it is of
SYDNEY and BOB RUELAND.

</p><p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE (V.O.)
<p id="dia">Over the last ten years, Sydney has become part of the family.  Here,
<p id="dia">he's showing his flash cards to my husband.  My husband is the one on
<p id="dia">the left.

</p><p><p id="act">Even more laughter.

</p><p><p id="right">CUT TO:
</p><p><p id="act">THE AUDIENCE

</p><p><p id="act">BOB smiles at those around him.  One GENTLEMAN teasingly pats him on
the back.  Bob looks up at the stage to his wife, with a playful "thanks
a lot" look.

</p><p><p id="act">REVERSE ANGLE

</p><p><p id="act">KATHERINE, minus the lab coat, in a lovely black evening dress, smiles
affectionately at Bob.  She CLICKS on the next SLIDE.

</p><p><p id="act">On the large screen next to her, we now see a photograph showing the
small area that Sydney is forced to live in.

</p><p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE
<p id="dia">Tonight, I was hoping I'd be able to announce that we've reached our
<p id="dia">financial goals for the expansion we so desperately need, but
<p id="dia">unfortunately, we were not awarded the grant.

</p><p><p id="act">A murmur of disgust and disappointment from the crowd.

</p><p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE (cont'd)
<p id="dia">But with one more year of fund raising, along with the money we've
<p id="dia">raised here tonight, Lincoln Park Zoo will soon be able to expand the
<p id="dia">Primate House to triple its size.

</p><p><p id="act">Applause.

</p><p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE (cont'd)
<p id="dia">And I assure you, my dear friend Sydney and his family are very excited
<p id="dia">for construction to begin.

</p><p><p id="act">Katherine CLICKS another SLIDE up onto the screen; SYDNEY and a group of
GORILLAS, all wearing hard hats.

</p><p><p id="act">Laughter from the crowd mixed with a sympathetic "ahhh".

</p><p><p id="speaker">KATHERINE (cont'd)
<p id="dia">Thank you all for your tremendous support.  Enjoy the evening.

</p><p><p id="act">Katherine receives a generous round of applause as she leaves the stage.
The last slide of Sydney still shines on the swaying screen.

</p><p><p id="act">A CONDUCTOR/M.C. steps up to the microphone.

</p><p><p id="speaker">CONDUCTOR
<p id="dia">Thank you, Dr. Rueland.  Now ladies and gentlemen, tonight's very
<p id="dia">special guest, Mr. Tony Bennett!!!

</p><p><p id="act">APPLAUSE.  TONY BENNETT steps out onto the stage...

</p><p><p id="speaker">TONY BENNETT
<p id="dia">Thank you very much.  I'm thrilled to be here tonight.  It's an honor to
<p id="dia">be a part of such a noble effort on behalf of the animals.
<p id="spkdir">(indicates the band)
<p id="dia">The boys and I have worked up a little something special for you...

</p><p><p id="act">With a wave of Tony's arm...the BAND kicks into a jazzed up version of
"IN THE JUNGLE".

</p><p><p id="speaker">TONY BENNETT (cont'd)

</p><p><p id="act">A YOUNG WOMAN lies in bed.  A well cared for plant blooms on the night
stand, behind it, a small easel holds a half finished watercolor.
Posters of famous European cities decorate the walls.  We get the sense
this room has been her home for a month or so.

</p><p><p id="act">The patient is GRACE BRIGGS, late twenties.  An attractive, shy and frail
woman.

</p><p><p id="act">Grace barely responds as her best friend, MEGAN DAYTON, seated in the
chair next to the bed, reads a Cosmo quiz aloud from the magazine.

</p><p><p id="speaker">MEGAN
<p id="dia">Is it most important that a man is, A: Polite to your family and
<p id="dia">friends? B: Can handle finances well? Or C:  Will take care of you when
<p id="dia">you are ill?  Well, I guess your answer is definitely C.

</p><p><p id="act">Megan checks a box.  Grace smiles.

</p><p><p id="speaker">MEGAN (cont'd)
<p id="dia">What do you expect most from a relationship?  A: Companionship?  B: Sex?
<p id="dia">C: Respect?  I'd have to go with B, sex.  But let's mark "C" so we get a
<p id="dia">higher score.  This is pathetic, I'm cheating on a magazine quiz.

</p><p><p id="act">Grace stirs a little.  Megan immediately gets up and leans over the bed
to hear anything Grace may say.

</p><p><p id="speaker">MEGAN (cont'd)
<p id="dia">What?  What is it?  What d'ya need?  Your back?  Move the pillow?  Your
<p id="dia">neck?

<p id="spkdir">(whispers)
<p id="dia">Rosebud.

</p><p><p id="speaker">MEGAN
<p id="dia">Very funny.

</p><p><p id="speaker">GRACE
<p id="dia">I just want some water.

</p><p><p id="act">Megan holds a paper cup of water and bends the straw to Grace's mouth.
We see the great amount of effort it takes for Grace to drink the water.

</p><p><p id="speaker">GRACE (cont'd)
<p id="dia">Thanks.

</p><p><p id="speaker">MEGAN
<p id="dia">Would you like me to bring the check or will you be ordering dessert?

<p id="dia">Megan, you can go home, y'a know.

<p id="dia">To what?  I don't have cable, you do.

</p><p><p id="speaker">GRACE
<p id="dia">What about Joe and the kids?

</p><p><p id="speaker">MEGAN
<p id="dia">He likes me more when I'm not around.  And the kids like me a lot more
<p id="dia">after they've been alone with Joe.
<p id="spkdir">(smoothing Grace's blankets)
<p id="dia">It's good for him to be with the kids when they're coming down from the
<p id="dia">sugar.  He usually fuels 'em up and then they go through de-tox on my

<p id="dia">Hey, Dr. Senderak.

</p><p><p id="act">The Doctor goes to switch places with Megan, who moves out of the way,
careful not to knock into any of the I.V. stands or monitors; they've
done this dance a million times.

<p id="dia">You're about the same, hematocrit 16, SMA 20... Some things are a bit

<p id="spkdir">(putting chart under his arm)
<p id="dia">I'll see you tomorrow.

</p><p><p id="act">As the doctor exits...

</p><p><p id="speaker">MEGAN
<p id="dia">Doctor, why don't you give her your heart?  You're not using it.

</p><p><p id="speaker">MEGAN
<p id="dia">What?  I wish he'd do...something.

</p><p><p id="speaker">GRACE
<p id="dia">He can't.  Even if a heart's available, they won't give it to me.  I
<p id="dia">just have my Grandpa pressuring them.  I have no husband, no children.
<p id="dia">I may never get a heart.

</p><p><p id="speaker">MEGAN
<p id="dia">Listen, Tin Man.  You've got me.  I'm pressuring them.

</p><p><p id="speaker">GRACE
<p id="dia">Thanks, Meg.

<p id="spkdir">(fixing bed sheets)
<p id="dia">You'll get a new heart and before you know it, you'll be back in your

</p><p><p id="speaker">GRACE
<p id="dia">I'm getting a new heart, not a new ass.

</p><p><p id="speaker">MEGAN
<p id="dia">My point is, you'll be out doing things you were never able to do,
<p id="dia">riding a bike...

<p id="dia">Traveling, painting in Europe...

</p><p><p id="speaker">GRACE
<p id="dia">It's too late, Megan.  I'm too old.  I'm twenty-seven.  My mother's

<p id="dia">Promise me you'll take care of my grandpa...

</p><p><p id="speaker">MEGAN
<p id="dia">Twenty-seven is not old.  I'm thirty-three...four...five -- whatever.

<p id="dia">Oh, hi Mr. Bennington, I didn't see you or I would have stopped and said
<p id="dia">hello.

</p><p><p id="speaker">MR. BENNINGTON
<p id="dia">Katherine's speech was wonderful.  I suppose she told you about the
