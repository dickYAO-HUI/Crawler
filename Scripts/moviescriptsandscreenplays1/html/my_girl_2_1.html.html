                             By Janet Kovalcik



       SETTING:  MADISON, PENNYSYLVANIA 1974


       CLOSE-UP OF VADA SULTENFUSS' FACE

                                   VADA
              I remember before I was born, wounded up like 
              a fur ball in the highly overrated fetal 
              position, luckily I'm not claustrophobic, but 
              on rainy days I still feel a tightness in my 
              left shoulder. So now that my stepmother's 
              pregnant, I understand what the baby's going 
              through, and I'm not jealous at all, really, 
              not at all.

       VIEW OF THE SULTENFUSS' DINING ROOM TABLE. VADA, HARRY AND 
       SHELLY ARE SEATED. SHELLY IS VERY PREGNANT

                                   HARRY
              Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.

                                   SHELLY
              If I eat it I'll throw up.

                                   HARRY
              Well you should at least try a little bit.

                                   SHELLY
              Then I'll throw up a little bit.

                                   VADA
                     (to Shelly's stomach)
              Are you sure you wanna get involved in this?

       OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, MUSIC IS PLAYING OUR HOUSE, 
       INSIDE HARRY IS SINGING

                                   HARRY
              ...windows are illuminated by the evening 
              sunshine through them firey gems for you, only 
              for you, our house, is a very, very, very fine 
              house, with two cats in the yard, life used to 
              be so hard, now everything is easy 'cause of 
              you...

       Harry walks to Vada who is placing chairs in rows in the 
       funeral room

                                   HARRY
              Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a 
              little more.

                                   VADA
              Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't 
              scrunch.

       Doorbell rings

                                   ARTHUR
              I'll get it.

                                   HARRY
              Well I guess we'll just set up more chairs in 
              the library and pipe the sermon in like we did 
              with Old Man Hasselmeyer.

                                   VADA
              Better fix that speaker, it makes the 
              minister sound like an astronaut.

       Arthur opens the front door to reveal Judy

                                   ARTHUR
              Oh, hello Judy.

                                   JUDY
              Hi Arthur.

       Harry walks past

                                   HARRY
              Hi Judy, come on in.

                                   JUDY
              Hi Mr. Sultenfuss.

                                   ARTHUR
                     (to Vada)
              Look who I found.

                                   VADA
              Hi Judy!

       Judy doesn't enter the funeral room. She doesn't like the 
       idea of being anywhere near a corpse

                                   JUDY
                     (nervous)
              Hi.

                                   VADA
              Come on in!

                                   JUDY
              That's okay.

                                   VADA
              It's just a corpse.

                                   JUDY
              I know that.

                                   VADA
              You should be here when they bring in a body 
              that's been dead for a couple of days, and 
              they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an 
              apartment, and no-one came to visit, or 
              floating in a river, and then the body starts 
              turning this weird shade of green, you know, 
              like watery pea soup? The arms and legs 
              deteriorate first, the body looks like a 
              raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why 
              I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??

       front door closes

              Judy???

                                   ARTHUR
              I think you lost on the raisin with the four 
              fat legs honey.

       LIVING ROOM, HARRY AND SHELLY ARE SITTING WATCHING TV, VADA 
       GETS A DRINK AND JOINS THEM

       Harry and Shelly are laughing

                                   HARRY
              I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los 
              Angeles today, said he went body surfing.

                                   VADA
              I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body 
              surfing.

                                   SHELLY
              I don't know if I want to.

                                   HARRY
              Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you 
              can absolutely say no if you want to.

       Shelly gives Harry a look

              I'm just bringing it up for discussion.

                                   SHELLY
              But Harry, I thought we decided we weren't 
              gonna do this.

       Vada looks confused

                                   VADA
              Do what?

                                   HARRY
              Well the thing is your room is right next 
              door to ours, and so we thought, well, I 
              thought, if you were willing we might move you 
              to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for 
              the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the 
              night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of 
              noise....

                                   VADA
              You want me to move?

                                   HARRY
              Well not far, just down the hall. Plus 
              Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a 
              view of the whole neighborhood.

       Vada looks a little put out

                                   VADA
              Okay, no problem.

                                   HARRY
              Okay thanks, atta girl.

       OUTSIDE, ON THE DECK, HARRY IS PLAYING HIS TUBA, SHELLY 
       COMES OUT

                                   SHELLY
                     (at the door)
              Harry? 
                     (closer, a little louder)
              HARRY?? 
                     (in Harry's ear)

              *HARRY*!!!!

       Harry gets a fright and blows a foul note

              I'm sorry to interrupt honey but Vada's 
              upset.

                                   HARRY
              Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.

                                   SHELLY
              Look we react to every kick this baby gives, 
              maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.

       BOWLING ALLEY, VADA AND HARRY ARE BOWLING, CLOSE UP OF 
       HARRY HOLDING UP HIS BALL

                                   HARRY
              The thing to remember is you must visualize a 
              spare. The parabola of the arcing ball must 
              intersect with the pyramid of the pins at 
              precisely this angle of attack.

       Harry bowls his ball, which goes straight into the side 
       ditch

              Shit.

       Harry walks back to Vada

                                   VADA
              Visualize a spare?

                                   HARRY
              Well you know what I mean.

                                   VADA
              So, what's on your mind?

                                   HARRY
              Me? What makes you think there's something on 
              my mind?

                                   VADA
              You're passing up Archie Bunker to go 
              bowling, you've gotta have an angle.

                                   HARRY
              No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of 
              us had an evening out so we could... talk.

       Vada stands up and picks up a ball

                                   VADA
              Shelly's already told me all about sex.

                                   HARRY
              She told me too, I mean, she told me she told 
              you about sex, I personally new about sex long 
              before I met Shelly.

                                   VADA
              I figured you did.

       Vada bowls her ball and gets a perfect strike

                                   VADA
              Yes!

       Vada returns and sits down

                                   HARRY
              Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this 
              talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been 
              a lot of changes, and I know you're upset 
              about losing your room, but the baby's gotta 
              go somewhere.

                                   VADA
              No it's okay, I understand, really.

                                   HARRY
              Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you 
              Vada.

       Harry then gets up to bowl again

                                   VADA
              Maybe I should just move to China. One kid 
              per family, that way you don't lose your room.

                                   HARRY
              Hey, why don't you just keep your room and 
              we'll put the baby in the back yard.

                                   VADA
              Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.

                                   HARRY
              Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and 
              the weed killer.

                                   VADA
              Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.

                                   HARRY
              Seriously?

                                   VADA
              Seriously.

                                   HARRY
              Great.

       Harry stands poised to bowl...

                                   VADA
              I'm thirteen, maybe it's about time I got my 
              own apartment.  

       THUD, Harry drops his ball and turns around looking 
       staggered, then sees that Vada is definitely kidding

       VADA AND JUDY ARE IN A SHOP SMELLING PERFUMES

                                   JUDY
              My mother can't have any more kids.

                                   VADA
              Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly 
              who's pregnant.

                                   JUDY

                     (raising wrist to Vada's nose)
              What do you think?

       Vada smells Judy's wrist

                                   VADA
              I think I'm leaning towards passionflower, it 
              combines the traditional floral scent with the 
              musty aroma of samba wood.

       a group of teenage guys enter the shop

                                   VADA
              What are you staring at?

                                   JUDY
              It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.

                                   VADA
              See you? He can smell you from there.

                                   JUDY
              Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, 
              totally natural.

       Vada and Judy stand close to a rack of sunglasses, Kevin 
       and his two friends approach

                                   JUDY
                     (looks at Kevin with a large smile, 
                     and slowly takes her sunglasses off)

              Hi Kevin.

                                   KEVIN
              Hi.

       Vada turns around wearing sunglasses with ENORMOUS lenses

                                   KEVIN
                     (to Vada)
              Real cool Sultenfuss, you look like a 
              grasshopper.

       His group of friends laugh and move off

                                   VADA
              What's the matter?

                                   JUDY
              He likes you.

                                   VADA
              Likes me? He said I looked like a 
              grasshopper.

                                   JUDY
              Boys always pretend they hate you when they 
              really like you.

                                   VADA
              That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't 
              stand someone, then you pretend that you're 
              really crazy about them?

                                   JUDY
              I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a 
              jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all 
              yours!

                                   VADA'S THOUGHTS
              If grasshopper is a term of endearment, I've 
              got a lot to learn.

       BEDROOM IN SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, ARTHUR, SHELLY, HARRY AND 
       VADA ARE MOVING AROUND DOING VARIOUS THINGS

                                   ARTHUR
              So have you guys thought of any new names for 
              the baby?

       Vada looks annoyed and drops with a thud the load of books 
       she is carrying

                                   SHELLY
              Umm, yeah, if it's a girl I'm kinda leaning 
              toward Esme.

                                   ARTHUR
              Esme?

                                   HARRY
              Yeah, you know that kinda sounds like a noise 
              your nose makes, 
                     (nasalised)
              es-MEH. I mean it's...

                                   ARTHUR
              And what if it's a boy?

                                   HARRY
              Oh Harry Junior of course.

                                   VADA
              Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend 
              that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends 
              that he doesn't like you how can you tell that 
              he likes you?

                                   HARRY
              What boy likes you?

                                   VADA
              It's just a question, it's not about anybody.

                                   ARTHUR
              Uh oh, here comes puberty.

                                   SHELLY
              Vada, I think what you're talking about is 
              the fear of rejection. You see men will do 
              anything to avoid looking foolish.

                                   HARRY
              Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my 
              needle nosed pliers?

                                   SHELLY
              Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with 
              you, it really means he didn't have nerve to 
              ask you out on a date, so you'll get your 
              homework together and pretend to be studying, 
              and the next thing you know you're ordering 
              pizza and talking about your favorite movie 
              stars.

                                   VADA
              So you're saying...What are you saying??

                                   HARRY
              Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over 
              anxious, so if you think there's a boy that 
              might like you, let him know that you like 
              him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk 
              when he's thinking of asking you out.

              Okay?

       OUTSIDE, VADA IS RIDING HER BIKE DOWN THE PAVEMENT AND 
       ARRIVES AT JUDY'S HOUSE

       Vada presses the doorbell, Judy opens the door

                                   JUDY
              Hi.

                                   VADA
              Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my 
              new room tomorrow?

                                   JUDY
              ehh...I don't know I mean....

       Kevin appears from inside the house holding a carton of 
       juice

                                   KEVIN
              Is it okay if I drink this?

                                   VADA
              It's okay with me, hi Kevin.

                                   KEVIN
              Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.

                                   JUDY
              Stop it Kevin.

                                   KEVIN
              I was kidding, it's a joke okay.

                                   JUDY
              We were just doing our homework and studying 
              for the test.

                                   VADA
              And the next thing you know you're gonna be 
              ordering pizza and talking about your favorite 
              movie stars. See ya.

       Vada gets on her bike and rides off

                                   VADA'S THOUGHTS
              In the future I think I'll stick to asking 
              Dad for advice on embalming.

       VADA IS CLIMBING THE STAIRS COMING TOWARD THE CAMERA, SHE 
       HEARS SHELLY SINGING &quot;BABY LOVE&quot; AND HARRY PLAYING THE TUBA 
       IN A BEDROOM AND ENTERS

                                   SHELLY
              Baby, Baby, Baby love, my baby love, I need 
              you oh how I need you, why do you do me like 
              you do, haven't I been good to you, so deep in 
              love with you, Baby, Baby.

              I read an article that says if you sing to 
              the baby it's a calming influence.

                                   VADA
              Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.

                                   SHELLY
              I bet your mom sang to you.

                                   HARRY
              Well if there was an article about it I'm 
              sure she did. She was always reading.

                                   SHELLY
              Yes I know, it runs in the family. 
                     (to Vada)
              New book?

                                   VADA
              The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer

                                   HARRY
              Her favorite poet.

                                   SHELLY
                     (shaking head)
              Never heard of him.
                     (burp} 
              Excuse me.

                                   HARRY
              How about a nice glass of milk?

                                   SHELLY
              And some taco chips so I can dunk.

       Harry leaves, and Shelly leans forward to talk to Vada

                                   SHELLY
              You know Vada, being an older sister, you're 
              gonna be very important in this baby's life.

       Vada's glance shifts onto Shelly's enlarged breasts, she 
       smiles, a little embarrassed, Shelly looks down at them and 
       laughs

                                   SHELLY
              They're enormous, I know.

                                   VADA
              Is there milk in them already?

                                   SHELLY
              No, the milk comes when the baby comes.

                                   VADA
              When did you umm, I mean umm...

                                   SHELLY
              Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to 
              call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had 
              real bra's, not like the training ones I had.

                                   VADA
              Why do they call them training bra's? It's 
              not like learning to ride a bike.

                                   SHELLY
              I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing 
              you for the rest of your life. It's not easy 
              being a woman.

                                   VADA
              You're telling me.

       VADA'S ROOM, BOXES EVERYWHERE, VADA IS LYING ON HER BED 
       THINKING TO HERSELF

                                   VADA'S THOUGHTS
              All the great writers pondered the meaning of 
              life and death. I've been thinking a lot about 
              my mother recently, even though I don't have 
              any memories of her. I wish I could see her 
              just once, even if it were only in a dream. I 
              know she'd help me figure things out.

       VADA'S ENGLISH CLASS AT SCHOOL

                                   MR. OWETT
              Bless me now with your fierce tears I pray, 
              do not go gentle into that good night, rage, 
              rage against the dying of the light.

              What do you think Dylan Thomas is saying 
              here? &quot;Rage against the dying of the light.&quot;

                                   KEVIN
              He's mad 'cause they shut-off his 
              electricity.

       class laughs

                                   MR. OWETT
              I think he was referring to life energy Mr. 
              Phillips, which in your case wouldn't cause 
              much of a power shortage, now would it?

       class goes &quot;oooohh&quot;, Vada then raises her hand

                                   MR. OWETT
              Vada?

                                   VADA
              The poem is really about attitude. It's about 
              not giving up and...it's easy to be 
              overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we 
              should...force ourselves to push on.

              Alfred Biedermeyer said, &quot;To heed the urgent 
              inner voice, embracing destiny, not choice&quot;.

                                   MR. OWETT
              That's very good Vada. All right, moving on, 
              I want to give you guys a chance to write.

       class does an &quot;awe man&quot;

              Hey, hey, hey, listen up, I want you to write 
              about someone very special, someone 
              interesting, someone you admire, someone who 
              has achieved something worth writing about, 
              but it's gotta be a stranger, someone you've 
              never met, I want you to investigate the 
              personal side, play Perry Mason, see what you 
              can come up with. All right? Any ideas? 
              Remember two things: Someone who has achieved 
              something and someone you have never met.

       Kevin raises his hand

              Kevin?

                                   KEVIN
              Elvis, the king.

                                   MR. OWETT
              Elvis, the king.

       another guy raises his hand

              Devon?

                                   DEVON
              Farrah Fawcet, I love to watch that girl run.

                                   MR. OWETT
              Why is that Mr. Reid?

              Devon
              ...never mind.

       class laughs

                                   MR. OWETT
              Vada what about you, who have you come up 
              with?

                                   VADA
              My mother.

                                   MR. OWETT
              Your mother?

                                   VADA
              I never met my mother.

       VADA, HARRY AND SHELLY ARE WALKING DOWN TOWN TALKING

                                   VADA
              I know my mom's favorite color was pink, and 
              she ate peanut butter and banana sandwiches 
              for breakfast, but that's not what I would 
              call hard hammered facts.

                                   HARRY
              I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?

                                   SHELLY
              No.

                                   HARRY
              Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for 
              Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it 
              so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up 
              under the Christmas tree.

                                   VADA
              Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was 
              this sickening smell permeating the entire 
              house.

                                   SHELLY
              Oh no.

                                   HARRY
              Yeah when I picked it up it sort of exploded 
              and liquefied at the same time.

       Shelly laughs

              It wasn't funny, it soaked clear through 
              Grammoo's oriental.

                                   VADA
              There's still a big spot on the floor.

       INSIDE A GENERAL STORE, VADA, SHELLY AND HARRY ENTER

                                   HARRY
              Okay, we need wallpaper paste. 
                     (to shop owner)
              Hey Cece!

                                   VADA
              Oh, is there anything else you remember, how 
              did you propose? Was it romantic?

                                   HARRY
              Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root 
              beer float.

                                   SHELLY
              Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.

                                   VADA
              Did she mention any contests that she won? I 
              mean she must have had some awards, she was so 
              talented and all.

                                   HARRY
              She was talented, but honey I wish I could 
              help you a little more, it's just that your 
              mother and I had kind of a whirlwind 
              courtship, she came to town with this 
              traveling theater group, I proposed on our 
              second date, two weeks later we were married 
              and almost nine months later you were here and 
              she was gone.

                                   VADA
              Was it a nice funeral?

                                   HARRY
              Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did 
              a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used 
              the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered 
              wallpaper for your room?

              How about this?

       AT SCHOOL, VADA IS WALKING DOWN CROWDED STAIRS BEHIND MR. 
       OWETT

                                   VADA
              Hi Mr. Owett.

                                   MR. OWETT
              Hey Vada. How's your report coming?

                                   VADA
              Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know 
              where to start.

                                   MR. OWETT
              You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, 
              I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a 
              fascinating life.

                                   VADA
              Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my 
              mom, she led a fascinating life too.

                                   MR. OWETT
              I'm sure she did. 
                     (to Judy and Kevin, who are standing 
                     near Vada)

              Hey guys.

                                   KEVIN
              Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you 
              wouldn't have to write about your mother.

                                   VADA
              But I wanna write about her.

                                   KEVIN
              You're crazy, what was her big achievement? 
              Did she invent gravity?

                                   VADA
              No-one invented gravity, it just exists.

                                   JUDY
              Then what did she do?

                                   VADA
              Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but 
              since I'm gonna write about it I might as well 
              tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.

                                   KEVIN
              Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? 
              And where did she spy on the Russians from, 
              here in Pennsylvania??

                                   VADA
              No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to 
              Russia undercover with her acting troupe and 
              got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans 
              sent back. Just when she was about to go home, 
              she got caught, and they killed her.

                                   KEVIN
              All right, so when did she have you between 
              all her acting and spying and getting caught?

                                   VADA
              That's simple. She was pregnant with 
              me...when she went to Russia and she didn't 
              know...and then when the Russians found out, 
              they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not 
              allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the 
              world.

                                   JUDY
              So she had you in jail, in Russia?

                                   VADA
              Well actually I was born in Siberia and then 
              they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.

                                   KEVIN
              Vada, if bullshit wore a bra, you'd be topic. 
              Come on Judy.

       Kevin and Judy walk off

                                   VADA
              Ohh...ask anyone, ask my Dad!
                     (pause)
              Could be true.

       Vada goes to her locker and opens it, exchanging books

                                   VADA'S THOUGHTS
              How come guys talk so much when they have 
              nothing to say, and girls have plenty to say, 
              but no-one will listen.

       VIEW OF RUG ON FLOOR OF SULTENFUSS' LIVING ROOM, VADA LIFTS 
       UP THE RUG AND EXPOSES THE LARGE BLACK PATCH THAT THE 
       PUMPKIN LEFT SHOWING SHELLY

                                   VADA
              I used to come down here and sleep on this 
              spot when I was little.

              My report is gonna be a disaster, everything 
              I know about her fits into one little box.

                                   SHELLY
              A box?

       TOP VIEW OF BOX, VADA AND SHELLY ARE SITTING ON A BED 
       LOOKING THROUGH IT

                                   SHELLY
              Oh Vada, what a sweet baby book!

                                   VADA
              It's only filled out to page two. I was eight 
              pounds, four ounces.
                     (looking further in box)
              There's so many programs, she was in a lot of 
              plays.

              Dad said that when she was on stage, she held 
              the audience in the palm of her hand.

                                   SHELLY
                     (looking at a small brown paper bag)
              What's this? December 8th, 1958?

                                   VADA
              I don't know, Dad doesn't either.

                                   SHELLY
              Well, it must mean something. She was 
              obviously very sentimental.

                                   VADA
                     (as Shelly pulls out a passport)
              This is one of my favorite things, her 
              passport.

                                   SHELLY
                     (looking at the photo)
              Oh Vada she's so beautiful.

              Margaret Ann Muldovan, Born in Los Angeles, 
              California, February 7th 1936. Aquarius.

                                   VADA
              Margaret's my middle name, but everybody 
              called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever 
              been there?

                                   SHELLY
              No. You know they say, that it never rains, 
              that you can barbecue on Christmas 
              day...instead of riding your bike, you just 
              surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the 
              place is just crawling with celebrities. I 
              know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up 
              his dry-cleaning.

                                   VADA
              Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?

                                   SHELLY
              Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little 
              adventure.

                                   VADA
              I wonder why she got a passport if she never 
              went anywhere.

                                   SHELLY
              Well you've gotta be prepared.

                                   VADA
              I'm definitely traveling some day.

       Shelly gets an idea

                                   SHELLY
              Why not now?

                                   VADA
              What do you mean?

                                   SHELLY
              How would you like to go visit your Uncle 
              Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your 
              spring vacation, you could do research on your 
              mom.

                                   VADA
              But what about you and the baby? You need me.

                                   SHELLY
              Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for 
              another six weeks or so.

                                   VADA
              Yeah, it would be kinda great.

                                   SHELLY
              It would be fantastic.

                                   VADA
              But Dad'll never go for it.

                                   SHELLY
              You leave your father to me.

       FOYER OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, HARRY AND SHELLY ENTER THROUGH 
       A DOOR ARGUING

                                   SHELLY
              We should encourage her to spread her wings.

                                   HARRY
              She can spread her wings, right here in 
              Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to 
              Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears 
              pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what 
              else.

                                   SHELLY
              She is not a child Harry, she is a young 
              woman, she's on the brink of...

                                   HARRY
              Disaster, disaster lurks behind every
                     (hesitates)
              palm tree.

                                   SHELLY
              You're being narrow-minded.

       Harry begins to move up the stairs

                                   HARRY
              Look, maybe when she's a little older, I'd be 
              more then happy to bring up...

       Vada approaches from upstairs

                     (to Vada)
              Ohh...Hi Vada, we were just having a 
              little....

                                   VADA
              You were just having a fight about me. 
              Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?

                                   HARRY
              Of course.

                                   VADA
              I think that if I'm old enough to accept a 
              new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a 
              new room, I'm old enough to go to California.

                                   HARRY
              Honey I know it's fun to think about these 
              things but....

                                   VADA
              I already bought a ticket.

                                   HARRY
              What??

                                   VADA
              I used my own money and got a great deal, 
              it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I 
              have to change planes in Dallas and stay over 
              a Saturday.

              There's no exchanges or refunds, so...if you 
              don't let me go then I will have wasted my 
              entire life savings.

                                   HARRY
              Ah, uh, uh, bu...but...but I... I... Isn't it 
              against the law to sell airline tickets to 
              minors?

       Harry looks at Shelly, who looks guilty

              Don't tell me you aided and abetted this 
              little scheme?

                                   SHELLY
              Well, Vada needed me.

       Vada leaves the room

              Besides the airline requires the signature of 
              an adult.

                                   HARRY
              Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who 
              wasn't having hormone surges.

                                   SHELLY
              Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five 
              days here.

                                   HARRY
              I really think we're going overboard for just 
              a simple school assignment.

       VADA IS BACK IN LIVING ROOM, RUBBING HER HAND ON THE 
       PUMPKIN STAIN SPOT, WE CAN HEAR HARRY AND SHELLY IN THE 
       BACKGROUND

                                   SHELLY
              But it's not a little school assignment. I 
              think maybe all of this is happening for a 
              reason.

                                   HARRY
              Reason? What reason?

       VADA LIES DOWN AND PUTS HER HEAD ON THE SPOT

                                   SHELLY
              Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the 
              baby being born, Vada's report, I think...

       CAMERA IS BACK ON SHELLY AND HARRY

              ...maybe all of these are signs, signs that 
              it's time for Vada to take this trip.

                                   HARRY
              Signs. OOOOOOOOOOOH, let me get the loch ness 
              monster on the phone, you two have a lot to 
              talk about. No, I'm sorry, Vada is NOT going 
              to Los Angeles, now I have made my decision 
              and that is final.

       AT THE AIRPORT, VADA AND HARRY ARE WALKING OUT TOWARDS THE 
       CHECK IN DESK

                                   HARRY
              And remember don't talk to anyone, even if a 
              nun sits next to you, don't talk to her.

                                   VADA
              No nuns, got it.

                                   HARRY
              And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people 
              are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and 
              on drugs...and don't come running to me when 
              you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on 
              your toe having been beaten up into an 
              unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T 
              make eye contact, it communicates an implied 
              vulnerability.

       Vada hands her ticket to the attendant

                                   VADA
              What does that mean?

                                   HARRY
              It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never 
              let his baby girl out of his sight for the 
              simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why 
              don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the 
              damn plane already?

       Vada gives Harry a hug

                                   VADA
              Bye Dad, I'll miss you.

                                   HARRY
              Thanks, I needed that.

                                   VADA
              I'll be back in 137 hours.

                                   HARRY
              Have fun.

       Vada waves as she boards the plane

              Not too much.

       OUTSIDE VIEW OF AIRBORNE PLANE, SWITCHES TO INSIDE VIEW OF 
       VADA AT HER WINDOW SEAT, SHE GETS OUT HER BOX AND LOOKS 
       THROUGH IT AGAIN

                                   VADA'S THOUGHTS
              It's hard to believe that my mother's whole 
              life fits into this box. I've just gotta think 
              of this stuff as clues...or good luck charms.

              But I need more than luck to solve this 
              puzzle, I need a miracle.

       CONVEYOR BELT AT AIRPORT IN LA VADA'S BAG DROPS ONTO BELT 
       AND BEGINS TO MOVE ALONG, AT FIRST ATTEMPT VADA MISSES HER 
       BAG, THEN SHE GETS IT

       Vada has her bag and stands in the middle of the terminal 
       waiting, a boy is seen running into the building, he stops 
       and looks around, passing straight by Vada, then turning and 
       trying to get a look at her, Vada will not allow this as she 
       keeps turning away from him

                                   BOY
              Are you waiting for someone?

       Vada stays turned away and does not reply

                                   BOY
              Excuse me I asked you a question.

                                   VADA
              I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not 
              even nuns.

                                   BOY
              You're Vada right?

       Vada turns nervously and looks at him

                                   VADA
              How did you know my name?

                                   BOY
              Your Uncle Phil told me.

                                   VADA
              Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.

                                   BOY
              Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or 
              something?

                                   VADA
              This is California, anything is possible.  

                                   BOY
              Well if I was looking for a victim, I 
              definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who 
              outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who 
              would I ask for ransom? You??

                                   VADA
              Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance 
              or is it just an attitude problem.

                                   BOY
              My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is 
              giving me five bucks to pick you up but I 
              don't get paid 'till delivery.

                                   VADA
              Gee, that is a problem.

       the boy picks up Vada's suitcase and begins to walk off 
       with it

                                   VADA
              Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!

                                   BOY
              What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a 
              polite person helped carry your bag?

                                   VADA
              I don't think you're very polite.

                                   BOY
              Yeah, well I don't think you're very 
              grateful. A lot of people in your position 
              would say &quot;thank you&quot;.

       he begins to move off, Vada follows

                                   VADA
              THANK YOU.

                                   BOY
              Don't mention it.

                                   VADA
              I don't even know your name.

                                   NICK
              It's Nick.
                     (giving Vada's ticket to attendant)
              There you go.

                                   ATTENDANT
                     (checks ticket against luggage)
              Okay.

                                   NICK
              Thanks.

       outside

                                   NICK
              Oh great, no cabs!

       Hari Krishna guy approaches Vada

                                   MAN
              I have a gift for you.

       he gives her something

                                   VADA
              Thanks....

                                   NICK
              No THANKS!

                                   VADA
              He said it was a gift.

                                   NICK
              Yeah, RIGHT.

                                   VADA
              I don't need you to be telling me to...

                                   NICK
              TAXI!!!

       the two rush up to a waiting taxi, cutting off a woman who 
       was about to get in

                                   NICK
              Get in...get in!!

                                   TAXI DRIVER
              Okay, you look like a man who knows where 
              he's going, where're we headed?

                                   NICK
              Take the 405 to Santa Monica, Santa Monica to 
              Whittier, Whittier to Sunset.

       CAMERA IS FOLLOWING TAXI FROM SKY, SONG IS PLAYING 
       SWINGTOWN VADA IS WATCHING OUT WINDOW ALL THE SIGHTS, THEY 
       PASS AN OIL PUMP, A HUGE DONUT STORE, CAPITOL RECORDS 
       BUILDING ETC.

       Vada waves out the window to a surfer in a red convertible, 
       then they turn off, and pull up to a building with &quot;BUDAPEST 
       auto repair&quot; written on it

                                   NICK
                     (paying driver)
              There you go.
                     (to Vada)
              See that building, my grandfather built it. 
              Budapest auto repair.
                     (points)
              That's my room right up there. One of these 
              days this is all gonna be mine.

       Vada enters the large garage and sees Phil walking inwards

                                   VADA
              Uncle Phil!!

       Phil turns around

                                   PHIL
              Vada!! 
       Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms 
              Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You 
              look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?

                                   VADA
              They're great.

                                   PHIL
              How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?

                                   VADA
              He was very polite, worth the entire five 
              dollars.

                                   PHIL
              Uh huh, well...good to know.
       Phil hands Nick a               5 note

                                   NICK
              Thanks

                                   ROSE
                     (appears from behind a door, holding 
                     phone under her ear)
              Give it back Nicholas!

                                   NICK
              But we made a business deal.

                                   ROSE
              What ever happened to a good old-fashioned 
              favor huh?

       Nick returns the               5

                                   ROSE
                     (into phone)
              Now Irving our family's been dealing with 
              your company for over forty years now, now 
              either the timing chain is here or isn't here 
              and from what I can see it isn't here, now you 
              wanna come down and explain to the customers 
              why we can't re-assemble the cars because not 
              all the parts are here.

              Now come on, I have enough trouble keeping my 
              weight down, I don't need this blubber from 
              you, are we quite clear on this Irving or do I 
              have to speak with your father?
                     (pause)
              Thank you. Yes, yes I love you too Irving. 
       she then hangs up, and notices Vada

              You must be Vada! Oh what a face! 
       she leans over and hugs Vada 
              Oh if I had a face like that I wouldn't have 
              to yell so much. I'm Rose, Rose Zsigmond, 
              Nick's mother among other things.

                                   VADA
              You're Nick's mother?

                                   ROSE
              What, did you think he was raised by a pack 
              of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.

                                   NICK
              Mom!

       Phil moves over to Rose and puts his arm around her 
       shoulders

                                   PHIL
              Who knew that when I started working in the 
              finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also 
              find the light of my life.

                                   ROSE
              Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah 
              look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil 
              will you help Vada get settled?

                                   PHIL
              Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna 
              stay.

       Vada and Phil go upstairs, and enter a very nicely done up 
       room

                                   PHIL
              Here we go...not what you expected from 
              downstairs right? Now well put your stuff over 
              here in this closet...you can unpack later and 
              this is where you sleep. Luckily this sofa bed 
              is really comfortable, I can tell you that 
              from personal experience.

                     (pointing)
              Bathroom, do you have to?
                     (pointing)
              Rose and my room.

                                   VADA
              She lives here too?

                                   PHIL
              Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. 
              This is Nick's room and uhh....

                                   VADA
              But...are you engaged or something?

                                   PHIL
              Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, 
              want something to drink? Sure you do, it's 
              been a long trip.

       Phil goes and begins to get Vada a drink

              You see Vada, marriage, marriage is a very 
              big step...and...no... not something to be 
              entered into lightly, see I just uhh...I just 
              wanna make very sure that everything is 
              absolutely right before I go jumping into some 
              kind of a...

                                   VADA
              Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, 
              Uncle Phil.

                                   PHIL
              That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what 
              do you call it?

                                   VADA
              Committed?

                                   PHIL
              Committed.

                                   VADA
              So does that mean that you sleep here every 
              night?

                                   PHIL
              Yes, it does.

       Phil holds up two containers, one of orange juice and one 
       of milk, Vada

              indicates the milk

                                   VADA
              Well then that's not exactly dating is it.

                                   PHIL
              Vada, I know that traditionally you're not 
              supposed to do a lot of these things before 
              you're officially married...but these are 
              very, very special circumstances.

       Phil pours Vada a drink of milk, as she drinks it we 
       hear...

                                   VADA'S THOUGHTS
              When sex is involved, it's always special 
              circumstances.

       AT THE ZSIGMOND DINNING TABLE. ROSE, PHIL, VADA AND NICK 
       ARE SITTING, EATING

                                   VADA
              My parents had a brief, but intensely 
              fulfilling relationship. She's remained a 
              woman of mystery to this day.

                                   NICK
              And you're gonna solve the mystery?

                                   VADA
              I got it all figured out, I know she went to 
              Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, 
              I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her 
              yearbook. That way I can get the names of all 
              the people she was in clubs with and found out 
              who her friends were.

                                   PHIL
              Then you'll be all set.

                                   ROSE
              Sounds like you're very organized.

                                   VADA
              I had to be, I only have five days. So just 
              point me in the right direction and....

                                   PHIL
              I'll do better than that. I'll send you off 
              with your own private guide.

       Phil looks at Nick

                                   NICK
                     (mouth full)
              Muh??

                                   PHIL
              I'd consider it a personal favor.

       Nick flashes an evil look at Vada

       VADA IS IN A DRESSING GOWN, WALKING TOWARD THE KITCHEN 
       WHERE NICK AND PHIL ARE WASHING DISHES AND TALKING, VADA 
       STOPS BEHIND THE FRIDGE AND LISTENS

                                   PHIL
              It's not like you had a whole lot planned for 
              this week right? It'll be okay. Hey, here you 
              go. 
       Phil hands               10 to Nick

                                   NICK
              What's that?

                                   PHIL
              Ten bucks.

                                   NICK
              What's it for?

                                   PHIL
              For the mini-bike fund.

                                   NICK
              Wow!

                                   PHIL
              Well I know you're not crazy about taking 
              Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to 
              know I appreciate it though.

                                   NICK
              No problem.

                                   PHIL
              You're a good man Nicholas.

                                   NICK
              Phil, I think you should consider...
       fades as Vada walks off

       CLOSE UP OF VADA IN BED. SHE WAKES UP, AND GETS UP, 
       WANDERING OUT ONTO THE FRONT PORCH IN THE FRESH MORNING AIR 
       LOOKING AT LA

       EXTERNAL VIEW OF BUS GOING DOWN A HIGHWAY

       INSIDE BUS, VADA AND NICK ARE SITTING ON ONE OF THE SEATS

                                   VADA
              I thought my mom went to school in LA, we've 
              gotta be closing in on the Grand Canyon. But 
              I'm sure for a trip to the Grand Canyon you'd 
              charge a little more than...ten dollars.

       Nick ponders on this for a moment and then looks annoyed

                                   NICK
              You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive 
              habit.

                                   VADA
              I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.

                                   NICK
              I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it 
              to me.

                                   VADA
              Well look, I know that all you care about is 
              your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have 
              no sense of historical perspective, I think 
              we're here.

       she pulls the buzzer

                                   NICK
                     (to driver)
              Getting off please.

                                   VADA
              Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.

       Vada and Nick get off the bus and walk towards an empty 
       field, there is a plaque standing near them, so Vada goes to 
       look

                                   VADA
              Where's the school?

       looks at the plaque and reads from it

                                   VADA
              Due to a devastating fire June 17 1963, 
              Wilson High School was closed.

              I can't believe it! My mother's high school 
              burned down!

                                   NICK
              They obviously have no sense of historical 
              perspective either.

                                   VADA
              It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? 
              Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just 
              walk around town looking for someone with a 
              Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!

                                   NICK
              Vada.

                                   VADA
              WHAT??

                                   NICK
              Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, 
              where your books come from.

              I mean they don't appear out of thin air.

       INSIDE A PRINTING PRESS SOMEWHERE, VADA AND NICK ARE 
       WALKING BEHIND A WORKER

                                   MAN
              Watch these machines now.

                                   VADA
              This is really very nice of you.

                                   MAN
              It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.

       they all enter a large storage room

                                   MAN
              If it's in here at all, it's in the back two 
              rows.

                                   VADA
              O.K. Thank you very much.

                                   MAN
              Happy hunting.

       Vada and Nick begin to search through boxes and boxes of 
       books

                                   NICK
              I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a 
              nose bleed from the altitude.

                                   VADA
              Just remember the needle in the haystack.

                                   NICK
              I never did understand that story, did 
              someone find the needle or not?

                                   VADA
              What difference does it make?

                                   NICK
              A big difference, if someone found it we 
              should keep looking, if they didn't we're just 
              wasting our time.

                                   VADA
              Oh my gosh, here it is!

       Vada searches quickly through the book

                                   VADA
              Look, here she is.
              Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary 
              magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate 
              Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With 
              Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're 
              sure to be seeing her name in lights.
              She was gonna be famous.

                                   NICK
              Yearbooks always set you out for 
              disappointment, I want mine to say:
              Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't 
              be surprised if you never hear anything about 
              him again.
              Can we go?...It smells like someone left 
              their gym bag in here.

                                   VADA
              It's the leather bindings, I love the 
              fragrance of vintage books.

                                   NICK
              I love the fragrance of chilidogs.

       VADA AND NICK ARE AT AN OUTDOOR FAST FOOD RESTAURANT, 
       EATING

                                   VADA
              He was on the school paper with my 
              mom...great...a full page of Tanaka's, fifteen 
              with the initial 'D', this is gonna be tough.

                                   NICK
              Don't forget, the girls change their names if 
              they got married.

                                   VADA
              I'd never do that.

                                   NICK
              Get married?

                                   VADA
              Change my name.

                                   NICK
              What, you think the guy should change his 
              name?

       Vada gets up to go to the phone

                                   VADA
              I don't think anybody should change their 
              names, that way you can always find them when 
              you need them.

                                   NICK
              What if you don't wanna be found?

                                   VADA
              Why do you argue with everything I say?

       Nick grabs one of Vada's chips while she's not looking

       L.A.P.D., VADA AND NICK ARE GOING UP THE STAIRS, THEY 
       APPROACH A FEMALE COP AT THE DESK

                                   VADA
              Hi.

                                   COP
              Can I help you?

                                   VADA
              Umm, yeah does someone named Daryl Tanaka 
              work here?

                                   COP
              Sure.
                     (turns around and shouts)
              Hey TANAKA, you got company!

                                   DARYL
              It's too bad about your mom. At least she 
              went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go 
              out the hard way.

                                   VADA
              What do you remember about her.

                                   DARYL
              Well, we worked on the school paper together. 
              I remember when the Legion of Decency declared 
              Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim 
              Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.

              Ah, she wrote this article about censorship 
              in the first amendment, she was really 
              something. Graduation, some big deal 
              congressman saying Senator McCarthy was the 
              greatest American ever. Maggie gets up in 
              front of five hundred people...walks 
              out...couple of people followed her too.

              Took a lot of guts.

                                   VADA
              Wow, you walked out with my mother?

                                   DARYL
              You kidding? 
       he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick

              My parents would have shot me.

              I was the president of the young republicans. 
              Nee say second generation...hall monitor. I 
              didn't wanna start World War Three.

                                   NICK
              You saved a lot of lives, you should be very 
              proud.

                                   VADA
              Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest 
              achievement.

                                   DARYL
              She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended 
              for smoking.

                                   VADA
              Suspended from school, my mother??

                                   DARYL
              Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was 
              turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.

                                   NICK
              What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?

                                   DARYL
              I would do it again in a minute.

                                   VADA
              You ratted on my mother??

                                   NICK
              Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?

                                   DARYL
              Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. 
              But let me tell you something. Sooner or later 
              it's gonna be your turn to take out the 
              garbage.

                                   NICK
              What about giving the other guy a break.

                                   DARYL
              What about living in the real world pal?

                                   INTERCOM
                                   TANAKA got a minute?

                                   DARYL
              I'll be right there. 
       he gets up and begins to leave

                     (to Vada)
              Oh, ahh, I'd be a little more careful of who 
              I hang around with.  
       Nick picks up Daryl's packet of cigarettes and shows them 
       to Vada

                                   NICK
                     (to Vada)
              Care for a smoke?

       VADA AND NICK ARE WALKING ALONG THE STREET

                                   VADA
              This'll be great in my report, my mother was 
              suspended for smoking.

                                   NICK
              I think it's cool.

                                   VADA
              You would.

                                   NICK
              You'd rather have a mother that's a member of 
              the police state? Rules are made to be broken.
                     (pointing to Nixon on TV in a shop

                                   ROSE
              Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.

                                   MAN
              Then I have come to the right place.

                                   ROSE
              I guess you have.

                                   MAN
              I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.

                                   ROSE
              Rose.

       they shake hands

                                   ROSE
              So what's wrong?

                                   SAM
              Nothing, nothing at all.

                                   ROSE
              I mean...with your car.

                                   SAM
              Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove 
              in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.

                                   ROSE
              Excuse me?

                                   SAM
              I was commenting on your hair.

                                   ROSE
              Oh, are you a hairdresser?

                                   SAM
              I'm a pediatric cardiologist.

                                   ROSE
              Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little 
              babies?

                                   SAM
              Mostly...little babies, but...not 
              exclusively.

       Phil looks up from his work to see Sam holding Rose's 
       hands, he is mildly annoyed

                                   SAM
                     (laughing)
              ...It's all in the hands really. You know you 
              have nice hands, you operate?

                                   ROSE
                     (laughing)
              Yes, I do.

                                   SAM
              ...so I guess I'll always...teach...you 
              know...'cause it makes a good relief from the 
              operating-room, I feel I have an obligation...

       Rose and Sam continue conversing as Phil comes over to them

                                   PHIL
              Hi, Phil Sultenfuss

       Phil goes to shake Sam's hand and then realizes that they 
       are very dirty and

              withdraws his hand Oh sorry. Ahh, some kind 
              of problem here?

                                   ROSE
              No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just 
              needs to have his oil changed.

                                   PHIL
              Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require 
              such a lengthy consultation.

                                   SAM
              Well Rose was being very thorough.

                                   PHIL
              Was Rose.

                                   ROSE
              Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in 
              tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when 
              we open, we'll get you started.

                                   SAM
              I'll be here.

                                   PHIL
              I look forward to it. 
       Phil slaps the windscreen of Sam's car, leaving a huge 
       greasy handprint 

              Oh, I'm sorry, I'll get that for you in the 
              morning.

       he gets out a rag and wipes the mark, smearing it 
              Ooooh, made it worse, Get that for you in the 
              morning. Nice wheels.

                                   SAM
              Thanks.

       Sam reverses out and drives off

                                   PHIL
              What's with the touching, why was he touching 
              you?

                                   ROSE
              He wasn't touching me he was 
              just...gesturing...

                                   PHIL
              He was caressing.

                                   ROSE
              Phil for God sake.

                                   PHIL
              God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke 
              God Rose, because he saw even more than I did.  
              ROSE
              Look Phil, if you want the rights of a 
              husband, you're gonna have to ask me something 
              but if not, you're gonna have to get 
              accustomed to the rights of what you are.

                                   PHIL
              Oh...what's that?

                                   ROSE
              Right now? An intimate border 
              with...mechanical skills.

       Phil notices Nick and Vada entering the garage

                                   PHIL
              Hi!

                                   ROSE
              Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?

                                   NICK
              Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.

                                   VADA
              May I use the phone please.

                                   ROSE
              Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.

                                   PHIL
              Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A 
              gentleman, would choose British racing green, 
              with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a 
              red car, with a black interior and wire 
              wheels, you have one thing on your mind and 
              one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman 
              to say what that one thing is...in front of 
              the children.

       Vada and Nick exchange looks

              Even if I am just a glorified boarder.

       Phil changes the radio station from the classical one that 
       Rose has it on,

              to a modern one, with some heavy 70's music 
              on it

       Vada is talking on the phone trying to find the number for 
       another one

              of her mother's friends

                                   VADA
              Hi, I would like the number of Stanley 
              Rosenfeld photos, please?

       IN A BALL ROOM, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE DANCING TO A SONG 
       BEING PLAYED BY A LIVE BAND, VADA AND NICK ARE WALKING WITH 
       STANLEY ROSENFELD

                                   STANLEY
              You know photography is an art form if you 
              take it seriously enough, which I happen to 
              do. 
       Stanley sees a couple dancing

              Ester, Ester you gorgeous thing you, smile 
              for the birdie. Hold, hold.

                                   ESTER
              Stomach in Harold.

       click

                                   STANLEY
              BEEAAAUUUUUUTIFULLL.

                                   ESTER
              Thank you.

                                   STANLEY
              Thank YOU.

       Vada and Nick exchange weird looks

              Your mother was something-special Vada, to 
              tell you the truth, I had quite a crush on 
              her.

                                   VADA
              Really?

                                   STANLEY
              Who didn't? She could play basketball like 
              Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then 
              she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, 
              forget about it. I asked her out a couple of 
              times but she always said no.

              Lenny, Nancy, you just got married, look 
              happy, look happy, look like you mean it.

       click 
              BEEAAAUUUUUUTIFULLL.

              I remember those days, then we all went off 
              to UCLA and she started hanging round with 
              those drama department types. There was this 
              one guy, Peter Webb he's become a big director 
              in Hollywood now...and the only reason I know 
              him at all is that we were all together in 
              this big poetry class with this crazy guy 
              Albert Boderfelder...

                                   VADA
              Beidermeyer?

                                   STANLEY
              Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.

                                   VADA
              He's a great poet.

                                   STANLEY
              He is?

                                   VADA
              Do you know him?

                                   STANLEY
              Everybody did, walk along Citrus between 
              Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.

                                   VADA
              He'll remember my mother for sure.  STANLEY
              It was a big class Vada and...but...well of 
              course he'll remember, who could forget 
              Maggie?

                                   VADA
              Just one more thing. Does this mean anything 
              to you?

       Vada gets out the brown paper bag and shows it to Stanley

                                   STANLEY
              No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.

                                   VADA
              Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and 
              I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, 
              I'm sure she would have had a really great 
              time.

                                   STANLEY
              I would have tried to show her a good time. I 
              promised her when she left that I would never 
              forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld 
              does not forget.

       VADA AND NICK ARE WALKING DOWN A PAVEMENT, TALKING

                                   VADA
              This is the street he walks down every day. 
              When he needs inspiration...

                                   NICK
              Boy, you're really into this.

                                   VADA
              He is one of the great poets.

       they look across the road and see an old man sitting in a 
       chair, writing

                                   VADA
              I think it's him.

       they cross the road

                                   VADA
              He's writing. Hello?

                                   MAN
              If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm 
              borderline diabetic.

                                   VADA
              You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?

                                   ALFRED
              You had to remind me?

                                   VADA
              Are you writing a poem?

                                   ALFRED
              No, I'm writing to the phone company because 
              they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, 
              Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in 
              Caracas, Venezuela?

                                   VADA &amp; NICK
              No.

                                   ALFRED
              Neither do I.

       a buzzer sounds

              Ask not for whom the bell tolls...time for my 
              medication and my nap.

       as he gets up, he knocks everything off his table

                                   NICK
              Here, we'll help you carry your stuff.

                                   ALFRED
              I can handle it, I can handle that. Oh well, 
              thank you, I'm in the penthouse. 
       Vada and Nick begin to climb the stairs 
              Penthouse A, it's there over on the left.

       Alfred begins to climb the stairs after Vada and Nick, very 
       slowly

                                   NICK
              If he has a heart attack you're carrying the 
              body down yourself.

                                   VADA
              At least it gives you plenty of exercise.

                                   ALFRED
              It keeps me young.

       They all enter Alfred's apartment

                                   VADA
                     (referring to the table that she is 
                     carrying)
              Umm, where do you want this?

                                   ALFRED
              Oh, just put it over there.

       Vada is looking through Alfred's bookshelf

                                   VADA
              Do you still teach?

                                   ALFRED
              No, no, no, I gave it up ten years 
              ago...actually it gave me up.

       Vada finds a book of interest

                                   VADA
              My mother took this course with you at 
              UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.

              Her name was Maggie Muldovan.

                                   ALFRED
                     (completely absentmindedly)
              Ohhhhh.

                                   NICK
              Remember her?

                                   ALFRED
              I've been blessed with a very bad memory.

                                   VADA
              People said she looked like me.

                                   ALFRED
              I was drinking a little in those days.
                     (gets up)
              I'm drinking a little these days too.

                                   VADA
              I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.

                                   ALFRED
              Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously 
              boring.

                                   VADA
              No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna 
              be just like you.

                                   ALFRED
              Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country 
              that rewards poetry, this is a country that 
              rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't 
              read poetry anymore, they watch television. 
              Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.

       OUTSIDE, NICK AND VADA ARE GOING DOWN STEPS OUTSIDE ALFRED 
       BEIDERMEYER'S FLAT

                                   NICK
              Vada, come on...I got a place I always go 
              when I need cheering up.

       TAR PITS, VADA AND NICK ARE ON THE VIEWING PLATFORM LOOKING 
       OVER THE EDGE

                                   VADA
              The tar pits? This is where you come to get 
              cheered up?

                                   NICK
              Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it 
              isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a 
              bottomless pit of tar.

                                   VADA
              And I thought I was weird.

                                   NICK
              You are weird. Let's just go.

                                   VADA
              Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.

       Vada and Nick sit down on a concrete bench

                                   NICK
              Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the 
              sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a 
              mood ring.

                                   VADA
              This isn't just a mood ring.

                                   NICK
              Does it work?

                                   VADA
              Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but 
              it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of 
              mine.

                                   NICK
              Boyfriend?

                                   VADA
              Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was 
              my best friend. When we were kids we were 
              gonna...move out here and move to the Brady 
              Bunch.

              Then umm, I lost this ring in the woods...and 
              when he went to find it...he got stung by bees 
              and he died.

                                   NICK
              Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, 
              looking down on you and watching you all the 
              time?

                                   VADA
                     (smiles)
              Well, I hope he's not watching me all the 
              time.

                                   NICK
              Let me see if it changes colors on me.

                                   VADA
              ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of 
              sentimental value.

       Vada takes the ring off and hands it carefully to Nick, 
       they stand up

                                   NICK
              Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.

                                   VADA
              Don't force it, you'll break it.

                                   NICK
              I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it 
              change colors.

                                   VADA
              I want it back now. I never should have taken 
              it off, I want it back.

       Nick begins to tease Vada with her mood ring, she begins to 
       get quite distressed

                                   NICK
              Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.

                                   VADA
              Give it to me!

                                   NICK
              Come and get it.

                                   VADA
              Just give it to me!!

                                   NICK
              Just come and get it...right here!

                                   VADA
              DON'T, come on!!!

       Nick has his back against the side of the platform with his 
       arm outstretched,

              threatening to drop it

                                   NICK
              Woah, watch it!

                                   VADA
              DON'T!!!

                                   NICK
                     (expression suddenly changes)
              Uh oh...

                                   VADA
              What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???

                                   NICK
              ...I dropped it.

                                   VADA
              In the tar??

                                   NICK
              It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.

       Vada runs off down the steps

                                   NICK
              Where are you going???

                                   VADA
              Owh...

       Nick is sprinting after Vada, who is running fast toward 
       the fence

                                   NICK
              Vada wait up!!!!! WAIT!!!!!

       Vada tries to scale the fence to get into the enclosed area 
       to retrieve her

              ring, Nick pulls her off

                                   NICK
              What are you doing? You can't go in there!

                                   VADA
              Oh no?!?!?!

       Vada climbs again, Nick pulls her off again

                                   NICK
              It's dangerous!!

                                   VADA
                     (pushing Nick)
              Leave me alone!!

              That ring is the only thing I have left of 
              Thomas J, I have to get it!!

                                   NICK
              You mean,
                     (opens other hand)
              this ring?

                                   VADA
              Jerk! You IDIOT!!!

       Vada begins to hit Nick quite fiercely

                                   NICK
              You hit pretty good, for a girl!!

       they run off

       NIGHT TIME INSIDE THE ZSIGMOND HOUSE, NICK OPENS HIS 
       BEDROOM DOOR AND EMERGES DRESSED IN HIS PAJAMAS

       Nick walks over past where Vada is sleeping on the couch-
       bed and stops, turns back and moves over to take a look at 
       the sleeping beauty, all of a sudden the light in Rose &amp; 
       Phil's room goes on

                                   ROSE
                     (whispering, from bedroom)
              Nicholas! What are you doing up?

                                   NICK
              I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.

                                   ROSE
              There's water in your bathroom.

                                   NICK
                     (opening fridge)
              I want juice!

                                   ROSE
              Don't wake up Vada.

                                   NICK
              I won't.

       Vada smiles and opens her eyes

       SOME WESTERN MOVIE SET IN HOLLYWOOD, VADA AND NICK ARE 
       WALKING ALONG TALKING TO PETER WEBB

                                   PETER
              I think ahh...Maggie could have been a major 
              glitter. She'd talent, God knows that face was 
              made for close-ups but everything was...magic 
              with Maggie. I remember, we were walking down 
              Hollywood Boulevard, we put our feet in the

              stars' footprints, you know like tourists do, 
              Maggie could not believe it, her feet were the 
              same size as Judy Garland. Of course mine 
              matched perfectly with Orson Wells. Hahaha, 
              just kidding.

              You should call Hillary Mitchell...Maggie 
              were very close. She's got this funky little 
              clothing store over here on Melrose, I'd call 
              her for you but well we ahh, kinda had this 
              thing you know...got a little messy.

       Peter writes on a piece of paper and then hands it to Vada

                                   VADA
              Thanks. Umm...would you know what this is?

       Vada hands her mother's brown paper bag over to Peter

                                   PETER
              Well not really. Ahh, could be the date of an 
              opening, an audition...eh...umm...birthday? 
              Not my birthday. I dunno, who...eh...writes 
              dates on paper bags?

       Peter gives the bag back to Vada

                                   VADA
              My mom.

                                   PETER
                     (looks at watch)
              Woooh, I have got to get to Dailies, gotta 
              break this up.

                                   VADA
              Well thanks for your time, I know you're very 
              busy.

                                   PETER
              You are Maggie all over...you let me know if 
              you ever wanna be a movie star...you got the 
              face for close-ups too.

                                   VADA
              Thanks.

       Peter gives Vada a kiss on the forehead, then walks off

                                   NICK
              What a dufus.

       LIVING ROOM OF ZSIGMOND HOUSE, PHIL AND ROSE ARE READY TO 
       GO OUT, VADA AND NICK ARE SITTING READING MAGAZINES

                                   PHIL
              We may go out for coffee after the meeting so 
              don't expect us before midnight.

                                   ROSE
              There's plenty of fruit.

                                   PHIL
              You know where the fire extinguisher is.

                                   NICK
              If the fruit burst into flames I'll be 
              prepared.

                                   ROSE
                     (to Nick, whom she gives a kiss on 
                     the forehead)
              You're so clever.

                     (to Vada)
              Are you all right honey?

                                   VADA
              I'm just tired.

                                   ROSE
              All right, well get to bed early and don't 
              let anybody in. Bye.

                                   PHIL
              Lock the door.

                                   VADA
              Bye.

       Vada looks up expectantly at Nick, who gets up and goes to 
       the door to check

              that Rose and Phil have left

                                   NICK
              We have lift off.

       the song &quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot; begins to play

       ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, NICK AND VADA ARE LOOKING AT ALL 
       THE STARS ON THE PAVEMENT

                                   VADA
              Joan Crawford, oh I love her...there's the 
              Marx Brothers. Carol Lombard, my dad's 
              favorite!

                                   NICK
              Never heard of her.

                                   VADA
              Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.

                                   NICK
              Here's Judy Garland!

       Vada runs over

                                   VADA
              My mother stood on this very spot.

                                   NICK
              I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.

                                   VADA
              That's 'cause I was cursed with the 
              Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.

                                   NICK
              Big deal.

       A hippie walks past smoking a joint, and blows a puff of it 
       on Vada, who

              smells it and coughs

                                   VADA
              What's he smoking?

                                   NICK
              What do you think?

                                   VADA
              Really?

       Vada starts off after him, but Nick grabs her arm and pulls 
       her away, they

              walk off and then Vada sees a sign saying 
              Ears Pierced,               5.00

                                   VADA
              Hey look!

                                   NICK
              This is a totally barbaric custom.

       They enter the store

       VADA AND NICK STROLLING QUIETLY DOWN A PAVEMENT IN FRONT OF 
       A LARGE WALL MURAL OF MOVIE STARS

                                   NICK
              So if Phil marries my mom, she'd be your Aunt 
              right?

                                   VADA
              Right.

                                   NICK
              And you'd be my cousin?

                                   VADA
              Yeah I guess...sort of.

                                   NICK
              But we wouldn't really be related right?

                                   VADA
              Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same 
              bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total 
              strangers who...accidentally had relatives 
              that got married.

                                   NICK
              Good. I mean...

                                   VADA
              Marriage can really complicate things. So, 
              aren't you gonna say anything about my 
              earrings?

                                   NICK
              I already did, it's a totally barbaric 
              custom...but on you, it looks good.

       Vada smiles

       BUS PULLS UP TO STOP NEAR BUDAPEST AUTO REPAIRS, NICK AND 
       VADA RUN OFF OF IT AND SPRINT OFF TOWARDS THE DOOR TO NICK'S 
       HOUSE

                                   VADA
              We should've called.

                                   NICK
              It's not that late!

       they enter the living room, Rose and Phil are sitting 
       waiting

                                   ROSE
              You're grounded 'till you're fifty!

                                   NICK
              You're over reacting!

                                   ROSE
              Make that sixty and I'm docking your 
              allowance for two weeks.

                                   NICK
              MOM!

                                   ROSE
              You think this is easy for me? You go out on 
              the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I 
              don't want you to be some punk hoodlum 
              delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent 
              if you don't do your job as a kid.

                                   VADA
              It's not his fault!

                                   NICK
              No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, 
              ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do 
              anything.

                                   ROSE
              Go to your room.
                     (to Vada)
              And you...I don't suppose your father gave 
              you permission to pierce your ears, did he?

                                   VADA
              Not exactly.

                                   ROSE
              Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never 
              let you visit us again if I send you home 
              hairless and full of holes.

       Phil moves his hand up to cover his smile as he tries 
       desperately not to laugh

       GARAGE DAY, DR HELBURN DRIVES IN

                                   SAM
              Good morning.

                                   ROSE
              Well maybe for you.

                                   SAM
              Something wrong?

                                   ROSE
              Well let's just say you're lucky you deal 
              with children who are under anesthesia.

                                   SAM
              Well, even without anesthesia I always tell 
              my patients to...eh... to relax.

              Look...eh...isn't it time for your coffee 
              break or something? There must be some place 
              we can go...talk?

                                   ROSE
              Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.

                                   SAM
              You couldn't?

                                   ROSE
              Well I'm sort of involved.

                                   SAM
              Sort of?

                                   ROSE
              Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.

                                   SAM
              Where I come from, involvement...generally 
              calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.

                                   ROSE
              Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.

                                   SAM
              All right, so you don't like jewelry 
              but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. 
              Liszt, one of my favorites.

                                   ROSE
              Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were 
              Hungarian.

                                   SAM
              Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful 
              music...and beautiful women.

       Phil approaches, looking annoyed

                                   PHIL
              Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last 
              couple of days we've changed your oil, 
              realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated 
              your tires, aligned your front end, and 
              flushed out your entire cooling system, I 
              really didn't expect to be seeing you for 
              another three thousand miles.

                                   SAM
              Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel 
              so welcome here.

                                   ROSE
              And you are.

       Phil glances at Rose

                                   SAM
              Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the 
              morning and you can check out that left 
              blinker for me.

                                   ROSE
              Oh, sure okay.

                                   SAM
              I'll see you then...I look forward to it.

       Sam gets into his car and drives off

                                   PHIL
              You really oughtta flush out that line of 
              bullshit he's got:

              Hungarian's are famous for their beautiful 
              women.

                                   ROSE
              What's wrong with a little flattery? What's 
              wrong with a little appreciation?

       Rose starts to move toward the office

                                   PHIL
              Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?

                                   ROSE
              I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a 
              real date, when was the last time you did 
              that?

                                   PHIL
              Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every 
              night.

                                   ROSE
              No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't 
              cook.

       Rose shuts the door

                                   PHIL
              I do the dishes.

       VADA AND NICK ARE WALKING DOWN A STREET, THEY STOP AND 
       ENTER A SHOP

                                   VADA'S THOUGHTS
              I'd go to a fortuneteller but they can only 
              predict the future...I need someone who can 
              predict the past.

       INSIDE SHOP

                                   LADY
              Hi, can I help you?

                                   VADA
              Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to 
              school with Maggie Muldovan?

                                   HILLARY
              Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?

                                   NICK
              She's her daughter, Vada.

                                   HILLARY
              Ooh...of course!
                     (hugs Vada)
              Oh, look at you! Oh it's the eyes mostly and 
              the hair too and now she's gone...she's 
              gone...she'll never get to see how well you've 
              turned out. Oh... oh my God...Maggie! You poor 
              thing!

       Hillary begins to sob and hug Vada

                                   VADA
              It's okay really, I was just a baby.

                                   HILLARY
              I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all 
              these seminars to get in touch with my 
              feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.

       Nick reaches over and gets a tissue, then hands it to 
       Hillary

                                   NICK
              Here.

                                   HILLARY
              Oh, thank you, you're very sweet. So how did 
              you find out where I was?

                                   NICK
              Peter Webb told us.

                                   HILLARY
              Peter? You saw Peter? Oh God...
                     (begins to cry, and then hugs Nick)

              Oh forgive me, I'm making such a scene here. 
              Why don't you have a seat.

                                   VADA
              Thanks.

                                   HILLARY
              I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you 
              know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford 
              pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.

              It was pitch black, with a red leather 
              interior. Does he still drive that?

                                   VADA
              No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.

                                   NICK
              He's an undertaker.

                                   HILLARY
              You're kidding, Jeffrey Pommeroy's an 
              undertaker?

       Vada and Nick are confused

                                   VADA
              His name's Harry Sultenfuss.

                                   HILLARY
              Oh.
                     (then it dawns on her)
              Ohhh?

                                   VADA
              What're you saying?

                                   HILLARY
              Ummmmm, look, I...I...

                                   VADA
              Are you saying my mother had another husband?

                                   HILLARY
              Oh honey, back then...people did crazy 
              things.

                                   VADA
              They sure did! They got kicked out of school, 
              they married truck drivers...these are my 
              mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure 
              glad I came all the way out here to find them 
              out.

       Vada runs out of store, Nick looks at Hillary and then 
       follows

       OUTSIDE ON SIDEWALK

       Vada is running down the sidewalk

                                   NICK
              Vada, wait up!

       Vada slows down and Nick catches up

              Just because you mother was married before, 
              it...it doesn't mean anything.

                                   VADA
                     (very near tears)
              Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told 
              me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying 
              to hide something.

                                   NICK
              Like what?

                                   VADA
              Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real 
              father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair 
              of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in 
              my family has this nose, it could be the nose 
              of...a...of a complete stranger,

       Vada's voice is getting a little hysterical and she is 
       starting to cry

              I mean...I came out here to...to find out 
              about my mother and I...and I found...

       Vada turns around, covers her face and cries

                                   NICK
              Don't cry...come on...that lady in there 
              looked pretty flaky to me.

              How 'bout Phil, maybe he knows something 
              about all this. At least you should talk to 
              him before you get worked up.

                                   VADA
              Before I get worked up? You don't think this 
              is worked up?

       Nick takes Vada by the shoulders and gently turns her 
       around, he then wipes

              a tear from her cheek

                                   NICK
              That thing you said about your nose...it was 
              a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I 
              mean...it's yours...you know?

                                   VADA
              Nick?

                                   NICK
              Yeah?

                                   VADA
              This has been a real confusing day.

       Nick nods

       ZSIGMOND DINING ROOM TABLE, VADA, PHIL, NICK AND ROSE ARE 
       SITTING EATING

                                   VADA
              How could Dad let me visit here and find out 
              like this?

       Phil shrugs

                                   VADA
              I'm gonna call him...and make him tell me 
              everything.

       Phil knows something that Vada doesn't, and he doesn't want 
       Vada to phone

              Harry at the moment

                                   PHIL
              Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...

                                   VADA
              Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.

       Vada picks up the phone and dials a number

                                   HARRY
              Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.

                                   VADA
              Hi Dad.

                                   HARRY
              Hi honey.

                                   VADA
              I just called to say that I'm having a really 
              great time.

                                   HARRY
              Good! You should go over and watch some Ted 
              Carson.

                                   VADA
              Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.

       HARRY AND SHELLY'S ROOM BACK IN PENNSYLVANIA, SHELLY IS 
       LYING IN BED LOOKING SICK, HARRY IS SITTING BESIDE HER ON 
       THE PHONE TO VADA

                                   HARRY
              Is he...eh...some kind of a new rock star or 
              something?

       VADA

                                   VADA
              Yeah.

                                   HARRY
              Totally groovy huh?

                                   VADA
              Totally.

       HARRY

                                   HARRY
              Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.

       VADA

                                   VADA
              I will. How's Shelly?

       HARRY

                                   HARRY
              Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor 
              just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a 
              little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just 
              to make sure that...

       VADA

                                   VADA
              Okay...bye daddy, I love you.

       HARRY

                                   HARRY
              I love you too sweetie, bye.

                                   VADA
              Give my love to Shelly.

       Harry hangs up and then looks at Shelly who has just opened 
       her eyes, and is weakly smiling a little

       VADA

                                   VADA
              Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom 
              of this whole thing and get back there.

                                   ROSE
              She'll be all right baby.

                                   VADA
              Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.

       L.A.P.D. AGAIN, VADA AND NICK ARE TALKING TO DARYL TANAKA

                                   DARYL
              I'm not authorized to trace licenses for 
              civilians.

                                   VADA
              His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to 
              drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red 
              interior. Please?

                                   NICK
              Give us a break. All you have to do is make a 
              phone call.

                                   DARYL
                     (to Vada)
              I thought I told you to lose this guy.

                                   NICK
              Look, sergeant I know I said some things last 
              time that I shouldn't have said at all but...

                                   DARYL
              I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.

                                   NICK
              I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy 
              because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell 
              her stuff that no one else knows.

                                   DARYL
              You're still asking me to break the law.

                                   VADA
              No, we're asking you to stand up with Maggie 
              Muldovan like you should have years ago.

       Daryl thinks for a moment then picks up the phone and dials 
       a number

                                   DARYL
              Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, 
              I need a current address for a Jeffrey....

                                   VADA
              Pommeroy.

                                   DARYL
              Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a 
              black 54 Ford Pickup.
                     (covers phone)
              Monday.

                                   VADA
                     (disappointed)
              I'm leaving Sunday.

                                   DARYL
                     (into phone)
              Could you hold on for a second?
                     (quietly, to Vada and Nick)

              Look, I can't get priority without a criminal 
              charge.

                                   NICK
              So charge him with something...who's gonna 
              know?

                                   DARYL
              Me, I'll know!

                                   VADA
              Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?

                                   DARYL
                     (into phone)
              Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this 
              guy...well we think he might be going after 
              the governor.
                     (pause)
              Twenty minutes? Fine.

       BUDAPEST GARAGE, VADA AND PHIL ARE LOOKING AT THE ENGINE OF 
       A CAR

                                   PHIL
              So give him a call, the worst he can do is 
              hang up on you, right?

                                   VADA
              I feel like before I can talk to him I have 
              to see his face.

                                   PHIL
              How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive 
              over to his place, you can introduce 
              yourself....

                                   VADA
              I'd like to see his house but...I don't know 
              if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock 
              on his door. I don't think I can go through 
              with it.

                                   PHIL
              Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.

       VADA AND PHIL DRIVING DOWN HIGHWAY, THEY TURN OFF INTO A 
       SIDE ROAD

                                   PHIL
              You're awfully quiet.

                                   VADA
              Do you think I should tell my dad about 
              Jeffrey Pommeroy?

                                   PHIL
              I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his 
              mind right now.

              Maybe some day when the time is right.

                                   VADA
              Maybe.

                                   PHIL
              Then again, your dad's got his own memories 
              and he's got his own life now...I think this 
              is a secret just between you and your mom.

                                   VADA
              A secret, I like that.

       PHIL'S TRUCK PULLS UP TO A HOUSE

                                   PHIL
              This is it I guess.

                                   VADA
              Well, I've come this far...the least I can do 
              is knock on the door.

                                   PHIL
              You want me to come with?

                                   VADA
                     (shakes her head)
              I should do this myself.

                                   PHIL
              Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a 
              walk around.

                                   VADA
              Okay.

       Vada gets out and makes her way up to the front door, 
       petting the dog sitting

              on the doorstep, she turns to look back at 
              Phil

                                   PHIL
                     (in car, gesturing that she should 
                     press the bell)
              Go ahead honey...go ahead.

       Vada presses door bell, waits then presses it again, then a 
       man opens the door

                                   MAN
              Hi there...can I help you?

                                   VADA
              Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?

                                   JEFFREY
              Sure am, who are you?

                                   VADA
              I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother 
              was...

                                   JEFFREY
              Maggie...Maggie's little girl.

       Vada nods

                                   JEFFREY
              I was hoping I'd get to meet you.

                                   VADA
              You mean, you knew about me?

                                   VOICE FROM INSIDE
              Who is it honey?

       A woman appears next to Jeffrey

                                   JEFFREY
              It's aah...Maggie's little girl, Vada.

              WOMAN
              Ohh, Oh my.

                                   JEFFREY
              This is my wife Emily.

                                   EMILY
              Hi.

                                   VADA
              Hi.

                                   JEFFREY
              Umm...can you come in for a minute?

                                   VADA
              I'd like to, thanks.

       they enter the house. Vada walks next to Jeffrey who leads 
       them into the living room, a little girl suddenly comes 
       running in

                                   LITTLE GIRL
              Mommy, Daddy, I painted you a rainbow, come 
              and see.

                                   EMILY
                     (to Katie)
              This is Vada,
                     (to Vada)
              Vada this is our little girl Katie.

                                   VADA
              Hi.

                                   KATIE
                     (shy)
              Hi.

                                   EMILY
              Umm...why don't we let Daddy and Vada visit 
              for a little while?

                                   KATIE
              Okay.

                                   JEFFREY
              Okay.

                                   KATIE
              Bye.

                                   VADA
              Bye.
                     (Emily and Katie leave)
              She looks a little like me when I was a 
              little girl.

                                   JEFFREY
              Does she?

       Vada nods

                                   JEFFREY
              I'm glad you're here.

                                   VADA
              You are?

                                   JEFFREY
              Yeah, come on, let's talk.

       they move into the kitchen

       IN KITCHEN, JEFFREY IS IN FRIDGE GETTING A DRINK

                                   VADA
              We have this school assignment to write about 
              someone we never met and I chose my mother. 
              She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle 
              Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and 
              then I looked at her high school yearbook 
              and...  and I called a few people and one guy 
              said that she went to UCLA, another guy said 
              that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....

                                   JEFFREY
              Hillary Mitchell? How's she?

                                   VADA
              Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. 
              Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford 
              truck and this policeman I know got in touch 
              with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your 
              address and here I am.

                                   JEFFREY
                     (laughs)

                                   VADA
              I told you it was a long story.

                                   JEFFREY
              That's all right, you know what? You sound 
              just sounded just like your mother...she told 
              great stories. Stories with crazy accents 
              and...special effects.

                                   VADA
              Special effects?

                                   JEFFREY
              Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when 
              she was talking about lightning...audiences 
              love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to 
              work an audience.

                                   VADA
              I don't know very much about her...I was 
              hoping that you could help me.

                                   JEFFREY
              I'll try.

       Vada gets out her brown paper bag and hands it to JEFFREY

                                   VADA
              No one else knows what this means.

       JEFFREY looks at it for a moment as memories come flooding 
       back

                                   JEFFREY
              You see...the thing is, we always wanted to 
              work in a theater, so we drove out to New 
              York, to Broadway where it was...where it was 
              all happening...and...New York was just full 
              of fancy French restaurants and we wanted to 
              get married in one but we were totally broke, 
              so your mom found this little coffee 
              shop...little tables round the back...and real 
              tablecloths on 'em, and a minister who worked 
              cheap...but when we got down to the coffee 
              shop there was a sign on the door that said 
              Closed by the Board of Health. By that time 
              it had started snowing, so...we just got 
              married...right outside in the snow.

              It was freezing but it was wonderful. And for 
              our wedding feast, we had a bag of hot roasted 
              chestnuts. This is the bag.

                                   VADA
              And she saved it.

                                   JEFFREY
                     (nods)
              Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just 
              wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will 
              be out wedding album, this will be a day we 
              will never forget.&quot; We never did.

                                   VADA
              Do you have any pictures if her?

                                   JEFFREY
              I've got something better.

       ROOM WITH PROJECTOR SITTING BEHIND COUCH, VADA IS SEATED ON 
       THE COUCH AND JEFFREY IS SITTING BEHIND HER OPERATING IT

       Vada and JEFFREY are watching the movie

                                   JEFFREY
              We called ourselves &quot;The Appearing Nightly 
              Players&quot;.

                                   MAGGIE
                     (on screen, in French accent)
              Darling, oh where is my chauffeur? You don't 
              want I should walk to the stage? An actress of 
              my overwhelming talent?

                                   VADA
              She's beautiful.

                                   JEFFREY
              We performed on the beach one 
              summer...ha...everything went wrong.

       we can see the acting troupe stuffing round on the beach, 
       then Maggie in a doughnut-floatie in the sea with an 
       umbrella, then playing volleyball, then sitting at a table 
       surrounded by friends, she is convinced to sing by her 
       friends, which she begins to do

                                   MAGGIE

              Smile though your heart is aching,

              Smile, even though it's breaking,

              When there are clouds,

              In the sky you'll get by,

              If you smile through your fears and sorrows,

              Smile and maybe tomorrow,

              You'll see the sun come shining through if 
              you,

              Light up your face with gladness,

              Hide every trace of sadness,

              Although a tear may be ever so near,

              That's the time you must keep on trying,

              Smile, what's the use of crying,

              You'll find that life is still worthwhile,

              If you just smile.

       the group that Maggie sang for start to complement her and 
       chatter away, then the reel ends, JEFFREY turns off the 
       projector, gets up and turns on the light

                                   JEFFREY
              She had a...a beautiful voice.

       Vada nods, crying a little

                                   JEFFREY
              Would you like...eh...to have these movies?

                                   VADA
                     (turns around)
              More than anything in the world.

                                   JEFFREY
                     (nods)
              It's good to see Maggie again...and you.

                                   VADA
              Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?

                                   JEFFREY
              Well I didn't know about you until after she 
              was gone.

                                   VADA
              I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious 
              about how I turned out.

                                   JEFFREY
              I'd say you turned out just fine.

                                   VADA
              I guess what I mean is, my mother married my 
              dad after you...and then I was born, so I 
              thought that...maybe you got divorced because 
              of me.

                                   JEFFREY
              Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you 
              think I'm your father?

                                   VADA
              Well...

                                   JEFFREY
              Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. 
              It just isn't so.

       they walk outside

                                   JEFFREY
              Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I 
              didn't.

                                   VADA
              oh.

                                   JEFFREY
              She didn't wanna miss out on 
              anything...especially motherhood...it got to 
              be a real problem with us.

              I thought she had plenty of time, she didn't. 
              Anyway...that's why I was grateful when she 
              met your father, he had the sense to love her 
              the way she deserved...and most of all...I was 
              glad that she had you, the baby she always 
              wanted.

              I wanted you to know that.

       this has made Vada's day, she looks very happy, they hug 
       each other

       BUDAPEST GARAGE, VADA IS TALKING TO NICK, ROSE AND PHIL

                                   VADA
              And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my 
              report. Jeffrey says audiences love special 
              effects.

                                   NICK
              You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole 
              vacation.

                                   ROSE
              Well it's a wonderful story with a very happy 
              ending.

       Sam enters the garage in his car

                                   PHIL
              Sorry doc, we close for business at 3 o'clock 
              today.

       Sam gets out and walks over to Rose, and offers Rose a box

                                   SAM
              Ahh...this isn't business. You know I...I 
              found this wonderful little Hungarian 
              restaurant that makes it's own strudel and 
              I...I thought you might like a taste of the 
              old country. You see there's apple in there 
              and...and cherry and this is the...eh... 
              cheese but I...I gotta say I think that cherry 
              is...is really....

       Phil grabs the strudel and puts it back in Sam's car

                                   PHIL
              Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel 
              does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I 
              am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar 
              full of strudel come waltzing in here and....

                                   SAM
              I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.

                                   PHIL
              Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an 
              arrangement.

                                   SAM
              Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?

                                   ROSE
              Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very 
              interested to know what kind of an arrangement 
              we have.

                                   PHIL
              You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on 
              Rose...what do you want from me?

                                   ROSE
              I don't want anything you don't wanna give 
              me.

                                   SAM
              And you certainly shouldn't settle for 
              anything less that you deserve.

                                   PHIL
              You stay out of this, look, if I had a red 
              XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell 
              wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.

                                   SAM
              I don't think the color of the interior 
              is....

                                   PHIL
              Rose this not the place to be having this...

                                   ROSE
              I think this place is just fine.

                                   PHIL
              You know how I feel about you.

                                   ROSE
              You like the way I cook...you think I make 
              out a great invoice.  PHIL
              You and Nick and...and this...this garage are 
              my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't 
              have the greatest taste in music...but there's 
              not another woman who could look so sexy in 
              that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to 
              sa...

       Vada takes Phil's hand and mouths the word &quot;commitment&quot; to 
       him, giving him strength

              What I mean to say...Rose will you marry me?

                                   ROSE
              You really think I look sexy in this smock?

                                   PHIL
              Is that a yes?

       Phil and Rose hug each other and kiss, Sam looks defeated, 
       Vada and Nick smile at each other

       AT AIRPORT, VADA IS ABOUT TO BOARD HER PLANE, ROSE AND PHIL 
       ARE STANDING NEXT TO HER

                                   VADA
              Thanks for everything, you're the best.

                                   PHIL
              No, you're the best and I don't want you 
              talking to anybody on the plane.

                                   VADA
              Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna 
              meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some 
              pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with 
              Shelly.

                                   PHIL
              Sounds great, well you give 'em both one of 
              these for me.

       Phil gives Vada hug and a kiss

                                   VADA
              Bye Aunt Rose.

                                   ROSE
              Bye Niece, Vada.

       Rose and Vada hug

                                   VADA
              Thanks. Well, bye.

       Vada walks down the corridor a little and stops by Nick who 
       is waiting for her

                                   VADA
              ...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to 
              sacrifice your entire vacation.

                                   NICK
              Some sacrifices are worth it.

                                   VADA
              You mean...it wasn't that terrible?

                                   NICK
              I wouldn't say it was terrible...it 
              was...kind of...

                                   VADA
              An adventure?

                                   NICK
                     (smiling)
              Part adventure...part miracle.

       Nick looks into Vada's eyes, they kiss, a long moment 
       passes and their lips part. They both smile at each other

                                   NICK
              Write me a poem?

                                   VADA
                     (shakes her head smiling)

                                   NICK
              No?

                                   VADA
              I'll write you ten poems.
                     (PA springs to life informing people 
                     to board NOW)
              Bye.

                                   NICK
              Good-bye, look in your backpack.

       Vada turns around and looks at Nick

                                   VADA
              Okay.

       Vada walks down the passage and turns out of sight, Nick 
       turns and heads past Rose and Phil, his eyes fixated on some 
       object far away, there is only one word to describe how he 
       looks
              STONED ON LOVE

       INSIDE PLANE, VADA IN HER SEAT, SHE REMOVES HER SEATBELT 
       AND OPENS HER BACKPACK

       she finds a little box which she opens and finds contained 
       in it a note and a pair of earrings, she looks at the 
       earrings and then reads the note

                                   VADA'S THOUGHTS
                     (reading note)
              In memory of barbaric customs, Love Nick.

       this makes Vada extremely happy

                                   VADA'S THOUGHTS
              Life is full of barbaric customs, I just hope 
              they all end with a kiss like that.

       as Vada disembarks, she makes her way into the crowd of 
       people waiting to pick up others, Arthur is standing there 
       waiting, Vada approaches

                                   VADA
              Arthur, where's my dad?

                                   ARTHUR
              He took Shelly to the hospital.

                                   VADA
              Is she okay?

                                   ARTHUR
              Well, she was making a lot of noise.

       they exit the scene

       OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL, ARTHUR PULLS UP AND LETS VADA OUT

       Vada gets out of the car and runs inside, making her way 
       through corridors to the maternity ward, where Harry is 
       waiting

                                   VADA
              Dad!

       Vada and Harry hug each other

                                   VADA
              What happened to Shelly?

                                   HARRY
              She just had a baby that's all.

                                   VADA
                     (excited)
              We have a baby?

                                   HARRY
              Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.

                                   VADA
              Can I see him?

                                   HARRY
              You can do anything you want. You're his 
              sister.

              Hey, what's on your ear?

       VADA ENTERS THE ROOM WHERE SHELLY IS LYING HOLDING THE BABY

                                   VADA
              Shelly?

                                   SHELLY
              Hey! Oh look.

                                   VADA
              He's so tiny.

                                   SHELLY
              I know, look at his little hands.

                                   HARRY
              I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.

                                   SHELLY
              I was pushing as fast as I could.

                                   VADA
              Did it hurt a lot?

                                   SHELLY
              You have no idea.

                                   BABY
              WAAAAAAAAAAH!!!

                                   SHELLY
              Shhhh.

                                   VADA
              Let me hold him.

                                   SHELLY
              O.K.

       Vada gently takes the baby from Shelly's arms

                                   SHELLY
              Maybe he's wet?

                                   HARRY
              Maybe he's hungry.

                                   VADA
              He's okay...you just have to sing to him.

              &quot;Smile though your heart is aching,
              Smile, even though it's breaking,
              Although a tear may be ever so near,
              That's the time you must keep on trying,
              Smile, what's the use of crying,
              You'll find that life is still worthwhile,
              If you just smile.&quot;

       OUTSIDE, HARRY SHELLY VADA AND BABY (IN PRAM) 
       ARE TAKING A WALK

                                   VADA'S THOUGHTS
              Things haven't exactly calmed down around 
              here, I got an A+ on the report, Dad's getting 
              used to my pierced ears and Nick's coming to 
              visit this summer. Other than that I'm busy 
              being a big sister. I'd like to tell my 
              brother about my mom, how I got to meet her 
              friends and find out how special she was, I 
              mean...she may not have her footprints in 
              cement but she definitely left her imprint on 
              the world...and I told them that even though 
              it sounds conceited...her greatest achievement 
              was me.

       Vada, Harry, Shelly and the baby cross the road and walk 
       off down the sidewalk as the camera rises and the song &quot;My 
       Girl&quot; begins to play and the credits roll
