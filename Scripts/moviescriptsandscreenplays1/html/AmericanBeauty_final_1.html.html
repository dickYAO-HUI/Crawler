My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood. This is my street. This... is my life. I'm forty-two years old. In less than a year, I'll be dead.

We're looking down at a king-sized BED from OVERHEAD:
</P>

</p><p><p ID="act">
LESTER BURNHAM lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens, face down, wearing PAJAMAS. An irritating ALARM CLOCK RINGS. Lester gropes blindly to shut it off.

LESTER (V.O.)

Of course, I don't know that yet.

LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd)

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - MOMENTS LATER</P>

Lester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower.
</P>

</p><p><p ID="act">
ANGLE from outside the shower: Lester's naked body is silhouetted through the fogged-up glass door. It becomes apparent he is masturbating.

CLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE. A gloved hand with CLIPPERS appears and SNIPS the flower off.

CAROLYN BURNHAM tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham house. A very well-put together woman of forty, she wears color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and expensive tools.

Lester watches her through a WINDOW on the first floor, peeping out through the drapes.

That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs? That's not an accident.

EXT. JIMS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS</P>

Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and Miracle Grow.

Jim #1 and Carolyn continue to chat, unaware that Lester is watching them.

LESTER (V.O.)
</P>

<P ID="dia">
Man. I get exhausted just watching her.
</P>

</p><p><p ID="act">
Lester's POV: We can't hear what Jim and Carolyn are saying, but she's overly animated, like a TV talk show host.
</P>

</p><p><P ID="speaker">
LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd)
</P>

She wasn't always like this. She used to be happy. We used to be happy.

LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd)

<P ID="dia">
Janie's a pretty typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused. I wish I could tell her that's all going to pass...

Outside, a CAR HORN BLARES. Jane stuffs items into her BACKPACK.
</P>

</p><p><P ID="speaker">
LESTER (V.O.) (cont'd)
</P>

<P ID="dia">
But I don't want to lie to her.

We HEAR the CAR HORN again from outside. Jane studies herself in a mirror, then shifts to get a good profile of her breasts.

</p><p><p ID="act">
Carolyn stands next to a platinum-colored MERCEDES-BENZ ML320, reaching in through the drivers' window to blow the HORN again.

Jane shuffles out of the house, her backpack slung over her shoulder.

Jane. Honey. Are you trying to look unattractive?

CAROLYN (cont'd)
</P>

<P ID="dia">
Lester, could you make me a little later, please? Because I'm not quite late enough.
</P>

</p><p><p ID="act">
Lester's briefcase suddenly springs open and his papers spill all over the driveway. He drops to his knees to gather everything.
</P>

</p><p><P ID="speaker">
JANE
</P>

<P ID="dia">
Nice going, Dad.
</P>

</p><p><p ID="act">
Lester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment.
</P>

</p><p><p ID="act">
His POV: Carolyn looks down at us, contemptuous but also bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago.
</P>

</p><p><P ID="speaker">
LESTER (V.O.)

<P ID="dia">
Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser, and... they're right.

LESTER (V.O.)

I have lost something. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I know I didn't always feel this... sedated. But you know what? It's never too late to get it back.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</P>

</p><p><p ID="act">
Lester sits at his workstation, a BEIGE CUBICLE surrounded by IDENTICAL BEIGE CUBICLES. He's staring at a computer monitor and talking on a HEADSET PHONE. The beleaguered expression on his face is at odds with the light, friendly tone of his voice.

LESTER

Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media Monthly magazine, I'm calling for Mr. Tamblin, please?... Well, we're all under a deadline here, uh, but you see, there is some basic information about the product launch that isn't even covered in your press release and I... Yeah. Can I ask you a question? Who is Tamblin? Does he exist? 'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in... Yeah, okay, I'll leave my number...

Lester sits across from him, looking small and isolated.

LESTER

Oh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta free up cash. Gotta spend money to make money. Right?

Exactly. So...

Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and then she used the card numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for, what was it, like, three months?

That's fifty thousand dollars. That's somebody's salary. That's somebody who's gonna get fired because Craig has to pay women to fuck him!

BRAD

<P ID="dia">
Jesus. Calm down. Nobody's getting fired yet. That's why we're having everyone write out a job description, mapping out in detail how they contribute. That way, management can assess who's valuable and--
