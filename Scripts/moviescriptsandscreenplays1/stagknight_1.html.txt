Stagknight is set to be the next cult hit British comedy/horror film. Currently in post-production, the film will be released later in the year. An entirely independent project, following in the footsteps of Shaun of the Dead, Stagknight boasts better kills, hotter babes, more laughs and one of the most original horror villains ever seen. Featuring Sandra Dickenson (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) and Jocelyn Osario this will be a project to watch! By producer/director Simon Cathcart and producer Rob Mercer (Razor Blade Smile).This is a British comedy that goes near enough beyond the boundaries of taste and logic. It has violence that few movies can compare to, it has gratuitous sex and bad language, it has thrills, scares and a big budget look that wouldn't be possible without the expert direction of Simon Cathcart, who has had both acting and directing experience, both to universal acclaim. 

Synopsis: Deep in the woods outside London, an ancient evil lies undisturbed for centuries. Until now. In the middle of nowhere it was to be the perfect Stagknight.... strippers, pranks, drugs, booze and paintball! But for bridegroom Brian and his team of Weekend Warriors, Happy Valley Paintball Farm isn't all that happy. As the party hots up and tensions in the group simmer, the lads face off for a night game, blissfully unaware that a far greater foe is waiting for them in the dark.
