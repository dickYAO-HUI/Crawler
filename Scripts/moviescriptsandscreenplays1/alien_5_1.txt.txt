ALIEN 5 OPENING SEQUENCE?



	SPACE

	A backdrop of stars, traces of colorful galaxies.

	INTO FRAME AS WE MOVE BACK: A BEACON.  Old, scarred.  One 
	side crumpled from an explosion.  Weyland-Yutani emblon 
	visible.  The beacon's navigation light blinks erratically.

	BACK FURTHER revealing an astronaut with a HANDHELD JETPACK 
	nearing the beacon.  A TETHER snakes out behind the figure.

	CONTINUING BACK shows the tether attached to a SPACESHIP 
	built like a giant Swiss army knife -- a repair ship.  On 
	one side of the ship: B42-GOV/WY-FRONTIER 'BERTHA'.  Inside 
	the open cargo bay sits a NEW BEACON, this one a sleeker 
	model than the one outside.  Its nav light strobes eagerly.

	INT. BERTHA

	CONRAD, mid-20s, wearing Weyland-Yutani overalls, floats 
	weightless and inverted at the cabin ceiling.  He retrieves 
	a thick manual from a compartment then kicks off toward the 
	main viewscreen, where TIBBS, fat and in his 50s, is buckled 
	into a pilot chair.  Tibbs sucks purple mush through the 
	straw of a food container.  His straining t-shirt reads: W-
	Y LITTLE LEAGUE - GO COLTS GO!  Conrad slips a headset on.  
	They watch the astronaut on the screen.

	THE BEACON

	DEBBIE, 20-ish and sassy, fires the jetpack to align herself 
	with the beacon.  She grabs a hand hold, climbs over to a 
	control box, and attaches a tether from her suit harness to 
	part of the beacon.

			DEBBIE
		That's it, we're hitched.

			CONRAD (V.O.)
		Can I kiss the bride?

			DEBBIE
		No, but you can kiss my ass.

	INT. BERTHA

			CONRAD
		It's a deal.  Listen, that damaged 
		panel looks unstable.  Skip the 
		external and go straight for 
		diagnostics, okay?

			DEBBIE (V.O.)
		You're the boss, Conrad.

			TIBBS
		     (to Debbie; mouth full)
		Ah, technically I'm the boss.  
		I've got twenty years with the 
		company; Conrad's got six months 
		and an uncle in personnel.

	THE BEACON

	Debbie uses a small tool to pop open the panel.  Buttons, a 
	screen, and two large switch-breakers inside.  She thumbs 
	the two switches.  Buttons light up.  The screen flutters 
	to life with: AUXILLARY POWER ON / MAX 50 MINUTES FULL LOAD 
	/ COMMAND?  The screen glitches intermittently.

			DEBBIE
		The pile is down.  Backup power 
		seems okay, though.

			CONRAD (V.O.)
		Patch in a filter just in case.

	She takes a small electronic unit from her utility belt.  
	In her other hand she uses a gun-shaped tool to squirt some 
	sticky goop on the back on the unit, which she jams onto 
	the rim of the control panel.  She hooks it up between the 
	main tether and the control panel.

			DEBBIE
		All set.  You should have a clean 
		feed now.

	The screen flashes through some menus, then fills with a 
	stream of data.

	INT. BERTHA

	Still eating, Tibbs watches a nearby monitor blur with data.

			TIBBS
		That's affirmative.

	Tibbs and Conrad work the ship computers.

			DEBBIE (V.O.)
		What's the verdict?  Do we salvage?

			CONRAD
		     (scanning readouts)
		This one's pretty much brain dead.

			DEBBIE (V.O.)
		Don't go all technical on me.

			TIBBS
		The analysis shows multiple 
		fractures in the substructure.  
		Too risky to bring it onboard for 
		a stripdown so we'll just go with 
		standard procedure and deep-six 
		it.

	THE BEACON - INTERCUT

			DEBBIE
		So was that a yes or a no?

			CONRAD
		Ah, Debbie, I believe that was a 
		negative.

			DEBBIE
		Okey-dokey.  So how do we blow it?

			CONRAD
		See that big red button labeled 
		"self-destruct"?

			DEBBIE
		     (looking hard)
		I don't see it.

			TIBBS
		That's because there isn't one.  
		Young lady, you really should have 
		paid attention during basic 
		training.  We prime the reactor 
		for detonation from here.  Standby.  
		Conrad, give me the core activation 
		string.

	Conrad consults the manual.  On the cover: WEYLAND YUTANI / 
	FRONTIER DIV. / ADVANCED WARNING SYSTEMS / CLASSIFIED B2.

			CONRAD
		     (from manual)
		Delta Charlie dash one seven zero.

			TIBBS
		     (typing)
		D-C-one-seven-zero.  Confirmed.

	The beacon's control screen now reads: EVENT DELAY (MINUTES)?

			DEBBIE
		It's showing some kind of timer.

			CONRAD
		     (bouncing it off Tibbs)
		Ten minutes to get her back and 
		unsuited, ten minutes to move to a 
		safe distance.  Say fifteen minutes 
		contingency.  Thirty-five?

			TIBBS
		Thirty-five minutes is ample.
		     (he types)

			CONRAD
		Return to deploy the new beacon, 
		then dinner and a quick game of 
		scrabble -- we'll be in hyper-sleep 
		and headed for home within a couple 
		hours.  Outstanding.

	Debbie watches the screen shuffle through menus.  A countdown 
	appears: 35 MINUTES TO POWER CORE IGNITION.

			DEBBIE
		Warm up my slippers.  I'm on my 
		way.

	INT. BERTHA

	An alarm sounds.  The two men jump to the controls.

			CONRAD
		Proximity alert.  Picking up a 
		huge neutrino echo.  Somebody's 
		dropping out of L-space right on 
		top of us.

			TIBBS
		Nobody should be out this far ...

			CONRAD
		There's a shitload of matter influx.  
		Too much for just one ship.  Looks 
		more like a fucking planet!

			TIBBS
		Debbie!  You copy that?  We've got 
		L-space activity!  Hold on!

	SPACE

	A portal opens, squeezing into normal space.  A wall of 
	light.  Blinding.  Debbie cringes in the beacon's shadow.  
	Conrad and Tibbs shield their eyes.  Then ...  all light 
	gets sucked back to its pinhole origin.  Where there was 
	nothing is now a vast fleet of alien spacecraft.  Twenty in 
	all.  Several makes and sizes, but all follow the same basic 
	design.  We've seen their type before... on LV-421 -- the 
	derelict spacecraft with its crop of deadly facehuggers.

	A red-blue energy wave ripples outward from the fleet.  The 
	shockwave is brutal but losing energy fast as it dissipates.

	INT. BERTHA

	The main viewscreen splits into windows showing the beacon, 
	the energy wave, and a rapid visual scan of the alien fleet.  
	In that window the computer reports: SCAN COMPLETE / 
	IDENTIFICATION FAILED ON MULTIPLE UNKNOWN OBJECTS, STRUCTURE 
	AND COMPOSITION UNKNOWN / LIFEFORMS DETECTED, SPECIES 
	UNKNOWN.

			CONRAD
		Fuckers didn't even knock first.

			TIBBS
		Oh Christ.  Here comes the Phase 
		shift aftershock.

			CONRAD
		Debbie!  Use the beacon as your 
		shield.  Get behind the beacon!

	THE BEACON

	Debbie sees the approaching shockwave and clambers sideways 
	to get behind the beacon.

	INT. BERTHA

	The blastwave hits them.  It buffets the ship for a few 
	seconds.  Sends objects cascading through the weightless 
	cabin.  Scrambles all electronics.  Systems fail.  No power.

	THE BEACON

	Debbie hugs the beacon as it goes tumbling.  It reaches the 
	end of the tether and jerks tight, nearly throwing Debbie 
	off.  The momentum sends Bertha and the beacon spinning 
	around each other in dizzying circles.

	Debbie regains her hold.  Stars whirl past.  She looks at 
	the control screen.  Dead.  All lights off.

			DEBBIE
		Bertha, Bertha, you copy?  The 
		beacon just lost backup!

	INT. BERTHA

	Tibbs and Conrad recover from the impact, scan the computers.

			CONRAD
		The blastwave fritzed our power 
		too.

			TIBBS
		Whoever that is out there, it's 
		not us.  And they're headed this 
		way.

			CONRAD
		Debbie, get back in here now!

	Tibbs rips off panels and franticly examines wiring and 
	componentry.  Conrad watches Debbie's image on screen.

	THE BEACON

	Debbie can't detach the tether.  The blastwave has twisted 
	the catch, snagging it in the hook.  She yanks at it but it 
	won't budge.

			DEBBIE
		Damn this mainline, Conrad, it's 
		stuck!

			CONRAD (V.O.)
		C'mon, Deb, detach and get your 
		ass in here on the double.

	She pauses as the beacon suddenly stutters back to life.  
	The nav light flickers on, the control panel lights up, and 
	the screen returns with the countdown timer.  But there's a 
	difference that freezes Debbie's blood in her veins: the 
	timer reads: 4 MIN 50 SEC TO REACTOR IGNITION (NO RECOURSE).

	INT. BERTHA

			DEBBIE (O.S.)
		Oh shit.  The power's back but now 
		the timer is down to four minutes!

			TIBBS
		What?  Four minutes to detonation?

			CONRAD
		No power, we're tied to a bomb, 
		and we're surrounded by aliens.  
		This was not in my fucking contract!

			TIBBS
		     (working frantically)
		Check the fineprint.

	THE BEACON

	Debbie stabs at keys on the beacon's control panel.  She 
	gives up and pounds it with her fist in frustration.

			DEBBIE
		Cancel the self-destruct order!  
		Tibbs, transmit the code now!

	INT. BERTHA

			TIBBS
		Negative.  It's too late for that.  
		There's no failsafe under five 
		minutes.  No recourse.  We can't 
		stop it.

			CONRAD
		     (thinking fast)
		Listen to me, Debbie.  Cut the 
		mainline.  Use your suit laser.

	THE BEACON

	Debbie presses a switch on her glove.  A pencil-sized laser 
	extends over her index finger.  She points it at the tether 
	linking her and the beacon, activates it with her thumb.  A 
	narrow beam starts biting into the thick cable.  The beam 
	cuts out, flickers, cuts out again, returns.

			DEBBIE
		Goddammit!

	INT. BERTHA

	The Bertha's power returns.  All systems back online.  Tibbs 
	whoops and leaps into the pilot's chair.  He begins 
	programming the nav computer.

			CONRAD
		Deb, the ship's back online.  We 
		need to put some space between us 
		and that fucking beacon!

			TIBBS
		How much time?

			DEBBIE (O.S.)
		Three minutes.  Repeat, three 
		minutes.

	Tibbs powers up the engines.

	EXT. BERTHA

	The ship stabilises, no longer spinning, and begins 
	accelerating smoothly away.

	THE BEACON

	Debbie clings on as the beacon whips around and gets towed 
	behind Bertha.

			DEBBIE
		Hey, what the...?

	INT. BERTHA

			CONRAD
		Tibbs!  What are you doing?

			TIBBS
		I'm getting us the hell away from 
		that alien fleet.  It's no 
		coincidence they appear where a 
		recon beacon is out of action.  
		They probably disabled it in 
		advance.

			CONRAD
		We don't know that.  They could be 
		friendly!

			TIBBS
		Sure, maybe they're just out here 
		for a picnic.

	Tibbs stares Conrad down, then secretly hits a console 
	button.

	EXT. BERTHA

	The cargo bay doors begin to close.

	CLOSE ON DOORS as they scissor shut, severing the tether 
	line.  Internal wiring sparks.

	The beacon is left stranded as the ship accelerates away.

	THE BEACON

	Debbie watches the ship leaving.  She takes a deep breath 
	before turning back to the job at hand.  One minute thirty 
	left on the timer.

			DEBBIE
		     (shaky)
		Well, guys, the bad news is I won't 
		be joining you for dinner...

	INT. BERTHA - INTERCUT

			CONRAD
		Shit!  SHIT!  Tibbs, we lost Debbie!  
		Turn the ship back!

			TIBBS
		Damn you, there's no time!  We'll 
		all die.  I'm sorry, Debbie.

			CONRAD
		Fuck sorry -- turn back now!

			DEBBIE
		No!  Conrad, it's okay.  You guys 
		can make it.  Thanks to me, I might 
		add.  As usual a woman saves the 
		day.

			CONRAD
		     (helpless)
		You're one in a million, Debbie.

			DEBBIE
		     (works the faulty laser)
		Damn straight.  I'm smart as well 
		as good-looking.  And let's not 
		forget my wonderful fucking 
		personality.

			CONRAD
		I won't forget.

			TIBBS
		I'm taking the ship to L-space.  
		We'll have entry speed in one 
		minute.

			DEBBIE
		I agree with Tibbs -- this is some 
		kind of invasion... 

	The laser has cut most of the way through the tether joining 
	Debbie to the beacon.  She switches off the laser, grabs 
	her jetpack and the glue gun, and squirts a couple of big 
	dollops of the sticky resin on the front of the jetpack.  
	Then she sticks the jetpack to the beacon.  Resumes cutting 
	the tether.  The timer dips below one minute.

			DEBBIE
		You're kind of sweet on me, aren't 
		you, Conrad.

			CONRAD
		     (choking up)
		I ... yeah, I guess so.

			DEBBIE
		Too bad, sweetheart, because I 
		also happen to be fantastic in 
		bed.

			CONRAD
		     (smiling sadly)
		I was counting on it.

	The tether between Debbie and the beacon severs.  She slaps 
	a switch on the jetpack -- the rockets fire full on, blasting 
	her in a backward somersault as the beacon launches away 
	from her, toward the alien fleet.

			DEBBIE
		Yeee-hah!  Go baby go!  Go tell em 
		not to fuck with me!

	INT. BERTHA

	Tibbs is preoccupied with getting the ship into L-space.  
	Conrad is numb.  He watches Debbie's plight on the 
	viewscreen.

			CONRAD
		Hey!  She cut herself free!  And 
		she did something to the beacon.  
		It's headed for the fleet.

			TIBBS
		Shit.  We just fired the first 
		shot.  If they were friendly they 
		won't be now.

			CONRAD
		Wait.  The beacon...

	DEBBIE

	Tumbles slowly through space.  At least she's alive.  She 
	tries to keep watching the beacon as it diminishes...  then 
	grows larger -- the beacon is COMING BACK in her direction!  
	The jetpack has put it in a loop!

			DEBBIE
		     (wearily)
		Yeah, whatever ...

	THE BEACON

	Five seconds left on the counter.  It's going to pass within 
	100 metres of Debbie ...

	THE ALIEN FLEET

	Like a searchlight, a continuous beam shoots from one of 
	the big ships.

	THE BEACON

	The beam surrounds the beacon in a cocoon of energy.  The 
	timer reaches zero.  Debbie watches in awe.  The powerful 
	explosion is contained within.  The beam ceases.

	THE ALIEN FLEET

	A second beam shoots out from the same alien craft.

	DEBBIE

	Is caught by the beam, all motion arrested.  The beam begins 
	to pull her toward the big alien craft.

			CONRAD (V.O.)
		Debbie?  Debbie?

			DEBBIE
		I'm alive.  I'm being pulled back 
		to their ship.  Guess they want to 
		meet me. 
		     (fear in her voice now)
		Can't blame em, I'm such a fine 
		specimen of womanhood ...

	INT. BERTHA

	Conrad and Tibbs are strapped into the pilot chairs.  They 
	exchange a horrified look: what will the aliens do with 
	her?

	THE ALIEN FLEET

	A smaller vessel fires its weapons.

	DEBBIE

	Watches the missiles streak past her.

			DEBBIE
		Conrad!

	INT. BERTHA

			TIBBS
		Almost ready...

	An alarm SHRIEKS.  CLOSE ON A MONITOR which reads: THREAT 
	ALERT!  EMERGENCY MEMORY DUMP -- UPLOADING TO NETWORK ...

			CONRAD
		Incoming fire!  Punch it now!

			TIBBS
		L-drive online--

	EXT. BERTHA

	Too late.  The missiles obliterate the Bertha.

	DEBBIE

	Is almost at the alien vessel.  She witnesses the distant 
	explosion, then disappears through an access port underneath 
	the ship.
