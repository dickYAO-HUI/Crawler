                on a background of steaming funnels belching 
                steam--accompanied by a musical score of ex-
                citing tempo.

                Large ocean liner, plowing through darkened 
                waters, its decks and portholes brilliantly 
                illuminated.

                spray many feet into the air--almost up to the

                S. S. Progress.

        Hello again! This is Chad Denby--remember?--h'mm
        --Your Master of Ceremonies--coming to you with 
        another program in mid-atlantic--for the benefit of 
        you folks who just tuned in I want to say that the 
        passengers are all comfortably seated--I wish you 
        listeners back there in the small towns and villages could 
        see the life and glamour on this floating palace--We're 
        having oceans of fun--Am I hot tonight! 

                Mary enters. 

                                MARY 
        Oh-h, Mister Den-n-by--
 
 
                                DENBY
        Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What 
        do you want, Mary?
 
                                MARY
        I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
 
                                DENBY
        But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time--
        why spoil it?

        Somebody's got to do it--

                        (reads from paper) 
        Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across 
        the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for 
        boats to ride on thee--
 
                                DENBY

        Very good, Mary--
 
                                MARY
        But I'm not finished yet--(Poem)--And your waves 
        are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, 
        Atlantic, how I love you (signs of seasickness)--(re-
        peats)--how I love you--
 
                                DENBY
        What's the matter, Mary?

        Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with 
        that part?
 
                                DENBY
        Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through
        a porthole--

                The voices of Frank Parker and Jean Sargent can

        You are listening to the golden voices of Jean Sargent
        and Frank Parker, who are entertaining with that 
        rollicking bit of syncopation, Rock and Roll--every-

                                MARY 
        I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate 
        of bean soup not a plate of bean soup? 

                                DENBY
        All right. When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of 
        noodle soup?

        gives you this entertainment on the high seas? Where is 
        it coming from?--you said it! the Transatlantic Merry-

        three hot funnels--a hundred galloping portholes--
        and all nice people! Try a trip on our boat for what ails

                He goes in door, closes it, and we hear the door
                lock.

                We stay on the exterior of door, where we hear
                two shots fired--a woman screams--we see the

        Have you taken the soundings?

                                SECOND NAVIGATION OFFICER 
        Yes, Sir--here's our position now.

15              CLOSE SHOT--Officer's hand tracing the progress 
                of the ship on the chart.

                                SECOND NAVIGATION OFFICER 
        We're off the southeastern point of Newfoundland--
        43 West and 52 North--running dead to time.

        Thirty-six hours off the point light--fifty-eight hours 
        --back in--New York!

                As he says "New York" the setup becomes dif-
                fused. SOUND TRACK CARRIES a honking and toot-
                ing of motor horns--the sound of many voices--
                an orchestra playing.

                Over this the SOUND TRACK carries miscellaneous
                noises in fast tempo--hooting of taxicabs--
                screeching of brakes--babble of excited voices--
                hawkers, porters, passengers. CAMERA PANS DOWN

                flowers, and policemen who keep them moving.

                we occasionally hear this boy's voice calling the
                above) 

                PULL CAMERA BACK TO VERY LONG SHOT. Private 
                cars and taxis are arriving in a stream, tooting 
                impatiently as they jockey for a position to drop 
                their passengers and baggage. In the distance can
                be heard the occasional wailing whistles of crafts 
                in the stream and, from the decks of the S. S. 
                Progress, the ships orchestra playing gay, familiar 
                tunes.

                As a taxi drives up, CAMERA DOLLIES BACK TO 
                MEDIUM SHOT, shooting from the roadway through 
                taxi window to the entrance of the dock. Its 
                occupant is LEE LOTHER (the man we saw dead in 
                first sequence).

                He jumps out, pays taxi; porter grabs his hand baggage.

        Name and reservation, sir?

        Lee Lother--4C.
 
19              TRAVEL SHOT 
                As they move through the crowd. SOUND TRACK 
                carries paper boy's voice calling the extra. Lother 
                stops and buys a paper. In close proximity is a 
                man reading one of the papers--a woman is looking 
                over his shoulder.

        Escaped again!--More bank robberies!--More hold-
        ups!--What we need is a police force!

                Lother overhears this as he pays for paper and 
                moves on reading paper, followed by porter, also 
                trying to read it over Lother's shoulder. 

                                PORTER 
        They'll be a lot of shooting before they get that guy

                A limousine discharges its passengers. A taxi 
                behind it is tooting impatiently to get alongside.
 
21              INTERIOR TAXI--ANYA ROSSON AND HER HUSBAND 
                Anya is a young Russian, blonde, extremely attractive, 
                beautifully dressed--speaks with a slight
                accent. She is puffing nervously at a cigarette. 
                Her husband is young, middle-aged Grand Mitchell 
                type. They get quickly out of the car and move 
                toward dock. At first-class gangplank they stop. 
                Porter carrying their baggage starts to take it 
                aboard.

                                ANYA 
        Wait a minute, porter--my husband's not going aboard. 

                Porter bows away to a respectful distance. Anya 
                places her hand on her husband's arm.

                        (quietly) 
        Going to miss me?
 
                Rosson nods his head--his voice is a little husky. 

                                ROSSON 
        Send me a wireless when you arrive--and have a good 
        time--that's the important thing. 

                                ANYA
                        (smiling)
        It's all happened so suddenly--I can hardly believe I'm 
        going-- 

                As she is speaking these lines her eyes are 
                searching for someone on the ship.

        Too bad you couldn't come, too, Herbert. 

                                ROSSON 
                        (kindly) 
        As long as we can indulge your whims--somebody in the 
        family has to work.
                        (He kisses her quickly.) 
        Good-bye, my dear. If I keep those Duluth people waiting 
        another minute, I'll lose the deal. 

                                ANYA
        Don't let me go without the jewel case.
                (He puts his hand in his pocket and hands 
                her a small case.) 
        The American Express cheques are in there, aren't they? 

                                ROSSON 
                        (nodding) 
        You can pick up your letter of credit at Cook's in 
        Cherbourg. Goodbye.

                They embrace. Quickly she takes a flower from the 
                corsage she is wearing and places it affectionately in his 
                lapel, pats his cheek, and, without another word, goes 
                up the gangplank followed by the porter. Rosson stands 
                bareheaded watching her for a moment. CAMERA MOVES 
                IN CLOSE to him. We see that his mildness is belied by 
                his eyes and that he is under an emotional strain. His 
                hand goes to the lapel of his coat. He pulls out the 
                flower, crushes it in his hand, and let's it slowly fall to 
                the ground.

24              DOLLY SHOT--HE HURRIES BACK THROUGH THE CROWD
                Finds a porter--hands him a check. 

                                ROSSON 
        Get my baggage out of the check room and put it 
        aboard this ship.

                                PORTER 
        Yes, sir--where's your reservation?

                        (pulling out passport and steamship ticket) 
        Cabin 108--Second Class--I'll see you aboard. 

                Rosson disappears through the crowd. The porter, 
                who was already carrying a bag when approached 
                by Rosson, puts its down on top of a theatrical 
                trunk while he goes to collect Rosson's baggage 
                from the check room. CAMERA STAYS ON TRUNK on 
                which is printed: "Sally Marsh--Marsh Trio." A 
                girl is leaning against the trunk, her back to the 
                CAMERA. She turns slowly--it is SALLY MARSH. 
                Beside her is NED, turning the pages of Variety. 
                Also a porter.
 
                                SALLY
                        (to Porter) 
        Take these things to 51C and the other trunk has my 
        name on it just like this.

                                PORTER 
        You get aboard, Miss--I'll take care of it. 

                                SALLY
        It's very important--it has our costumes in it. 

                                VOICE 
                Hey, Sally.
 
                Chad Denby, Master of Ceremonies, comes into 
                scene.

                                DENBY
        The big star of Chad Denby's big seagoing show. We'll
        have your name up in lighthouses from here to England. 

                Sally is looking around rather nervously. 

                                SALLY
        Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it. 

                                DENBY
        Are you happy?

                                SALLY
        Will be--as soon as the ship sails. 

                                NED 
        I thought I had our sailing covered up--
                (indicates paper) 
        --and here it is.
 
                                SALLY 
                        (alarmed)
        Do you think Lother could have seen it?

                                DENBY
        You'd better get on board. I'll take care of the trunks.
        Hey, porter!

                Sally moves near gangplank near which is standing 
                a gang of five or six vaudevillians of various types, 
                etc., etc. Suddenly they see Sally and rush forward 
                with enthusiastic greetings.

                                FIRST VAUDEVILLIAN
        Just read in Variety you were sailing. Picked up some 
        of the boys and girls to come down and give you a cheer.
 
                General ad-lib as they give Sally flowers, wish her 
                luck, etc. Sally is ill at ease--she ad-libs with the 
                others.

                                FIRST VAUDEVILLIAN 
        Say, these steamship companies are going into the show 
        business in a big way.

                                SECOND VAUDEVILLIAN
        I should say so--this transatlantic showboat idea is a 
        novelty.

                                THIRD VAUDEVILLIAN
        I think it's a conspiracy--They want to take all the 
        vaudeville acts out to the middle of the Atlantic and 
        dump them overboard.

                                FOURTH VAUDEVILLIAN
        Ha! Ha! That's a dirty trick to play on the fish! 

                                FIFTH VAUDEVILLIAN
        Do they pay any kind of money on these big ships? 

                                FIRST VAUDEVILLIAN
        Sixty-two fifty for teams and a hundred and a quarter 
        for quartets.

                                FIFTH VAUDEVILLIAN
        I wouldn't sing on a rowboat for that kind of dough!
 
                The foregoing lines are more or less spoken together--
                disjointedly.
 
                CAMERA PANS slowly over to the roped-off passport 
                enclosure at which an official is sitting stamping 
                visas. CAMERA MOVES IN close to his hand holding a 
                passport.

                BRETT (Gene Raymond). He takes back his passport.

        Thanks.
 
                He is scanning the dock, obviously in search of 
                someone. He moves toward steerage gangplank in 
                the direction of SHORTIE--a depressed-looking 
                individual in steward's white coat.
 
                Shortie's eyes are anxiously searching the crowd. 
                His expression is anything but happy. He sees 
                Brett and moves toward him. 

                                SHORTIE
        Now listen, Jimmy--!
 
                Brett doesn't even glance at him but continues to 
                walk past, speaking as he does so. 

                                BRETT
        Not here--follow me around the shed.

                        He then turns to Shortie) 
        Don't you know better than to talk to me with people 
        around?
 
                                SHORTIE 
                        (sarcastically)
        Oh, putting on the swell, eh?

                                BRETT 
        I thought you were a smart guy. 

                                SHORTIE 
        If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on
        this ship.
                        (He lights a cigarette)

                                BRETT
        We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we? 

                                SHORTIE 
        We coulda got two third-class! 

                                BRETT 
        No bank roll there, boy.
                      (quickly) 
        Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that 
        Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, 
        Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be 
        mighty welcome.
 
                                SHORTIE 
        Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and 
        it's a bad habit to get into.

                                BRETT 
        It'll never hurt you---Got any money?

                                SHORTIE 
        A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it! 

                                BRETT 
        No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy. 

                                SHORTIE 
        I'll give you half of it.
                (He goes to his pocket and extracts money) 
        Here's seventy cents.
                (Brett takes it) 

                At this point two uniformed cops approach. 
                Brett sees them.


                                BRETT 
        Nix, the law!

                                SHORTIE 
                        (immediately becomes servile) 
        Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir! 


                                BRETT 
                        (Speaking casually as 
                        the man comes near) 
        He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a 
        basket of fruit.

                                SHORTIE 
        I'll watch for him, sir.

                The cops have stopped and are eying Shortie. 

                                BRETT 
        Thank you, and here's seventy cents for your trouble. 

                Shortie pockets the money and is about to start
                away.

                                COP 
        Just a minute!
 
                Shortie swallows hard--turns. 

                                SHORTIE

        You ought to know better than that.

        Don't forget that $l.70 change.

                Shortie, in a spot, hands it to Brett. The steward 
                walks away.

        Not interested, boys. When I left headquarters this 
        morning--I cut the words "police" and "criminals" 
        right out of my vocabulary.
 
                                SECOND DETECTIVE
        Don't blame you, sir--you've earned a rest.

        Pardon me, gentlemen--have you noticed a colored man 
        in chauffeur's uniform, carrying a l-a-r-g-e basket of--
        fruit?
 
                As he says this he looks the Inspector straight in 
                the eye. There is no sign of recognition on McKinney's 
                part, who replies casually: 

                                MCKINNEY 
        No, I haven't.
 
                A little smile of satisfaction overspreads Brett's 
                countenance as he thanks them and hurries on 
                through the crowd.

                there is general confusion. The gang are all 
                patting her on the back, wishing her luck, etc. 
                Mechanically she kisses each one of them. 

                As she is doing this, Jimmy Brett, hurrying from 
                left to right, gets mixed up in the group. Sally 
                mechanically kisses him, the next moment realizes 
                her mistake and smiles with embarrassment as the 
                vaudevillians laugh.
 
                                BRETT
                        (after kiss)
        That was sweet of you.

                The orchestra from the deck commences to play 
                Sweet of You. Brett removes his hat, looks at Sally 
                admiringly and grins.

                                SALLY
        I'm so sorry!

                                BRETT
                        (facetiously)
        Want to take it back?

                He leans toward her hopefully. 

                                SALLY
        I thought you were one of my friends. 

                                BRETT
        I'd like to be.
                        (anxiously) 
        Sailing on the Progress?

                                SALLY
        Yes--are you?

                                BRETT
                        (looking her straight in the 
                        eye and smiling) 
        I wouldn't miss this boat for a million. 

                                SALLY
                        (looking at boat with 
                        admiration) 
        She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's 
        beautiful.
                        (still looking at boat)
 
                                BRETT 
                        (who hasn't taken his eyes 
                        off Sally for an instant)
        I'll say she is! 

                                SALLY
        Nice lines--

                                BRETT 
        Yes--
 
                Sally turns--sees he's looking at her--smiles. 

                                SALLY
        Like her paint job?
 
                                BRETT 
        Very much--
 
                                SALLY
                        (Searching for handkerchief)
        You've got lipstick all over you. 

                                BRETT
        I could stand some more--

                                SALLY
                        (laughing) 
        --You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--
                        (she reaches up with her 
                        handkerchief) 
        --let me wipe it off.

                                BRETT
        No! Don't touch it! I want the world to see my shame. 

                NED comes quickly into scene--he's impatient to 
                get her aboard.

                                NED
        Come on, Sally.

                As they move off toward ship.

                Among the crowded passengers at the railing, 
                watching Sally. He smiles to himself and steps
                back.

                Watching Lother.

                His eyes are twinkling--there is a smile on his lips 
                --he is evidently very much impressed. He watches 
                Sally move toward gangplank.
 
46              MEDIUM SHOT
                As Brett starts to move away he bumps into a 
                messenger boy carrying a beautiful bouquet of 
                flowers.
 
                                BRETT 
                        (quickly)
        Who are those flowers for?

                        (looking at label)
        Mrs. Armitich.

                                BRETT 
        Glad I caught you in time--Mrs. Armitich is not sailing 
        --so give them to my sister--that lady with the beautiful 
        red hair going up the gangplank. 

                He tears label from bouquet. 

                                MESSENGER BOY 
        But I'm supposed to--

                                BRETT

        --With the red hair--Hurry!

                He gives the boy a push, shoving him out of picture.

                We see the boy overtake Sally just before she steps 
                aboard. She takes the flowers--looks surprised--
                evidently asks the boy who they came from. We 
                see the boy point in Brett's direction. She smiles
                her thanks just as the fellow singing through the 
                megaphone comes to the phrase--"It was sweet of 
                you."

                Porter yanks open the door. Seated on a suitcase 
                on the floor, the befuddled victim of alcohol, is 
                DAN CAMPBELL (Sidney Howard). He has a bottle 
                in his hand and beams at the porter. 

                                DAN 
        Come in, my dear fellow--pull up a chair--delighted to 
        meet you! My name's Campbell.

                He extends his hand. By now the taxi driver has 
                reached the door. There is an impatient tooting of 
                cars from behind.

                                DRIVER 
        Come on--get out of there!

        He's got a ticket for England--some guy loaded him 
        into my cab.
 
                They yank him to the sidewalk and send him on 
                his way.

                comes to Mary Livingston and Chad Denby, CAMERA 
                PANS TO favor them. Chad is talking to Mary. 

                                DENBY 
        Mary--I've got a great show for this trip--and with 
        my dry wit and humor--h'mm--a few more trips and 
        we'll have to furnish straphangers for the passengers to 
        hang on!
 
                                MARY 
                        (sarcastically)
        With your dry wit and humor--

                                DENBY 
        Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
 
                                MARY 
        Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality. 

                                DENBY
        What's he got that I haven't got?

                                MARY
        Well, he has a straw hat--
   
                                DENBY
                        (interrupting) 
        So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk. 

                                MARY 
        --And he has sex appeal.

                                DENBY
        So what? 

                                MARY 
        Get that out of your trunk.

                                DENBY 
        All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes--
        there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but 
        class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all 
        members of the Who's Who!

                                MARY 
        Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat 
        I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All 
        I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy. 

                                DENBY 
        Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the 
        raise!
 
                Dan Campbell staggers in between them--Chad 
                grabs hold of him to brace him up. 

                                MARY
        Is that one of the Who's Who? 

                                DENBY
                (embarrassed)
        No--He's probably one of the "Here's How." 
                        (holding up Dan to steady him) 
        Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--

                                DAN 
        I'll say--how fast is this boat going?

                        (speaking to himself) 
        Pretty good--thirty miles an hour--

                                DENBY
        No. Knots!

                                DAN
        What?

                                DENBY
        Knots!

                                DAN
        I can see you're no gentleman--

                                MARY
        He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. 
        Denby.

                                DAN
        Denby!--Are you Chad Denby? 

                                DENBY
        That's me!

                                DAN
        Not the real Chad Denby?--

                                DENBY
        Yes--Me--in person!

                                DAN

        Where's your dry humor now, Chad? 

                Dan staggers.

                                DENBY
        Be careful--come on--I better pour you on the boat--

                As the three start away--Denby is still sore at the 
                last remark.

                                DENBY
        I can see where I won't talk much to you. 

                                DAN 
                        (misunderstanding)

                down the gangplanks from the first saloon. The 
                orchestra is playing--quartermasters are shouting 
                instructions--paper streamers are commencing to 
                be thrown aboard.

                Denby has Campbell by the arm helping him up 
                the gangplank. Campbell stumbles and his rubber 
                legs buckle under him. Denby has some difficulty 
                helping Campbell back on his feet. After Campbell 
                is put on his feet again, he turns to Denby, 
                and very seriously remarks: 

                                CAMPBELL 
                        (to Denby) 
        Steady, old boy--I've got you. 

                                DENBY 
        Thanks--I appreciate it.

                They proceed up gangplank, toward deck of boat. 
                Two or three policemen in uniform are seen coming 
                down gangplank, obviously leaving the boat. 

                                FIRST POLICEMAN
        He's not there, Inspector--we've searched every inch of 
        the boat.

                Ballinger, which we recognize from the newspaper. 
                It immediately disappears and his hand comes up 
                and drops a policeman's uniform and cap over the 
                side of the boat into the water.

                sees him in the mirror, speaks without turning.

        Took your time getting here.

                                BRETT
        Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four 
        years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you? 

                                SHORTIE
        Yeah--but high livin's made me soft. 

                                BRETT
        How're the tips?
 
                                SHORTIE
                        (depressed)
        A dollar forty.

                                BRETT
        I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward. 

                                SHORTIE
        Not a chance.
 
                                BRETT
                        (coaxingly)
        Come on--
                        (He extends his hand) 
        I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
 
                                SHORTIE
        Until then--the dollar forty stays with me. 

                                BRETT
        Is that a nice way to talk to a pal? 

                                SHORTIE
        Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at 
        these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job--
        it's a marathon.

                He moves to door.

                                BRETT
        Oh, Shortie!--
                        (his voice is casual) 
        --there's a girl on this ship--

                                SHORTIE
                        (contemptuously) 
        --there's thousands of 'em!

                                BRETT 
                        (enthusiastically) 
        A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of 
        the rosebush!

                He takes it big.
 
                                SHORTIE
                        (sternly--with a quick look)
        This is a business trip!

                                BRETT
        She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat--
        and carrying a bag with S. M. on it. 
                        (half to himself) 
        Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
                        (He picks up passenger list)

                                SHORTIE
        Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you
        ever think of that?

                                BRETT 
                        (happily) 
        Why didn't I think of that?--I am going to scout 
        around and see if I can find her.

                A stateroom steward knocks and enters quickly. 

                                STEWARD
        Everything in order, sir? 
                        (He sees Shortie and favors 
                        him with an unfriendly look)
        What are you doing here, my lad?

                                SHORTIE
        Telegrams.
   
                                STEWARD
                        (aggressively)
        Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station. 

                Shortie casts a look of despair at Jimmy and 
                commences to exit.
                        
                                BRETT 
        Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something? 

                                SHORTIE
        No, sir?
                       
                                BRETT 
        My change.
                    
                                SHORTIE
        Change? 

                                BRETT 
        A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you. 

                He extends his hand. Shortie favors him with a 
                dirty look, hands him the dollar forty. The steward 
                eyes him grimly and exits. Shortie starts to follow, 
                suddenly gets an idea, and moves quickly to Brett's 
                cabin trunk. He pulls out the top drawer.
 
58              CLOSE SHOT--IT'S CONTENTS
                Gambling paraphernalia, cards, dice, etc.
 
59              CLOSE SHOT--SHORTIE'S HAND
                Takes key and opens his drawer in Brett's trunk. 
                He takes out a pair of dice and rolls them quickly 
                two or three times on top of the trunk. Each time 
                they throw a seven.

                                SHORTIE'S VOICE 
        Not bad--I'll use these to get even.

        Shortie!--you know my motto? 

                                SHORTIE
        Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
 
                                BRETT
        Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep 
        your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice 
        and give me the office.
 
                                SHORTIE
                        (Visibly brightening)

        Boy!

                                SHORTIE
        Yes, ma'am.

                                LADY
        Will you come in and fix my porthole?

                Shortie enters stateroom. CAMERA FOLLOWS him to 
                porthole which he closes quickly. The lady tips him 
                and Shortie starts out.

                                SALLY
        I'm looking for 48.

                                SHORTIE
        Right down there, Miss. 

                He points.

65              MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
                Ned and Denby. Ned is sitting there very worried 
                about Sally because Lother is aboard ship.
 
                                DENBY
                        (speaking) 
        Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the 
        Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the 
        Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."--
        and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will 
        I."--Good?--And then I do the one--
                        (he stops--sees no reaction 
                        from Ned) 
        Oh--you don't like it, eh?

                                NED 
        Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about 
        Sally--

                                DENBY
        Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board? 

                                NED 
        No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--

                The door opens--Sally enters. 

                                SALLY
                        (gaily) 
        Am I a member of this club?

                (forcing a laugh) 
        You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just 
        telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--

                                SALLY
        Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first 
        thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from 
        Venus de Milo--
                        (then to Ned) 
        Get out of here.
                        (She pushes him good-naturedly 
                        and he leaves)

                                DENBY
        Everything O.K.?

                                SALLY
        Just what the doctor ordered.

                She glances around the large cabin which has been 
                turned into an office for the Master of Ceremonies. 
                It contains the usual paraphernalia, including
                stacks of music orchestrations, a few theatrical
                photographs, a violin in a case, a portable mike, 
                etc.

                                SALLY
                        (looking around) 
        Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street. 

                                DENBY
        Like it?

                                SALLY
        Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the 
        noises--

                                DENBY
        Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I 
        sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company. 

                                SALLY
        And you've put it over--haven't you?

                                DENBY
        Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know--
        We're doing capacity, Sally--and all Nice people--

                                DENBY
        No--not much--excepting--
                        (looks at her steadily)

                        (glances at her picture on wall) 
        Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, 
        wasn't I, Chad?

                                DENBY 
        No--Inexperienced--
                        (looks at picture) 
        A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was 
        Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet. 

                                SALLY
        I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to 
        do this--

                                DENBY
        Do what--

                        (places her hand on his arm 
                        affectionately) 
        You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' 
        notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know. 

                                DENBY
        News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away 
        from a rat--

                                SALLY
        It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam. 

                                DENBY 
        I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too? 

                                SALLY
                        (nodding) 
        I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was 
        O.K. by me.
                        (She avoids his eye) 
        I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock 
        promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. 
        It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--
                        (her voice lowers) 
        --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the 
        kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass. 

                                DENBY
        I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running 
        around with a racketeer--

                        (With a wan smile) 
        Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I 
        found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee 
        wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am! 

                                DENBY
        Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of 
        months--you'll soon forget all about it.

                Sally looks at him a moment before speaking--her

                Brett looks disappointed, leans against the

                Sitting in wicker chairs, in a quiet part of the palm 
                court. Anya's mood is very gay.  She smiles at 
                Lee. His is very thoughtful--and none too pleasant. 
                The music is playing and passengers are dancing.

        I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there--
        made my plans--I'd have sent for you.

                She smiles disbelievingly. She is in love with Lee 
                and quite contented as long as she's with him. 

                                ANYA

        You're a charming liar. You know, Herbert's too dull to 
        be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly 
        decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--

        nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way

        Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.

        O.K. Heads you win.

                Brett flips coin; it comes heads. A medicine ball 
                comes whizzing through the air striking him 
                squarely on the head. He drops the coin and falls 
                into the arms of McKinney. They both stagger 
                with the impact. Denby picks up the coin that 
                Brett dropped.

        mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of 
        iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--
                        (to McKinney) 
        What is this thing--a racket or a mallet? 

                                MCKINNEY
        Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department 
        of Street Cleaning--

                        (looks toward Brett and Sally 
                        obviously jealous and annoyed) 
        Too bad we're not making a trip around the world--
        maybe we could finish this game.
                        (He then yells to Brett) 
        Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot 
        that last disk!

        Watch this one.
 
                He takes a careful shot. CAMERA FOLLOWS the 
                disk down the deck. It scatters the others and lands 
                dead center in a ring.
           
                                MCKINNEY'S VOICE
                Nice shot!
 
                CAMERA PULLS BACK AND FOCUSES ON McKinney
                and Denby as they start returning the disks from
                their end.

                                MCKINNEY 
        You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the
        way he plays shuffle-board.
                  
                                DENBY
        Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.

                FOLLOW THEIR FIRST SHOT back to Sally and 
                Brett, then PULL BACK TO SEMIWIDE SHOT. During 
                the following dialogue the disks are being shot
                at their feet from the opposite side. Anya come 
                into scene. She smiles sarcastically at Brett as she 
                approaches him.

        Feeling a little better, I see.

                                BRETT
        Yes, yes--the air--
                        (He looks at Sally) 
        --I'm getting plenty of air.

                                SALLY
        How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I
        have a slight earache.
                        (She looks at Brett) 
        --and it's so noisy up here.

        Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise. 
                        (to Brett) 
        Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and 
        cards.

                She crosses to the other side of the deck.

                                BRETT 
        Don't be a c-a-t.

                                SALLY
        You asked me to dine with you tonight. 

                                BRETT 
        Yes? 

                                SALLY 
        Well, I can't.

                                BRETT 
        Don't rub it in.

                                SALLY
        But I'll have cocktails with you. 

                                BRETT 
        When?

                                SALLY

                                SALLY
        Okay.

                                BRETT 
        Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.

                        the direction that Anya left) 
        But I dislike possessive women.
 
                She turns and looks at him--they both grin, then 
                giggle, and end up with a good laugh.

                The steward has just placed the cool drinks in

                McKinney grabs it.

        No! no! You trimmed us. The drinks are on me.

                He hands Shortie the fifty-dollar bill.

                Lother and Summers and Anya react by exchanging 
                glances.

                                ANYA 
        Good afternoon--
 
                                BRETT 
                        (looking at bracelet)
        Glad to see you again.
 
                Brett seats himself next to Anya while Summers 
                and Lother start to pour drinks. 

                                ANYA
                        (sweetly)
        Do you mind if I don't play? I've a beastly headache. 

                She puts her hand on her forehead and Brett gazes 
                longingly at the bracelet on her wrist. 

                                LOTHER 
        But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.

                                ANYA 
                        (rises) 
        I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.
                        (She turns to Brett) 
        Shall I see you tomorrow?

                                BRETT
        I hope so.

                                ANYA 
        That's a date.
                        (She extends her hand) 

                Brett shakes it gently and it is evident that the 
                bracelet fascinates him.
   
                                ANYA
                (to others) 
        You'll excuse me.
                        (She exits) 

                                SUMMERS 
        Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that 
        game.
 
                                BRETT
                        (timidly)
        If you gentlemen play a heavy game, perhaps you'd better 
        count me out.
 
                Summers and Lother exchange disappointed glances.
 
                                BRETT 
                        (smiling apologetically) 
        I never play higher than--say a $200 limit.
 
                Lother and Summers are obviously delighted. 

                                LOTHER 
                        (apologetically) 
        We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing
        with cash? 

                                BRETT
        Not at all.
 
                It is difficult for Lother and Summers to conceal
                their glee as they pull their chairs up to the table. 
                The cards are shuffled by Summers. He places 
                them in front of Lother for the cut. Lother cuts 
                the cards and Summers deals them.

                                        LAP DISSOLVE:
 
115             MEDIUM CLOSE--BRETT 

                                BRETT
        I'll bet a couple of hundred--
                        (glances toward door)
        I wonder what's keeping that boy. 

                                SUMMERS
                        (magnanimously)
        Don't worry about that.
                        (He throws in a couple hundred) 
        We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I 
        come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What 
        have you got?
 
                                BRETT
                        (showing his hand)
        Three Jacks.
    
                                SUMMERS 
                        (good-naturedly) 
        That beats two Pairs. I'm glad I didn't win the first pot. 
        Take the money, Mr. Brett. 

                Brett scoops in the stakes. 

                                BRETT
        Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
 
                                LOTHER 
        If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
                        (takes the cards and starts to deal) 

                                SUMMERS 
        Well, as I said before, I don't like to win the first pot. 
        Out my way in Montana we're very superstitious--we 
        always say a good beginning is a bad ending. 
                        (He addresses Brett and laughs) 
        I hope that won't apply to you.

                Shortie comes into scene with thirty one-dollar bills 
                and two ten's rolled up in such a manner that it 
                looks like twenty million. 

                                SHORTIE
        Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett. 

                                BRETT 
                        (takes it) 
        Thank you.
                        (he peels a ten dollar bill from 
                        the top of the roll) 
        I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change. 

                                SHORTIE
        Thank you, sir.
                        (He exits)
  
                                BRETT
        I'll take one.
                        (Lother deals him a card)
       
                                SUMMERS
        One will be enough for me. 

                Lother deals him one.

                                LOTHER 
        I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
                        (He takes three) 

                                BRETT 
        I'll bet a couple of hundred.
                   
                                SUMMERS
        Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff.
                        (He throws two hundred into the pot)

                                LOTHER
        Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you. 

                                BRETT 
                        (Showing his hand) 
        Aces full.
 
                                LOTHER
        And me coming in with two pair--
                        (Sighs)
                     
                                SUMMERS
        I thought my straight was O.K., but--
                        (Sighs) 

                Brett scoops in the money. Lother's hand goes to 
                his ear for the high sign to Summers.

                                SUMMERS
                        (to Brett) 
        It's your deal.

                                BRETT 
        It's a pleasure.    

                As he starts to deal the cards there is a knock on
                the door.
                   
                                LOTHER 
        Come in!
 
                Shortie enters.

                                SHORTIE
        Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message 
        for you.
 
                                BRETT 
                        (shuffling cards)
        What is it?

                                SHORTIE
        Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you
        right away.
 
                                BRETT 
                        (much concerned)
        Oh, is she? What a shame!
                        (He rises, puts the money in his pocket)
        You'll pardon me?
 
                                LOTHER 
                        (quickly)
        You're coming back--

                                BRETT
        That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me,
        gentlemen?

                He leaves followed by Shortie. The two men rise 
                slowly and look at each other and then toward the
                door.
 
                                LOTHER 
                        (to Summers)
        How much did you lose?

                                SUMMERS
        About twelve hundred.

                                LOTHER 
        I went for four.

                                SUMMERS 
        It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later. 

                They exit.

                                BRETT

                He tosses a bill on the counter.

        If there's any change, keep it.

                Sally smiles sweetly and buries her face in the

                her and she doesn't notice that he is evidently

                He closes the door quickly. He smiles. She 
                stands staring at him speechless. There is a pause.

        It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me 
        --I'd have found you--no matter where you were. 

                                SALLY
                (her voice staccato) 
        Why don't you leave me alone? 

                                LOTHER
                        (He moves close to her) 
        Because I want you--will always want you--no other 
        woman'll ever take your place.
                        (His voice is tense with emotion) 
        I want you more now than I did that first night--
                        (He puts his arms around her--
                        she tries to push him away) 
        You've forgotten all that, I suppose? 

                                SALLY
        I wish I could.

                                LOTHER
        Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story. 

                Sally wrenches herself free. Her voice is tense with 
                emotion.

                                SALLY
        You get wise to yourself! If you know what's good for 
        you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one 
        mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too 
        rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get 
        that!--And what're you going to do about it? 

                                LOTHER
        That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire. 
                        (casually, lighting a cigarette) 
        How about Ned?
 
                                SALLY 
        He's all right.

                                LOTHER 
        Thanks to me.

                                SALLY
        You leave the kid alone.

                                LOTHER 
        A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints 
        and--

                                SALLY 
        --you'd go with him!
                   
                                LOTHER
        Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there. 

                He picks up the passenger list.

                                LOTHER 
        Of course not--
                        (politely) 
        --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth 
        precinct--where they made the squawk?

                        (trying to be polite) 
        I'm sorry, Mr. Campbell, but I'm waiting for someone. 
        I'd appreciate it if you'd--

                At this point Mary enters; sees Dan.
 
                Mary enters scene on way to rehearsal, with paper 
                in her hand.

                                MARY 
        Oh, there you are--

                                DAN
        That's right--you're the one I was looking for. 
                        (to Brett) 
        You'll excuse me.
                        (Brett reacts relief) 
                        (back to Mary)
        How about you and I being alone? 

                                MARY
        Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? 
        You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I? 

                                DAN 
        Let me see now--Don't tell me-- 
                        (trying to figure out) 
        You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I 
        don't get it.

                                MARY 
        Never mind.
 
                She continues reading. Denby enters and sees 
                Mary.
                  
                                DENBY
        H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this 
        show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?--
        And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll 
        get it!

                                MARY 
        Oh, all right--
                        (to Dan) 
        See you later, Toots.


                                DAN
        Nobody is any help to me at ail. 

                Mary exits followed by Dan. 

                                BRETT 
        Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
                  
                                DENBY
        No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you 
        might know where she is--
 
                                BRETT
        She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She 
        ought to be here any minute.

                                DENBY
        I would--but our rehearsal starts right away. 
                        (starts to leave) 
        Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an 
        important part of my show. Some day--not now--when 
        you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll 
        appreciate it.

                Brett reacts with a grin, as Denby exits toward 
                rehearsal room.

                                DENBY
        Seen Sally?

                                NED
        She went over to the ship's photographers.

127             LOTHER'S CABIN
                Sally is sitting on the lounge, Lother next to her. 
                The fight seems to have gone out of her and she 
                looks desperately unhappy. 

                                SALLY
        I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it. 
                        (She looks at him) 
        What do you want me to do?

                                LOTHER
        Just smile again and be reasonable. 
                        (his voice cajoling)
        I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old
        times.

                                SALLY
        --and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll
        never come near either of us again? 

                                LOTHER 
        That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, 
        Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking 
        about you--
 
                He puts his arm around her--tries to draw her 
                to him.

                                SALLY
        Don't, Lee--that's dead.
 
                                LOTHER 
                        (grabbing her)
        Let's see if I can bring it back to life.

                Hungrily his lips meet hers. She tries to struggle 
                but his arms are tight about her. He bends her 
                back across the lounge, his lips still to hers. Slowly 
                her resistance ceases. Her arms drop limp. He 
                kisses her eyes, her throat, then back to her lips. 
                She remains inanimate. Suddenly he lets her go 
                and stands towering over her in a fury. 

                                LOTHER
        So it's as cold as that, is it?

                It opens quickly and Anya, enters. Behind her 
                stands Summers. She takes in the situation. An 
                ironical little smile plays about the corner of her 
                mouth. Summers, behind her, is signaling to Lother 
                that he couldn't help it. They enter the room.

        This is Miss Marsh.

                                ANYA
        Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be 
        turning up in the most unusual circumstances. 
                        (solicitously) 
        What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling 
        well? 

                There is a long, awkward pause.

        I'll join you later.

                                ANYA
        And do bring Miss Marsh--
                        (She surveys the disheveled Sally)

                        (jumping to her feet) 
        You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you

                                ANYA
                (ironically) 
        Sorry I can't return the compliment. 

                                SALLY
        You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my
        apartment one evening--
                        (She points to Lother) 
        --and he was gentleman enough to boast why you'd been 
        there and show me a snapshot of you.

                                ANYA
        I don't understand.

        Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with

        What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage 
        with you?

        Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. 
        I just ran into her by accident.

                        (sweetly)

                                LOTHER 
        You mind your own business! She's an old friend of 
        mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?

        And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless 
        to Herbert.
                        (She smiles sweetly) 
        Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At 
        least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something 
        pretty low down in me--because I like you.

                        blazing) 
        I adore you--you gorilla!
 
                She slaps his face none too gently. 

                                LOTHER
        And I'm nuts about you--
                        (He pinches her face roughly)
        --beautiful!

                He returns her slap in the face playfully--but with 
                interest.
 
                                ANYA
                        (breathlessly)
        I couldn't live without you!
 
                Again she hits him across the face but this time 
                with all her force. Before he can retaliate she has 
                again fastened her lips to his. We see his clenched 
                fist in the air hesitate a moment then relax. His 
                arms go about her--he crushes her to him.

                                        CUT TO:
 
133             BRETT AND MARY--LOUNGE
                Brett is very nervous and impatient. He paces 
                back and forth.

                                MARY 
        Why don't you answer my question? 

                                BRETT
                        (impatiently) 
        I didn't even hear it.

                                MARY
        Then I'll repeat it.
 
                Brett continues pacing to and fro. 

                                MARY
        If spinach makes iron, what makes a boat rock?

                                BRETT
                        (uninterested) 
        Who cares?
  
                                MARY
                        (laughing) 
        I'll have to tell that to Denby. He'll use it on the radio. 

                Denby passes by door and hears remark. 

                                DENBY
                        (sticking head in door) 
        I don't know what it is, but I won't use it. 
                        (then to Brett) 
        Is she entertaining you?

                                BRETT
        I should say not.

                                DENBY 
        Good!
                        (then to Mary) 
        At last you're making yourself useful. So long! 

                Denby leaves. A steward enters. 

                                STEWARD 
        No, sir--she's not on the upper deck either. 

                                BRETT
                (handing him a bill) 
        Thank you.
                        (to Mary) 
        You'll excuse me, please--

                He walks away toward dining room.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:
 
134             MEDIUM CLOSE 
                As Brett exits from scene with Mary, he sees Sally, 
                who is walking dejectedly.

                                BRETT
                        (calling)
        Oh, Sally!

                                SALLY
                        (enters apologizing)
        I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened. 

                                BRETT 
        You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody 
        except me for the rest of the voyage. 

                                SALLY
        I must say you're persistent--
                        (pleased) 
        --it's kind of flattering.
 
                Occasionally a passenger passes them but the deck 
                is more or less deserted.
   
                                BRETT 
                        (studying her) 
        You're unhappy about something, aren't you? 

                She hesitates before replying. 

                                SALLY
        A little.

                                BRETT 
        Sorry.

                                SALLY
        Thanks.

                                BRETT 
        Anything I can do?
                        (She shakes her head) 
        I'd jump overboard if it'd help you. 

                She puts her hand over his and pats it. 

                                SALLY
        Mighty decent of you, pal.
                    
                                BRETT 
        Decent?
                (His expression hardens) 
        I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested. 

                They stop near lifeboat (PROCESS SHOT).

                                SALLY 
                        (suddenly)
        What are you thinking?

                                BRETT 
        A lot of things I'd like to forget. 

                                SALLY
        That's funny--so was I.
                        (another pause) 
        Guess the ocean makes one sentimental

                                BRETT
        I can't blame the ocean--it's you. 

                                SALLY 
        You don't know anything about me. If you did, you
        probably wouldn't be here.

                He leans toward her--their heads are very close
                together.

                                BRETT 
        Can you keep a secret? 
                        (She nods) 
        You're the first girl I ever met I wanted to build a fence
        around.
 
                She looks at him steadily. 

                                SALLY
        Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it. 

                                BRETT
        For once I'm dead on the level--
                        (He lowers his voice) 
        --crazy about you!

                                SALLY
        Will you take some advice?
                        (He nods) 
        If you're looking for romance--count me out--
                        (as an afterthought) 
        --if you know what's good for you. 

                                BRETT
        But--

                                SALLY
        --I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school
        girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon. 
                        (She starts to rise) 
        Guess I'll be going.
 
                                BRETT
                        (detaining her)
        Sally--!

                                SALLY
        Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too 
        ... and I don't want to get involved. 

                                BRETT 
                        (eagerly) 
        You mean that?

                                SALLY
        Don't let's talk about it.
 
                                BRETT 
                        (gaily)
        You said it! How about a little action?
 
                He leans over and kisses her. For a moment she 
                resists him, then her arms go around his neck. 

                                VOICE 
        Sandwiches?
 
                As they look up, Sally breaks away from him and 
                runs out of scene, leaving him.

                                        CUT TO:
 
135             REVERSE ANGLE
                Two stewards--one carrying a tray of sandwiches, 
                the other, a tray of bouillon--are standing before 
                him. Brett is oblivious of their presence. The 
                steward places a cup of bouillon and a sandwich in 
                his hand. 

                They exit.
 
                He comes out of his daze--notices the food in his 
                hand and places it on rail by lifeboat.

                                        PAN TO:
 
136             CLOSE SHOT OF LIFEBOAT
                From the canvas covering of the lifeboat a head 
                slowly appears. It is Ballinger (the man we saw 
                drop the cop's uniform). He is gaunt and haggard. 
                He looks around furtively. For a moment he looks 
                down--sees the sandwich--reaches for it--brings 
                it back into the lifeboat--and disappears.

                The music is playing--a few couples are dancing--
                other people are being seated--stewards are looking 
                in through windows.

                In doorway--Brett is standing near by--Summers
                sees Brett.
 
                                SUMMERS 
                        (looking toward Brett)

                Lother, Anya, and Summers walk over to Brett.

                                BRETT

        How about a little game later? 

                                BRETT
        Fine--I'll be glad to.

140             MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT--BRETT AND ANYA
                Anya is wearing a thin bracelet (quite unlike the 
                one she had been wearing in previous scenes). Brett 
                notices this.

141             MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT--BRETT
                He reacts when he sees the bracelet as if an idea 
                has just struck him.
 
                                BRETT
                        (to Anya)
        Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
 
                                ANYA 
        We'll save you a place at our table. 

                                BRETT 
        Thanks.
      
                He exits.

                He is standing by the window and sees Brett leaving.

        The ice is in the storage.
 
                CAMERA FOLLOWS Brett and Shortie to Anya's
                stateroom, where they stop.
 
143             MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT--OUTSIDE ANYA'S STATEROOM DOOR.
                Brett is glancing up and down corridor furtively. 

                                BRETT
        Keep a lookout, Shortie--

                Brett takes a bunch of keys from his pocket--he 
                inserts a key in the door and goes in.

146             MCKINNEY--MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
                He sticks his head out of stateroom door--he is in 
                evening dress with dress tie untied--he calls to 
                Shortie.
             
                                MCKINNEY
        Oh, boy!

147             CLOSE-UP--SHORTIE
                He turns toward McKinney and reacts nervously. 

                                SHORTIE 
                        (timidly)
        Yes, sir.
 
                He goes to McKinney. McKinney takes him by the 
                arm without saying a word, and takes him into his 
                room. Shortie is obviously scared to death. McKinney, 
                slightly embarrassed, speaks softly. 

                                MCKINNEY
        Can you tie a bow tie?
 
                                SHORTIE
                        (trembling)
        Yes, sir--

                He starts fumbling with tie, and ties it very badly.

148             MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT--BRETT
                He has the bracelet which he puts in his pocket and 
                starts to exit to exterior of room. Outside he looks 
                for Shortie.

        What's your hurry, young feller?
 
                Brett turns. He stops and smiles. By this time 
                McKinney has reached Brett's side.

                                BRETT

                business for this number as worked out by Larry 
                Ceballos.) Parker sings one verse and chorus and 
                starts to sing a second chorus, but is interrupted 
                by Denby's voice.

                                DENBY'S VOICE 
        Wait a minute--

                                        CUT TO: 

152             MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT--DENBY 
                He is carrying a baby spotlight--he stops the 
                orchestra--
 
                                DENBY 
                        (to orchestra)
        That's enough, boys--
                        (then to Parker) 
        That was fine, Frank--you've already sung a verse and 
        chorus, and everybody enjoyed it--I hope--Now I have 
        a good idea--sit down, Frank, Mary, Jean. 

                The trio sits down.

                                DENBY 
        Here's the idea--we're going to reverse things around 
        here--you've entertained the audience, and now for a 
        change they're going to entertain you--
                        (He turns to audience) 
        aren't we?--I'll sing the chorus up until I get to the 
        words, "Oh, Leo," then I'll put the spotlight on some 
        lady or gentleman, and whoever the lucky one might be, 
        he or she will then sing the words, "Oh, Leo--Oh Leo--
        Oh Leo--Oh--" 

                Denby sings the best he can, which is bad enough. 

                                DENBY
        We'll try it once--
                        (He addresses the orchestra)
        Play, boys!
 
                The orchestra plays. Denby sings until he reaches 
                "Oh Leo," then puts the spotlight on someone in 
                the audience, and we 

                                        CUT TO: 

153             CLOSE-UP--THAT SOMEONE 
                (Note: We continue this routine, in which we 
                utilize all principals as well as outsiders.)  The
                number concludes with entire audience singing song 
                enthusiastically.

154             MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT--PARKER, LIVINGSTON, AND 
                SARGENT
                They are applauding the audience.

                                        CUT TO: 

155             CLOSE-UP--DENBY
                He also is applauding the audience--he is laughing 
                and having a good time--he addresses the passengers.

                                DENBY
        That was fine, folks--now we'll try it again. 

                Mary walks into scene and interrupts him. 

                                MARY 
        Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?

                                DENBY
        Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--

                Mary, Parker, and Sargent take him by the arm 
                and start to lead him off stage--as they do so he 
                announces the next act while walking toward the 
                wings.
                  
                                DENBY
        The next act will be Sally Marsh and her troupe of
        trained adagio dancers.
 
                Denby exits with trio--orchestra starts introduction 
                of It Was Sweet of You.

                The curtains part and Sally Marsh and Frank 
                Parker appear.

157             CLOSE SHOT--TABLE IN AUDITORIUM
                Brett, Lother, Summers, Anya, and McKinney are 
                seated around it--Frank Parker's voice comes over 
                this scene. Anya is sitting between Brett and 
                Lother--Brett is looking toward stage and beaming 
                with pride as he looks at Sally.

                                        CUT TO:
 
158             MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT--BACKSTAGE IN WINGS
                Ned and Denby--Parker is still singing--

                                DENBY
        Does she know Lother's aboard yet? 

                                NED 
        No--but I'm going to tell her as soon as the act's 
        finished.

                                        CUT BACK TO: 

159             MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT--TABLE IN AUDITORIUM
                Where Anya, Lother, Brett, Summers, McKinney 
                are sitting.
 
                                BRETT
                        (to Anya)
        Isn't she lovely?

                                ANYA
        Yes--and very popular--
                        (She glances meaningly at Lother) 

                Lother responds to the glance with a faint smile--
                by this time Parker has finished the song.

160             CLOSE SHOT--STAGE
                Where we see Sally quickly removing her dress and 
                throwing it off stage--she is underdressed in her 
                adagio dance costume. Ned and Hans enter for 
                Adagio routine (Note: This will be staged by 
                Larry Ceballos.) During the dance, the following 
                dialogue is cut into the routine while dancing. 

                                NED 
        What's the matter, Sally?--you're shaking. 

                                SALLY
        I'm all right.
   
                                NED
                        (anxiously) 
        You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you? 

                                SALLY
        I was in his cabin--
                   
                                NED
        What!--are you crazy?
                 
                                SALLY 
        I'll explain later--
 
                                NED
        If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--

                They continue at a faster tempo which interrupts 
                their dialogue. The music works up to a gradual 
                increase in tempo for a whirlwind finish. (Note: 
                This is to be determined by Ceballos.)

                There is a perceptible rocking of the boat--individual

                Where Brett, Summers, Anya, Lother, and McKinney 
                are seated--dishes are now on the table, 
                napkins, etc.

        Now that the entertainment is over, how about a little
        game of cards?

        No, thanks--I never gambled in my life. 

                                SUMMERS
                (laughing) 
        You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing

                (rising) 
        I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- 
        see you later.
 
                Anya leaves. Lother rises--he addresses the group. 

                                LOTHER
        Excuse me, gentlemen--I'll see you at the card game--

164             MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT--HERBERT ROSSON
                In second-class buffet with three other men--they 
                are seated at the table with drinks in front of
                them.
        
                                FIRST PASSENGER
                        (smiling)
        All right--if you must know the truth--I'm going to 
        Carlsbad for my health.
 
                                SECOND PASSENGER 
                        (a Frenchman)
        And, gentlemen--I'm going home, because my wife is 
        going to have a baby.
      
                                THIRD PASSENGER 
                        (embarrassed--speaks softly) 
        I'm on my honeymoon--

                                FIRST PASSENGER
                        (turns to Rosson)

                        glass down quietly, and 
                        earnestly says) 
        I'm going to kill a man.

                She is very nervous and excited--she addresses the 
                purser.

                                ANYA
        A very valuable bracelet of mine's been stolen!

        Where did you have it last?

                                ANYA
        In my cabin. I didn't wear it this evening--when I went 
        downstairs just now, I found the lock of my jewel box 
        broken open.

                By this time McKinney and Summers come up. 

                                ANYA
                        (excitedly as she addresses them) 
        A bracelet's been stolen from my cabin! 

                                MCKINNEY
        Where is your cabin?

                His eyes shift furtively from left to right, 
                ascertaining that he is not being watched by anyone. He 
                nods his head in the affirmative to Brett.

170             CLOSE SHOT--BRETT'S HAND UNDER TABLE
                He takes bracelet from his pocket, wraps it up in 
                a napkin and puts it on the table.

171             MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT--SHORTIE
                He leaves the window--picks up a tray from a 
                table near by and starts toward Brett's table. 
                TRUCK WITH HIM UP to table, as he starts to
                clear the dishes and pile them on to the tray, also 
                taking napkins. A waiter enters and puts a halt to 
                Shortie's activities.

                                WAITER
        This is my job--you've got no business in here--

                He takes the tray with the piled dishes, including 
                the napkin which envelops the bracelet from 
                Shortie, and starts sway.
 
171A            CAMERA PANS WITH SHORTIE AS HE FOLLOWS
                WAITER, who goes to chute where dirty linen is de-
                posited. He lays the tray down and takes one of 
                the five napkins on the tray and throws it down the 
                chute,--he repeats this operation with two more 
                napkins. Shortie almost faints--he takes a napkin 
                from the tray and feels the weight of it quickly--
                satisfied that it contains nothing, he throws it 
                down the chute and grabs the only remaining napkin 
                off the tray. He readily realizes that this contains 
                the bracelet and jams it quickly into his pocket and 
                exits.

        This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get 
        away with it on a ship--

        Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard 
        ships--

                                BRETT 
        It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving 
        this, Inspector--
                 
                                MCKINNEY 
        Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--

                (to Anya) 
        If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--
                        (Brett takes cigarette) 
        Bet I could find that bracelet--
   
                                MCKINNEY
                (strikes a match) 
        I wouldn't be surprised--

                The two men look at each other. 


                                PURSER
        Mrs. Rosson, was the bracelet insured? 

                                ANYA 
        Yes--for $10,000--

                                PURSER
        If you'll give me the details in the morning, we'll notify 
        the insurance company--and rest assured if it's on the
        boat we'll locate it--

                Purser exits.
 
                                BRETT 
                        (to Anya)
        I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--
                        (to McKinney) 
        How about a nightcap, Inspector?

        No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then
        turn in--

                                BRETT
        Good night!
 
                Brett exits. 

                                ANYA
                        (to McKinney)
        He's a nice boy--
                   
                                MCKINNEY
        Yes--he's very naïve--

                He exits as Summers enters. 

                                SUMMERS 
        Did you find it?
                  
                                ANYA
        No!--Did you take that bracelet?
                        
                                SUMMERS 
        No-o!

                                ANYA 
        Where's Lother?

173             MEDIUM SHOT--SALLY'S DRESSING ROOM
                She is still in her adagio costume. Lother is present. 

                                SALLY
                (to Lother) 
        Do you mind getting out of here now--I want to 
        change--

                                LOTHER 
        Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--

                                SALLY
        I've lost my taste for knickknacks--

                                LOTHER
        Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you--
        you need me more than I need you--have you figured
        they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
                     
                                SALLY
        Have you ever figured they might extradite you? 

                                LOTHER 
        I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--

                There's a knock at the door. Sally goes quickly to
                it and half opens it--Brett is in the companionway
                --from his position he is unable to see Lother. 

                                BRETT
        Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me? 

                                SALLY
                (anxious to escape from Lother) 
        Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
                        (She grabs a cloak and goes out)

        This time I'm really glad you showed up. 

                                BRETT
        Lonesome?
                    
                                SALLY
        We'll let it go at that--

                They exit from companionway.

                DRESSING ROOM
                Ned meets Lother coming out of Sally's cabin--
                he stops momentarily--then rushes into Sally's 
                cabin--he sees that Sally is not there--he comes 
                out quickly--
          
                                NED
                (grabbing Lother by the arm) 
        What are you doing around here? 

                                LOTHER 
                        (very calmly) 
        Take it easy--you'll last longer--

                Ned goes after Lother with a clenched fist. 

                                NED 
        Why don't you leave Sally alone--you dirty--
 
                Lother is too quick for Ned and hits him a terrific 
                punch on the jaw, knocking him down. Lother then 
                exits. Denby enters scene--he goes to Ned and 
                helps him to his feet.

                                DENBY
                (alarmed)
        What happened to you?

                                NED
        You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me
        have it?

                                DENBY
        What for?

                                NED
        Don't ask any questions--just give it to me. 

                                DENBY
                        (trying to quiet him) 
        Easy kid--easy....
                        (puts his hand on Ned's shoulder) 
        Come on--I want to talk to you.

                He takes Ned by his arm and leads him away.

                        (looking at moon)
        That's a beautiful moon, Sally? 

                                SALLY
                        (smiles sweetly)

                                BRETT 
                        (very seriously)
        Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--

                                SALLY
        What?--

                                BRETT
        I think we'll live in Europe after we're married? 

                                SALLY
                (is speechless for a moment, 
                        then laughs) 
        I didn't know we were going to be married.
  
                                BRETT
        You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--

                                SALLY
        You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine
        would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd 
        give me an engagement ring--

                                BRETT
        I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones 
        set--what do you think?

                                SALLY
        I think we ought to walk.

                They walk out of scene.
 
177             CAMERA PULLS BACK ON DECK--MEDIUM LONG SHOT
                McKinney is walking along deck. He sees Sally and 
                Brett--an idea has struck him--he immediately 
                turns and goes the other way.

                He sees McKinney suddenly, and reacts with a 
                start--he then continues staggering down deck, 
                singing, "Oh, Leo, Oh, Leo." He stops abruptly, 
                and a frightened look replaces his happy smile.

183             DECK
                Where Brett and Sally are sauntering along, and
                are met by McKinney.

                                BRETT
                (to McKinney) 
        Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector. 

                                MCKINNEY 
        Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
                        (inviting them both)
                     
                                SALLY
        It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I
        think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
 
                                MCKINNEY
        Good night!
 
                                BRETT
                        (softly)
        Good night, Mrs. Brett!

        Good night, idiot!

        How about you?

                                BRETT
        No, thanks. I've promised to play cards. 

                                MCKINNEY
        You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card
        game I'd go to the Purser's office. 

                                BRETT 
        Why?

                                MCKINNEY
        Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you 
        in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even 
        the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched.
        Get me?

                                BRETT
        Sure, I'll go.
 
                                MCKINNEY
        I'll go with you. 

                                BRETT
        Swell!

        Well, you insist--

                He runs his hands through Brett's pockets. 

                                MCKINNEY
                (laughing) 
        It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice. 

                                BRETT 
                        (smiling) 
        How about trying your fine Italian hand?

                                MCKINNEY
        This has nothing to do with me--
                        (He moves to Brett) 
        But always remember, Purser, when you're searching 
        anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--
                        (He suits the action to the words) 
        --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then--
        back of the collar--here--that used to be a favorite 
        trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside 
        of the shoe--like this.

                                BRETT 
        Hey!--you're tickling me.
       
                                MCKINNEY
                (ignoring the interruption) 
        Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs--
        like this--in case they got what you're looking for 
        attached to a string.
                        (He stands off and surveys 
                        Brett, slightly disappointed) 
        See what I mean, Purser?
                        
                                PURSER 
        Very interesting.
 
                                BRETT
                        (good-naturedly)
        Well, I guess that's all--good night!

                He flips them a salute and goes nonchalantly out.

                                PURSER 
        He's certainly good-natured.
                 
                                MCKINNEY 
        "Smooth's" the word.
                    
                                PURSER
        I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you 
        searched them like that.
 
                                MCKINNEY 
                        (casually)
        It all depends on what you're used to.
 
                McKinney suddenly bangs his fist on the desk. 

                                MCKINNEY
        Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook! 

                                PURSER
        What's the matter?
                 
                                MCKINNEY
        Nothin--
                        (He pulls out his billfold and grins) 
        --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me 
        fifty bucks.

        This is the first chance I've had to get away to tell you 
        --McKinney was snooping around in this cabin last 
        night.
 
                                BRETT
                (smiling)
        It's O.K., Shortie--it's still there. Better bring it in. 

                Shortie goes to porthole and puts his head through 
                window.

        See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
 
                As Brett exits, Shortie takes bracelet and puts it 
                in his shoe.

                TRUCK AHEAD OF BRETT until we reach cigar and
                news stand. At the news stand buying books is 
                McKinney. He has two books in his hand, making 
                a decision on which one to buy. He looks up as he 
                hears Brett speak.
                    
                                BRETT
        Large package of Luckies--Good morning, Inspector! 

                                MCKINNEY
        Hello, young fellow!

                                BRETT
        Coming to the pool for a swim?

                                MCKINNEY
        Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading. 
                        (to the store attendant as he 
                        hands him the money) 
        I'll take this one.
 
                He puts a copy of Monte Cristo under his arm and 
                drops the other book in front of Brett. As Brett 
                looks at its title,

                He looks up from the book to the retreating 
                McKinney, smiles, takes his cigarettes and commences 
                to move out of scene.

                McKinney exits from cigar stand to where Chad 
                Denby has been watching. Denby greets him with--

                                DENBY
        Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. 
        Somebody lost a bracelet.
                 
                                MCKINNEY
        Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation. 

                                DENBY
        I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By 
        the way--what do you know about him? 

                                MCKINNEY
        Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your
        mind?

                                DENBY
        Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him. 

                                MCKINNEY 
        Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago--
        but could never pin anything on him. 

                                DENBY
        Maybe he just travels in bad company. 

                                MCKINNEY
        Yeah--

                He exits.

191             BRETT AND ANYA IN THE POOL AT THE SHALLOW END.
                It is crowded with many beautiful girls in colorful 
                bathing suits. People are diving in and out of the
                water--huge colored balls are being thrown--the 
                usual hilarity of a crowded pool. 

                                BRETT 
                        (anxiously) 
        Tell me--did you find your bracelet? 

                                ANYA
        No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about
        it--
         
                                BRETT
                        (with an ingratiating smile) 
        Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming 
        lesson I promised you?

                By now they are just about up to their waists in 
                water. He starts to teach her to swim--his hand 
                is under her chin.

                                BRETT
        Strike out harder with your feet--now exhale as your 
        arms go back.
 
                He holds Anya up as she strikes out.

                She has just arrived. She throws off her wrap and 
                she looks very fetching in her bathing suit. She 
                sees Brett smile and waves.

                He has just seen her--forgets Anya and goes 
                quickly toward Sally. Anya, without his support, 
                promptly sinks. He goes back, stands her on her 
                feet, mumbles an apology, and swims quickly 
                toward the other end of the pool.

                        (casually) 
        Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with 
        her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker 
        instead.

        Who with?

                                BRETT
        A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother. 

                                SALLY
        Oh, you infant! How much did you lose? 

                                BRETT 
        Lose?--I won a little--
                    
                                SALLY
        That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with 
        them again--

                                BRETT 
                        (quickly) 
        What do you know about them? 

                                SALLY 
        Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--
                        (She looks him straight in the eye) 
        I used to be Lee Lother's girl--

                                BRETT
        You can live that down, can't you?
                     
                                SALLY
        He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part 
        of the racket--helped him!
                (She throws her head back 
                        and looks at him)
        Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse 
        you!
 
                She dives off edge of pool and Brett swims after 
                her.

                Hidden from Shortie's view by a locker, is another

                bracelet, looks surprised, and takes a step forward.

                the bar for a drink.
 
201             SHORTIE RUSHING DOWN STEPS FROM "A" DECK--
                Closely pursued by steward. He throws a terrified 
                glance over his shoulder. The steward is shouting 
                at him to stop. At the bottom of the steps is the 
                quartermaster.

                He rushes through the crowd to the edge of

                There are several young ladies (probably six or

                athletic shorts and blouses or in the dresses they 
                would ordinarily wear on board ship. They are all 
                lined up at the starting line, ready for a "Horse 
                Race." Each of the girls has a boy (or man) for 
                a partner. The idea is this:

                The men place their hands on the deck and the 
                ladies take hold of their feet, while the men move 
                forward being partially pushed by the ladies 
                wheelbarrow fashion. All principals are participants

228             HERBERT ROSSON'S CABIN
                Jealousy has driven him to despair. He is the victim 
                of his own imagination. A half-empty whisky 
                bottle and glass are close at hand. The clock on 
                the dressing table discloses the time--11:30. Rosson 
                is a very different individual from the quiet 
                businessman we met on the dock. He goes to his 
                valise, takes out a revolver, loads it carefully, and 
                starts to leave cabin.

                Denby's voice and the applause of the audience 
                can be heard.

                Sally runs through MEDIUM SHOT of Lother. He 
                sees her and calls.

                has run into a dense fog. Throughout the following 
                scene the screaming of the siren is 
                heard intermittently. Sally is seated facing 
                McKinney, her face drawn after a sleepless 
                night. McKinney also looks tired. He has undone 
                his tie and loosened his collar. Now that 
                he is back in harness he doesn't spare himself. 

                                SALLY
        That's the truth--every single word!

                (He turns to Brett) 
        Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before 
        the shots were fired?
 
                                BRETT
                        (stalling)
        Why, I--

                                DENBY
        Just before the shots! Why, he was with me--backstage 
        --we ran down together when we heard them. 

                Both McKinney and Brett look at him in amazement.

                                        CUT TO:
 
250             LONG SHOT--DOOR BURSTS OPEN
                A steward enters--he is very excited. 

                                STEWARD
                (He is white) 
        The lady in cabin--has been killed! 

                                MCKINNEY 
        Are you sure?--

                This scene is shot so that the door in the 
                background is not in the picture--we hear a 
                voice say--
 
                      VOICE
        That's right, Inspector!--

                CAMERA PANS OVER TO DOORWAY.
 
251             CLOSE-UP--ROSSON 

                                ROSSON 
                        (calmly) 
        She's dead!--I killed Lother too!
 
                As Inspector, Captain, and Officers go to him--
                we--
                                  CUT TO: 

251-A           CLOSE SHOT--DENBY--NED--SALLY
                Denby enters scene where Ned is standing with his 
                arm around Sally.

                                DENBY
        Take her to her cabin--she's all in.

                                                CUT TO:
 
251AA           CLOSE SHOT CORNER OF PURSER'S OFFICE--BRETT 
                AND DENBY--

                                BRETT
        Thanks for establishing an alibi for me. If that guy 
        hadn't confessed I would have been on the grill plenty, 
        and I don't think I could have weathered it. Get me? 
        Any time I can do you a favor don't hesitate to ask for
        it.

                                DENBY
        I won't--I'll ask for one right now.
                        (turns and looks Brett up and down) 
        Sally tells me she's in love with you. 

                                BRETT 
        She did?
  
                                DENBY
                (continuing) 
        Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell 
        you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but 
        that would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about--
        easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd 
        just like to live my life so nothing I did would bounce 
        back and ruin hers--Do I make myself clear?
  
                                BRETT 
                        (soberly)
        Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you. 

                                DENBY
                        (offering his hand)
        O.K., kid--
                        (They shake hands) 
        I'm only sorry for one thing.

                                BRETT 
        What's that?
                   
                                DENBY
        If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard--
                        (Sighs) 

                Brett grins and leaves him.
 
                As he walks away, Shortie comes up to Brett. 

                                SHORTIE 
                        (nervously)
        Hello, Jimmy. What's up?

                                BRETT 
        Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice? 

                                SHORTIE 
                        (nervously)
        Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd 
        hide it.
                    
                                BRETT 
        Where did you hide it?
                     
                                SHORTIE
        On the drunk.
                   
                                BRETT 
        Get it!
 
                Shortie exits.

                                        CUT TO:

251-B           MEDIUM SHOT-DAN-STAGGERING DOWN CORRIDOR.
                Shortie follows him.

        Well, Inspector--now that that's over--you can go 
        back to your vacation.
                 
                                MCKINNEY
        Not quite yet. There's still a loose bracelet floating 
        around here somewhere.
                                    
                                        DISSOLVE TO:
 
252             CLOSE-UP--BRACELET 
                CAMERA DOLLIES BACK TO BRETT AND SALLY
                   
                                BRETT
        There comes a time in every guy's life when he has to 
        stand off and take a look at himself. I've been doing that 
        tonight--and what I saw is pretty phony. 

                He shows her the bracelet. 

                                BRETT 
        Now you know.
                (repeating her words) 
        If you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you. 

                She looks at him for a moment. 

                                MCKINNEY'S VOICE 
        Sorry to intrude.
 
                Brett hastily puts bracelet in his pocket. 

                McKinney comes into scene. 

                                MCKINNEY
        Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. 
        Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got 
        to win that fifty bucks.
                     
                                SALLY
        I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector. 

                                MCKINNEY
        I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll 
        be seeing you.
                                       
                                        CUT TO:
 
253             MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT--BRETT AND SALLY
                    
                                BRETT
        I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the 
        consequences.
 
                                SALLY 
        Jimmy!
 
                His hand goes to his pocket. 

                                BRETT
        Well, I'll be--!!!
 
                        SALLY
        What's the matter?

                They both react seriously and look off down the
                deck.
                                  
                                        CUT TO:

                BACK TO CAMERA is walking down the deck. We
                catch a flash of the bracelet as he tosses it in the
                air.
 
                                BRETT'S VOICE 
        Hey--wait a minute!
 
                Quickly, McKinney slips the bracelet into his 
                pocket. Brett comes into the setup. Silently he 
                takes a roll of money from his pocket, peels off a 
                fifty and hands it to McKinney with a quiet look. 

                                BRETT 
        Here's your fifty.
                 
                                MCKINNEY 
        Thanks. That makes us square.
 
                Sally enters scene. McKinney grins and moves off. 
                CAMERA PANS WITH HIM.
                 
                                MCKINNEY 
        Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. 
        Good-night.

        He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy 
        straight than jug a million.

        This is the Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round program 
        signing off--station W-A-V-E--Chad Denby speaking.

        Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--

                                DENBY
        Good-night, folks.
 

                                THE END
