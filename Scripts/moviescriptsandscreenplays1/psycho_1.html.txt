The Psycho
 
TITLES AND CREDITS
 
Crude white-on-black spray paint.

 
					FADE UP ON:


INT: BEDROOM -- MORNING
 
STRAIGHT-DOWN ANGLE ON the PSYCHO lying in bed staring at 
the ceiling. He is blond, handsome, tall, and muscular. He 
wears black briefs and LOVE is tattooed on his arm. WE HEAR 
the soft ticking of an alarm clock on the bedside table.
 
The alarm goes off. As he sits up and shuts it off, WE SEE 
pills scattered on the table.
 
The room is shabby and disordered. There is a hot plate, a 
few pieces of Goodwill furniture, torn shades without 
curtains. The walls are scrawled with quotations about love 
-- everything from the Beatles (ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE) to 
Robert Browning (O LYRIC LOVE, HALF ANGEL AND HALF BIRD, 
AND ALL A WONDER AND A WILD DESIRE!) WE SEE some of these 
in TILTED, TIGHT SHOTS. On one wall is a giant handmade 
calendar with days Xed out. It's mid-February.
 
The Psycho gets dressed in makeshift combat gear including 
dogtags and spit-polished army boots. Spotting an 
imperceptible fleck of dust on the gleaming toe of a boot, 
he carefully brushes it away.
 
He rips off a strip of bedsheet and ties it around his head.
 
He pulls an aluminum suitcase from under the bed. It is 
fitted with state-of-the-art guns. He tapes an automatic to 
his ankle, conceals a sawed-off twelve-gauge in his jacket, 
stuffs his pockets with ammo, and grabs an assault rifle.
 
The Psycho is ready to start his day.
 

INT: HALLWAY -- MORNING 

While locking the door, the Psycho sees the MILKMAN down 
the hall, a milk carton in each hand. He whips out the 
shotgun and cuts loose. The milk cartons explode as the man 
goes down.
 
The Psycho steps over the body and heads for the street.
 
 
EXT: STREET -- MORNING
 
As he comes down his tenement steps, a pretty black HIGH 
SCHOOL STUDENT skates by, books slung over her shoulder. 
The Psycho squeezes off a burst that sends her crashing 
into the curbside garbage cans, scattering her schoolbooks 
on the sidewalk. The skate wheels spin to a stop.
 
The Psycho strolls past her, eyeing a tall office building 
across the street. He walks toward the entrance.
 

INT: OFFICE BLDG. LOBBY -- DAY 
 
The Psycho crosses the lobby and steps into an empty 
elevator. A LITTLE BOY and GIRL get in after him. The Little 
Girl looks up at him and smiles. He smiles back. The doors 
close and WE SEE the floor indicator rise.
 

INT: TOP FLOOR -- DAY
 
The bell dings as the doors open. The Psycho exits without a 
backward glance. The children lie sprawled on the floor.
 
The Psycho disappears into a stairwell door marked ROOF.
 

EXT: ROOF -- DAY
 
The Psycho takes out a sniper scope and snaps it on the 
rifle. He braces against the building and sights on an 
elderly couple in the park.
 
Through the scope, WE SEE the OLD MAN in the crosshairs 
feeding PIGEONS. The rifle shot startles the pigeons, and 
the Old Man slumps on the bench.
 
The scope swings to sight on the OLD WOMAN.
 
 
EXT: STREET -- DAY
 
TWO COPS are taking a coffee break in the patrol car as the 
second shot rings out.

			MALE COP 
	Let's roll!
 
He peels out as his female Partner hits the siren.


EXT: OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY
 
The cop car skids to a halt, and the Cops race into the 
building. WE HEAR sporadic rifle fire in the distance.
 

INT: LOBBY -- DAY 

The Cops rush into the lobby. A badly shaken SECURITY GUARD 
meets them.
 
			GUARD 
	He's on the roof.
 
			FEMALE COP 
	How do we get up there?
 
			GUARD
		(pointing the way) 
	Take the back stairs.
 

INT: STAIRS -- DAY 

The Cops run up the steps with drawn guns.
 
The sound of random gunfire gets louder. They reach the roof 
and, pressed against the wall, edge open the outside door.
 

EXT: ROOF -- DAY

Encircled by spent cartridges, the Psycho unloads round 
after round on the unsuspecting city below. He doesn't hear 
the Cops sneak up behind him.
 
			MALE COP 
	Freeze! Drop it!
 
The Psycho throws down the rifle.
 
As the Cop moves in to cuff him, the Psycho snakes out the 
ankle gun and blows him away. The other Cop fires but 
misses. The Psycho wings her. She tries to make it back to 
the stairs, but he nails her again and she tumbles down the 
steps.
 

INT: LOBBY -- DAY 

The Psycho leaves, ignoring the cringing Guard.
 
 
EXT: OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY 

He passes the abandoned cop car -- doors flung open, cherry 
top whirling.
 
 
EXT: STREET -- DAY 

On his way home, he spies a pair of rabbits frolicking in a 
pet store window. He sprays the window with bullets, 
shattering the glass.
 

EXT: TENEMENT -- DAY 

He wearily mounts the front steps. It's been a long day.


INT: HALLWAY -- DAY 

He steps over the Milkman, careful to avoid the pools of 
milk splattered on the linoleum.
 
 
INT: BEDROOM -- DAY
 
Unlocking the door, the Psycho enters his room, and tosses 
the guns aside. He picks up a can of spray paint and X's 
out the day on the calendar -- February 14.
 
Sweaty, exhausted, he throws himself on the bed. In the 
STRAIGHT-DOWN ANGLE, WE SEE him staring at the ceiling.

 
WE SLOWLY PUSH IN 
On the Psycho.
 
 
He shuts his eyes. Music begins -- a scratchy old version of 
"Funny Valentine."
 

INT: HALLWAY -- DAY 

In a dreamy, drifting HAND-HELD ANGLE, WE SEE the Milkman 
twitch.

 
INT: OFFICE BLDG. STAIRS -- DAY 

WE FLOAT toward the Cop. She jerks alive and tries to stand.
 

EXT: PARK -- DAY 
 
The Elderly Couple start to move.
 
 
INT: BEDROOM -- DAY 

WE PUSH IN TIGHTER on the Psycho.

 
INT: HALLWAY -- DAY 
 
The Milkman gets to his feet. He presses the doorbell of the 
NEIGHBOR'S apartment. She answers -- a saucy woman in her 
forties -- and gives him a big kiss.
 

EXT: STREET -- DAY 
 
A good-looking black HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT in a varsity jacket 
picks up the roller skater's books. A little chagrined, she 
sits on the curb adjusting a skate.
 
			BOY STUDENT
	Are you okay?
 
 			GIRL STUDENT
	I'm fine.
 
He helps her to her feet, still holding the schoolbooks.
 
 			BOY STUDENT
	I'll carry these.
 
 
INT: OFFICE BLDG. LOBBY -- DAY 

The elevator doors open, and the Little Boy and Girl exit 
holding hands.
 

EXT: PARK BENCH -- DAY 

The Old Man gives his companion a hug. She nestles her head 
on his shoulder.
 

EXT: OFFICE BLDG. -- DAY 

The Male Cop reaches under the car seat, pulls out a satin 
heart-shaped box of chocolates, and hands it to his Partner.
 

INT: BEDROOM -- DAY
 
WE PUSH IN TO HEAD SHOT of Psycho. He grins.
 
 
EXT: PET STORE -- DAY
 
Through the unbroken window, WE SEE, in addition to the 
pair of rabbits, dozens and dozens of baby bunnies.
 

INT: BEDROOM -- DAY
 
WE PAN DOWN to the dogtags around Psycho's neck and MOVE IN 
FOR ECU. They read: CUPID.
 
Music ends -- "Each day is Valentine's Day..."
 
					FADE TO 
					BLACK
 




Unproduced screenplay by Michael O'Donoghue 





My Funny Valentine
My funny valentine, sweet, comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart

Your looks are laughable, unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek? Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?

But don't change a hair for me, not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay! Each day is Valentine's Day
