Alone In The Dark - Read the Script! - HTML Format
August 19, 2003 revised draft.  Screenplay by Elan Mastai, Michael Roesch & Peter Scheerer

Edward Carnby, detective of the paranormal, investigates a mystery with clues leading to "Shadow Island" that brings him face to face with bizarre horrors that prove both psychologically disturbing and lethal, as he discovers that evil demons worshiped by an ancient culture called the Abskani are planning on coming back to life in the 21st century to once again take over the world... and only he and a young genius anthropologist with an incredible memory,  Aline Cedrac, stand in their way, at a gateway to hell. Standing in Carnby's way, however, is the impact that a brief encounter with an evil spirit called the Queen had upon his mind, as he slowly finds himself overpowered by the forces of darkness as they eat away at his very sanity...
