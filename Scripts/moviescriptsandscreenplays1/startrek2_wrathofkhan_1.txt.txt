STAR TREK II:  THE WRATH OF KHAN
        MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE (TO BE DESIGNED)
        FADE IN:
1       IN BLACK                                        1
        Absolute quiet.  SOUND bleeds in.  Low Level b.g. NOISES
        of Enterprise bridge, clicking of relays, minor
        electronic effects.  We HEAR as FEMALE VOICE.


                                SAAVIK'S VOICE
                Captain's log.  Stardate eighty-
                one-thirty point three.  Starship
                Enterprise on training mission to
                Gamma Hydra.  Section Fourteen,
                coordinates twenty-two/eighty-seven/
                four.  Approaching Neutral Zone, all
                systems normal and functioning.
        INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE
        As the ANGLE WIDENS, we see the crew at stations; (screens
        and visual displays are in use); COMMANDER SULU at the
        helm, COMMANDER UHURA at the Comm Console, DR. BONES McCOY
        and SPOCK at his post.  The Captain is new - and
        unexpected.  LT. SAAVIK is young and beautiful.  She is
        half Vulcan and half Romulan.  In appearance she is Vulcan
        with pointed ears, but her sin is fair and she has none
        of the expressionless facial immobility of a Vulcan.
                                SULU
                Leaving Section Fourteen for
                Section Fifteen.
                                SAAVIK
                Stand by.  Project parabolic course
                to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
                                SULU
                Aye, Captain.  Course change
                projected.

        The bridge takes another hit - a big one.  In its wake
        there is a second electrical EXPLOSION along the
        communications panel.  Uhura falls from her station.
        Bones rushes to her side amid the smoke and alarms.

        Another hit:   reverberating flashes of spark and flame
        on the bridge.  Spock dies.  Bones comes to him, but
        even as he coughs his way through the smoke, a final hit
        and Bones falls.  The room is smoke filled and a shambles.

        Saavik digests this for a painful moment.  Then, touching

        Spock rises and leaves.  Bones remains on the floor,

        her son, a bright young scientist of twenty.  He is
        good looking and humorous.

                Well, don't have kittens.
                Genesis is going to work.  They'll

        A RUINED SERIES OF MAN-MADE STRUCTURES, half-buried in
        sand.  They look at each other in consternation.  Chekov
        is worried; something about all this is familiar.
        They descend towards the structures, now seen to be the
        wreckage of some sort of space craft.
        They pass but do not notice the FEDERATION LOGO, half
        buried next to their feet.

        They wander as they talk, picking up objects that bespeak
        a fairly sophisticated ad hoc environment: a laboratory
        in one hold, a kitchen; a LARGE SAND TANK filled with
        disgusting CETI EELS.

        on its side in the sand: the walls are not the floor,
        etc.  All in crookedness - like its owner.  On the
        floor, smiling at them (i.e., the wall) is a BABY.
        Tentatively they come over to it, looking around -

        Lethal-looking odd swords on one wall, a bookshelf;

        KING LEAR, THE HOLY BIBLE - and a seat belt dangling
        with the name on it - BOTANY BAY.
        Chekov mouths the words, softly at first, then aloud -

                Welcome aboard, Admiral.  I think
                you know my training crew.  Certainly
                they have come to know you.

        Chekov hesitates, seems to be listening to someone off

                                CHEKOV
                The orders came from Admiral James

                This is completely improper,
                Commander Chekov.  I have no

                I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor.

                That is wise.  In any case, were I
                to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates
                that the needs of the many outweigh

                lifelessness.  It is a process
                whereby the molecular structure is
                reorganized at the sub-atomic level
                into life generating matter of equal
                mass.  Stage One of our experiments
                was conducted in the laboratory.
                Stage Two of the series will be
                attempted in a lifeless underground;
                Stage Three will involve the process

        Rounding a corner, he starts:  A RAT scuttles right

        CAMERA MOVES TOWARD it as the BEAM SOUND continues,
        with irregularity.  The planetoid is ugly and dead.
        The sound frightens us, and climaxes with:

        The BEAM SOUND screeches, then settles into its
        comfortable mode as the FIVE FIGURES FLUCTUATE.  FADE,
        then APPEAR.  They look around in wonder and relief.

        of the model we saw earlier.  They stare, (N.B. FEATURE

        They walk by a group of crates.  It all happens very
        fast:  David leaps out and tackles Kirk, throwing him
        to the ground and landing atop him, a knife at his throat.
        At the same time, Bones and Saavik reach for their
        phasers, but Jedda, already armed, steps out.  He has
        them covered and helpless.

                Phasers down!

        instantly throws herself on him bringing him down as
        Terrell fires, hitting Jedda, who was behind David -
        a killing ray.  Jedda dematerializes.  Carol SCREAMS
        and David reacts with horror and guilt.
        Most importantly, Chekov begins to tremble.  Terrell
        himself is shaken by his reflexive action.  He's in

        Reactions by all - only Kirk and Bones are unsurprised.
        David and Saavik, dazed, fight the urge to do something.
        Chekov is close to a seizure.  Terrell fights
        conflicting mental signals.

        As though tearing off a leach,, Terrell grabs at the
        wrist recorder and flings it tot he ground.  A shockwave
        of pain hits Terrell.  He recovers, trembling and tries
        to obey.  Chekov is shaking badly.  Terrell aims his
        phaser at Kirk.  Chekov slowly raises his phaser and
        aims at Terrell, though his hands are like lead.  We
        THINK Chekov is going to do the right thing.  Then,
        shockingly:  Terrell turns the phaser on himself.
                                KHAN'S VOICE

        Terrell does, blowing himself into oblivion.

        He SCREAMS, horribly, drops his phaser, clutching his
        head.  Bones leaps to his side, pulls an injection
        device from his belt pack, jabs it into Chekov's arm.
        Chekov, almost with a sigh of relief, drops.

        Horror from all.  Kirk picks up a phaser.  As the eel
        clears Chekov, he fires and destroys it.  He shudders,
        then sees the wrist recorder and grabs it.

        In the rocky cavern the transporter beam locks on to the

        As Kirk and the other watch, horrified, Khan beam sup
        the materials.  David tries to reach the torpedo, but

                together?  Were we going to be?
                You had your world and I had mine.
                And I wanted him in mine, not chasing
                through the universe with his father.
        Kirk turns away, overcome.  She watches him.

                Actually, he's a lot like you in
                many ways.  Please.  Tell me what
                you're feeling.
                                KIRK
                There's a man out there I haven't
                seen in fifteen years who's trying
                to kill me.  You show me a son
                that'd be happy to help him.  My son.
                My life that could have been and
                wasn't.  And what am I feeling?
                Old - worn out.
                                CAROL
                Let me show you something that'll
                make you feel young - as when the
                world was new.
        She offers her hand.  After a moment's hesitation,
        Kirk takes her hand and she leads him to the tunnel.

        on their faces as they walk, they run with excitement

        A huge cavern.  Kirk is actually standing at the middle
        of it.  Space extends vastly above and below his point
        of view.  Like Eden, lush growth everywhere, waterfalls,
        and a cobalt of blue sky high, high above where a round orb
        glows sending light and warmth downward.  There is a
        path from where Kirk stands down to the lower level where
        Bones, and the others are waiting and calling to him.
        Mist and haze waft gently across the cavern.

                me what you did?  I would really
                like to know.
        Kirk looks at Bones, who smiles -
                                BONES
                Lieutenant, you are looking at the

                Or the one.
        He props a hand on the glass to support himself.  Kirk's
        hand reflexively goes to match Spock's on the other side
        of the glass -
                                SPOCK
                        (continuing)
                I never took the Kobayashi Maru
                test - until now.  What do you
                think of my solution?

                - your friend...Live.  Long.  And.
                Prosper.
        Spock falls.  Bones and Scotty react.

        CAMERA PANS DOWN with Spock's burial capsule covered
        with the Starfleet Logo/flag, being lowered down to
        Torp. Bay 2.  We SEE the Ship's Company in full dress
        uniforms assembled for ship's burial service.
        Over the PULLBACK, we HEAR:
                                KIRK
                We are assembled here today to
                pay final respects to our honored
                dead.
        Carol and David are PROMINENTLY FEATURED.
        David watching Kirk attentively.  So are Sulu, Uhura,
        Chekov, and Saavik.  Bones stands next to Kirk.  Scotty
        carries his bagpipes.  Saavik wears her hair down.

                And yet, it should be noted, that
                in the midst of our sorrow, this
                death takes place in the shadow of
                new life, the sunrise of a new world,
                a world that our beloved comrade
                gave his life to protect and
                nourish.  He did not feel this
                sacrifice a vain or an empty one -
                and we will not debate his profound
                wisdom at these proceedings.  Of
                my friend, I can only say this...
                of all the souls I have encountered
                in my travels, his was the most -
                        (he falters)
                - human.
                                SULU
                Honors - hup!
        All Starfleet personnel salute.  Scotty begins to PIPE,
        an odd blare which mellows into Amazing Grace.  Kirk
        nods a signal.
261     THE CAPSULE                             261
        A gleaming black projectile is carried by pallbearers
        into the launching chamber, which locks behind it.  At
        a hand signal from a TORPEDOMAN, the projectile is
        fired.  NOISE.

        Spock's remains seen on their way to the new world.
        The capsule grows too small to SEE.  The bagpipes STOP.
263     INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS                    263
        After a long moment, the CAMERA DISCOVERS Kirk.  He
        pours a drink, then decides not to have it.
        He sits wearily, not knowing how to shake the ghosts.
        Then he sees the book.
        Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his
        friend, and closes his eyes a moment.  Almost idly he
        starts turning pages, looking for a clue.

        But he can't see the writing - He rummages through his
        pockets and pulls out the half-glasses -
        One of the lenses is broken.  It has a deep impact on
        Kirk.  He puts down the book and glasses and covers
        his eyes.
        A SOFT BONG.  Kirk clears his throat.
                                KIRK
                Come.
        The door whooshes open and closes to admit David.  The
        last person Kirk expected to see.
                                DAVID
                I don't mean to intrude.
                                KIRK
                No, not at all.  I should be on
                the bridge.
                                DAVID
                Look, can I talk to you for a
                minute?
                                KIRK
                I poured myself a drink.  Would you
                like it?
                                DAVID
                Lieutenant Saavik was right:  you
                never have faced a death.
                                KIRK
                        (hoarse)
                No.  Not like this.  I haven't faced
                death, I've cheated death.  I've
                tricked my way out of death and patted
                myself on the back for my ingenuity.
                I know nothing.
                                DAVID
                You knew enough to tell Saavik that
                how we face death is at least as
                important as how we face life -

                But good words.  That's where ideas
                begin.  Maybe you should listen to
                them.  I was wrong about you.
                        (pause)
                And I'm sorry.
                                KIRK
                Is that what you came here to say?
                                DAVID
                Mainly.
                        (he starts out,
                        then turns - )
                And also that I'm proud - very
                proud - to be your son.
        A stunned moment, then Kirk lets it all hang out:  for
        David, for Carol and for Spock.  He hugs his son,
        holding onto him as to life itself.

                if Genesis is indeed "life from
                death," I must return to this place
                again.
