Stan Laurel, Dinah,
                  and Oliver Hardy.




 
Altered
Opening Scene


The following is a reproduction of pages 5-9 of
the original script. They depict a scene from early in the film, that
did not make it to the final cut. Each word, as well as the
formatting of each page, is identical to the original ... typos and
all!

                                                       5.
 
 18. 
FADE IN on a long shot of a
prairie road.  To the theme song
of Laurel and Hardy we see a
travois, draws by a burro, which
Stan is leading.  Seated on the
travois is Babe.
 
 19. 
IN A CLOSER SHOT we see that
Babe is asleep.  We follow the
travois to a stream, which Stan
fords, leading the burro.
 
 20. 
As they come out on the other
side of the stream we see that
the shafts have pulled loose from
the travois, leaving Babe still
seated on it, in the water.
Stan continues out of scene, not
noticing that he has left Babe
behind.
 
 21. 
CUT TO BABE.  Feeling the water
around his fanny he wakes up and
has a takem when he realizes what
has happened.  He whistles to Stan.
 
 22. 
CUT TO STAN hearing Babe's whistle.
He comes to a stop, looks around,
then returns to Babe.
                              STAN:       What happened?
 
                              BABE:          (Disgusted)
                                          Never mind!  Come on!
 
 23. 
Babe starts to wade ashore, but
steps into a deep hole and dis-
appears.  Stan misses him and
starts to brush through the water
trying to find him.  Babe's head
comes out of the water.  Stan assists
him to the bank, and they exit
out of the scene.
 
 24. 
CUT TO a cross-roads where we
see a sign post reading:
 
"BRUSHWOOD GULCH - 2 MILES"
 
                                                       6.
 
The sign is loose on the post,
so that it swings with the wind.
 
Babe and Stan enter with the
burro.  Babe looks at the sign;
it is pointing to the left.  He
turns and looks off in that
direction.
 
 25. 
The wind shifts the sign.  Stan
looks up at it and it is now
pointing to the right.
 
They both start off in different
directions, and a controversy
arises as to the right road.
 
                              BABE:       This is the way!
 
                               STAN:      Uh,uh.  It's this way.
 
                              BABE:       Can't you read?  We
                                          have to go the way
                                          that sign points.
 
 26. 
This argument culminates when
they both look at the sign and
see that it has now swung back
in the direction from which they
came.  As they look at the sign
it swings again.  They realize
what is wrong, but are left very
much in doubt as to the right
direction to Brushwood Gulch.
 
                              BABE:       Now we don't know which
                                          way to go.
 
                              STAN:       Let's go this way.
 
                              BABE:       Why should we go that
                                          way, when it might be
                                          this way?
 
 27. 
This puzzles Stan for a moment.
An Indian Brave enters the scene.
Stan walks over to him.
                              STAN:       Pardon me, Mister, but
                                          which way is right?
 
The indian grunts and points
to the right, then exits out
of scene.  Stan turns to Babe,
very satisfied.
 
                                                       7.
 
                              STAN:       You see, I was right.
                                          It's that way.
 
                              BABE:       That's all I wanted to
                                          know.
They start out of scene.
 
 28. 
CUT TO another section of the
road.  We pick up the sheriff
riding toward the CAMERA.  As
he comes to foreground he reins
his horse.
                              SHERIFF:    Whoa!
 
He speaks to someone out of
scene.
                              SHERIFF:    Where you headed for,
                                          Strangers?
 
 29. 
CUT TO REVERSE SHOT of Stan
and Babe.
                              BABE:       We're on our way to
                                          Brushwood Gulch.
 
                              SHERIFF:    Well, you'll never get
                                          there that way, because
                                          it's that way.
 
He indicates the other road.
 
                              BABE:       Thank you very much.
 
The sheriff continues on his
way out of scene.  Babe gives
Stan a dirty look.
                              BABE:       You see how dumb you
                                          are?  I don't believe
                                          you even know that
                                          Lincoln is dead.
 
                              STAN:       I certainly do.  I knew
                                          it a week ago.
 
                              BABE:       Well, you didn't know
                                          it was that way.
 
Babe points and Stan happens
to turn his face into Babe's
hand, causing him to get a
poke in the nose.
 

                                                       8.
 
Stan becomes a little sore at
this and grabbing hold of Babe's
nose pretends to pull it off
and shows it to Babe between
his fingers.  Babe takes it big.
 
                              BABE:       Oh, give that back!
 
 30 
Stan holds it out of his reach
and babe  gets so angry that
he picks up a rock.  Stan
quickly pulls out his gun.  At
the sight of the gun Babe drops
the rock, turns his back and
holds his hands over his ears as
though he fully expected to get
shot.
                              BABE:       Don't you dare shoot
                                          me.
Stan deliberately shoots out of
scene and at the same time
kicks Babe in the fanny.
 
 31 
CUT TO the sheriff riding away
from CAMERA and show that his
hat is shot off.
 
 32. 
CUT BACK to Babe.  He straightens
up, feels his fanny, convinced
that he has been shot.  Babe
assumes a very dramatic position
on the ground, groaning like a
dying man.
                              BABE:       To think my best friend
                                          would shoot me - right
                                          behind my back.
 
Suddenly the sheriff's voice
interrupts sharply from out of
scene.
                              SHERIFF:    Stick 'em up!
 
Babe forgets all about dying,
jumps to his feet and holds
up his hands.  Stan does like-
wise.  The sheriff steps into the
scene with his gun drawn, and
throws his punctured hat on the
ground.
                              SHERIFF:    Take a look at that
                                          hat you big, bloated
                                          porcupine!
 

                                                       9.
 
Babe stoops to pick up the hat
and the sheriff kicks him in
the fanny, which Babe takes.
                              SHERIFF:       (To Stan)
                                          And you pick it up!
 
As Stan bends over he grabs a
heavy frying pan off the mule
pack, and quickly protects his
fanny with it as the sheriff
kicks, almost breaking his toe.
The sheriff reacts to this,
and as he hops around holding
his injured foot, Prunella hauls
off and gives him a terrific kick
in the fanny.  He flies out of
scene.
 
 33. 
CUT TO a cactus bed.  The sheriff
lands in it, sprawling on his hands
and knees.  As he gets up we see
that his hands are covered with cactus
needles.  He reaches for his gun,
but is unable to draw it because
of the cactus on his hands.  He
looks off and sees Stan and Babe
running down the road, with the
burro following them.
 
 34. 
WIPE TO the Main Street of Brushwood
Gulch.  Babe and Stan tie their mule
to a hitching post in front of
the honky-tonk.  They start to enter, but
but Stan, seeing a sleek-looking horse
tied alongside eating some hay, reaches
over the horse's back and touches it
on the far side, causing the horse
to turn away from the hay.  He quickly
takes some and gives it to Prunella.
The horse turns back, sees Stan and
makes a menacing face at him.
 
(NOTE: This can be done by putting
a rubber band over the horses upper
lip.)
 
This frightens Stan, he quickly
returns the hay and tips his hat.
During this Babe has been watching
Stan with disgust.  babe motions
Stan to follow and they exit into
the honky-tonk.
