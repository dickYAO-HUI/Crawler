	FADE IN

1-	<OUT>
3

3A	EXT. TWA PLANE IN FLIGHT OVER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

	With the myriad lights of the city beneath it. As the plane lands:

3B	EXT. HUGE HANGAR

	Troop carriers filled with ARMED SOLDIERS are lined up before the
	hangar; several official cars filled with SECRET SERVICE MEN, four
	MOTORCYCLE POLICEMEN, and a caravan of three limousines complete the
	waiting entourage. The CHIEF of the SECRET SERVICE looks toward the
	airfield as the plane is heard taxiing in. He turns and gets into one
	of the limousines, followed by the others.

3C	LONG SHOT - VEHICLES ON AIRFIELD

	Coming toward camera. The plane looms in the f.g. A motorized stairway
	is on the way toward the door of the plane. The vehicles come to a
	halt before the camera.

3D	HIGH ANGLE SHOT - PLANE

	The Armed Soldiers leap out of the troop carriers and form a cordon
	around the plane. The Secret Service Men get out within the circle of
	guards, wait for the door to open.

4	EXT. JET DOOR

	It opens. GRANT steps out: in middle thirties, with the air of a man
	who takes nothing seriously -- his coverup for involvement. He turns
	to help JAN BENES out of the plane. Benes is Mittel European in dress
	and manner. Physically, he is Schweitzer at forty: the leonine head,
	the shock of hair. He carries a battered suitcase. In response to
	Grant's gesture, he precedes him down the stairs.

5	ON THE FIELD

	As Benes reaches the last step, he is greeted by the Chief of the
	Secret Service, who shakes his hand, introduces him to several of his
	subordinates, and leads him to a limousine. Their words are lost in
	the din of jets. About to get into the car, Benes turns and moves back
	quickly to Grant, who is near the bottom of the stairs. Benes extends
	his hand. They shake warmly. Benes moves back toward the limousine.

6	GRANT - ON PLATFORM STAIRS

	He watches as Benes gets into the limousine and the caravan takes off
	with the Motorcycle Escort. The Soldiers are climbing back into the
	troop carriers. Grant starts down the stairs, is lost to view in the
	general activity.

7-	<OUT>
8

8A	EXT. PICO BOULEVARD

	Down which the cavalcade speeds.

8B	EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT OF STUDIO (BACK LOT)

	The cavalcade races through an area of dark warehouses.

8C	EXT. DESERTED STREET (BACK LOT)

	A rundown area. The cavalcade starts down the street. In the second
	floor of an otherwise dark house, a light is turned on and off, an
	evident signal. PAN DOWN to a heavy car, waiting in a narrow alley
	which opens into the street. Its headlights are off, the sound of its
	engine completely drowned by the concerted roar of the oncoming cars
	and motorcycles. As the cavalcade nears the entrance to the alley, one
	of the motorcyles comes speeding up from the rear of the escort. The
	car in the alleyway starts toward the entrance to the alley.

9-	<OUT>
15

15A	EXT. ALLEYWAY

	The car starts hurtling forward at full speed. The front of the
	limousine is now visible. A broadside impact seems inevitable.

15B	EXT. ALLEY

	The motorcycle from the rear reaches the limousine as the kamikaze car
	comes hurtling out like a motorized projectile. It hits the motorcycle
	-- a totally unexpected obstruction -- and sends the Policeman flying
	out of scene. It is sufficient to deflect the kamikaze car from its
	deadly aim. The car hits the rear of the limousine, sends it spinning
	out of control. The suicide car, also out of control, careens toward
	the opposite side of the street. The limousine smashes into a
	telephone pole, which brings it to a jolting stop.

16	INT. LIMOUSINE

	The impact throws Benes to the side. His head hits the door handle
	with stunning force, almost knocking him out.

17	EXT. STREET

	The kamikaze car slams directly into a brick wall. It instantly bursts
	into fire, engulfing the Driver. The fitful flames illuminate the
	otherwise dark street.

18	EXT. LIMOUSINE

	The Chief of the Secret Service jumps out of the limousine, waves to a
	sedan to pull up, his shouts lost in the general turmoil. Other Secret
	Service Men are helping the dazed Benes out, shielding him. A sedan
	pulls up beside the limousine.

19	INT. SEDAN

	The Chief of the Secret Service instantly hustles Benes into the rear.
	As he climbs in beside him, and the other Secret Service Men rush to
	the other side to get in, there is the sharp crack of a rifle shot. It
	shatters the rear window of the sedan, narrowly missing Benes. The
	Chief thrusts him onto the floor, sprawls on top of Benes to cover
	him, while shouting to the Driver to get going, his words
	indistinguishable in the confusion of more rifle shots, which sends
	glass and bullets ricocheting through the interior of the sedan.

20	EXT. STREET

	In the eerie light of the burning car, the sedan can be seen speeding
	off, flanked and spearheaded by Motorcycle Police. The Secret Service
	Men and those in the sedans are left behind, firing toward the top
	floor of a nearby bullding from which the rifle fire came.

21	SERIES OF IMPRESSIONISTIC CUTS THROUGH CREDITS

	Without divulging the nature of the hospital, the unconscious Jan
	Benes is seen undergoing a fast and thorough medical probe by
	TECHNICIANS and SPECIALISTS, using the latest equipment. Huge X-ray
	machines, Centrifuges whirling blood samples, EKGs, Encephalographs,
	and a variety of instruments used in cerebral examinations are
	featured. After the LAST CREDIT:

21A	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

	It is late. A car is speeding along.

21B	INT. CAR

	Seated in the rear, Grant looks as if he has just been aroused from
	sleep and hustled into the car in a hurry. He is getting into his
	shirt, helped by a MAN beside him. There is a smudge of lipstick on
	his cheek.

					MAN
			Sorry we had to get you up at this
			hour, Mr. Grant.

					GRANT
				(yawning)
			I thought I was on my vacation...
			What's it all about?

					MAN
			I can't tell you.

					GRANT
			Where we going?

					MAN
			I can't tell you that either...
			Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got
			a smudge on your cheek.

	He takes out handkerchief, realizing Grant can't see it.

					MAN
			May I?

					GRANT
			Go ahead.

	As Grant finishes buttoning on his shirt, the Man rubs off the
	lipstick. Then he throws the handkerchief out of the car.

					GRANT
			What'd you do that for?

					MAN
			I'm married.

					GRANT
			And she said it was indelible...

									DISSOLVE TO:

21C	EXT. DESERTED WAREHOUSE - PARKING AREA - NIGHT

	The car bearing Grant pulls up on an unpaved parking area used for
	loading trucks. Nothing stirs. The DRIVER shuts off the engine and
	lights.

21D	INT. CAR

	The Driver and the Man in the rear get out. As Grant starts to follow:

					MAN
			You're to stay inside, Mr. Grant.
				(answering look)
			And wait...

	They close their respective doors, leaving Grant alone in the car,
	looking out mystified into the darkness.

21E	EXT. PARKING AREA

	The two men move off together, until they reach what they obviously
	know is a proscribed distance from the car. Then they stop and look at
	it. For a moment nothing happens, then the ground seemingly starts to
	sink with the car.

21F	INT. CAR

	Grant is startled to see the earth sliding up past the car.

21G	LONG SHOT - ELEVATOR SHAFT

	It now becomes apparent that the car has been resting on what is
	really the top of an elevator shaft. The sides of the shaft now become
	visible: it is seemingly bottomless.

21H	INT. CAR - IN SHAFT

	Grant responds as the elevator finally comes to a halt.

22-	<OUT>
39

40	INT. BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT

	The car is on the earthen platform. Two big doors open. A scooter
	bearing the distinctive insignia of the <CMDF> appears, driven by an
	M.P. wearing the same emblem. Grant gets out of the car, is waved by
	the M.P. into the scooter. He gets in, is driven away.

41	INT. UNDERGROUND ORDNANCE DEPOT

	They pass through a vast empty area, obviously capable of holding
	large pieces of equipment. The insignia of the <CMDF> is prominent.

42-	<OUT>
43

43A	RAMP

	The scooter carrying Grant speeds up the incline to:

44	INT. CENTRAL CLEARANCE AREA

	MALE and FEMALE OFFICERS, all in the uniform of the <CMDF>, are moving
	about busily. As the M.P. and Grant drive across the foyer, Grant eyes
	the Female CMDFs appreciatively. Their uniforms emphasize non-military
	points. The scooter reaches:

45	INT. CLEARANCE DESK

	The OFFICER behind the desk looks up.

					OFFICER
			Your I.D. card, please.

	Grant takes out a card with only an embossed number. The Officer
	places it into an IDENTIFIER. We see its screen is blank. After a
	moment, Grant's picture flashes on in color, in full view and profile.
	The Officer looks up at Grant, sees it is an exact likeness. He then
	extracts the card. The screen goes blank. He hands Grant the I.D.
	card. The scooter takes off, speeding down a long neon-lit corridor,
	marked off for scooter traffic: four lanes, two in each direction.
	Numerous doors leading to offices open on both sides of the walkways.
	Traffic is heavy. Grant is the only one in mufti. The scooter
	approaches doors over which lights flash:

				<MEDICAL DIVISION>
				<AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL>
				<ONLY ONLY ONLY>!

	As the scooter nears the Sentry Box, the M.P. on duty hits a switch.
	The steel doors slide open. The scooter goes through into:

46-	<OUT>
50

51	INT. MEDICAL FOYER

	GENERAL ALAN CARTER is coming out of a door in a hurry. The scooter
	bearing Grant pulls up beside him. Grant gets out. They shake hands.

					CARTER
			Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.

					GRANT
			The Pentagon, wasn't it, General?
			Only you weren't in that uniform...

52	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

	They move to window overlooking the OPERATING ROOM, see the
	unconscious Benes being wheeled in for Surgery. His head is uncovered.
	The full shock of hair stands out against the white pillow. His body
	is draped in the usual manner. A battery of SPECIALISTS and MEDICAL
	ATTENDANTS, MALE and FEMALE, are moving about under the glare of beams
	focused on the Operating Table.

					GRANT
				(startled)
			Benes... What the devil happened?

					CARTER
			The Other Side got to him.

					GRANT
			How bad off is he?

					CARTER
			Brain injury.

					GRANT
			Before or after what he wanted to
			tell you?

					CARTER
			Before he could breathe a word. He's
			the only scientist who knows the
			answer to what we're after. That's
			why we have to operate --

	He turns away from the window, moves toward another door, with Grant
	following.

					CARTER
			-- and why we need you.

					GRANT
			<Me>?

	Bewildered, he follows Carter through door into:

53-	<OUT>
55

56	INT. MONITORING ROOM

	Carter moves to a panel of many switches and TV screens.

					GRANT
			I can't even put a Band-Aid on my
			finger.

					CARTER
			Here's the Surgeon.

	He flicks a switch. On the TV screen appears the INTERIOR OF DUVAL'S
	OFFICE. We see DUVAL, a brain surgeon in the middle forties. He has
	the manner of one totally dedicated to his work. At the moment, he is
	testing a ruby laser, narrowing the beam down to pencil-like thinness.
	Assisting him is CORA PETERSON. In the middle twenties, her
	attractiveness is matched by her efficiency, which is considerable.
	They work together smoothly, the result of long association. It is
	evident neither know they are being observed during:

					CARTER
			Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain
			man in the country. Ever hear of
			him?

					GRANT
			Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons.
			Who's the girl?

					CARTER
			Cora Peterson, his Technical
			Assistant. You'll join Duval and the
			others --

					GRANT
			What can I do? Except maybe pass
			out?

	Carter flips on another switch. On the TV screen appears the INTERIOR
	OF DR. MICHAELS' OFFICE. It is dominated by big blowups of the
	Circulation System. Michaels is asaembling charts, as if under
	pressure.

					CARTER'S VOICE
				(on loudspeaker)
			Mike...

	Michaels moves to a wall, presses a switch. His TV screen shows Grant
	and Carter.

					MICHAELS
			Yes, Alan.

					CARTER
			Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels,
			Chief of the Medical Section.

					MICHAELS
			Glad to have you with us, Mr.
			Grant.

					GRANT
			Wish I knew why.

					CARTER
			Tell him where he fits in, will you?
			I've got a few things to check out.

	He moves to another panell is seen throwing on switches, monitoring a
	fast series of scenes, all of which are indistinguishable in angle of
	shot. Michaels is seen bustling about, collecting charts during:

					MICHAELS
			We need you for Security purposes,
			Mr. Grant.

					GRANT
			At an operation?

					MICHAELS
			They know they failed to kill Benes.
			Security thinks they'll try again,
			first chance they get. We're afraid
			of medical sabotage -- or surgical
			assassination.

					GRANT
			Surgical assassination?! But that
			means you suspect --

					CARTER
				(re-entering scene)
			[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]

					MICHAELS
			I don't agree. Just because he's
			often difficult --

					CARTER
			Difficult? He's impossible!

					MICHAELS
			That's no reason to suspect him of
			disloyalty.

					GRANT
			But why take the chance, when there
			must be other doctors?

					CARTER
			We have no choice. Duval's the most
			skillful brain surgeon in the
			country, and he's right here, at
			hand.

					GRANT
			I wouldn't know if he's trying to
			save him or kill him.

					MICHAELS
			I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.

					CARTER
				(to Grant)
			And no matter what happens, you're
			to take orders <only> from Dr.
			Michaels, understand?

					GRANT
			Right, sir.

					CARTER
			Come along, they'll be operating
			shortly.
				(hand on switch)
			See you later, Mike.

	Michaels waves. Carter switches off the monitor. He moves to a door.
	Grant follows.

57-	<OUT>
61

62	INT. MEDICAL FOYER

	As they emerge:

					GRANT
			His technician okay? In addition to
			the Looks Department?

					CARTER
			No question of her loyalty.

	As Carter leads Grant to the scooter and they take their places, Grant
	looks at the big <CMDF> insignia on the floor.

					GRANT
			I don't mean to be inquisitive. But
			this <CMDF> -- for all I know it
			could stand for <Consolidated
			Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?

					CARTER
				(matter-of-fact)
			<Combined Miniature Deterrent
			Forces>.

					GRANT
				(blankly)
			Say that again?

	Carter starts the scooter and they drive through the big doors leading
	out of the Medical Foyer.

63-	<OUT>
74

75	INT. CORRIDOR - TRAVELING WITH SCOOTER

					CARTER
			We can reduce anything down to any
			size we want. People -- ships --
			tanks --planes...

					GRANT
			General, I've heard some wild ones.
			But this takes it.

					CARTER
			We can shrink an Army -- with all
			its equipment -- and put it in a
			bottle cap. That's why we call it
			<Combined Miniature Deterrent
			Forces>.

					GRANT
				(with silent whistle)
			If the Other Side ever gets hold of
			a thing like that...

					CARTER
			They have...
				(answering look)
			But we've both got the same problem
			-- lack or control. We can only keep
			things Miniaturized for exactly
			sixty minutes. Arter that,
			everything starts growing back to
			its original size.

	They arrive at the root of the escalator, leave the scooter and board
	the moving stairway.

76	WITH ESCALATOR

	As they ride up:

					GRANT
			I assume Benes knows how to control
			it.

					CARTER
			That's right. He wanted us to have
			the secret, and not them. Which is
			why they tried to kill him.

					GRANT
			They're bound to try again. No
			wonder they want me to stand by
			during the operation.

					CARTER
			And take a little trip with them...

					GRANT
				(bewildered)
			Trip? Where to?

					CARTER
				(matter-of-fact)
			Well, the only way to reach that
			clot is from inside the Brain. So
			we've decided to put a Surgical Team
			and a Crew into a submarine --
			reduce it way down in size, and
			inject it into an Artery --

					GRANT
				(jolted)
			You mean <I'm> going along?

					CARTER
			As part of the Crew.

					GRANT
			Wait a minute! They can't shrink
			<me>!

					CARTER
				(assuringly)
			Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink
			anything.

					GRANT
			But I don't want to be
			Miniaturized -- !

					CARTER
			It's only for an hour --

					GRANT
			Not even for a minute! General
			Carter, sir, I'd like you to
			reconsider your choice. I'm just not
			the right man for a mission of this
			kind.

	He starts walking against the direction of the escalator, thus
	remaining in the same place.

					CARTER
				(taking his arm)
			Come on, Grant. You're going to a
			Briefing.

	They have reached the top of the escalator. Nearby is a door marked:

					<CONFERENCE ROOM>

	Carter opens the door, waves him in.

77	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

	Grant and Carter enter in the middle of what is evidently a heated
	argument between COLONEL DONALD REID and Duval. Reid is in the uniform
	of the <CMDF>, with a cadaceus which indicates he is the Medical
	Division. Also present is CAPTAIN BILL OWENS, in Naval uniform, and
	Michaels. Cora stands beside Duval, rather abashed, since she is the
	cause of the vociferous disagreement.

					DUVAL
				(irascibly)
			Miss Peterson volunteered to come
			along!

					REID
			So did every male Technician in the
			Unit. A woman has no place on a
			mission of this kind.

					DUVAL
				(brooking no rebuttal)
			I insist on taking my Technician.

					REID
			You'll take whoever <I> assign!

					DUVAL
				(angrily)
			Don't tell me whom I'm to work with!
			Not on this operation or any other!
			I'll do what <I> think is best,
			without any interference from
			anyone!

	Before Reid can reply:

					MICHAELS
				(diplomatically)
			Dr. Duval has relied on Miss
			Peterson for years. And since she
			wants to come along, I'm sure it's
			for the best, Dr. Reid.

					REID
				(making best of defeat)
			I don't agree with you -- but since
			you're in charge, you can do as you
			please. But I want to go on record
			as being against it.

					CARTER
			Grant -- Colonel Reid, Operation
			Commander.
				(they nod; of Michaels)
			You've met our Medical Chief.

	Grant and Michaels shake hands, in effect their first meeting vis-a-
	vis.

					CARTER
			This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.

					GRANT
			Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.

	With the attitude of the completely dedicated professional, Duval
	throws him a cursory glance, nods, sits down, quickly opens up a
	folder containing the latest lab reports on Benes, which he scans
	during:

					MICHAELS
			Miss Peterson, his Technical
			Assistant.

					GRANT
				(the charmer)
			How are you, Miss Peterson?

	She responds with an impersonal nod, sits down beside Duval and opens
	up her sheaf of lab reports, handing him the pertinent ones during:

					CARTER
			This is Captain Bill Owens, designer
			of an experimental submarine for the
			Navy's 'Oceanographic Research and
			Development Program.'

	As they shake hands:

					GRANT
			Out of your element, aren't you,
			Captain?

					OWENS
			Sort of.

					GRANT
			That makes two of us.

					CARTER
			Grant's uniquely qualified for this
			mission. He's a Communications
			Expert and was a Frogman during the
			War. Besides, he brought Benes into
			this country, and the fewer people
			who know about him, the better. At
			any rate, you'll find Grant
			invaluable, should anything go wrong
			once you're under way.
				(to Reid)
			Okay, Don.

					REID
			Here's the overall Target Area...

	Reid presses a switch. A large anatomical map of a Brain flashes on a
	central screen. The ganglia and dendrites form a network, much like
	intersecting roads, in a detailed war map. The clot is a solid
	obstruction in the center. Grid lines cross the map vertically and
	horizontally as points of reference. The entire projection has a
	three-dimensional effect, since it is drawn in perspective.

					DUVAL
			Benes' brain...near as we can map it
			stereotaxically...

	He switches on a flashlight arrow, points to the clot.

					DUVAL
			The clot's right here...

	He switches off the arrow and quickly flashes it on again, this time
	on the edges of the map. The arrow now probes and with draws from the
	base, center and top of the brain, like the animated technique of
	showing an attack which is repulsed at the perimeter.

					DUVAL
			Impossible to get at --
				(arrow makes vertical
				penetration to give
				impression of wide cut)
			-- without damage to the intervening
			tissue...which would prove fatal to
			Benes.

	He presses another switch. A startling OVERLAY OF THE BLOOD VESSELS OF
	THE HEAD AND NECK appears over the anatomical drawing of the brain,
	encasing it. The red-colored arteries and blue-colored veins form such
	an intricate maze, that finding one's way through it seems virtually
	impossible.

					DUVAL
			The only way to reach it is via the
			Arterial System.

	Grant looks at Cora. She is busy making notes from the projected map.
	Owens is showing no undue reaction, apparently having been apprised.

					REID
			Phase One calls for Miniaturizing a
			submarine, with Crew and Surgical
			Team, and injecting it into the
			Carotid Artery.

	He points with the arrow to the exact spot.

					OWENS
			How small would that be?

					REID
			About the size of a microbe.

					GRANT
			Colonel, I'm sure that's quite a
			comfortable size, but --

					REID
			Reduced proportionately, you won't
			find it too strange --

					GRANT
			All in a day's work, sure. But I was
			thinking of the speed of the
			Circulatory System.

					MICHAELS
			About forty miles an hour.

					GRANT
			Well, it seems to me if you reduce a
			ship to microscopic size -- and the
			stream remains constant -- we'd take
			quite a beating.

					OWENS
				(very worried)
			I hope you've taken that into
			account --

					CARTER
			We have.

					REID
			You won't be going anywhere near
			that fast. We're putting Benes in
			deep Hypothermia -- that is,
			freezing him low as compatible with
			human life. It'll slow down his
			heartbeat, Circulation, and all
			other physical processes.

	Owens begins polishing his glasses, indicating his inner qualms.

					OWENS
			Even so, because of our size -- I
			mean lack of it -- we'll still be
			cruising mighty fast. We'll be
			smashed to bits if there's any
			turbulence --

					MICHAELS
				(pointing with flashing
				arrow)
			The only danger of turbulence is in
			the Heart -- and we're not going
			through it.
				(flashing arrow)
			Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll
			remain in the Arterial System...
			until we reach the point of
			damage --
				(flashes around clot)
			-- where Dr. Duval will attempt to
			dissolve the clot with a laser beam.
			After the operation, we'll return by
			way of the Venous System --
				(coursing down with
				arrow)
			-- until we reach the base of the
			neck --
				(arrow stops)
			-- where we'll be removed right here
			-- with a hypodermic.

					GRANT
			How will you know where the sub is,
			at any particular moment?

					REID
			Dr. Michaels -- our Circulatory
			Specialist -- will serve as your
			Navigator. He'll know just where you
			are. And you can communicate
			directly with us, by wireless.
			Besides, the sub is nuclear-powered,
			and we'll be tracking it just as we
			would any radio-active tracer.

					CARTER
			There'll be a team of Surgeons
			standing by. We're prepared to
			remove you immediately, should
			anything go wrong. In any event, you
			must be out within sixty minutes.
			After that, you'll be in danger of
			attack.

					GRANT
			Attack? Who -- or should I say what
			from?

					REID
			Benes' natural defenses. White
			Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you
			begin to grow -- and become a menace
			to the body -- you'll trigger them
			off...
					MICHAELS
			With all the unknown factors in the
			body, I still say risking five lives
			for one is something we should
			reconsider --

					CARTER
			We understand your concern, but
			we've made our decision, Doctor. Any
			questions? Anybody?

					GRANT
			Just one, General...

					CARTER
			Yes?

					GRANT
			Where can I get a cab back to town?

	No one responds to the attempted levity. Carter rises.

					CARTER
				(to all)
			Proceed to the Sterilization
			Section.

	Carter and Reid move out of the room through the door. The others go
	out through another.

78-	<OUT>
80

80A	INT. CORRIDOR

	The five appear and stop before a cylindrical door with handles
	similar to those in a vault, to give the effect of a sealed chamber
	within. Over the door flashes:

				<STERILIZATION SECTION>

	The five reach the door. An electronic beam swings it open
	automatically. They start in. As Grant moves past the sign:

					GRANT
			How much can a man give to his
			country?

	The door swings automatically shut behind him.

81	<OUT>

82	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	A huge plastic bubble in the form of a truncated semicircle, with
	glass panels overlooking areas not visible in the angle of the shot.
	TECNICIANS in the uniform of the <CMDF> are seated at a desk-level
	bank of monitors, on a slightly raised platform. They are checking the
	numerous TV screens for focus. A cacophony of B-Beeps from the screens
	underscores the sense of last-minute preparations. A COMMUNICATIONS
	AIDE wearing headphones and throat microphone moves about. Carter
	crosses to the Miniaturization Control Panel. Reid goes to the window
	overlooking the OPERATING ROOM. Below, he can see Benes on the
	operating table, a towel over his head. Surgical Aides are making a
	last-minute check of the Thermal Blanket which encases him in three
	sections. Reid presses a button on the wall beside the window.

					REID
			Make the final preparations...

	They begin to remove the towel from Benes' head. Reid turns away from
	the window and crosses to the window overlooking the MAIN OPS ROOM.
	With him we see a huge room, bisected by a floor-to-ceiling detailed
	map of the entire ARTERIAL and VENOUS SYSTEM from rib-cage to skull,
	to simulate the body of Benes in a prone position. Grid lines mark off
	areas in relation to true North and South. TECHNICIANS are bustling
	about with charts and reports which are coming in through headphones,
	telephones, teletypes, batteries of Computers, Oscillographs, etc.
	Encircling the entire floor are glass-fronted booths which enclose the
	SPECIALISTS' POSTS. Reid turns to a Technician at the Master Control
	Section.

					REID
				(to Technician)
			Heart.

	The Technician flips on a switch. On a TV screen appears the INTERIOR
	OF THE HEART POST, one of the glass-enclosed booths looking out onto
	the MAIN OPS ROOM. Like all the Specialists Posts, it is concerned
	with its particular area and nothing else: Blowups of the Heart in
	great detail, X-rays of Benes' heart, its beat being recorded
	electronically on a huge EKG chart which fills one wall and is in
	constant operation via remote control. The HEART SPECIALIST is
	standing before the EKG chart, while a TECHNICIAN twirls dials at a
	panel. Reid can be seen in the closed TV circuit in the Heart Post.
	(As in all subsequent TV communications.)

					REID
			How's it look, Henry?

					HEART SPECIALIST
				(over TV)
			Holding steady at thirty-two per
			minute.

					REID
				(to another Technician)
			Respiration.

	The Technician flips on another switch. On a TV screen appears the
	INTERIOR OF THE RESPIRATION POST. Here everything relates only to the
	lungs. In addition to cut-away sections where each small area assumes
	the proportions of a detailed war map, there are banks of Benes'
	X-rays, lit up in panels, plus immense calibrated charts labeled
	INHALATION and EXHALATION, on which the rate is being electronically
	recorded.

					REID
			How's he doing, Jack?

	The Lung Specialist is seen glancing at a chart.

					LUNG SPECIALIST
				(over TV)
			Respiration is now six per minute...
			I wouldn't take him down any
			further.

	Another Technician flips switch in response to:

					REID
			Hypothermia...

	On a TV screen appears the INTERIOR OF THE HYPOTHERMIA POST, its walls
	festooned with dials recording bodily temperature, before which
	TECHNICIANS sit watching and making minute adjustments. The
	HYPOTHERMIA SPECIALIST moves along, keeping a sharp eye on the various
	zones labeled: CIRCULATORY, RESPIRATORY, CARDIAC, RENAL, etc.

					REID
			Any problems, Dr. Sawyer?

					HYPOTHERMIA SPECIALIST
				(over TV)
			No sir. We're holding him at twenty-
			eight degrees Centigrade.

	Carter enters, moves to the Control Section to join Reid.

					CARTER
			Where do we stand?

					REID
			Medical's ready.

	The Communications Aide with headphones moves up to them.

					COMMUNICATIONS AIDE
			They're in the Sterilization
			Corridor --

83-	<OUT>
88

89	INT. STERILIZATION CORRIDOR

	Bathed in eerie ultra-violet light. The five are passing down the
	corridor, in single file. All are dressed in khaki uniforms. Grant
	moves ahead of Cora. As they reach a vestibule at the end, the door
	swings open automatically. Grant starts to help Cora over the
	threshold.

					CORA
			Don't touch me. I'm sterile.

	Grant grins. They move into:

90	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	A huge parquet area, composed of white octagonal modules. In the
	center is the Zero Module, in red. Standing over it is a fifty-foot
	craft. The angle and the distance renders its details indeterminate.
	WHITE-CLAD TECHNICIANS wearing rubber gloves are seen working about
	it. As the five come into the room:

					CARTER'S VOICE
				(on loudspeaker)
			Please board and check all your
			equipment immediately.

	They look up, see:

91	CARTER AND REID AT WINDOW OF CONTROL TOWER - THEIR P.O.V.

	They can be seen, high above.

92	DOWN INTO MINIATURIZATION ROOM - FROM P.O.V. CONTROL TOWER

	Carter and Reid look down at the tiny figures below as they move
	toward:

93	THE PROTEUS - OVER THE ZERO MODULE

	With Grant and the others, we now get the full impact of the
	experimental sub at close range: sleek lines from the intake in the
	nose sweep over a transparent plastic bubble atop the structure, and
	then down to taper off at the stern under which are double vents. The
	sub is supported by cradles, allowing it to stand free of the module.
	Plastic windows in the bow afford the occupants a full view. A white-
	Clad Technician hands Owens a small lead box.

					TECHNICIAN
			Here's the particle, sir.

					OWENS
			Everything aboard?

					TECHNICIAN
			All squared away, sir.

	Carefully holding the lead box, Owens starts up the ladder, followed
	by Duval, then Michaels. Grant waves Cora to precede him. They reach
	the monk's steps above the ladder, climb upward, then one by one
	disappear through the hatch. Grant is the last one in.

94	INT. PROTEUS

	With Grant we see the interior. There are plastic windows in the bow.
	In the center is the Navigation and Communications kiosk, which
	contains charts, reports, and a wireless set. Four swivel chairs are
	spaced about the kiosk. Behind it, a ladder leads to the Conning
	Bubble above. Set in the rear of the kiosk is a watertight door
	leading into the escape hatch. Behind the kiosk is a Lab and Storage
	Section, not visible at the moment. No power of any kind is on --
	lights or air-conditioning. The interior is illuminated by the light
	coming in through the plastic windows. Duval, Michaels and Cora
	instantly move to the kiosk and busy themselves examining the charts
	and reports in the numerous pigeonholes. Owens hands the lead box to
	Grant.

					OWENS
			Hold this...

	Grant takes the lead box. Owens removes a crank from the tool box,
	inserts it into a hole in a circular trap door which reads:

					<DANGER>
					<ATOMIC FUEL>

	Owens turns the crank. The lid of the trap door opens. A hollow cradle
	comes up. Owens then opens the lead box by undoing two butterfly
	screws. He removes the Seed Cage from within the box.

					GRANT
				(not relishing thought)
			Atomic fuel?

					OWENS
			Nothing you could see with the naked
			eye. But there's a microscopic
			radio-active particle inside.

	He puts the Seed Cage on the cradle and lowers it back beneath the
	floor, by reversing the crank. During the above:

					GRANT
			If it's no military secret, how can
			a sub run on a microscopic particle?

					OWENS
			They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But
			once the Reactor's Miniaturized --
			along with the submarine -- a
			microscopic particle should emit
			enough energy to activate it.

					GRANT
			That's cutting it mighty close --
			for a perfect fit.

					OWENS
			It should work -- theoretically. If
			it doesn't, the mission's off. The
			craft's nuclear-powered. Except for
			your wireless.

	The lid of the trap door is now level with the floor. Owens removes
	the crank, and taking the lead box from Grant, he puts both back into
	the tool box during:

					GRANT
				(looking about;
				admiringly)
			All in all, quite a canoe...

					OWENS
			Designed for Piscatorial Research --
			the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea
			Fish.

					GRANT
			Remind me to ask you about the love
			life of an octupus.

	He moves to the wireless, sees Cora smile as she goes through the aft
	door. Grant begins tapping out a message.

95-	<OUT>
96

97	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	A WIRELESS TECHNICIAN is writing down the message heard coming in. He
	tears it off his pad, hands it to the Communications Aide, who takes
	it to Carter.

					COMMUNICATIONS AIDE
			Test message from the Proteus, sir.
				(reading)
			'Miss Peterson has smiled.'

					REID
			That's an auspicious sign.

					CARTER
			Confirm receiving.

98	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant is at the wireless, logging the incoming message. In the
	meantime, Owens finishes battening down the entrance hatch. Duval is
	studying medical reports, Michaels is spreading out the first of the
	Navigation Charts, a very detailed map of the Vascular System of the
	Neck and Head. As Owens crosses on the way to the ladder leading to
	the Bubble:

					MICHAELS
			Captain, how will you be able to
			follow my charts --
				(of Bubble)
			--from up there?

					OWENS
			On the Repeater.

	Michaels looks at him blankly. Owens flips a button up and down of a
	hooded device which is trained on the chart area. The small screen
	remains blank.

					OWENS
			Once the power's on, we'll be in
			direct touch. Come, I'll show you.

	Michaels moves with him to the ladder leading to the Bubble. Owens
	stops, waves him to continue. Michaels goes up the ladder.

98A	INT. CONNING BUBBLE

	An ultra-sophisticated set of controls, consisting of a push-button
	panel and an airplane-like steering wheel. The plastic affords a 360
	degree view of the Miniaturization Room. There is room for only one
	person. Owens remains on the ladder, so that only his head is within
	the Bubble. Owens points to the identical Repeater on the Panel.

					OWENS
			That's it...

					MICHAELS
				(of controls;
				ironically)
			Looks simple to operate.

	He sits down in the single seat.

98B	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant is moving aft. With him we hear:

					OWENS'VOICE
				(from Bubble; with pride)
			It actually is, although the
			controls are highly sophisticated.
			There's a button for everything --

	Grant enters:

99	INT. LAB AND STORAGE SECTION

	Originally designed for marine research, it still shows some of its
	pre-adaptation structure: there is a series of glass-fronted
	compartments, now labeled ANTIBIOTICS, ANTI-COAGULANTS, COAGULANTS,
	MED OXY, etc. A wide counter runs the length of the compartment on one
	side, suitable for working on specimens. A Ruby Laser sits on the
	counter at the end, its plastic cover removed and to the side. At the
	other is a piece of metal on a metal base. As Grant enters, he sees
	Cora working with a set of very small tools, making minute adjustments
	on the laser.

					GRANT
			Bet you're pretty handy around the
			house... Can you cook?

					CORA
				(indicating oxy
				containers)
			We're pushing oxygen today.

					GRANT
			I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.

					CORA
				(surprised)
			You sound as if you're not looking
			forward to it.

					GRANT
			Well, it's not exactly a pleasure
			cruise.

					CORA
			I think it's the most exciting --
				(with awe)
			We're going to see things no one
			ever saw before. The actual physical
			process of Life itself -- not
			something under a microscope... Just
			think of it --

					GRANT
			That's the trouble. I am. Being
			shrunk...

					CORA
			You may learn to like it.

	She has finished adjusting the laser. She now lifts Grant's hand away
	from the metal disc.

					CORA
			Excuse me...

	She presses a button on the laser. With startling suddenness, a thin
	pencil of light shoots out, cutting a hole through the metal
	instantaneously. Had Grant's hand remained, the beam would have gone
	right through it.

					GRANT
			For a nice young lady, you play with
			the damndest toys, Miss Peterson...

	She adjusts the intensity and thickness of the laser beam, each new
	one cutting different size holes through the metal during:

					CORA
				(with smile)
			That'll teach you where to keep your
			hand.

					GRANT
			Now I know...

	As she drills metal through again:

					GRANT
			That could be quite a lethal
			weapon... It could kill, not cure.

					CORA
			Not in the hands of a great surgeon
			like Dr. Duval. The beam of this
			laser can be regulated to one
			millionth of a millimeter.

					GRANT
			I understand you've been Dr. Duval's
			Assistant for quite some time... He
			must've snatched you out of the
			cradle.

					CORA
			I've been with him since I got out
			of school. He brought me into the
			CMDF, over five years ago.

					GRANT
			A long time, with one man.

					CORA
			Not working for someone like Dr.
			Duval --

	She breaks off, realizing she may have revealed her feelings. She
	switches off the laser, averts looking at Grant as she fits the
	plastic cover over it. Into the silence, the wireless is heard as a
	message comes in. Grant starts back into:

100	INT. PROTEUS

	Thoughtful, listening to the wireless. Michaels is coming down from
	the Bubble. As Grant reaches the wireless, the tapping comes to an
	end.

					GRANT
				(loud enough for all)
			'Prepare for Miniaturization'...

					OWENS
			Positions, please. And strap
			yourselves in.

	Grant and Duval begin putting on their safety harnesses, which are
	attached to their respective seats. Cora appears out of the aft
	compartment. Michaels moves toward it, a check-list in hand. He
	disappears within. In the meantime, Owens is busy tightening every
	lock-screw in evidence.

101	AT THE KIOSK

	Cora stops before Duval, tries to help him with the final stages of
	getting into the harness.

					DUVAL
			It's all right -- I can manage.

	She starts to leave, stops.

					CORA
				(with difficulty)
			Doctor...

					DUVAL
				(busy with harness)
			Yes, Cora.

					CORA
			I -- I want to say...

	She falters as he looks at her.

					DUVAL
			What is it?
				(anxiously)
			Anything wrong?

					CORA
				(the moment gone)
			I just wanted to thank you for
			taking me along.

					DUVAL
			Thank you for volunteering.

	She turns abruptly, gets into one of the seats and starts putting on
	her harness. In the meantime, Michaels appears from the aft
	compartment, checking off a few items on the bottom of his list as he
	moves quickly to the kiosk. He places the list into a pigeonhole, sits
	down, quickly straps on his harness.

102	WITH OWENS

	Everything battened down, he now checks Cora's harness, then does the
	same with Duvalls and Michaels'. All are now sweating. Finished with
	Grant's harness, Owens moves quickly up the kiosk ladder leading to:

103	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens drops into the seat, and with the speed of much practise, slips
	into his harness.

104	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant and the others hear:

					OWENS' VOICE
				(from above, in Bubble)
			Okay, Mr. Grant. Tell them we're
			ready.

	As Grant begins to tap out message:

105	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	The message is coming in. The Wireless Technician writes it down, rips
	it off the pad and the Communications Aide reads:

					COMMUNICATIONS AIDE
			'Proteus reports all secured.'

					CARTER
				(to Technician)
			Miniaturizer...

	A TECHNICIAN at a panel marked <MIN> throws a switch.

106	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	What appeared to be a solid wall at the end now slowly starts to slide
	apart, gradually revealing:

107	THE MINIATURIZER

	A huge, honeycombed disc, suspended from a rail running along the
	ceiling, begins to roll silently toward the sub.

108	INT. PROTEUS

	As Grant gets his first sight at what is going to shrink him, he
	reacts quite convinced. He glances at Duval, Michaels and Cora. They,
	too, are looking at the oncoming Miniaturizer, but with none of his
	response. They apparently have seen it before.

109	P.O.V. MINIATURIZATION ROOM - FROM CONTROL TOWER

	Reid and Carter are looking down at the M1niaturizer as it rolls
	slowly toward the sub. When the disc is directly over the sub, the
	Techn1cian at the <MIN> panel throws a switch, instantly stopping the
	Min1aturizer.

					REID
			All stations stand by...

	A Technician presses a button. There is the SOUND of a warning claxon.

110	MAIN OPS ROOM - P.O.V.

	The last minute scurry, as all take their respective places. The GRID
	OFFICER is seen moving up to the big center grid map of the Arterial
	System with something in hand which we can't distinguish as yet.

110A-	CUTS OF TECHNICIANS IN MAIN OPS ROOM
110D
	Now all are mobile, waiting at their machines.

110E	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Reid is now before the monitors, all of which are on. Carter turns
	from the window overlooking the Miniaturization Room, looks at Reid.
	The latter nods in silent affirmal. Carter turns to the Communications
	Aide.

					CARTER
			Commence Miniaturization.

					COMMUNICATIONS AIDE
				(into throat mike)
			Commence Miniaturization.

111	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	The bottom of the Miniaturizer begins to glow with increasing
	intensity. Simultaneously, the modules beneath the sub also begin to
	light up with equal intensity. Gradually, the entire sub is encased in
	a blaze of incandescence.

112	INT. PROTEUS

	The lack of ventilation and the tension is causing Grant and the
	others to sweat profusely.

113	INT. CONNING BUBBLE

	From his vantage point, Owens can see the light of the Miniaturizer
	reach the peak of intensity.

114	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	A light flashes on the <MIN> panel. With Carter we see a grid on the
	Technician's Control Panel as it becomes activated. Two blips from the
	co-ordinates marked <MIN DIMEN> and <MIN SECS> flash on. Reid remains
	at the monitors, eyes on the charts which keep flashing on, sending
	Benes' temperature, heartbeat, etc.

115	<OUT>

116	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	The light is bathing the entire sub in an iridescent glow. There is a
	dull hum.

117	INT. PROTEUS

	With Grant we get the first <subjective> realization that the sub is
	shrinking: the proportions of what he can see in the Miniaturization
	Room are changing. He looks about him in a moment of wonder.

118	DUVAL AND MICHAELS

	From their vantage points at the kiosk tower, they can see a little
	more of the outside than Grant. They respond like scientists: with
	intense absorption in the process.

119	CORA

	She responds enthralled.

120	OWENS

	Up in the Bubble, he gets the unlimited view -- and he is transfiXed.
	For now the Miniaturizer stretches far, far up, and the honeycombed
	light from the Miniaturizer disc seems as distant as stars. The walls
	of the room are barely discernible in the distance.

121	BACK TO GRANT

	The final subjective reaction as with him we see:

122	CONTROL TOWER - GRANT'S P.O.V.

	Far, far up, the windows of the tower have merged into a tiny ray of
	light.

123	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM - P.O.V. CONTROL TOWER

	Now with Carter we get the first <objective> view of the shrinking
	Proteus as they watch it shrink down, down, down in the center of the
	Zero Module, which we see is laced with intersecting lines. When the
	sub reaches the size of a capsule about the length of a centimeter,
	Carter looks down at the grid on the Technician's Control Panel. He
	sees the blips on the co-ordinates approach closer and closer until
	they finally merge into one. He looks back at:

124	<OUT>

125	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM - P.O.V. CONTROL TOWER

	The lights at the bottom of the Miniaturizer's disc go off. The hum
	stops. At this distance, the sub looks like a speck on the floor.

					CARTER
			Elevate Zero Module.

126	THE ZERO MODULE - MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	It starts to rise from the floor with the capsule-sub.

127	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant and the others respond as the vast parquet floor with its maze
	of hexagonal lines seemingly stretching into infinity suddenly begins
	dropping beneath them. The effect is that of becoming air-borne.

128	INT. BUBBLE

	With Owens we get the unobstructed view: everything is falling far,
	far below. The bottom of the Miniaturizer seems an infinite distance
	above.

129	THE ZERO MODULE

	Still rising slowly.

130	THE ZERO MODULE - P.O.V. FROM INTERIOR CONTROL TOWER

	The capsule-sub is now about four feet off the floor, on the Module.
	The Zero Module comes to a stop.

131	INT. PROTEUS - ON MODULE

	All are sweating more profusely, showing increasing discomfort.

132	<OUT>

133	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Carter turns from the window, looks at Reid, who glances up from
	viewing the monitors.

					REID
			Okay to proceed.

					CARTER
			Phase Two.

134	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	A panel slides open and a precision handling device is rolled in by
	several WHITE-CLAD TECHNICIANS. A NURSE follows, in uniform. The
	machine is fourteen feet high, consists of pulleys on a tripod, which
	control a vertical arm angling down from a horizontal extensor. Two
	sets of mechanical fingers are on the vertical arm, about a foot
	apart. Together they act as clamps. All adjustments are controlled by
	various worm-gears. As the tall tripod rolls by, on the side of the
	base we see stamped: MIN PRECISION HANDLING, under the insignia of the
	<CMDF>.

135	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant and the others react to the first sight of the oncoming <human
	beings> in relation to their own reduced size: a button is immense, a
	shoe -- although far down from their position on the Zero Module -- is
	long as a city street, the heads gargantuan atop skyscraper-tall
	bodies. The precision handling machine itself is beyond recognition,
	owing to its vast proportions.

136	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	The tripod is eased to a stop so that its vertical arm is directly
	over the Proteus on the Module. A TECHNICIAN at the gear box starts
	turning a worm-gear control, which lowers the vertical arm toward the
	capsule-sub.

137	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant reacts as huge steel fingers at the bottom of the arm slowly
	slide into view. He glances at Cora and the others. They apparently
	know what to expect, but watch with the interest of scientists. The
	mechanical fingers slowly disappear beneath the sub.

138	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	The Technician maneuvers the mechanical fingers carefully so that they
	slip under the cradle of the sub, in effect becoming its holding fork.
	Once the steel fingers are in place, the Zero Module sinks below the
	floor from view, while the tripod holding the Proteus is eased back.

138A	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	A Technician presses a switch.

138B	CYLINDRICAL AMPULE - MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	A glass ampule about as tall and round as a small silo starts coming
	up out of the floor on the Zero Module. The transparent container is
	filled with a clear liquid, two-thirds to the top. It rests on an
	encircling cork base. The lettering at the base reads: SALINE
	SOLUTION.

139	<OUT>

140	CYLINDRICAL AMPULE - P.0.V. PROTEUS

	Grant and the others react to what appears to be something big as an
	illuminating gas storage tank -- albeit filled with liquid.

141	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM - P.O.V. CONTROL TOWER

	With Carter we see the tripod with the Proteus brought to a stop close
	to the saline solution.

142-	<OUT>
143

144	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	The Technician at the tripod moves it so that the claw holding the
	Proteus is directly over the water in the ampule.

145	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant and the others react as they see themselves suspended over what
	appears to be a huge lake far below, bounded by cylindrical glass
	walls in the distance. Reflected light bounces off the top of the
	water, with iridescent effect. Suddenly they begin to descend. Grant
	and the others react as they seem to be dropping at suicidal speed
	toward the water which is rushing up to meet them as if they were in a
	dive-bomber. Then as the surface nears:

146	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	Within the high walls of the ampule, the capsule-sub is deposited into
	the water. Despite the delicate handling:

147	INT. PROTEUS

	It 'hits' the water, jarring all within, as at a launching from
	drydock.

148	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	The Technician now begins to maneuver the mechanical fingers out from
	under the sub.

149	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant and the others see the gigantic steel fingers sliding past the
	plastic windows.

150	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	The lifting fork is now disengaged from the sub, which floats free in
	the ampule.

151	INT. BUBBLE

	The sub is rocking none too gently on the surface of the vast glass-
	enclosed 'lake.' As Owens sees the ends of the immense prongs move
	past the bubble and continue upward:

					OWENS
				(down toward kiosk)
			We've got to submerge manually.
			Grant, open Valves One and Two on
			the bulkhead.

152	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant slips out of his harness and moves quickly to a butterfly valve
	marked <ONE> in the bulkhead. On the opposite side of the sub is a
	duplicate valve marked <TWO>. As Grant begins turning Valve One:

					DUVAL
			Here -- I'll get the other.

	Duval gets out of his harness and moves to the second valve. Grant
	watches him covertly while working at his own valve.

152A	MICHAELS

	As he sees the fluid rising toward the bow windows, he begins to
	respond with increasing fear.

153	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens' attention is on the gauges in the panel before him. They begin
	recording PRESSURE and DEPTH. The surface of the saline solution
	begins to flood upward.

154	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant and Duval at the valves, now fully open. Through the outer
	windows the water appears to move upward in relation to the sub, which
	continues submerging.

154A	MICHAELS

	Face sweating, his eyes reflect growing irrational terror as he stares
	at the rising fluid bubbling over the bow windows.

155	INT. BUBBLE

	As the depth gauges near the <30> mark:

					OWENS
			Close valves.

156	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant and Duval twist the valves shut. When both are done:

					GRANT
			Valves closed.

					OWENS'VOICE
				(from Bubble)
			Right. That's all for the present.

	As Grant and Duval move to their seats, Michaels opens his harness,
	slips out and hangs onto the bulkhead ledge, gasping for breath.

					DUVAL
			Doctor, what's wrong?

					MICHAELS
			I can't breathe!... I've got to get
			out!

					DUVAL
			It's too late now. We must go on.

					GRANT
			You'll feel better once we're
			underway.

	Michaels hangs on tighter to the bulkhead ledge, trying to control
	himself.

					MICHAELS
				(gasping)
			I -- I'm sorry... Claustrophia --
			buried alive -- two days -- air raid
			-- England... Thought I'd gotten
			over it. Please -- forgive me... I'm
			quite all right now...

	He sinks back into his seat. Grant helps him with his harness.

157	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	We now see the sub for the first time beneath the surface of the
	saline solution: a small capsule submerged at an even keel, about one-
	fourth of the way down in the huge transparent container. The Modules
	on which the ampule rests now return to floor level.

158	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM - P.O.V. CONTROL TOWER

	From his vantage point above, Carter can barely see the capsule in the
	ampule. He glances at Reid, who looks up from the monitors and nods.

					CARTER
				(to Technician)
			Phase Three.

	The Technician presses a button on the <MINI> panel, activating the
	<MIN> grid. The two blips flash on again, moving down the <MIN DIMEN>
	and <MIN SECS> co-ordinates.

159	<OUT>

160	THE MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	Instantly the disc of the Miniaturizer trained on the ampule begins to
	glow again. The light is reflected on the entire surface of the saline
	solution. The low hum resumes.

161	INT. PROTEUS

	Again we first get the <subjective> view of the shrinking process:
	Grant and the others see everything rushing away into an immensity of
	distance. And all the time the reflected light which has illuminated
	the interior of the sub is diminishing. We see the reason:

162	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	The <objective> view: the ampule has shrunk way below the
	Miniaturizer. Its far smaller size reflects only a spark of light. The
	sub is now only a particle, shrinking with the ampule. The Technicians
	and Nurse look on, grouped at the tripod which is beyond the range of
	the Miniaturizer.

162A	EXT. PROTEUS

	As the sub shrinks to invisibility, disappearing before our eyes:

163	EXT. AMPULE AND PROTEUS

	In its now fully reduced size, we see the ampule is actually a glass
	cylinder about two inches long and half-an-inch in diameter.

164	MIN GRID - P.O.V. CONTROL TOWER

	With Carter we see the two blips merge and hold. Instantly the lights
	in the Miniaturizer go off. The hum stops. A loud CLICK is heard. All
	look up at:

165	CLOSEUP - ELECTRIC MINUTE RECORDER

	A big <60> flashes on, and holds. (NOTE: We will see the same kind of
	clock, in varying sizes, in every set, flashing on the passage of time
	in <minutes>, from now to the end of the picture.)

166	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM - P.O.V. CONTROL TOWER

	The Zero Module now begins to rise above floor level. The ampule, on
	its reduced cork base, appears very tiny from this height.

					GARTER
				(to Wireless Operator)
			Inform Proteus they are at Full
			Reduction.

	The Technician taps out the Proteus' call letters. All wait, tense,
	for a response, as the tapping stops. They react, relieved, as they
	hear:

167	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant tapping out reply. Now, for the first time, we get the
	<microscopic> view of what all see from their various vantage points,
	distorted through liquid and the glass walls. The light is dim, all
	are finding it very hard to breathe in the unventilated craft. When
	the incoming message stops:

					GRANT
			[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]

168	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens glances at his wrist watch. Then he flips a switch. He watches
	the buttons on his panel. None light up. There is an anxious moment.
	Then the myriad lights on the panel begin to glow dully. The Minute
	Recorder on the panel begins to flash <59>.

169	INT. PROTEUS

	The lights become brighter. Cora, Duval and Michaels react with
	relief. The ventilators come on, permitting all to breathe easier.

170	INT. BUBBLE

	The buttons on the panel are now aglow. Owens makes a test: he touches
	a button which spins his seat, with the control panel before him, in a
	complete 360 degree turn within the Bubble.

171	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	After a brief message is heard coming in:

					COMMUNICATIONS AIDE
			Proteus On-Power.

	With relief, Carter turns to Reid.

					CARTER
			It's all yours, Don.

	Reid moves from the monitors, presses a button on the Control Section.

172	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	As the Technicians at the tripod hear:

					REID'S VOICE
				(over loudspeaker)
			Phase Four.

	The Technicians move the tripod so that the vertical arm is brought
	directly over the ampule and lowered, until the two sets of mechanical
	fingers clamp the cylinder firmly. Then the ampule is raised a few
	inches from its position on the module. The reduced cork base still
	encases the bottom. The Nurse and a Technician move to the ampule. He
	holds a small instrument case.

173	AT AMPULE

	When they reach the clamped ampule, the Technician opens the case. The
	Nurse takes out a plunger. Very carefully, she begins to insert it
	into the top of the ampule without disturbing the liquid. She then
	gently pulls away the cork remaining at the base of the ampule,
	revealing a small opening in the center. But owing to the pressure
	above, the liquid does not run out. She takes a needle out of the case
	and carefully fits it into the nipple. We now see the ampule is
	actually a hypodermic syringe.

174	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM - P.O.V. CONTROL TOWER

	Ried and Carter watch as the tripod is carefully wheeled across the
	room.

175	THE HYPODERMIC NEEDLE - MOVING SHOT

	The saline solution in the cylinder is sloshing slightly, despite the
	great care of those moving it.

176	INT. PROTEUS

	The sub is being rocked, causing everyone to hold on for support.

177	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens is trying to keep an even keel with his controls, now in full
	operation.

178	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	As two big doors slide open for the tripod to pass through:

179	EXTREME CLOSEUP - RADIAL LINES

	What appears to be a myriad number of radial lines crossing each other
	to form tiny squares over a domed surface is revealed to be:

180	BENES' HEAD

	Now shaved clean, the head is grid-marked for Stereo-encephalatomic
	measurements. In the background, the tripod is seen being wheeled in.

181	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	Moving with the hypodermic needle clamped in the tripod, we now get
	the full impact of the set: the floor is marked off for True North and
	South, with latitudinal and longitudinal lines. The modern operating
	table is set so that Benes' head corresponds with the exact position
	of the Arterial Head on the big grid map in the Main Ops Room. Benes
	is lying under a thermal blanket, covered up to the collarbone. Thin
	rubber pipes lead out from the blanket to the Central Thermal Unit
	under the operating table, out of the way of everyone. A TEAM OF
	GAUZE-MASKED SURGEONS AND ASSISTANTS stand grouped around the
	unconscious patient. In a semi-circle at the head of the bed, beyond
	the head, is a series of SMALL TRACKING DEVICES resembling radio-
	telescopes. They are remotely controlled. The Minute Recorder, in a
	prominent position now changes from <59> to <58>.

182	INT. OPERATING ROOM - P.O.V. CONTROL TOWER

	Reid and Carter are looking on. The Communications Aide stands at his
	side. They see the clamped hypo rolled up to the side of Benes' head
	and brought to a gentle stop.

183	BENES AND HYPO

	A small circle marks the exact spot of the injection. A SURGICAL AIDE
	swabs the area with alcohol.

184	CLOSE SHOT - ACTIVATOR

	It is brought down mechanically by use of worm-gears on the tripod
	toward the plunger, engaging it.

185	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Reid, watching the proceedings below:

					REID
				(to Wireless Operator)
			Contact Proteus --

186	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant takes down the message as it comes in. When message stops:

					GRANT
				(loud enough for Owens
				in Bubble)
			Stand by for injection!

	Suddenly the sub begins to rock hard. All hold on.

187	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens is manipulating controls, trying to keep an even keel.

188	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	The hypodermic is being angled by the precision gears of the tripod
	for the exact degree of injection. When this is accomplished:

189	BIG CLOSEUP - BENES' NECK

	The point of the needle approaches the exact spot, which we now see is
	marked off by a tiny cross within the circle on the Artery.

190	TECHNICIAN AT TRIPOD

	He presses the mechanical activator which sends the needle plunging
	into Benes' neck O.S.

191	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Instantly a warning klaxon goes off. It keeps on for a few seconds,
	then stops. Into the silence:

					REID
			Tracking.

	A Technician flips a switch.

192	INT. TRACKING POST - ON MAIN MONITOR IN CONTROL TOWER

	Four TECHNICIANS are seated before their radar screens, which show
	flat electronic lines, except one. This is picking up a blip.

192A	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	A Technician at the Control Panel throws on a switch. Another TV
	screen next to the Main Monitor goes on, revealing:

192B	CLOSE SHOT - BLIP ON TV SCREEN

	Duplicating the blip seen in the Tracking Post. We see the blip is
	heading down, at an angle identical with that of the hypo. CAMERA
	MOVES IN on the blip, and keeps moving until it fills our entire
	screen and becomes:

193	EXT. PROTEUS - WITHIN THE HYPO

	Diving at a terrific speed, steeply angled like the hypo, through the
	clear saline solution.

194	INT. PROTEUS

	All hold on as if riding a roller coaster at its steepest plunge.
	Suddenly all goes pitch-dark.

195	INT. BUBBLE

	Only the buttons are glowing, and the Minute Recorder, which now reads
	<57>. Owens throws a switch. Through the plastic windows the
	headlights of the sub are seen coming on. They pierce the darkness
	sufficiently to catch the side of the steel wall of the needle, which
	is rushing past at a tremendous speed, giving the effect of an
	enclosed channel. The beams gradually reveal:

196	HOLE OF NEEDLE - P.O.V. BUBBLE

	A small aperture in the distance, barely visible.

196A	HOLE OF NEEDLE - P.O.V. PRINCIPALS IN KIOSK

	Grant and the others see the opening at the end of the needle becoming
	bigger and bigger, apparently rushing toward them with great speed.

196B	EXT. END OF NEEDLE

	It fills the screen, an immense aperture in relation to the tiny sub
	which suddenly comes shooting out of it.

197-	<OUT>
198

199	MAIN OPS ROOM - P.O.V. CONTROL TOWER

	Reid and Carter observe the Grid Officer, wearing headphones and
	throat mike, move up to the Arterial Map with a tiny replica of the
	Proteus. He places it in the center or the huge channel in the neck,
	which depicts the Carotid Artery. The little sub is held magnetically
	on the grid. The Minute Recorder now reads <56>. Reid turns from the
	window, moves to the Map Case, which contains the same assortment of
	charts as in the sub's kiosk. Reid takes out an OVERLAY MAP OF THE
	HEAD AND NECK. He places it on a Radarscope. The blip shows it is
	traveling up the Carotid Artery.

200	LONG SHOT - ESTABLISHING - PROTEUS IN ARTERY

	The headbeams of the speeding sub reveal a world of dazzling color and
	beauty: the Arterial Stream. The walls of the vast amber-colored
	chamber are lost in the distance. Now the screen is filled with a
	floating wonderland: huge red corpuscles, whirling globules,
	platelets, particles, minuscule fragments drift with the stream,
	reflecting the entire spectrum of color.

201	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens is slowing down the sub. He gazes in awe at:

202	ARTERIAL ELEMENTS - THROUGH BUBBLE

	As the Proteus moves through the swirling conglomerations, the
	elements are parted, flow over the sub, bounce about it, forming new
	fluid galaxies in a universe of amber. And each grouping and
	regrouping, every mass and disc, though loosely linked, has a <rhythm
	of its own>. Thus the Corpuscular drift, the bouncing particles, the
	parting and the merging achieve a majestic choreography lyrical in
	quality, a fugue of motion.

203	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant and Cora, strapped in their seats, look on enthralled at the
	sheer beauty of the dancing wonder-world visible through the windows.
	Duval appears equally moved. Michaels observes with more clinical
	detachment.

204	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens has now slowed down the sub so that it moves slightly faster
	than the current, thus enabling him to maintain maneuverability.

					OWENS
			You may unfasten your belts...

205	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant, Cora and Duval quickly slip out of their harnesses, move to the
	bow for a maximum view of the scene. Michaels remains at the console,
	checking their course on the Neck and Head chart.

205A	EXT. PROTEUS - HEAD-ON SHOT

	Approaching camera, with the three people looking out of the bow
	windows in speechless wonder at what they behold.

206	<OUT>

206A	INT. PROTEUS - SHOOTING OVER THEIR BACKS

	For a moment the three gaze in silent awe at the dancing drift
	directly outside: nuclei are clearly visible in the cells; variegated
	tiny organisms sweep like cosmic dust through the orbits of the
	spinning globules. Their first sight of the interior world, with its
	beauty and rhythmic splendor has affected them deeply. Finally
	breaking the silence:

					DUVAL
				(quietly, as he looks
				on)
			The Medieval Philosophers were
			right... <Man> is the center of the
			Universe... We stand in the middle
			of Infinity, between Outer and Inner
			Space. And there's no limit to
			either.

					GRANT
			You mean Inner Space is endless?

					DUVAL
			Everything can be divided in half,
			no matter how minute.

	As the concept sinks in, Grant turns to look out again. Cora has never
	taken her eyes off what she sees through the bow windows.
					CORA
			I never...never imagined it could be
			anything...like this.

					GRANT
				(equally awed)
			I always thought it was nothing but
			red.

					DUVAL
			Only to the naked eye.
				(indicating)
			Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen
			-- give the stream its color. But
			the rest of the plasma's very much
			like sea water. An ocean of life...

					GRANT
			Quite a piece of plumbing.

					MICHAELS
			End-to-end, a hundred thousand miles
			long.

	Grant reacts. Of something up ahead:

					CORA
			Dr. Duval -- what could those be?

	The sub is suddenly engulfed by a mass of very tiny discs in chain-
	like combinations, which blot out the rest of the stream.

					DUVAL
				(now the scientist)
			Never saw <that>. Not even under an
			electron-mrcroscope.

					CORA
			They're much smaller than
			bacteria...

					MICHAELS
			Looks like the molecular structure
			of proteins.

					DUVAL
				(flatly)
			I don't agree. I think we ought to
			stop and take a sample.

					MICHAELS
			That's not the purpose of this
			mission.
				(up at Owens)
			Captain -- keep a straight course --
			until you're in the clear.

207	INT. BUBBLE

	Steering by instruments, Owens remains on course, the massed discs
	obstructing his view. Suddenly they float off, revealing:

					OWENS
			Arterial Wall to the right!

	With him we see:

208	LONG SHOT - ARTERIAL WALL

	Barely visible in the spill of light, a smooth endothelial wall is
	seen in the distance.

209	INT. PROTEUS

	Michaels consults his chart, brings the co-ordinates into place over
	two Arteries.

					MICHAELS
				(up at Bubble)
			What's our speed?

					OWENS' VOICE
				(from Bubble)
			Fifteen knots.

	Michaels makes a rapid calculation with his slide rule.

					MICHAELS
			We should reach the Branching Artery
			in two minutes.

	He switches on the REPEATER.

210	INT. BUBBLE

	The same REPEATER device is now active on the panel, reflecting the
	chart on the console below, with Michaels' navigational calibrators
	pointing to the intersect1ng Artery.

					MICHAELS' VOICE
				(from below)
			Keep the Wall at its present
			distance when you turn. That'll
			bring you safely into the middle of
			the Branch.

211	EXT. PROTEUS - IN ARTERY

	It cruises for a moment through the dazzling elements, the Arterial
	Wall in the distance. Then suddenly the sub accelerates and veers off
	course toward the Arterial Wall.

212	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens reacts, tries to slow down the sub and steer it back into the
	middle of the channel. But the speed increases, and the sub continues
	being swept toward the Wall.

213	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant and the others respond to the ever-increasing speed and the
	nearing Wall. They turn to Michaels, who, too, is aware of the change.

					MICHAELS
			Captain -- correct your course --
			and speed.

214	INT. BUBBLE

	Increasingly concerned as he works the controls and glances at the
	gauges:

					OWENS
			She won't respond! We're in some
			sort of current!

215	INT. PROTEUS

	Duval moves to Michaels.

					DUVAL
				(bewildered)
			But that isn't possible.

					MICHAELS
			Not in a sealed vessel like an
			Artery.
				(up at Owens)
			Captain -- something must be wrong
			with your controls!

					OWENS'VOICE
				(from Bubble)
			No -- it's a current! It's too
			strong -- I can't break out of it!

216	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens is trying to gain control of the sub. It begins to vibrate.
	Startled, Owens peers out, trying to determine the cause, but the
	beams reveal nothing ahead but an iridescent swirl of Arterial
	elements which bounce back the light. The buffeting increases rapidly.
	The Arterial Wall is clearly visible to the side, getting closer.

217	INT. PROTEUS - IN BOW

	Grant and Cora exchange startled looks as the membranes of the
	Arterial Wall suddenly become visible in the spill of light from the
	headbeams: its connective strands arch Gothic-like, lost in the
	darkness of the vaulted enclosure. The vibrations have now increased
	so that all must hold onto stanchions for support.

218	DUVAL AND MICHAELS

	Gripping the console for support. Through the plastic windows to the
	side they can see the Arterial Wall looming with menacing closeness.
	They look at each other, unable to fathom the cause of the now-greater
	vibrations.

219	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens is desperately trying to avoid a head-on collision with the
	Wall, but the sub won't respond to any of his manipulations. The Wall
	looms closer, the buffeting is worse.

220	INT. PROTEUS

	Smashing into the Wall directly ahead seems inevitable. Now the
	connective strands almost fill the windows. Cora closes her eyes, in
	anticipation of the fatal impact. And just when a collision appears
	inevitable, the sub veers, narrowly missing the cable-like strands,
	thick enough to support a bridge.

221	INT. BUBBLE - PARALLEL TO ARTERIAL WALL

	With Owens we see the sub swept close alongside the Wall. It is
	evident the craft is out of his control, and that whatever averted the
	collision has nothing to do with his attempt to steer it. The swirling
	mass of particles up ahead begins to part. The vibrations [LINE OF
	DESCRIPTION CUT OFF]

222	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant reacts as he sees the now-visible area ahead.

					GRANT
			Whirlpool!... Strap yourselves in!

	He grabs Cora, and against the buffeting, moves quickly to help her
	toward her seat. Duval and Michaels instantly take their seats at the
	console, begin getting into their harnesses.

223	LONG SHOT - THE WHIRLPOOL - P.O.V. BUBBLE

	Owens is appalled as in the distance, in the center of the channel, he
	sees what appears to be an immense liquid centrifuge rotating at great
	speed, the Arterial elements within it whipped about like the contents
	of a mixmaster. Now the buffeting is reaching its climax. The sub is
	inexorably approaching the rim of the whirlpool, with Owens
	desperately trying to steer away from it.

224	INT. PROTEUS

	Duval and Michaels are in their harnesses.

225	GRANT AND CORA

	Slowed up by the intense buffeting, Grant is now helping Cora into her
	seat. But before he can assist her into the harness, the sub is caught
	in the whirlpool. The instant effect is that of a Carnival Whip. The
	centrifugal force flings Cora out of her seat against the bulkhead.
	Grant is spun around and slammed against the opposite part of the
	bulkhead, and then onto the floor, with stunning impact.

226	DUVAL AND MICHAELS

	Pinned back in their seats, unable to get out and help as they see:

227	GRANT AND CORA

	Helpless in the whiplike rotation, Cora is thrust from the bulkhead
	onto the floor. Grant manages to grab a stanchion, hold on. With his
	free hand he reaches out for Cora, now prone on the floor. She extends
	her hand, but a foot separates them. They desperately reach out to
	each other as the centrifugal force pulls them farther and farther
	apart... Grant takes the only possible chance or reaching her: he lets
	go of the stanchion which sends him slamming against the base of the
	seat. He grips the leg of the seat with one hand and grabs Cora's
	waist with the other, just in time to prevent her from again being
	flung against the bulkhead. She holds onto him with all her strength.
	Grant strains to maintain his grip on the leg of the seat with his
	free hand, which in effect holds them both against the centrifugal
	whipping.

228	INT. BUBBLE - TO INCLUDE WHIRLPOOL

	Owens, too, is thrust back in his seat, powerless to move. The sub is
	completely at the mercy of the whirlpool. A gauge on the panel is
	registering in circles.

229	EXT. PROTEUS IN WHIRLPOOL - LONG SHOT

	Rotating at great speed, a tiny piece of flotsam caught in a
	cataclysmic force which is inexorably spinning it toward the vortex.

230	INT. SUB - CUTS OF PRINCIPALS

	Reacting to the ROAR of the massive turbulence and the whirling
	stream, which is seen through the windows. The centrifugal force keeps
	them pinned to their positions, with Grant holding onto Cora as
	before.

231	EXT. PROTEUS - NEARING VORTEX

	It is whipped around and down in the final circle -- and disappears
	through the rapidly rotating center...

232	INT. PROTEUS

	The steeply angled dive causes greater strain on Grant as he keeps his
	grip on Cora. Duval and Michaels are now thrust forward as if they
	were in a gondola of a shoot-the-shoots making its steepest descent.

233	INT. BUBBLE

	In a similarly forward-tilted position, with Owens we see the stream
	whipping by in a seemingly endless drop. And then ahead there suddenly
	appears:

234	LONG SHOT - FISSURE IN ARTERIAL WALL - P.O.V. BUBBLE

	An immense crack through which some red corpuscles are streaming in an
	eddy.

235	INT. PROTEUS

	From their prone positions on the floor, Grant and Cora react to the
	huge fissure looming through the windows. Duval and Michaels exchange
	looks, suddenly realizing what it signifies. Now the immense crack is
	directly ahead.

236	EXT. PROTEUS - FISSURE FROM WITHIN VEIN

	As the tiny sub is swept out into the stream, where the blue
	corpuscles are. Through the crack, a stream of red corpuscles are
	whipping by on the other side. The angle of the dive now becomes less
	oblique.

237	INT. BUBBLE

	The sub is caught in a less turbulent current, which results in its
	gradually losing its angle and speed, permitting Owens to steer it
	away from the center toward a more placid area.

238	INT. PROTEUS

	The sub is now level, moving much slower. Exhausted from the ordeal,
	Grant sees it is safe to let go of Cora. He helps her rise. She stares
	dazed at the bluish stream. Duval and Michaels, equally spent, begin
	to get out of their harnesses.

238A	EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - BENES' NECK

	PAN over to the Miniature Tracking Devices.

238B	TWO RADAR SCREENS - INT. TRACKING POST - MAIN OPS ROOM

	The blip goes from one machine to the other, where it doesn't belong.
	The Tracking Technician reacts, instantly presses a button.

239	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	A warning buzz from a TV Monitor. Reid and Carter respond to the
	SOUND. The Communications Aide comes over to them.

					COMMUNICATIONS AIDE
			Proteus Off Course, sir. They've
			picked up a blip in Quadrant 23,
			Level B. Reid moves quickly to the
			window overlooking the Main
			Operations Room, followed by Carter.

240	<OUT>

241	MAIN OPS ROOM - P.O.V. CONTROL TOWER

	Both see the Grid Officer below move the replica of the sub from the
	Carotid Artery to another channel near it within a quadrant marked 23.
	The channel is outlined in blue.

					REID
				(jolted)
			They've crossed over into the
			Jugular Vein!

					CARTER
			That can't be -- there's no direct
			connection between the two --

					REID
			Normally not. Unless it's an
			Arterio-Venous Fistula --

242	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant, Cora and Duval are grouped around Michaels at the chart. In the
	distance, the endothelial walls of the Jugular Vein are vaguely
	visible.

					GRANT
				(blankly)
			A what?

					MICHAELS
			A forced joining of an Artery and
			Vein. Must've happened when Benes
			was hurt.

					DUVAL
			Yes, a fistula too small to show up
			on the X-rays.

					CORA
			But big enough for us...

	In the stream outside, the bluish corpuscles are increasing in number.

					MICHAELS
				(up at Bubble)
			Captain -- head back into the
			Artery.

243	INT. BUBBLE

	As if it were a suicidal order:

					OWENS
				(brooking no argument)
			We could never fight that current
			it's physically impossible.

					MICHAELS' VOICE
				(from below)
			Then don't drift down further.

					OWENS
			I'll do what I can.

	As he manipulates the controls:

244	INT. PROTEUS

					GRANT
			If we can't go back, is there an
			alternate route?

					MICHAELS
			Yes... We can go forward on this
			course, but it means going directly
			through the Heart.

245	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens is appalled as he sees the route being traced on the Repeater,
	down the Jugular Vein toward the Heart. Before it can go any further:

					OWENS
				(alarmed)
			We can't do that! We decided in the
			Briefing -- the craft could never
			stand the turbulence!

246	INT. PROTEUS

	Michaels looks up from the chart, to the others.

					MICHAELS
			Yes, it would be a hundred times
			worse than the whirlpool.

	The others respond with grim realization of what it portends.

					GRANT
			That's just dandy. We can't go
			forward -- and we can't go back.

					MICHAELS
			I'm afraid there's only one thing we
			can do. Call off the mission.

					CORA
				(emotionally)
			Doctor...you can't mean that! Not
			when we've come this far. And if we
			give up, there'll be no way of
			saving Mr. Benes --

					DUVAL
			Dr. Michaels is right. We have no
			choice.

					MICHAELS
				(to Grant)
			Tell them to take us out.

					GRANT
			If there's any chance --

					MICHAELS
				(an order)
			Request removal, Mr. Grant.

	As Grant moves to the wireless:

247	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Carter and Reid are looking down into the MAIN OPS ROOM at the replica
	of the Proteus. It is in the same position as last seen in the Jugular
	Vein on the big grid.

					REID
			But we have no choice! We've got, to
			take them out!

					CARTER
				(adamantly)
			No...

	He turns away from the window as a message is heard coming in. With
	seeming unawareness of the incoming message, Carter looks at the
	Minute Recorder, It is flashing <51>.

					CARTER
			We still have fifty-one minutes.
			Leave them in.

					REID
			But it's hopeless! They can't go
			back and they can't go on. I tell
			you there's nothing else we can do
			but remove them!

					CARTER
				(the final word)
			Not until the very last second. We
			must think of something... Something
			to save the situation.

	The incoming message stops. The Communications Aide takes it from the
	Wireless Technician.

					COMMUNICATIONS AIDE
				(reading)
			Proteus reports trapped in Venous
			System. Requests removal, sir.

					REID
			Well, there it is... What do I tell
			them, General?

	Carter turns his back on him, moves to the window, stands looking down
	on the OPERATING ROOM. The scene below is almost a tableau, except for
	the moving Miniature Tracking Devices. The Surgical Team around the
	table stands watching, waiting. Benes lies motionless. Reid joins
	Carter. As they both look down at the patient, whose only chance of
	life is now in their hands:

					CARTER
				(finally)
			Doctor...without killing him -- how
			long could we stop his heart?

					REID
			The less time, the better.

					CARTER
			I know that. But what's the maximum?

					REID
			In his comatose state...and
			everything slowed down...no more
			than sixty seconds.

	Carter takes out a slide rule.

					CARTER
				(as he figures)
			At topspeed...and adjusting distance
			for Degree of Miniaturization --
				(getting answer)
			The sub should get through the Heart
			in fifty-seven seconds.

					REID
			That would give us only three
			seconds to revive him...

					CARTER
			What are the problems in stopping
			the Heart?

					REID
			Nothing -- compared to starting it
			up again.

	From the window, Carter can see the big Minute Recorder in the
	Operating Room flashing from <51> to <50>.

					CARTER
			We're wasting time, Colonel. Let's
			get on with it.

	The decision made, Reid takes command.

					REID
				(to Technician)
			Heart.

	Technician presses monitor button. As Carter moves to the
	Communications Aide, the HEART POST flashes on the TV screen.

					REID
				(to Heart Post)
			<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping
			the Heart.

					CARTER
				(to Communications Aide)
			Message to Proteus.

	Now both give their orders simultaneously. As Reid speaks, we can see
	the HEART POST swing into action on the TV screen: the big X-rays of
	Benes light up on panels, a CATHODE TUBE recording his heartbeat
	becomes activated. The Heart Specialist and several Heart Technicians
	are seen leaving the POST. Meanwhile, the Communications Aide is
	taking down Carter's message for transmission.

	Reid's Voice is heard as the Heart Technicians rig Benes for electric
	shock with a Cardio-Verter. They are removing the top third of the
	Thermal Blanket. When his chest is exposed, they apply electrodes to
	it. Then the Technicians take their places at the various Cardiac
	Instruments which are recording the pulse and configuration of the
	heartbeat. The last is visible on the big cathode tube of the
	Cardioscope, a replica of which was seen in the Heart Post.

	Carter and Reid are looking down at Benes in the OPERATING ROOM.

256	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	Benes is now rigged for electric shock. The Tracking Devices are
	concentrated on his chest. The Heart Specialist looks at the
	Cardioscope Screen. The big screen registers the beat of the Heart
	with a cathode-tube effect, each pulsation causing an electronic
	pattern. They are very slow, regular. The Heart Specialist nods to one
	of his Technicians who wears headphones. The latter presses a button.

261	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	A warning buzzer SOUNDS. The Communications Aide moves up to Reid and
	Carter at the Tracking Station Monitor and Radarscope.

					COMMUNICATIONS AIDE
			Ready for Cardiac Shock...

	Reid nods, acknowledging the message. As he removes the map off the
	Radarscope, Carter takes out an OVERLAY MAP OF THE HEART from the Map
	Case and places it on the Radarscope. The blip is seen progressing
	down the Vena Cava, leading to the entrance of the Heart.

				(pressing button)
			Stand by.

	Carter takes out a stop watch.

262	<OUT>

263	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant and the others respond as they begin to hear the SOUND of a
	distant boom-boom, slow and measured. It has an ominous effect. It
	quickly gets louder during:

					CORA
				(in awe)
			Listen...the Heart.

					MICHAELS
			Yes...slowed down agreat deal.

					GRANT
			Sounds like heavy artillery...

264	EXT. PROTEUS - IN VENA CAVA

	The SOUND of the Heart is now very loud, each measured boom like heavy
	artillery in a relentless barrage. The headbeams illuminate the long
	passage, the walls of which are lost to view.

265	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant and the others look on ahead, responding to the now-deafening
	beat, which increases as they near the source in the bluish channel.
	And then they react with wonder as they see:

266	LONG SHOT - TRICUSPID VALVE - P.O.V. PROTEUS

	In the distance, three huge membranes are billowing open, with
	tendrils resembling supporting strands of parachutes.

267	EXT. PROTEUS - IN THE ATRIUM

	The parachute-like membranes are at the end of the Atrium, the
	entrance of which the sub now approaches. As the membranes blossom
	fully, with a lovely effect, a big aperture is revealed. The dilation
	causes a big forward surge of the stream.

268	INT. PROTEUS

	All hold onto whatever is at hand as the sub is swept onward, rocking
	with the tidal wave. Now in the distance they can see:

269	LONG SHOT - TRICUSPID VALVE - P.O.V. PROTEUS

	It is beginning to close, the three membranes seemingly collapsing
	like three parachutes over the aperture. The boom of the beating Heart
	is massive, making any communication very difficult.

					MICHAELS
				(over the sound; up at
				Bubble)
			Captain! They'll stop it on the next
			beat!

270	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens at the controls, eyes on the now-closed membranes, as he hears:

					MICHAELS' VOICE
				(from below)
			As soon as the Valve opens again, go
			through and give it everything
			you've got!

271	TRICUSPID VALVE - P.O.V. BUBBLE

	The sub approaches the now seemingly solid wall. Owens steers directly
	to where he last saw the aperture. The closed membranes loom closer
	and closer, the headbeams illuminating the delicately threaded
	strands. Suddenly, the three membranes start billowing open again.

272	THE CARDIOSCOPE SCREEN

	The electronic pattern is recording the beat.

273	THE CARDIO-VERTER AND TECHNICIAN

	He immediately presses the triggers on two electrodes held against

	A tense silence pervades. The Heart Specialist and his Technicians
	concentrate on the various instruments. The Surgical Team stands by,
	immobile.

	Calibrated in seconds. The hand is now crossing <5>.

283	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	In the silence, Carter looks up from the stop watch in hand to check

	is a blip, indicating the sub's passage.

284	<OUT>

285	EXT. PROTEUS - IN RIGHT VENTRICLE

	Racing through a subterranean channel partially illuminated by the
	headbeams: a forest of tendrils, connecting huge roots which are the
	chordae tendineae extending into the walls. The color of the stream is
	predominately blue, and the overall effect is that of a weird
	wonderland. As the sub surges ahead at top speed:

	Everyone stands rooted.

287	INT. CONTROL TOWER - HEART MAP OVERLAY ON RADAR SCREEN

	The blip has crossed more than half the distance. Carter and Reid look

290	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Reid and Carter are tensely watching the Heart Map Overlay, as the

	EXHALATION indicate the return to breathing.

					REID
			What's his rate, Jack?

					LUNG SPECIALIST
				(over TV)
			Back to six per minute.

	Reid reaches out, knocks a cup of coffee off the Central Control
	Section, spilling it on his trousers.

					REID
			Damn. And I just had them cleaned.

321-	<OUT>
322

323	EXT. PROTEUS - IN PULMONARY ARTERY

	It is now flowing down to its normal speed. Through the smooth
	endothelial walls, we see the outlines of what appears to be a maze of
	mammoth conduits arching above and beneath the channel through which
	the sub is proceeding. Smaller conduits divide and subdivide from the
	circular immensity, to be lost in the distance. The effect is that of
	a multi-level series of Over and Underpasses.

324	INT. PROTEUS

	All are out of their harnesses. Grant, Duval and Cora are at the bow
	windows, looking out. Michaels is at the console, plotting their
	position on a detailed Map of the Lungs.

					GRANT
			I'd hate to get lost on that
			Freeway...

					DUVAL
			They all lead to the same place --
			the Lungs.

325	INT. BUBBLE

	In the light of the headbeams, Owens can see the Walls becoming
	increasingly narrow and more transparent. He glances at his Repeater,
	sees the Lung Chart reflected, with the co-ordinates pinpointing their
	position.

					OWENS
			Doctor -- the channel's getting
			awful narrow.

					MICHAELS' VOICE
				(from below)
			We're entering a Capillary. Remain
			in the middle.

					OWENS
				(fascinated)
			The Wall's transparent...

					MICHAELS' VOICE
				(from below)
			It's less than one ten-thousandth of
			an inch thick. And porous.

326	INT. PROTEUS - AT WINDOW

	Grant reacts as he sees a peculiar phenomenon: the big-bluish
	corpuscles which stream past the submarine are turning bright red the
	instant they impinge against the Capillary Wall. They keep moving on,
	in a constant flow, taking on their new color during:

					GRANT
				(amazed)
			Look at that...they're changing
			color...

					CORA
				(thrilled)
			Doctor -- is it possible? That we're
			seeing it happen before our eyes?

					DUVAL
				(quietly)
			Yes, Cora... We're the very first to
			see the <living> process.

	They both look out, too deeply moved to speak. Atter a moment:

					GRANT
			Mind letting me in on what's going
			on out there?

					DUVAL
			A simple exchange, Mr. Grant.
			Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide
			-- the moment they touch the Wall of
			the Lung -- in return for oxygen
			coming through from the other side.

					GRANT
			Don't tell me they're refueling...

					DUVAL
				(almost in a reverie)
			Oxygenation...

	Cora turns to look at him, feeling close in this shared moment. Grant,
	too, is moved by Duval's manner. Michaels glances up from the Lung
	Map.

					DUVAL
				(still gazing out)
			We've known it exists -- even though
			we never saw it...like the structure
			of the Atom... But to actually
			behold one of the miracles of the
			Universe -- the engineering of the
			Cycle of a Breath...

	He is too moved to continue.

					MICHAELS
				(into the silence)
			Nothing miraculous about it. Just an
			interchange of gases. The end
			product of five hundred million
			years of Evolution.

					DUVAL
			You can't believe all that's
			accidental? That there isn't a
			Creative Intelligence at work --

	Before Michaels can answer, they hear a warning buzzer SOUND in the
	Bubble above.

327	INT. BUBBLE

	The buzzer is going while a red light is flashing on the panel. Owens
	looks startled at:

328	PRESSURE GAUGE ON PANEL

	The indicator is dropping rapidly toward a red horizontal line
	delineating the danger level. Owens flicks the button off and on
	rapidly, as if testing the mechanism, but the indicator keeps
	dropping. He shuts off the buzzer.

					OWENS
				(imperatively)
			Grant.

329	INT. PROTEUS

	All look up toward the Bubble, at the urgency of his tone. Grant moves
	from the bow toward the console during:

					GRANT
			What is it, Skipper?

					OWENS' VOICE
				(trom Bubble)
			We're losing pressure in the
			Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual,
			right over there.

	Grant can see him pointing to the Manual Control Section at the rear
	of the kiosk.

					GRANT
			Right.

	He moves quickly to:

330	MANUAL CONTROL SECTION

	Over a series of controls are numerous gauges. The indicators marked
	TANK RT and TANK LT show the left tank is rapidly losing pressure.

					GRANT
				(up at Bubble)
			The left tank's losing pressure.

331	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens presses a button and swivels around. With him we see:

332	P.O.V. - EXT. STERN OF PROTEUS

	A stream of large air bubbles is pouring out behind them.

333	INT. BUBBLE

	Startled, Owens presses the button which swivels him back.

					OWENS
			Grant! Get up here, quick!

	He starts getting out of his harness.

334	INT. PROTEUS

	As Grant moves toward the Bubble, he passes Duval and Cora, who are
	now looking toward the stern.

					CORA
				(with apprehension)
			Air bubbles!... Doctor --

					DUVAL
			No danger of an embolism. At our
			reduced scale, they're much too
			minute to prove fatal to Benes.

335	INT. BUBBLE

	As Grant appears, Owens is slipping out of his harness.

					OWENS
			There's a short in the valve. Take
			over.
				(of controls)
			Steers like an airplane.

	Grant nods as he gets into the seat. Owens starts quikly down the
	kiosk, leaving Grant at the controls.

336	INT. PROTEUS

	Cora and Duval, at the window, watch anxiously as Owens moves to the
	Manual Control Panel. Michaels remains at the console, also deeply
	concerned. Owens opens the Circuit Panel, revealing a maze of wires
	and circuit breakers. Only someone with an intimate knowledge of the
	sub could posslbly find the right one. Owens does quickly. He trips a
	switch, shuts the panel. He turns, sees their anxious looks.

					OWENS
			Well, that takes care of the valve.
			It was probably caused by that
			electric shock.

					MICHAELS
				(to Owens)
			Was there any damage?

					OWENS
			Not to the valve. But we've lost too
			much air to make it the rest of the
			way.

					DUVAL
			What do you propose we do, Captain?

					OWENS
			Nothing we can do. We must have full
			tanks to continue.

	He starts up toward the Bubble, leaving the three staring at each
	other in consternation.

337-	<OUT>
338

339	INT. BUBBLE

	As Grant slips out of the seat and Owens resumes at controls:

					GRANT
			Any reserve air?

					OWENS
			Enough to breathe, but that's all.

	Grant starts down.

340	INT. PROTEUS

	He steps into the cabin in time to hear:

					DUVAL
				(ironically)
			Just a few cells away from a vast
			air chamber -- one of the countless
			Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't
			get enough to fill a microscopic
			tank.

					GRANT
			Maybe we can...
				(as they look at him in
				bewilderment)
			Skipper, is there a snorkel on this
			sub?

					OWENS' VOICE
				(from Bubble)
			Yes, there is.

					GRANT
				(to Michaels and Duval)
			Could I run a tube through that
			Wall, without harming Benes?

					MICHAELS
			At this size, I would certainly
			think so.

					GRANT
			If those Corpuscles can take on air,
			no reason why we can't.
				(to Duval)
			All we have to do is hook up the
			snorkel to that air chamber you were
			talk1ng about, and when Benes
			inhales, there should be plenty of
			pressure to force the oxygen into
			the tank.
				(up at Owens)
			How's that sound to you, Skipper?

341	INT. BUBBLE

	As Owens considers the possibility:

					OWENS
			It's a dangerous procedure. If I
			miss the timing, we could explode
			the tanks... But I'm willing to try
			it.

342	INT. PROTEUS

					MICHAELS
			Yes, by all means. We must try it.

					OWENS' VOICE
				(from Bubble)
			It'll be safer if everybody leaves
			the sub.

	Grant moves to the aft compartment, opens the door, goes into:

343	INT. LAB AND STORAGE SECTION

	As he moves to compartment containing the Underwater Gear, he is
	jolted by something he sees o.s.

344	LASER OVER WORKING COUNTER

	It is swinging loose on one hook, its plastic cover off.

345	INT. LAB AND STORAGE SECTION

	Grant takes a step toward it, stops.

					GRANT
			Cora!

	After a moment, she appears. She follows his look toward the laser,
	reacts aghast.

					GRANT
			Looks like you didn't batten it down
			too well.

					CORA
			But I did. I'm positive!

	Duval and Michaels appear in the doorway in time to hear:

					GRANT
			Then how come it worked loose?

					CORA
			I have no idea.

					DUVAL
			Cora, is something wrong with the
			laser?

					CORA
				(distraught)
			I don't know yet, Doctor. And I
			won't know until I test it.

					GRANT
			That'll have to wait until after
			we're refueled.

	As he takes out the Underwater Gear and passes it to the three:

					CORA
				(righting laser)
			I can't imagine how it possibly
			could have come loose. I distinctly
			recall fastening it with all four
			bolts --

					MICHAELS
			It must have been jarred loose
			during the whirlpool.

	Grant and Michaels exchange looks, as if neither are satisfied with
	the explanation.

					GRANT
				(of gear)
			Well, let's get into these as
			quickly as possible.

	He leads the way out. Michaels and Duval follow. Left alone, Cora
	starts to unzip her jumper, revealing she is wearing her swim suit
	beneath. Her eyes remain on the laser, now her prime source of
	anxiety...

345A	INT. MAIN OPS ROOM

	Starting on the grid map, we see the sub in the channel of the
	Pulmonary Artery. CAMERA then TILTS DOWN to the Radarscope, where the
	blip is blinking on and off in one place, without moving.

346	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	On the monitor at the Map Table, we see the INTERIOR OF THE TRACKING
	POST, where the same blip is in the identical stationary position on
	the Radarscreen. PULL BACK to include Reid staring at the blip on the
	monitor. Carter is pacing on the other side of the table.

					REID
			They've stopped -- on the outer
			limits of the Right Lung...

	Carter looks at the Minute Recorder. It reads <42>.

					CARTER
			Another delay... With only forty-two
			minutes left.

					REID
			It'll be close -- but there's still
			a margin of safety.

					CARTER
			Let's find what the devil's holding
			them up!
				(to Wireless Technician)
			Contact the Proteus!

	As the message is heard being tapped out:

					REID
				(glancing at Monitors;
				none are on)
			It must be some kind of mechanical
			difficulty.

	The tapping stops. As they wait for an answer, Carter pours a stream
	of sugar into his coffee.

					REID
			I told you to cut down on the sugar.

					CARTER
			I can't help it. I'm just weak, I
			guess.

347-	<OUT>
349

350	INT. PROTEUS - AT DOOR OF ESCAPE HATCH

	All have stepped out of their jumpers and are now revealed in their
	swim suits except Owens, who remains in the Bubble. The suits are
	form-fitting, antiseptic-looking, with a Breather Pack strapped to the
	back. Duval is tightening Cora's pack. Grant is checking Michaels'
	pack. The latter looks in rear at the small hatch, visible through the
	open door. The wireless starts tapping again.

					CORA
				(of tapping wireless)
			Shouldn't you answer that?

					GRANT
				(putting on swim mask)
			Not now. We need air, not greetings!

	He motions Michaels to precede him into the hatch. Face reflecting his
	irrational fear, Michaels puts his swim mask over his fear. But he
	freezes at the door, unable to step into the small hatch. Grant and
	Duval exchange looks.

					GRANT
			Let's go, Doctor.

	Michaels forces himself into the Escape Hatch. Grant follows, closing
	the door.

351	INT. ESCAPE HATCH

	There is only space for the two. Michaels cowers against the wall,
	palms pressed against the metal, fighting against another seizure of
	his phobia. Grant opens a valve. Liquid starts pouring into the hatch
	from several ports. When it is up to their chins, Grant bends down to
	unlock the ventral hatch.

352	EXT. PROTEUS

	Grant drops out of the hatch. Michaels follows. Grant then closes the
	hatch. With Grant in the lead, they swim toward:

353	EXT. TOP OF PROTEUS

	Grant reaches the snorkel, looks toward Bubble.

354	INT. BUBBLE

	Where Owens has now swiveled so that he faces the stern. Owens sees
	Grant signal to proceed. Owens presses button on SNORKEL RELEASE.

355	EXT. PROTEUS

	The snorkel starts rising. When the tube is a few feet above the sub,
	Grant takes the bobbing end, holds it under one arm, and starts
	swimming with his free arm toward the Capillary Wall on the left.

356	EXT. SIDE OF PROTEUS

	As Grant swims by with the end of the unreeling tube, Michaels joins
	him. Then Duval and Cora, who are now coming out of the ventral hatch.
	All swim to the nearby Capillary Wall. (NOTE: During the following,
	their action is complicated by the big Corpuscles flowing by in a
	steady stream, taking on oxygen and bumping into them.) They reach:

357	EXT. ALVEOLAR CREVICE

	It shimmers with the liquid that seems to cover it like a door of
	reflecting glass. The opening is just large enough for all to look
	within. They see:

358	INT. ALVEOLUS

	A vast conical volcano, the upper part lost to view. Numerous
	outcroppings of immense crags are visible on all sides.

					GRANT
			It's full of rocks!

	(NOTE: During all Swimming Sequences, we will hear the Speaker's Voice
	<only> via the AUDIO PICKUP within the swimming mask of the one who
	responds vocally.)

					MICHAELS
			In a way -- yes. Those are
			impurities imbedded in the Lung
			after a lifetime of 'Civilization.'
			Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks
			of dust --

					GRANT
			Well, we better get on with it.

	He starts shoving the front of the snorkel through the vertical liquid
	entrance. To his startled surprise, it immediately comes flying out
	with great force. Michaels and Duval grab it in time to prevent the
	snorkel from snaking off down the stream.

					MICHAELS
			Careful! There is a tremendous air
			pressure in there -- in relation to
			our size!

	Grant grabs hold or the front part again.

					GRANT
			I'll try to hold it from the other
			side of the wall, while you push
			from out here. Maybe that'll do it.

					CORA
			You can't --it's too dangerous --

					MICHAELS
			Yes -- with all that pressure, and
			suction within --

					GRANT
			There's no other way. Tie my safety
			line to the sub.

					DUVAL
			Here, let me have it.

	Grant takes out his safety line, hooks it onto his suit. Duval starts
	swimming with the other end back to the Proteus.

359	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens is eyeing the pressure gauges anxiously. He reacts as he sees:

360	EXT. PROTEUS - P.O.V. BUBBLE

	With Owens we see Duval is nearing the sub, the safety line strung out
	behind him.

361	EXT. PROTEUS - AT VENTRAL HATCH

	Duval hooks Grant's safety line onto a ring for the purpose, signals:

362	EXT. ALVEOLUS CREVICE

	Grant acknowledges signal. The Alveolar Wall can be seen dilating
	slightly.

					GRANT
			All right now -- push the snorkel
			through as soon as I get inside.

					MICHAELS
				(eyes on Wall)
			Walt for the lull -- between the
			time he inhales and exhales.

	As the dilating stops:

					MICHAELS
			<Now>!

	Grant pushes quickly through the shimmering entrance.

363	INT. ALVEOLUS

	He has literally transposed himself into another element: air. There
	is no turbulence, no sound. Instantly he props his feet against both
	sides of the entrance. The snorkel is shoved through. As he grabs it
	and holds, a breath is heard starting. Only Grant can hear the ensuing
	sound.

364	CAPILLARY SIDE OF ALVEOLUS

	Duval now joins Michaels and Cora. They hold against the increasing
	pressure from within. Grant can be seen straining on the other side
	against the enormous wind pressure.

365	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens' finger is on the button of the MASTER PRESSURE GAUGE, waiting.
	Tha indicator is quickly swinging toward FULL.

366	INT. ALVEOLUS

	The wind is rising to gale force. Grant is holding on with all his
	strength to the end of the snorkel. The others can be seen pushing
	from their side, to keep the tube from flying out.

367	MASTER PRESSURE GAUGE

	As the indicator hits the FULL position:

368	AIR TANK CONTROL BUTTON

	Owens' finger presses down while:

					OWENS' VOICE
				(o.s.)
			Full!

369	INT. ALVEOLUS

	In response, Grant lets go of the snorkel, which is instantly whipped
	out. Buffeted by the howling wind, he now tries to get out. But the
	hurricane causes Grant to lose his balance. He falls, slammed against
	the outcroppings by the force of the wind. Finally the lull comes.
	Instantly, Grant starts climbing back, hand over hand, using the rope
	as one would in scaling a mountain. The crevice is still far up ahead
	when suddenly a new breath starts in the upward direction. Grant is
	caught in the tremendous suction of the exhalation and is pulled
	toward the interior of the Lung.

370	SAFETY CLASP ON SUB RING

	The Safety Clasp breaks off at the end of the nylon.

371	EXT. ALVEOLUS CREVICE

	Michaels, Duval and Cora react as the line snakes past them through
	the crevice.

					CORA
				(horrified)
			He's gone!

372	INT. ALVEOLUS

	The suction sends Grant flying upward, past the crevice, with the
	safety line trailing after him. The wind whips him toward a fantastic
	height. Finally he hits:

373	COLUMNAR CILIA

	Long stalks, with a waving motion that makes it resemble a vast field
	of wheat. Grant is seen flying through it, until he is lost from view.
	Then as the wind subsides:

374	EXT. ALVEOLUS CREVICE

	The three are waiting, tense.

					DUVAL
				(to Michaels)
			What can we do?

					MICHAELS
			Nothing -- against all that force.

					CORA
			But we just can't leave him in
			there! What'll happen to him?

					MICHAELS
			We'll know -- in the next breath...

	They react as they see the Alveolar Wall starting to dilate again,
	signaling the advent of another breath.

375	INT. ALVEOLUS - SHOOTING UP

	The wind starts howling. And then Grant is seen at a vast height,
	plummeting down. Part of the way he hits a spongy area, bounces, is
	caught up again by the blasting wind, hits another spongy section,
	with a big outcropping of "rock."

376	EXT. OUTCROPPING

	Fighting the gale, he manages to snake his safety line around the big
	rock. As he hangs on, he sees:

377	P.O.V. - PRINCIPALS AND SUB - THROUGH CREVICE

	Not too far above, with rocks between.

378	GRANT

	He waits it out until the howling tornado subsides. Then in the lull,
	he releases himself quickly and clambers toward the opening. He
	thrusts himself through the crevice, just as another breath begins.

379	EXT. ALVEOLUS CREVICE

	The others grab him, pull him through all the way before he can be
	sucked back.

380	EXT. CAPILLARY WALL - P.O.V. BUBBLE

	Owens is relieved to see the four start swimming back to the sub.

381	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Carter is pacing in the heavy silence. Reid is watching the monitors.
	Carter glances at the Minute Recorder. It flashes to <37>. Suddenly
	the tapping starts. Tense, they wait for the message. It is brief. As
	the Wireless Operator tears it off the pad, Carter takes it.

					CARTER
				(reading)
			'Proteus reports putting in to
			refuel air. Proceeding through the
			Pleural Cavity.'
				(suddenly realizing)
			Refuel air?

	As Reid starts to remove the OVERLAY MAP OF THE HEART from the
	Radarscope:

					REID
			Why not? They had a choice of over a
			billion Alveoli...

382	LONG SHOT - PROTEUS IN PLEURAL CAVITY

	The lone voyager is proceeding in a calm sea. Its headbeams reflect a
	yellowish cast, which becomes increasingly warm and sunny during the
	scene.

383	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens glances at the Repeater. The co-ordinates show the sub is
	traveling toward the apex of the Pleura, to the north, which is
	bounded by an undefined area simply marked "Lymphatic." A sense of
	absolute serenity seems to pervade. Abruptly:

384	SMASHED LASER TRANSISTOR

	as it is placed on the edge of an array of disassembled parts.

385	INT. LAB SECTION - WORKBENCH

	Cora is putting the tiny transistor down. Then, with a tweezers, she
	takes out the last part: a hair-like strand of wire. To Duval, who is
	beside her:

					CORA
			And a broken trigger-wire...

386	INT. LAB AND STORAGE SECTION

	Grant and Michaels are standing at the doorway, reacting to:

					DUVAL
				(fingering the parts)
			A smashed transistor. No way to fire
			the lamp... Well, that's the end of
			the laser.

	Grant and Michaels exchange looks.

					GRANT
				(to Cora)
			You must carry spare parts --

					CORA
			Not anything built into the chassis.
				(with guilt)
			If it hadn't come loose --

					MICHAELS
			That's beside the point now.
				(to Duval)
			I don't see the sense of going on.

					CORA
			We must!

					MICHAELS
			With no laser --

					GRANT
				(to Duval)
			Isn't there another surgical
			procedure you can try?

					DUVAL
			No, there's no other way.

	Before Michaels can answer, Grant squeezes into the compartment, picks
	up the broken transistor.

					GRANT
				(to Cora)
			If you had a transistor about this
			size and power output, and a thin
			enough wire --
				(of laser)
			-- could you piece it together?

					CORA
			No, it requires such absolute
			precision --

					GRANT
			A surgeon might...

					CORA
			Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If
			we had the parts.

					GRANT
			I've got a source. All I have to do
			is tap it.

	At their blank looks, he turns and moves into:

387	INT. PROTEUS

	As he goes to the wireless and begins to unscrew the panel, Michaels
	suddenly realizes:

					MICHAELS
			Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not
			going to dismantle the wireless?

					GRANT
			Just one little transistor and a
			circuit wire is all it takes.

					MICHAELS
			But that'll knock out our
			communications! We'll be cutting
			ourselves off from the outside.

					GRANT
			They'll still be able to track us by
			radar, because of the radioactive
			fuel.

	He moves to the panel, revealing a maze of electronic parts.

					GRANT
			Well, sir? Which is it? The
			wireless, or Benes' life?

					MICHAELS
				(finally)
			Send the following message...

387A	<OUT>

388	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	A LUNG OVERLAY MAP is now on the Radarscope. Reid and Carter see the
	Grid Officer is moving the replica of the Proteus into the next
	quadrant of the Pleural Cavity.

	An incoming message is heard. The Wireless Operator takes down the
	message. As the tapping stops:

					CARTER
				(reading)
			'Cannibalizing wireless to repair
			laser. This is last message.'

	Reid and Carter exchange grim looks.

					CARTER
			Incommunicado... Now they're really
			on their own.

	Reid moves to the window overlooking the OPERATING ROOM. As he looks
	down on Benes and the little Tracking Devices weaving back and forth
	across his chest:

					REID
				(quietly)
			We can still track them -- but
			that's all we can do.

	Carter joins him. As they both look down:

					CARTER
			Something told me I got into the
			wrong end of the bus1ness.
				(answering look)
			<Inner> Space...

389	<OUT>

390	TINY TRANSISTOR AND STRAND OF WIRE

	In the palm of Grant's hand. Cora's fingers delicately pick up both.

					CORAlS VOICE
				(o.s.)
			The transistor will do. But the
			wire's much too thick.

391	INT. LAB AND STORAGE SECTION

	Duval is picking up the original wire with the tweezers and placing it
	on a contrasting surface during:

					GRANT
			Nothing closer.

	As Cora turns to the workbench:

					DUVAL
			I may be able to scrape it thin
			enough. Cora, get me a number eleven
			scalpel.

	She puts the transistor and wire down on the workbench and moves to
	open a medical kit. Duval takes the wire and places it between two
	small clamps on the workbench. Cora extracts a scalpel, gives it to
	him. Duval swings a magnifying glass over the strand as Cora trains a
	light on the wire. Duval bends over. Peering through the magnifying
	glass, he slowly begins to scrape the strand with the scalpel.

392	GRANT AND MICHAELS

	They exchange looks. Then Grant turns away.

393	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant leads the way to the bow. As they look out:

					GRANT
			Looks like the sea, at dawn.

					MICHAELS
			We're safe -- long as it remains
			that color...
				(answering look)
			We're in the Pleural Sac.
				(indicating arched dome
				far above)
			It keeps the Lungs from rubbing
			against the Wall of the Chest up
			there. When those membranes become
			inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy
			-- and a wracking cough.

					GRANT
			Cough? If he can kick up a storm by
			just <breathing> --

					MICHAELS
			His Pleura's in fine condition. It
			should be clear sailing through this
			area.

					GRANT
			Let's hope... So far, somebody's
			tried to sabotage this mission
			twice.

	He glances back in the direction of Duval. Both drop their voices so
	that Duval and Cora can't hear:

					MICHAELS
				(startled)
			Sabotage? I don't understand...

					GRANT
			I saw the laser just before we
			started. It was fastened down
			securely. You don't suppose what
			happened was an 'accident?' Any more
			than my safety line snapping after
			it was tied off to the sub?

					MICHAELS
			You have no right to blame Duval --

					GRANT
			That line was tampered with...

					MICHAELS
				(agitated)
			I -- I don't know what to say. I
			know he's under a cloud, but there's
			not a more dedicated man in the
			entire medical profession.

					GRANT
			You still never know what's going on
			in anyone's mind...

					MICHAELS
				(with finality)
			I can't believe it. Whatever
			happened was an accident.

					GRANT
			Two in a row?

					MICHAELS
			It's possible --

	Grant looks at the Minute Recorder. It now reads <32>.

					GRANT
			Thirty-two minutes left...
				(back to Michaels)
			But chances are we won't have to
			wait that long for try-number three.

					OWENS' VOICE
				(from above)
			Look at those Walls up ahead!

	Grant and Michaels look out through the bow. Grant reacts amazed as he
	sees:

394	ENTRANCE OF LYMPHATIC DUCT - P.O.V. BOW

	A huge tube-like structure looms up. The Walls are transparent,
	composed of a single layer of squamous cells with round nuclei. Since
	the color of the stream is now predominately yellow, the globs create
	the impression of innumerable:

					GRANT'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			<Poached eggs>?!

395	INT. BOW

	As Michaels moves to the console:

					MICHAELS
				(with smile)
			We're entering the Lymphatic System.
			Those are nuclei of cells, lining a
			Duct.

					GRANT
				(puzzled)
			I always had an idea there was only
			one System. The Circulatory.

					MICHAELS
			The Lymphatic System drains off
			excess fluid from the Tissues.
			Without it, we'd all swell up like
			balloons. He reaches the console,
			begins to take out a new chart.

396	INT. BUBBLE

	The new chart suddenly becomes visible on the Repeater as it is spread
	out below. Owens reacts to the labyrinth.

					OWENS
			Looks like quite a Navigation
			problem...

	The co-ordinates are seen being moved to indicate the sub is passing
	through a Lymphatic Duct on its way to the first Node, which is
	followed by a series of others, strung out like sausage links.

					MICHAELS' VOICE
				(from below)
			Only until we get through the Nodes
			-- the Lymphatic Glands. Follow your
			present compass heading.

397	EXT. PROTEUS - LYMPHATIC DUCT

	As it courses easily through the sunny stream, to suddenly emerge
	into:

398	EXT. LYMPHATIC NODE

	A startlingly different world. The headbeams reveal what appears to be
	an underwater marshland: a tangle of reticular fibers which wave with
	the gentle cross currents seeping through the mesh. Weird bacterial
	forms drift by, moving in groups like raiding parties. The yellowish
	light of the Lymphatic Stream still filters through.

399	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens is forced to slow down as he carefully begins to thread his way
	through the tangle, trying not to brush against the tendrils. But for
	all of Owens' care, the nose of the sub breaks some fibers as it
	nudges through the increasingly narrow spaces of the brambly mesh.

400	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant reacts as he sees the broken fibers drift against the bow
	windows, and then become momentarily entangled around them. When the
	tendrils clear the windows, he looks back to the stern.

401	FLOATING TENDRILS - P.O.V. GRANT

	They are floating aft. Some adhere to the propulsion section, trailing
	out so that Grant can see them.

402	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant reacts, looks back and up toward Bubble.

					GRANT
			Skipper, you're picking up seaweed
			-- or whatever it is.

					MICHAELS
				(reassuringly; at chart)
			Reticular fibers. We ought to be
			clear of them soon.

403	EXT. LYMPHATIC NODE - P.O.V. BUBBLE

	With Owens, we see the way ahead is more tangly. As he keeps slowing
	down to get through safely:

					OWENS
				(anxiously)
			I hope so, Doctor. If that stuff
			clogs the vents, the engine'll
			overheat --

	He breaks off as a big clump of fibers is torn loose, for all his
	skillful steering.

404	EXT. UNDERSIDE OF SUB

	The mass of tendrils drifts down the length of the underside. Part of
	the clump adheres to the ventral hatch, another section twines around
	the exhaust: In so doing, it snags on the brambles beneath.

405	INT. LAB AND STORAGE SECTION

	Scalpel poised over the wire, Duval reacts as the Proteus momentarily
	jars while it pulls loose. He exchanges looks with Cora, who is
	holding the lamp.

406	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant glances back toward the open door of the aft compartment,
	realizing the danger of trying to repair the laser now. He looks at
	Michaels, who is bent over the chart.

					GRANT
			Doctor --

	He is interrupted by a loud WHAM against the bow windows. Startled,
	both look off, see:

407	EXT. LYMPHATIC NODE - BEGINNING OF BATTLE BETWEEN BACTERIA AND
	ANTIBODIES - P.O.V. PRINCIPALS

	Flashing reflected light from the headbeams, elongated crystalline
	structures with rod-like projections which make linkage possible, are
	whipping against the bow windows where they have trapped a mass of
	ferocious-looking large Bacteria. The smaller crystalline Anti-bodies
	are rapidly coupling with others that speed in to join the fray. The
	Bacteria fight back with their flagella, in a death struggle.

408	VIEW OF BATTLE FROM INT. BUBBLE

	Owens ducks involuntarily as the linking Antibodies and the Bacteria
	slam against the Bubble in such numbers and sizes as to make the way
	ahead virtually invisible. As a result, the sub tears through a clump
	of fibers like a scythe.

409	INT. PROTEUS

	Duval appears in the doorway.

					DUVAL
			What's causing all that -- ?

	He breaks off as he sees the Antibodies and Bacteria whipping against
	the windows. Cora appears behind him, gasps at the sight of the
	monsters locked in battle.

					GRANT
			Looks like somebody declared war.

					MICHAELS
			Just what it is. Antibodies,
			destroying Bacteria -- or any other
			foreign invader that threatens the
			System.

410	BIG CLOSEUP - ONE ANTIBODY AND BACTERIUM

	As both slam and hold against the bow windows in a life-and-death
	struggle. An amazing phenomenon is taking form: Antibodies are hooking
	up at the rods to completely encase the Bacterium -- and the geometric
	forms fit the antagonist <perfectly>.

					CORA'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			Look -- it's taking its exact shape!

					GRANT'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			Like hand-in-glove.

					MICHAELS' VOICE
				(o.s.)
			Much closer. Like two atoms.

	Now the crystalline geometric links start pressing together with
	inexorable force. The Bacterium fights back with its flagella. Then
	suddenly it goes limp. As the destroyed Bacterium drifts off, another
	mass of virulent monsters smashes into the windows and are instantly
	embattled with a swarm of Antibodies that come linking up. Now the
	SOUND of the battle can be heard along the entire length of the sub.
	Meanwhile, the sub is jarred hard, as it breaks through another clump
	of entangling fibers. The sound and sight of the mortal battle
	increases in intensity, as does the forced passage during:

					DUVAL
				(with glance at Minute
				Recorder)
			We'll never get there in time, at
			this rate.

					GRANT
				(to M1chaels)
			Isn't there another route? So we can
			by-pass all this?

					DUVAL
			Yes...
				(to Michaels)
			We can transfer over to the Inner
			Ear, and go by way of the
			Endolymphatic Duct.

					GRANT
				(to M1chaels)
			Then why not take it?

					MICHAELS
			It's infinitely more hazardous than
			going this way. Once we enter the
			Inner Ear, <any> sound in the
			Operating Room will be disastrous.
			At our reduced size, the vibrations
			inside the Ear would have a
			shattering effect.

	Another jar of the sub, and more smashing against the hull and bow
	windows, as the battle of the Antibodies and Bacteria reaches a
	climax.

					GRANT
				(over sound)
			They're tracking us Topside. Once
			they see where we're going, I'm sure
			they'll take every precaution.

					MICHAELS
			Let's hope they realize the danger.
				(up at Bubble)
			Captain, I'll give you a new compass
			heading.

411	BENES' SHAVED HEAD

	With the radial lines in the f.g. Beyond, the Tracking Devices are now
	weaving back and forth in the area of the Neck.

411A	INT. MAIN OPS ROOM

	CAMERA on the TRACKING POST, PICKING UP the Four Technicians before
	their Radarscreens. CAMERA then TILTS UP to the big grid map. We see
	the Grid Officer above, positioning the replica of the Proteus in the
	Inner Ear.

412	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Reid and Carter are looking down at the OPERATING ROOM. They turn as
	the Communications Aide announces:

					COMMUNICATIONS AIDE
			Proteus turning in Quadrant 73.

	Reid and Carter move to window overlooking the MAIN OPS ROOM. They
	exchange relieved looks as the Grid Officer moves the sub to the
	lateral quadrant, in the Neck.

					REID
				(with relief)
			At last they're heading for the
			Inner Ear...

	Carter glances at the Minute Recorder. It flashes <27>.

					CARTER
				(biting into unlit
				cigar)
			About time they realized they'd
			never make it the other way.

	Reid moves to the Control Section, presses button.

413	<OUT>

414	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	The Surgical Team and the Technicians exchange looks as they hear:

					REID'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			The Proteus is about to enter the
			Inner Ear... You are not to walk,
			talk, or make a sound of <any> kind.
				(strongly)
			<Absolute silence> must be
			maintained until they are out of the
			danger area...

	As all remain frozen in their positions:

414A	TRACKING DEVICE PAN

	with it to:

414B	EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - BENES' EAR

	CAMERA MOVES IN on the Ear, until it fills the screen.

415	<OUT>

415A	PANEL OF PROTEUS

	The red warning lights are flashing, the needle of the TEMPERATURE
	GAUGE is in the danger zone. The SPEEDOMETER is nearing zero.

415B	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens is working the controls, apparently without avail. He glances
	anxiously ahead, sees:

415C	EXT. COCHLEAR DUCT - ENDOLYMPHATIC STREAM - P.O.V. BUBBLE

	A huge clear area. In the distance, a few drifting Antibodies. There
	is nothing evident that should be giving the Proteus any difficulty.

415D	INT. BUBBLE

	As Owens looks back with grave concern to the panel, the SPEEDOMETER
	needle drops to zero.

415E	EXT. COCHLEAR DUCT - LONG SHOT

	The Proteus is sinking to the bottom.

415F	INT. PROTEUS

	Duval and Cora are back in the lab Section, working on the laser.
	Grant is beside Michaels at the chart. Both look up as the Proteus
	touches bottom with a slight jar.

					GRANT
				(up at Bubble)
			What's wrong, Skipper?

					OWENS' VOICE
				(from Bubble)
			What I was afraid would happen. The
			stuff we passed through -- that
			looked like seaweed --

					MICHAELS
			Reticular fibers --

					OWENS' VOICE
				(from Bubble)
			It clogged the intake vents. We're
			not getting any propulsion.

					GRANT
			Well, there's only one thing to do.

	As he moves to put on his Breather Pack, Cora appears in the doorway
	of the Lab Section. She looks anxiously out of the bow windows. In the
	distance, several Anti-bodies can be seen.

					CORA
			You're going out there? With those
			Antibodies --

					MICHAELS
				(to Grant)
			No danger of attack, as long as you
			don't trigger them off by any injury
			to the System.

	Grant nods, steps into the Escape Hatch, closing the door behind him.
	The light flashes red. Cora remains at the bow windows, looking toward
	the drifting Anti-bodies, with apprehension.

415G	<OUT>

416	EXT. VENTRAL HATCH

	Grant is dropping out of the opening, causing the attached seaweed-
	like fibers to come loose and drift off.

417	WITH GRANT

	He swims toward the bow, reaches the propulsion intake vents. As the
	clogged vents come into view:

					OWENS' VOICE
				(over audio)
			How's it look?

					GRANT
			I could use a lawnmower...

418-	<OUT>
455

455A	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens glances at the Minute Recorder.

					OWENS
			How long do you think it'll take?

					GRANT'S VOICE
				(over audio)
			Quite a while.

455B	INT. PROTEUS

	Cora turns from the bow windows. The Antibodies are still in view.

					CORA
			Wouldn't it be quicker if we all
			helped?

					MICHAELS
				(with glance at Minute
				Recorder)
			Yes, there's no time to spare. And
			those fibers can be quite tenacious.

	He moves to the Escape Hatch with Cora, both strapping on their
	Breather Packs. She glances at Duval, still in the Lab Section.

					DUVAL
			I'd better use the time to finish
			repairing the laser.

	Michaels and Cora step into the Escape Hatch, adjust their swimming
	masks.

456	EXT. PROTEUS - BOW

	Grant is pulling the seaweed-like fibers out of the intake vents. He
	works fast at what seems an endless task.

457	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens is watching the TEMPERATURE GAUGE. The needle is still in the
	danger zone.

458	EXT. PROTEUS - BOW

	Michaels and Cora swim up to Grant, join him in yanking out the long
	clinging tendrils. All work quickly as possible.

459	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	Absolute silence. The immobile Surgical Team and Technicians create a
	tableau-like effect. The forced silence and the inactivity causes
	several to sweat with tension. All are focusing on the Tracking
	Devices, now weaving back and forth at Benes' Head.

460	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Reid and Carter are at the window overlooking the OPERATING ROOM. The
	Communications Aide turns to them. They react with misgiving as they
	hear:

					COMMUNICATIONS AIDE
			Report no movement of the Proteus
			since entering Quadrant 74, Level D.

	Reid and Carter exchange grim looks, move to look down on the MAIN OPS
	ROOM. They see the little Proteus is in the quadrant of the Cochlear
	Duct. Carter glances at the Minute Recrder. It now reads <24>.

					CARTER
			Twenty-four minutes left. Maximum.
			This is just what we need -- another
			delay...

	He sees an ant crawling along the table, in the direction of a few
	spilled grains of sugar. Automatically, he starts to bring his thumb
	down to crush it. But he stops just in time. Reid looks at Carter
	curiously as the latter carefully picks up the ant and puts it on the
	railing so it can crawl out of harm's way.

					REID
				(with smile)
			You'll wind up a Hindu. Respecting
			all forms of life -- however
			small...

461	<OUT>

462	EXT. PROTEUS - BOW

	Loose tendrils are flowing about the hull like drifting seaweed. But
	the vents seem to hold an endless amount. Grant, Cora and Michaels,
	working at an exhausting pace, keep pulling out more and more clumps
	of long fibers.

463	INT. BUBBLE

	Eyes on the TEMPERATURE GAUGE, Owens reacts with relief as he sees the
	needle beginning to swing away from the danger zone.

464	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	Nothing moves except the little Tracking Devices on their silent
	bearings. But the ordeal of absolute silence and no movement is
	beginning to tell on all. Particularly:

465	SURGICAL CHIEF

	An older man, corpulent, he is sweating profusely under the strain.
	The headband of his Surgical Cap is wet. Automatically, he brings his
	rubber-gloved hand up to wipe the perspiration away, stops, as he
	glances at the patient o.s.

466	EXT. PROTEUS

	Many loose tendrils now about the hull attest to the progress of
	cleaning the vents. The three keep working.

467	INT. BUBBLE

	The needle of the TEMPERATURE GAUGE is now almost out of the danger
	zone.

467A	INT. MAIN OPS ROOM - SUB GRID MAP

	The sub is not moving. The Minute Recorder reads <21>.

467B	INT. MAIN OPS ROOM - SHOOTING TOWARD CONTROL TOWER

	Reid and Carter are at the window, looking down into the room.

468	<OUT>

469	EXT. PROTEUS

	The last of the fiber clumps is now being removed.

470	SURGICAL CHIEF

	Rivulets of sweat are streaming down toward the wrinkled corners of
	his eyes, causing him to blink.

471	FEMALE SURGICAL AIDE

	Seeing his extreme discomfort, she follows the usual procedure of
	reaching for a towel on the instrument table.

472	TOWEL

	A surgical scissors is partially tucked within the folds.

473	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	The scissors is not visible from the Aide's angle. As she pulls the
	towel gently off the table, careful not to make a sound:

474	SCISSORS

	Dislodged from the table. CAMERA WHIPS with it toward the floor. On
	the shattering impact:

475	FLASH CUT - BENES' EAR

	It fills the screen, the sound reverberating o.s. Instantly:

476	EXT. COCHLEAR DUCT

	The vibrations send the Proteus flying through the clear sea, as if
	struck by a cataclysmic undersea force. (NOTE: Until the end of this
	sequence, the vibrations keep on as if they have set off
	reverberations in endless echo chambers.)

477	GRANT

	Flung in one direction.

478	MICHAELS

	Hurled off in another direction.

479	CORA

	Whipped away from all the others.

480	OWENS IN BUBBLE

	Clutching the panel for support.

481	DUVAL IN LAB SECTION

	Clutching the laser.

482	EXT. ORGAN OF CORTI - WITH CORA

	As she is tossed toward the Cells of Hensen: a series of tall columnar
	structures, non-rigid, with cuticular plates forming a mosaic pattern.

483	CORA

	She is horrified as she sees where she is heading for:

484	P.O.V. - CHASM

	One wall consists of the TECTORIAL MEMBRANE, opaque, with built-in
	huge fibers. The other wall: geometric and translucent. Spaced at
	intervals are what appear to be electrical conduits with four exposed
	strands spanning the two walls. All the conduits are vibrating.

485	WITH CORA - DOWN THE CHASM

	She is thrust over the curved edge, starts falling head down. She
	narrowly misses the first connective conduit. Then her Breather Pack
	snags on one of the strands of the next conduit, which flings her
	partially to one side so that her legs are caught between the other
	strands. As she hangs head down, the weight of her body causing the
	strands -- and herself -- to be whipped back and forth, she is further
	terrifled to see:

486	LONG SHOT - CHASM - CORA'S P.O.V.

	All the quadruple strands are vibratlng in the seemingly bottomless
	abyss.

487	BACK TO CORA

	As she tries to extricate herself, which causes her to be "vibrated"
	with even greater intensity:

					CORA
				(screaming)
			Help!

488	EXT. COCHLEAR DUCT

	In the distance, the Proteus is being brought under control. Michaels
	and Grant are in view, swimming against the force set off by the
	diminishing vibrations in this part of the Ear.

489	GRANT

	He hears:

					CORA'S VOICE
				(barely audible: over
				audio)
			Please! Help!

	Grant looks about. There is no sign of her.

490	CORA

	Struggling head down, in terror, she hears:

					GRANT'S VOICE
				(over audio; in
				distance)
			Cora! Where are you?

					CORA
			I don't know! I think I'm caught on
			some auditory fibers!

491	EXT. COCHLEAR DUCT

	Michaels swims up to Grant.

					GRANT
			Where would that be?

	As Michaels points, Grant hears:

					MICHAELS' VOICE
				(over audio)
			Right down there.

	They both swim off in the indicated direction, reach:

492	EXT. EDGE OF CHASM

	Both look down. At first they don't see her. Then Grant spots Cora. He
	points for Michaels' benefit. They see:

493	CORA IN CHASM - THEIR P.O.V.

	Far below, still trying to struggle loose.

494	CORA IN CHASM

	As she hears:

					GRANT'S VOICE
				(on audio)
			Okay! I can see you!

	She stops struggling. But unseen by her, the vibrating strands in
	which she is entangled have called forth, in apparent response:

495	FEW ANTIBODIES - IN CHASM

	Appearing from the far side, and below Cora. They start moving toward
	her. More Antibodies instantly appear from the same area.

496	EXT. EDGE OF CHASM

	Grant and Michaels are swimming over the curved mosaic cells.

497	INSIDE THE CHASM

	Grant and Michaels swim down toward Cora on the strands. Now the
	Antibodies become visible, gathering in increasing numbers as they
	stream up toward Cora. They are as yet unlinked, but she is
	unmistakably their target.

					MICHAELS
				(startled)
			Antibodies!... Coming at Cora! She's
			triggered them off!

498	<OUT>

499	CORA ON STRANDS

	From her head-down position, she sees:

500	LONG SHOT - ANTIBODIES - CORA'S P.O.V.

	Streaming upward in increasing numbers toward her.

501	GRANT AND MICHAELS - IN CHASM

					GRANT
			Doctor! Get back in the sub! Quick!

	Michaels starts swimming fast as he can toward the Proteus.

502	<OUT>

503	EXT. CHASM - GRANT, CORA AND ANTIBODIES

	He is racing to reach Cora before they do.

504	ON THE AUDITORY STRANDS - IN CHASM

	From her head-down position, Cora sees vast numbers of: Antibodies,
	now nearer. Frantic with fear, she tries to free herself, causing the
	strands to start vibrating again, which calls forth more Antibodies to
	stream out of the far side. Grant reaches her, starts working
	desperately to get her loose. She tries to help as he yanks at her
	Breather Pack, trying to work it off the wires.

505	EXT. PROTEUS - COCHLEAR DUCT

	Near the edge of the chasm. Duval is seen at the bow windows, looking
	out anxiously.

506	INT. PROTEUS

	Duval turns as the door of the Escape Hatch opens from within and
	Michaels steps out. He closes the door quickly. The light over it
	instantly flashes red.

					DUVAL
			Where are they?!

	As Michaels pulls off his swimming mask, breathing hard:

					MICHAELS
			Below the Cells of Hensen. If those
			Antibodies reach her, they'll attack
			as if she were bacteria...

507	LONG SHOT - ANTIBODIES - IN CHASM - P.O.V. CORA (HEAD DOWN)

	They are beginning to link up.

508	EXT. CHASM - CORA AND GRANT

	He is still trying to get her Breather Pack loose.

					CORA
				(franticaliy)
			Hurry! Oh please, please!

	He manages to get her pack loose, now starts pulling the strands apart
	at her ankles so that she can extricate herself. As she finally does,
	they execute a half-somersault in the stream to start swimming upward.
	Both get a fleeting look at:

509	LONG SHOT - ANTIBODIES - P.O.V. GRANT AND CORA

	The links have now formed chains the <exact length> of Cora.

510	EXT. CHASM - GRANT AND CORA

	Grant grabs her at the torso and starts to propel her upward.

511	LONG SHOT - CHASM - ANTIBODIES AND PRINCIPALS

	The long links, in vast numbers, now race after the frantically
	swimming Cora and Grant.

512	EXT. EDGE OF CHASM

	Grant and Cora appear, swim over the slippery edge of the mosaic
	cells. She is too exhausted to keep up the pace. Grant holds her with
	one arm as he keeps swimming toward:

513	EXT. PROTEUS

	Duval and Michaels can be seen at the bow windows, looking out. Owens
	is visible within the Bubble, peering out anxiously.

514	EXT. VENTRAL HATCH

	The two reach it, Grant still helping Cora. They are at the point of
	exhaustion. Grant reacts as he sees:

515	LIGHT OVER VENTRAL HATCH

	Flashing red.

516	EXT. VENTRAL HATCH

	Grant waits, hand at the wheel. Cora looks back toward the edge of the
	chasm for signs of the Antibodies.

					CORA
				(gasping)
			Open it! Open it before they get
			here!

					GRANT
			I can't till the hatch is flooded!

	At her look of fright, he turns and sees:

517	ANTIBODIES - EDGE OF CHASM - P.O.V. CORA AND GRANT

	The long links catapult over the edge of the chasm like Polaris
	missiles in flight, then begin to execute a turn for a massed attack
	in the direction of:

518-	<OUT>
520

521	EXT. VENTRAL HATCH

	The light flashes green. Grant begins turning the wheel quickly as he
	can.

522	INTERCUT ANTIBODIES

	Hurtling down toward Cora, and the wheel turning.

523	EXT. VENTRAL HATCH

	Just as the door drops down, the vanguard of the Anti-bodies reaches
	Cora. Two coils whip transversely around her shoulders. There is no
	time to tear them off. Grant thrusts Cora through the door, then
	follows, with the massed attackers streaming in after them.

524	INT. ESCAPE HATCH

	Cora is clawing at the Antibodies which are coiling around her from
	every direction. For the moment, Grant can't help her as he struggles
	to close the door against:

525	ANTIBODIES AT VENTRAL DOOR

	The crystalline links are forcing their way in, against the pressure
	of the closing door. Grant struggles with all his strength against the
	coiling mass. Finally he manages to get the door closed and locked.

526	INT. ESCAPE HATCH - GRANT, CORA AND ANTIBODIES

	The water level starts falling, accompanied by the hissing of air
	pressure. Grant and Cora try to claw at the crystalline structures.
	But in the extremely narrow confines of the chamber, there is little
	either can do. Suddenly Cora's expression changes to one of horror and
	pain.

					CORA
				(gasping)
			They're tightening...

	Desperately, Grant tries to get at least one coil loose, but to no
	avail. The crystalline structures are now constricting around her.

527	INT. PROTEUS

	Duval and Michaels stand before the Escape Hatch, waiting for the red
	light to change to green.

					DUVAL
				(up at Bubble)
			How much longer?!

					OWENS' VOICE
				(from above)
			Ten seconds --

					DUVAL
			That's too long!

	He starts to twist the wheel, to open the Hatch.

528	INT. ESCAPE HATCH

	The water is now down to their knees. Grant is still pulling at one of
	the many links around Cora, but without any effect.

					CORA
				(barely audible)
			Please -- I -- can't -- can't
			breathe...

	And she is cut off as all the Antibodies lock into place. Her mouth
	remains open, in the manner of someone being choked to death. The
	crystalline coils about her body give her the appearance of a female
	Laocoon... Suddenly the entrance door is thrust open behind them.

529	INT. PROTEUS

	Water pours out from the Escape hatch as Grant drags Cora out. She
	falls on the floor. Duval and Michaels instantly start pulling at the
	Antibodies. Cora is almost unconscious. Grant joins in the frantic
	effort to free her. And then Owens, who comes bounding down from the
	Bubble. All four men pull at the structures with all their strength.
	And suddenly they begin to break off, shattering into crystalline
	fragments. With some coils broken, the others soon lose their lethal
	adhesion. Finally Cora is free. As soon as she finds her breath, she
	begins to cry hysterically. Duval bends over, calming her.

530	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	All are still immoblle, sweating out the long wait. The Female
	Surgical Aide who caused the scissors to drop stands holding the
	towel. The scissors is still on the floor at her feet. In the silence,
	she carefully reaches out and dabs at the rivulets of sweat running
	down the Head Surgeon's face. Now all are concentrating on the:

531	TRACKING DEVICES

	Moving silently back and forth across Benes' head, the only contact
	with what is transpiring within.

532	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Reid is looking down into the OPERATING ROOM, Carter is pouring two
	fresh cups of coffee. At the SOUND of a warning buzz, both look at the
	TV monitor. They see the INTERIOR OF THE TRACKING POST. The blip is
	moving on the radar screen.

					COMMUNICATIONS AIDE
			Proteus proceeding toward Quadrant
			75...

	Reid takes the coffee which Carter extends.

					REID
				(relieved)
			On their way again...

	Carter glances at the Minute Recorder. It now reads <12>. He upends
	empty sugar container without looking at it.

					CARTER
			Twelve minutes left --
				(breaks off; sees no
				sugar)
			Of all the time to run out of
			sugar...

534	EXT. ENDOLYMPHATIC DUCT

	The Proteus is speeding through the very wide passage.

535	INT. PROTEUS

	Michaels is spreading out a chart of the Brain, with the help of
	Duval. As the complexity comes into view, Grant reacts. With glance at
	the Minute Recorder:

					GRANT
			Looks like quite a way to go...

					MICHAELS
			No, we should reach the base of the
			Brain shortly. And from there, it's
			not far to the site of the injury.

	Suddenly, light pours in. Astonished, Grant sees:

536	HUGE OVAL MEMBRANE - THROUGH BOW WINDOWS

	Semi-transparent. The immense pillars which form the Stapes of the
	Inner Ear are illuminated by the light behind it.

					GRANT'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			Where's that light coming from?

					MICHAELS' VOICE
				(o.s.)
			The outside world. Filtering in
			through Benes' Eardrum...

537	INT. PROTEUS

	Duval bends over the chart.

					DUVAL
				(pointing; to Michaels)
			That puts us right here... Which
			means we can head straight for the
			Sub Arachnoid Cavity.

					MICHAELS
			Yes...

					DUVAL
			If we can go in past the Oculomotor
			Nerve...

	As both men remain bent over the chart, conferring, Grant moves into:

538	INT. LAB AND STORAGE SECTION

	Cora is lying on the cot. As Grant enters, she starts to rise.

					GRANT
			No need to get up --

					CORA
			I feel much better now...

	But she remains seated, still weak. As the light grows brighter:

					CORA
				(quietly)
			The outside world... I thought I'd
			never see it again.

	Grant stops at the laser which is fastened securely, runs his hand
	along it.

					CORA
				(turning to Grant)
			Thank you for saving my life.

					GRANT
			That's what they pay me for.

					CORA
			A great deal more than that, I
			believe...

	He looks up from the laser.

					GRANT
			Such as?

					CORA
			Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...

					GRANT
				(into the silence)
			What gives you that idea?

	The light now dims back to normal, indicating they have passed the
	Eardrum.

					CORA
			That's why you're really here. I
			knew it from the start.

					GRANT
			As obvious as that? Our Security
			people will jump for joy.
				(with smile)
			I suppose Duval's onto me, too?

					CORA
			You're not the first, but he's much
			too innocent, much too involved with
			his work, to realize what's going on
			around him.

					GRANT
			Under a cloud without cause, I take
			it.

					CORA
			Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't
			follow the herd, or change his
			convictions -- even when they're not
			popular. And he believes in an
			absolutely free interchange of
			information between scientists of
			different countries -- and these
			days, there's nothing more
			suspicious than that.

					GRANT
			Depends on which end of the
			telescope you look through.

					CORA
			What do you mean?

					GRANT
			Well, if you happen to be very fond
			of him -- even in love with him --
			it would certainly affect your point
			of view.

	Before she can answer, they hear:

					DUVAL'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			It's out of the question.

					MICHAELS' VOICE
				(o.s.)
			Now be reasonable!

					DUVAL'S VOICE
			I won't do it.

					GRANT
			Sounds like trouble...

	The two move toward the door.

539	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant and Cora silently witness:

					DUVAL
			It's against my better Judgment...

					MICHAELS
			Better Judgment?! To wait until the
			actual operation -- when it may be
			too late?

					DUVAL
			I've done all I could with the
			laser.

					MICHAELS
			All I'm asking is you test it
			beforehand!

					DUVAL
			If it won't work, it's beyond my
			power to fix it. But if it does,
			there's no telling how long it will
			hold up. It's a jury rig, at best,
			and we'll need every second of use
			we can get out of it. That's why I
			don't want to put any extra strain
			on the connections by running
			unnecessary tests.

					MICHAELS
			Dr. Duvall I insist you test the
			laser.

					DUVAL
				(angrily)
			I'll do nothing of the sort! The
			operation is <my> responsibility! I
			won't do it, and that's final!

					MICHAELS
				(controlling himself
				with difficulty)
			As usual, you want everything your
			way. Except this time there's more
			than your damned ego at stake.

					DUVAL
				(tightly)
			I know only too well what's in the
			balance, Doctor. And it's not my
			ego, damned or otherwise.

540	GRANT

	Looking thoughtfully after Duval.

541	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Reid and Carter are relieved to hear:

					COMMUNICATIONS AIDE
			Proteus turning into Quadrant 791
			Level F.

	Reid presses button.

542	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	Still in tableau. All hear:

					REID'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			The Proteus has passed the Inner
			Ear.

	Instantly the tension breaks. There is coughing, clearing of throats.
	Someone sneezes, evoking:

					AD LIBS
			--	Just in time! I couldn't hold
				it back another second!
			--	I was afraid to <breathe>!
			--	My foot's asleep.
			--	Only one?
			--	I thought I'd die when the
				scissors hit the floor!

	The Female Surgical Aide picks up the scissors.

543	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Reid is moving to the window overlooking the MAIN OPS ROOM. Carter
	turns from the Minute Recorder, which now reads <8>.

					CARTER
				(on edge)
			Only eight minutes left...

	As he joins Reid and both look down into the MAIN OPS ROOM, they see
	the Grid Officer moving the Proteus to the Quadrant at the base of the
	Brain.

					REID
				(softly)
			Imagine -- they're in the Human
			Mind --

544	<OUT>

545	CEREBRAL LIGHTS

	A dazzling display of flashing lights fills the screen. Then as the
	CAMERA PANS DOWN slowly, we see a high wall of complex circuitry, in
	which the tiny lights glow on and off rapidly. Finally, as the CAMERA
	NEARS the bottom, it reveals:

546	EXT. PROTEUS - IN CRANIAL FJORD

	The sub seems a mere speck as it cruises through a chasm formed by two
	walls of similar circuitry and electronic pyrotechnics. There is a
	sense of order despite the complexity.

547	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant has joined Cora and Duval at the bow. The three are deeply
	impressed and moved by what they see. Michaels remains at the chart.
	As they look on:

					DUVAL
				(softly)
			"Yet all the suns that light the
			Corridors of the Universe shine dim,
			Before the blazing of a Single
			Thought -- "

					GRANT
			"Proclaiming in incandescent glory
			The myriad Mind of Man..."

	Cora looks at Grant in rather surprised awareness of this other side
	of him.

					MICHAELS
			Very poetic, gentlemen. You seem to
			see a great deal out there. Let me
			know when we pass the Soul.

	Duval turns from the bow windows to face Michaels with the answer:

					DUVAL
				(quietly)
			The Soul? The finite mind cannot
			comprehend Infinity. And the Soul
			which comes from God is Infinite.

					MICHAELS
			Take a close look at your Soul, and
			your Infinity, and your God out
			there --

548	GRANT

	In thoughtful response to:

					MICHAELS' VOICE
				(o.s.)
			-- and you'll find it's nothing but
			a combination of atoms, molecules --

549	INT. PROTEUS

	Not letting Duval interrupt:

					MICHAELS
			--and certain chemicals involving
			proteins --

					DUVAL
			You left something out.

					MICHAELS
			What's that?

					DUVAL
				(flatly)
			The Breath of God...

	Before Michaels can reply:

					OWENS' VOICE
				(from Bubble)
			Doctor -- what's that up ahead?

	They turn toward bow, see:

550	EXT. FOREST OF DENDRITES

	As it comes into view with the sub turning the corner of the chasm: a
	huge semi-circular area of branchlike nerves, through which the
	cerebral lights flash. In the center is the site of the injury. The
	lights stop at its perimeter, as if short-circuited, causing a dark
	area.

					DUVAL
				(up at Bubble)
			There it is. That's the site of the
			injury -- the dark spot. We'd better
			get prepared.

	They move into the Lab Section, where they put on their Breather Packs
	quickly during:

					MICHAELS
			It's too late...

	Startled, they follow his look, see the Minute Recorder now reads <6>.

					MICHAELS
			You couldn't possibly operate and
			get out before the hour's up.
				(up at Bubble)
			Captain, keep going. Head for the
			Removal Point.

	He begins to spread out a map of the Removal Area.

					DUVAL
			Removal Point? What're you talking
			about!

					MICHAELS
			We have no alternative. With only
			six minutes left, we'll just barely
			make it.

					GRANT
				(up at Bubble)
			Hold it, Skipper.
				(to Michaels)
			What happens if we overstay?

					MICHAELS
			Once time's up, De-Miniaturization
			begins. In a matter of seconds the
			ship will grow big enough to become
			a danger to the System. Then White
			Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it,
			as they would any invader.

					GRANT
				(up at Bubble)
			How long will it take to get from
			here to the Removal Point?

					OWENS'VOICE
				(from above)
			Approximately two minutes.

					DUVAL
			That still leaves me four minutes to
			operate.

					MICHAELS
			All you'll succeed in doing is
			getting us trapped!
				(glancing at Minute
				Recorder)
			Captain, you will proceed
			immediately to the Removal Point.

					OWENS' VOICE
				(from above)
			Yes sir.

	Grant moves quickly to the Manual Panel and throws some key switches
	into the OFF position.

551	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens is startled to see the lights over the buttons go off, rendering
	the controls inoperative. The sub comes to a stop at some distance
	from the Forest of Dendrites and the dark area up ahead.

					OWENS
			My power's gone!
				(looks down, sees him)
			Grant -- what're you doing!

551A	INT. PROTEUS

	With manner of taking over:

					GRANT
			Get the laser, Dr. Duval.

	As Duval and Cora move quickly into the Lab Section:

					MICHAELS
				(furiously)
			I'm in charge of this mission! You
			were instructed to take orders from
			me, not give them!

					GRANT
			Sorry, but the situation has
			changed.

					MICHAELS
			Nothing has changed as far as <my>
			authority goes! He is <not> going to
			operate! Not in the little time we
			have left! There's no chance of
			success! It's sheer suicide for all
			of us!

	He breaks off as Duval and Cora come out of the Lab Section carrying
	the laser and power unit. As they move to the Escape Hatch door, which
	Grant opens:

					MICHAELS
				(furiously)
			Dr. Duval, you are not going through
			with this! I absolutely forbid it!
			I'm responsible for the lives of
			everyone here! I will not allow you
			or anyone else to leave this ship!

					DUVAL
			I'm going to do what I can to save
			Benes.

	He steps into the Escape Hatch with Cora. Grant closes the door.

					MICHAELS
				(rageng at Grant)
			You fool! Don't you see what you've
			done? You've given him a perfect
			opportunity to kill Benes!

	The lights start flashing red, indicating the Escape Hatch is being
	flooded. Grant puts on his Breather Pack during:

					GRANT
			I don't believe that.

					MICHAELS
			Why not? Because of his gibberish
			about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage
			-- that's all it is -- to blind the
			gullible like you! And to hide his
			real identity -- a fanatic whose
			only purpose is to kill Benes! And
			you made it possible!

	The light over the Escape Hatch turns green. As Grant opens the door:

					GRANT
			I've come up against fanatics
			before, and Duval just doesn't fit
			the pattern.
				(up at Bubble)
			I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe
			I can be of some help...

					OWENS
			Remember -- we can't take more than
			five minutes to get out.

	As Grant starts closing the door, he glances at:

551B	MINUTE RECORDER

	It now reads <5>.

551C	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant closes the door. The light over it flashes red. Michaels moves
	to the bow window to observe:

552-	<OUT>
553

554	EXT. SITE OF INJURY - P.O.V. MICHAELS

	Duval and Cora are swimming toward the dark spot with the laser and
	the power unit. They reach:

555	EXT. SITE OF INJURY - CLOSER

	Duval presses the laser control, not knowing if it will work. To his
	relief, a beam of light shoots out. Instantly a small portion of the
	clot begins to light up. This gradual encroachment of flashing lights
	in place of the dark area marks the progress of the operation.

556-	<OUT>
557

557A	EXT. VENTRAL HATCH

	Grant drops out and starts toward Duval and Cora.

558	SECTION OF THROMBUS IN BRAIN

	The laser beam is slowly dissolving away a small portion of the vast
	darkness. Grant swims up. He glances at his wrist watch.

					GRANT
			How does it look, Doctor?

					DUVAL
				(as he works)
			If I can relieve the pressure on a
			few key vessels...

	More of the dark area lights up.

559	<OUT>

560	INT. PROTEUS - AT BOW WINDOWS

	Watching, Michaels responds grimly to the increasing number of
	flashing lights in the injured area. He turns with grim resolution
	from the bow.

					MICHAELS
				(up at Bubble)
			Skipper...

560A	INT. BUBBLE

	Owens is startled to hear:

					MICHAELS' VOICE
				(from below)
			There seems to be something wrong
			with the Escape Hatch...

					OWENS
			What do you mean?

					MICHAELS' VOICE
				(from below;
				imperatively)
			Fluid is seeping through. Better
			come down and have a look!

	Quickly, Owens starts slipping out of his harness, starts down the
	ladder leading into:

560B	INT. PROTEUS - AT ESCAPE HATCH DOOR

	Michaels is not visible in the angle of the shot as Owens moves to the
	Escape Hatch, looking for the seepage. Seeing nothing wrong:

					OWENS
				(turning; puzzled)
			I don't see any sign of --

	He breaks off, his expression reflecting horrified surprise as a hand
	wielding the heavy crank of the winch smashes down on his head before
	he has a chance to dodge it. Owens slumps to the floor at the feet of:

561	MICHAELS

	He drops the heavy tool, goes quickly to the Manual Panel, throws the
	switches back into the ON position, restoring all the controls to
	where they were before Grant changed them. Then he climbs up into:

562	INT. BUBBLE

	The lights over the buttons are all on again, indicating the controls
	are in working order. As Michaels sits down hastily and begins to slip
	into the harness, with him we see:

563	<OUT>

564	EXT. SITE OF INJURY

	Duval is aiming the laser in short bursts at a dark area around the
	large Central Nerve. Grant glances at his wrist watch.

					GRANT
			Doctor, we've just about had it.

					DUVAL
			It I can clear this Central Nerve,
			that <may> be enough...

	Unseen by them:

565	LONG SHOT - PROTEUS

	In the distance it is swinging around in a wide arc <above> them.

566-	<OUT>
567

568	INT. BUBBLE

	As Michaels maneuvers into position, he responds grimly to:

569	EXT. SITE OF INJURY - P.O.V. INT. BUBBLE

	Light begins to play along sections of the Central Nerve.

570-	<OUT>
571

572	INT. BUBBLE

	The bow is now lined up straight with the Central Nerve. Face set,
	Michaels presses the FULL SPEED button.

573	EXT. JETS

	The churning indicates full power is on. The Proteus spurts ahead,
	speeding toward:

574	EXT. SITE OF INJURY - CENTRAL NERVE

	More and more of the Central Nerve lights up as the intervening
	darkness is dissolved by precise bursts of the laser beam. Unaware of
	the oncoming sub, Duval and Cora keep working. As Grant glances at his
	wrist watch, electrical impulses begin racing in a continuous flow
	through the Central Nerve, which is now incandescent along its entire
	height.

					DUVAL
			That should be enough...

	He looks critically at the results, as he normally would.

					GRANT
			We better get back to the sub. Every
			second counts now.

					CORA
				(suddenly)
			Look! They follow the direction of
			her glance, are startled to see:

575	EXT. PROTEUS

	Speeding directly toward the Central Nerve high above them. The person
	in the Bubble is indeterminate at the distance and angle.

					CORA'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			It's heading right for the Nerve!

					DUVAL'S VOICE
				(o.s., confused)
			I don't understand...

576	EXT. SITE OF INJURY

	As they watch helplessly:

					GRANT
				(getting idea)
			The laser! Let me have the laser!

	Grant grabs the laser from Duval. With Cora trailing, holding the
	power unit, Grant leads the way upward at an angle to intercept:

577-	<OUT>
589

590	EXT. PROTEUS

	It is speeding toward the Central Nerve like a projectile homing in on
	a target.

591	INT. BUBBLE

	The incandescent Central Nerve looms closer and closer. Michaels holds
	the controls in place with the fixed look of a pilot on a suicide
	course.

592	GRANT, CORA AND PROTEUS

	He stops swimming. She remains near him. The sub is now over their
	heads, at an angle which makes the rudder visible.

					GRANT
			Give me your widest beam! Full
			power!

	Cora turns a dial on the power unit. Grant takes careful aim. A wide
	beam shoots out from the laser, across the intervening distance and
	hits:

593	EXT. RUDDER AND REAR HULL

	The concentrated light disintegrates the rudder and burns open a large
	section of the hull.

593A	INT. LAB SECTION

	Fluid pours through the hole into:

594	<OUT>

594A	INT. PROTEUS

	The intact section with its trapped air holds off total inundation.
	The unconscious Owens stirs, face up, the liquid just short of
	covering him. The sub begins to keel, owing to the inflow.

594B	INT. BVBBLE

	Michaels wrestles with the controls, trying to keep on course, as the
	Central Nerve ahead looms closer and closer. For a moment it appears
	he will be able to ram it. But the increasing tilt suddenly causes:

594C	EXT. PROTEUS - CENTRAL NERVE

	To dive at a sharp angle, just barely missing the Central Nerve.

595	INT. BUBBLE

	Michaels wrestles with the controls, but to no avail. Through the
	Bubble, he is startled to see:

596	EXT. FOREST OF DENDRITES - P.O.V. BUBBLE

	It looms closer and closer as the Proteus dives inexorably toward:

597	EXT. FOREST OF DENDRITES

	Treelike branching nerves form an intricate mesh as if in a dense
	forest. The Proteus careens into it, tearing loose a section of nerve
	fibers. The sub keels over on one side.

598	<OUT>

598A	INT. BUBBLE

	Now at a sharp tilt. The impact causes one of the arms of the swivel
	chair to spring out of place, pinning Michaels to the seat. Lying at
	an angle, he struggles to break loose, without avail. Suddenly his
	startled eyes fix on:

599	THE MINUTE RECORDER ON CONTROL PANEL

	It flashes <0>. The lights begin to dim.

599A	INT. CONTROL TOWER - MINUTE RECORDER

	Flashing <0>. The SOUND of a warning siren is on loud. It continues
	during the scene, adding urgency to the reactions of all. Reid and
	Carter exchange grim looks.

					REID
			Time's up... We'll have to take them
			out immediately.

					CARTER
			It means killing Benes...
				(savagely)
			And for all we know, they may have
			completed the operation!
				(slamming table)
			Damn it to hell!

	He turns away. Reid goes to the window overlooking the OPERATING R00M.

					REID
			Remove the Proteus...

599B	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	For a moment only the undulating wail of the warning siren is heard.
	Then:

					CHIEF SURGEON
			Prepare for trepanation...

	One of the Surgical Technicians begins swabbing Benes' head with
	alcohol.

599C	<OUT>

599D	INT. BUBBLE

	The lights are almost out. It is now lit only by the eerie glow of the
	pulsing flashes in the Forest of Dendrites. Michaels is vainly trying
	to pry the steel arm loose, but it holds him in a vise-like grip in
	the chair. He looks fearfully toward the bow window, as if knowing
	what to expect next.

600	EXT. EDGE OF FOREST OF DENDRITES

	Grant, Duval and Cora are swimming through the maze of nerves toward
	the sub lying at a sharp keel.

					GRANT
			The ship's good as finished. We'll
			have to get out on our own! Is there
			a quick way out?

					DUVAL
			We could follow the Optic Nerve to
			the corner of the Eye.

					CORA
			It's beginning to grow...

	They stop, treading water as they see:

600A	EXT. PROTEUS

	Growing visibly before their eyes.

600AA	INT. BUBBLE

	Michaels reacts as he sees the dendrites outside growing <smaller>,
	which indicates the sub and he are growing larger.

600B	EXT. EDGE OF FOREST OF DENDRITES

					DUVAL
			We've got to get them out.

	As he starts toward the sub, Grant stops him.

					GRANT
			Hold it...

	They follow his look, see:

601	WHITE CORPUSCLES - IN FOREST OF DENDRITES

	Huge monster-like blobs are starting to ooze through the nerves toward
	the Proteus, which is now about a quarter as large as when last seen,
	and growing rapidly.

					CORA'S VOICE
				(o.s., horrified)
			White Corpuscles!

602	EXT. EDGE OF FOREST OF DENDRITES

					DUVAL
			They'll ingest the ship and
			everything in it!

					GRANT
			Stay here, both of you. Hold them
			off, if you can.

	He hands the laser to Duval and starts swimming toward:

602A	EXT. PROTEUS - IN FOREST OF DENDRITES

	The White Corpuscles are slithering through the interlaced dendrites.
	They are still some distance from the disabled sub.

602	MICHAELS - IN BUBBLE

	He is horrified to see the White Corpuscles slide into his view,
	though still removed from the sub. He renews his frantic effort to
	break loose from the steel grip of the sprung arm.

602BB	EXT. DAMAGED HULL

	Grant swims the hole through into:

602CC	INT. LAB AND STORAGE SECTION

	Quickly he makes his way through the narrow flooded area, picking up
	two Breather Packs en route.

602DD	INT. PROTEUS

	Grant emerges into the air-filled portion, pushes up his swim mask. He
	takes in the prone Owens and Michaels pinned in the Bubble as:

					MICHAELS
				(frantically)
			Grant! Help!

	For a moment Grant stands between the unconscious man and the one
	trapped in the Bubble. Then he hurriedly unzips Owens' jumper,
	revealing the swim suit beneath. Owens regains consciousness. During
	the above:

					GRANT
			What happened?

					OWENS
				(in a daze)
			Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...

					GRANT
				(with realization)
			Berserk nothing. He's the one who's
			been sabotaging the mission...
				(handing him Breather
				Pack)
			Get this on. Hurry!

					MICHAELS' VOICE
				(from Bubble;
				frantically)
			Grant!

602EE	INT. BUBBLE

	A monster-like cell is slithering toward the Bubble. Michaels is
	tearing at the steel arm that holds him to the chair.

					MICHAELS
				(with growing terror)
			Macrophages!

	Moving against the extreme tilt, Grant appears. Responding to the
	oncoming White Corpuscle, Grant pulls at the steel arm with all his
	strength.

					MICHAELS
				(during above)
			Get me out of here. Get me out!!

	For all his effort, Grant is unable to free Michaels.

602FF	WHITE CORPUSCLE

	Gradually oozes over the entire Bubble, covering it.

602GG	INT. BUBBLE

	Grant makes a last desperate effort to free Michaels as he sees the
	Bubble begin to dissolve beneath the body of the adhering White
	Corpuscle. As the fluid body begins flowing over Michaels:

					MICHAELS
				(in terror)
			No...no...

	His scream is cut off by the White Corpuscle engulfing him. Grant
	jumps back into:

602HH	INT. PROTEUS

					OWENS
			Come on -- it's no use!

					GRANT
			We can get out through the Lab
			Section.

	Both pull down their swim masks. Owens moves off, followed by Grant.

602II	INT. LAB SECTION

	Owens is swimming through the hole. Grant follows through the cramped
	area.

602JJ	EXT. PROTEUS

	Owens appears, swims off toward Duval and Cora. The two are working
	the laser and power unit. Duval is hitting the White Corpuscles and
	dissolving them in an attempt to keep them off the sub, but without
	avail. The monster cells are swarming in greater numbers.

602KK	EXT. DAMAGED RUDDER

	A monster White Corpuscle is flowing along it, down toward the hole.
	As Grant now emerges, the White Corpuscle grasps him in its tentacles.

602B-	<OUT>
602D

602E	GRANT AND WHITE CORPUSCLE

	He struggles, unable to break out of the fluid mass which engulfs him.

602F	EXT. EDGE OF FOREST OF DENDRITES

	Duval and Cora swim up. Duval aims the laser, presses the trigger. The
	beam shoots out with surgical precision, making a direct hit on:

602G	VACUOLE OF WHITE CORPUSCLE

	The nucleus of the monster cell disintegrates, releasing Grant. He
	swims quickly toward:

602H	EXT. FOREST OF DENDRITES

	The three see another White Corpuscle moving after Grant. Duval
	dissolves it just as the laser goes dead. As Grant reaches them:

					GRANT
			You said there was a quick way out!

					DUVAL
			What about Dr. Michaels?

					GRANT
			It's too late!

	Duval drops the laser, turns and starts to swim off. Cora drops the
	power unit. With Duval in the lead, they swim as fast as they can
	through:

602I	EXT. FOREST OF DENDRITES

	The dendrites are now <smaller> in relat1on to the four as they keep
	on through the Cranial Region of flashing lights.

603	EXT. PROTEUS

	White Corpuscles are now festooned all over the sub and flowing in
	through the Bubble and damaged portion of the hull.

604-	<OUT>
606

607	EXT. EDGE OF FOREST OF DENDRITES

	The swimmers look back and respond to:

607A	EXT. PROTEUS

	It is crumbling like the Hindenburg Zeppelin. The White Corpuscles are
	swarming over the remains, ingesting every particle.

607B	THE GROUP

	Reacting to the destructive power of these internal defenders. They
	swim off.

608-	<OUT>
616

616A	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	The Chief Surgeon's gloves are on. Now all start to take their places
	around the Operating Table. The operating beams are switched on. The
	Chief Surgeon holds out one hand. A Surgical Nurse slaps a scalpel
	into it.

616B	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Standing at the window overlooking the OPERATING ROOM, Carter and Reid
	can see the Chief Surgeon bending down over Benes' head, about to make
	an incision. Carter suddenly gets an idea, presses button.

					CARTER
			Hold it, Doctor!

616C	BENES' HEAD AND SCALPEL

	The cutting edge is a fraction of an inch from the shaved head. It
	stops just in time. The Chief Surgeon and the Surgical Team around the
	table look up toward the window.

617	<OUT>

618	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Reid looks tensely at Carter.

					REID
			What is it?

					CARTER
			That blip we're picking up might
			only be the radio-active particle.
			The Proteus may already be
			destroyed...

					REID
			What're you getting at?

					CARTER
				(thoughtfully)
			If I were in their place and I'd run
			out of time, I'd abandon the ship
			before I grew to dangerous size...
			and use the few extra minutes to get
			out the quickest way possible, on my
			own...

					REID
				(with quick realization)
			Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye.

	Swiftly, Reid crosses to the window overlooking the OPERATING ROOM. He
	presses button.

619	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	The Chief Surgeon and the others exchange tense looks as they hear:

					REID'S VOICE
				(o.s.)
			Wait thirty seconds...

	He rushes through the door leading down to the Operating Room.

620	<OUT>

621	EXT. ARACHNOID CORRIDOR - RIGHT OPTIC NERVE

	Composed of a cobweb of fibers. Sausage-like links, pinched in the
	center, compose the walls of the winding passage. These are the Nodes
	of Ranvier. Intermittent flashes leap across the Nodes, of varying
	intensity and duration.

622	THE GROUP - IN RIGHT OPTIC NERVE

	As he keeps swimming, Duval turns his head to the others.

					DUVAL
				(encouragingly)
			Light impulses -- on the way to the
			Brain! We're nearing the Eye!

	They swim on with renewed effort. They are now larger in relation to
	what they pass. Cora starts to fall behind, unable to maintain the
	pace, for all her valiant effort. Grant puts one arm around her waist
	and thus manages to keep after Duval and Owens.

623-	<OUT>
628

629	EXT. APEX OF CORNEA

	The four climb up on what appears to be the top of a huge transparent
	mound. The fluid is rapidly seeping upward from the channel below. A
	low-domed ceiling -- the inside of the Eyelid -- which is bisected by
	a crack, necessitates their crawling over the mound toward a crevice
	which affords more height. They force themselves along exhausted, and
	reach:

630	<OUT>

631	INT. CREVICE BETWEEN EYELIDS

	The four reach the grotto-like niche, where they can stand erect at
	their increased size. As they rise from their crawling position and
	lean panting in exhaustion against the wall:

632-	<OUT>
639

640	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	Reid wheels over a magnifying glass mounted on a stand. He bends down
	and pries open Benes' right Eyelid.

641	INT. CREVICE BETWEEN RIGHT EYELIDS

	The four, their breath now regained, react in response to the
	unexpected:

642	PARTING OF RIGHT EYELIDS

	The bisected dome above them parts like the walls of the Red Sea.
	Simultaneously the beam of the operating lights blaze in with blinding
	intensity, causing the four to shield their eyes and look down into
	the retina.

642A	KALEIDOSCOPIC EFFECT

	A symphony of colors is reflecting from the cones far beneath, through
	the VITREOUS BODY and the manifold furrows of the IRIS.

643-	<OUT>
645

646	REID

	He is bringing the magnifying glass into focal position. As he squints
	through it, he reacts on seeing:

647	THE FOUR - THROUGH MAGNIFYING GLASS - ON SURFACE OF EYEBALL

	Now magnified, we see the four figures being swept inexorably toward
	the far corner of the Eye by a flood of water.

					REID
				(o.s.)
			A glass slide! Quick!

	Through the magnifying glass, we see their frantic attempts to fight
	the sweep of the cascade. Just as the four near the fall-off point,
	where the corner of the lids Join, the magnified end of a glass slide
	comes into view and catches the teardrop -- with the four in it.

648	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	Reid carefully straightens up, holding the glass slide. He can barely
	see:

649	EXT. GLASS SLIDE

	Tiny specks are visible in the teardrop, moving about in the fluid.

650	INT. OPERATING ROOM

	All respond to Reid's imperative:

					REID
			Open those doors!

	Holding the slide so the teardrop doesn't spill, Reid moves quickly
	through the sliding doors into the Miniaturization Room.

650A	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Carter rushes to the window overlooking the MINIATURIZATION ROOM.

650B	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	All group around in silence, holding their breath as Reid very slowly
	and carefully bends down and places the glass slide on the platform.
	Above, at the window, Carter can be seen looking down.

651	EXT. GLASS SLIDE - ON FLOOR

	The tiny spots are growing visibly before our eyes.

652	INT. CONTROL TOWER

	Carter, looking down into the MINIATURIZATION ROOM, reacts as the four
	dots below on the glass slide continue to grow and grow to the point
	where they can be discerned on the platform, and a bedraggled quartet
	it is. They look like survivors of a shipwreck: dripping wet,
	exhausted, all the fight knocked out of them. Owens is seated, head
	between his drawn-up knees; Cora is leaning against Grant for support;
	Duval is fighting for breath.

653	<OUT>

653A	INT. MINIATURIZATION ROOM

	Now fully grown, the four look about, amazed at where they are. And
	the Surgical Team and Reid encircling them are staring with equal
	confoundment...

									DISSOLVE TO:

654	INT. CORRIDOR - <CMDF> HOSPITAL SECTION - DAY

	Grant and Owens are driving a scooter. Both are rested, freshly
	groomed. The scooter goes through door marked:

					<MEDICAL DIVISION>

	The scooter stops in:

654A-	<OUT>
658

658A	INT. MEDICAL FOYER

	They alight and go through door leading into:

658B	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

	As Grant and Owens enter, they see Benes is propped up on his bed,
	with Carter, Duval, Cora and Reid grouped around him. Grant moves
	immediately to Benes.

					GRANT
				(warmly; extending hand)
			Hello, Mr. Benes... How's the prize
			patient?

	Benes smiles as they shake hands.

					DUVAL
				(beaming)
			He's making a fine recovery.

					CORA
			He certainly is. He should be up and
			about in no time.

					OWENS
			That's great.

	Grant and Owens look toward Carter, who is pacing, visibly upset.

					CARTER
				(answering their look)
			Oh yes, great. The only problem is,
			he can't remember what he came to
			tell us.

					GRANT
			Can't remember?... What do you mean?

					CARTER
			He's blanked out on that one
			particular point.

					REID 
			Yes, he can remember everything --
			except how to control De-
			Miniaturization...

					GRANT
			Oh, no.

					OWENS
			After all that.

					DUVAL
			A specific area of memory may have
			been destroyed by the laser beam
			when Dr. Michaels interfered.

					CARTER
			As long as it isn't a certainty,
			we've got to try everything possible
			to make him remember!

					OWENS
			Well, if you have no further need
			for me...

					GRANT
			Yes, we'd like to get moving.

					CARTER
				(mind only on Benes)
			Why don't you go on. We'll meet you
			at the Clearance Desk in a few
			minutes.

	He paces, looking at Benes while:

					GRANT
			Good-bye, Mr. Benes. I must say it's
			been quite an experience knowing
			you.

	Benes smiles weakly at the double-entendre. As Grant starts out with
	Owens:

					CARTER
			Now how soon can we try Sodium
			Pentathol?

					REID
			I'd hold that off awhile.

					CARTER
			Well, how about hypnosis? That can't
			hurt him!

	Benes closes his eyes wearily.

					DUVAL
			I suggest the first thing we try is
			letting the patient get some rest.

	As he starts herding them out and they reach the door, they are
	startled by a loud CRASH o.s. They rush out.

658C	<OUT>

659	TWO SCOOTERS - AT INTERSECTION

	Another scooter has run into the one containing Grant and Owens with
	such impact that the two have been tossed out. The M.P. is blowing his
	whistle, stopping all traffic.

660	THE GROUP

	Carter, Reid, Duval and Cora are running toward:

661	THE INTERSECTION

	Grant is rising, holding the side of his head. Owens, dazed but
	uninjured, is also getting up. As the others reach them:

					DUVAL
				(of Grant)
			He may have a head injury!
				(to Reid)
			Get him to the hospital!

	Instantly, Grant grabs Owens and hustles him to their scooter.

					GRANT
			Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about
			me! We're not hurt! Isn't that
			right, Skipper?

					OWENS
				(dazed)
			Uh -- what?

					GRANT
				(getting him into
				scooter)
			We feel great, don't we? Just
			<great>?!

					OWENS
				(catching on)
			Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!

					GRANT
				(taking off)
			Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing!
			We're fine -- just fine!

	In his haste, he almost runs into another scooter but averts a crash
	by a matter of inches. He keeps going at top speed, by-passing the
	stopped traffic by traveling in the wrong lane.

662	LONG SHOT - SCOOTER

	As it is lost to view down the long corridor...

									FADE OUT
