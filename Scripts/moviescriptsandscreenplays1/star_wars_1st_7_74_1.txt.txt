FADE IN:

1.   SPACE

	A sea of stars is broken by the vast blue surface of 
	the planet, OGANA. Five small moons slowly drift into 
	view from the far side of the planet. The main 
	titles are followed by a roll-up:

		Until the recent GREAT REBELLION, 
		the DAI NOGAS were the most feared 
		warriors in the universe. For one 
		hundred thousand years, generations 
		of DAI perfected their art as the 
		personal bodyguards of the King. 
		They were the chief architects of 
		the invincible ROYAL SPACE FORCE, 
		which expanded the King’s power 
		across the galaxy, from the celes-
		tial equator to the farthest stars.

		Now these legendary warriors are all 
		but extinct. One by one, they have 
		been hunted down and destroyed as 
		enemies of the NEW GALACTIC KINGDOM 
		by a ferocious and sinister rival 
		warrior sect, THE LEGIONS OF LETTOW.

	A small silver spacecraft emerges from behind one of 
	the Ogana moons.  The deadly little fightercraft 
	speeds past several of the moons, until it finally 
	goes into orbit around the FOURTH MOON.

2.   VALLEY OF COLORED LAKES- FOURTH MOON - OGANA

	A harsh gale blows across the bleak grey surface of 
	the Fourth Moon.  The blood red sky presses down on a 
	lone figure, JUSTIN VALOR, a tall, heavy-set boy of 
	sixteen.   He slowly makes his way across a wierd 
	plain covered with huge sprawling lakes.  The water in 
	some of the lakes is bright red, while in others it is 
	a vivid green.  The oddly colored lakes create an 
	ominous landscape against the eerie red sky.

	The heavy winds whip at the young boy and make the 
	going extremely difficult.  His face is covered by a 
	breath mask and goggles.  He stops for a second to 
	adjust the shoulder strap on his chrome multiplelazer 
	rifle.  Something in the sky catches his eye, and he
	instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from 
	his belt.  He stands transfixed for a few moments, 
	studying the heavens, then turns and rushes back in 
	the direction from which he came.

3.   SUPPLY HUT - FOURTH MOON - OGANA

	A damaged spacecraft, half buried in the dust, rests 
	next to the remains of an abandoned supply shack.  Justin
	makes his way across the colorless landscape and 
	rushes into the crumbling building.  The interior of 
	the hut is shabby, but manages to abate the howling 
	winds.  Seated in front of a thermoheater are Justin's
	father, AKIRA, and his young brother, BINK.  Akira is 
	a large, burly man, wearing the distinctive robes of a 
	Dai.  Bink is ten years old, with dusty blond hair and 
	a large scratch on his cheek.  Justin slams the door 
	and removes his gear.   His ruggedly handsome face is 
	caked with many layers of dust.

				 JUSTIN
		Dad!  Dad!  They've found us!

	Bink looks up from a small cube he has been studying. 
	His father whacks him across the shoulder with a 
	braided wire connector.

				 AKIRA
		Continue with the problem.  Your 
		concentration is worse than your 
		brother's.  (to Justin)  How many?

				 JUSTIN
		Only one this time.  A Cao Four.

				 AKIRA
		Good.  We may not have to repair 
		this old bucket after all.  Pre-
		pare yourself.

				 BINK
		Me too!

				 AKIRA
		Do you have the answer?

				 BINK
		I think it's the Corbet dictum: 
		"What is, is without."

	Akira smiles.  This is the correct answer.  Justin is
	strapping on a utility belt with chrome lazerpistols 
	and lazersword.  Akira rises and starts for his equip-
	ment.

				 BINK (Cont.)
		Ahhh, Pop...

				 AKIRA
		Bink, do you feel you're ready?

				 BINK
		Yes, sir.  I've outmarked Justin in 
		twelve disciplines.  I'm as good...

				 AKIRA
		All right, son.  Get your gear.

	Bink jumps up with the enthusiasm available only to 
	a ten-year old and grabs his gear.  His father frowns 
	and shakes his head.

4.   WASTELAND BLUFF - FOURTH MOON - OGANA

	Akira Valor and his two sons carefully make their way
	up a rock bluff overlooking the Lettow spacecraft parked
	among the  colored lakes.Akira inspects the  
	with his electrobinoculars.

				 AKIRA
		No tracks.  Bi-lock hasn't been opened.
		Interior systems are still on.

				 JUSTIN
		Are we going to wait for him to come 
		out?

				 AKIRA
		He's not  in there.  He's baiting us. 
		I'm surprised they only sent one this 
		time.  We must be wearing them down, 
		or they must think this warrior is 
		something special.  Stay on guard, 
		and keep hidden.  I'm going to work 
		my way across the ridge and call his 
		bluff.  Better we meet in open combat 
		than wait for him to ambush us.  Keep 
		your guard!

	Akira leaves his two sons and moves off along the 
	obscured ridge.  Justin and Bink watch him intently. 
	Justin throws down his multiplelazer rifle in dis-
	gust.

				 JUSTIN
		He should have let me go with him.  
		He's getting too old to make an open 
		challenge.

				 BINK
		He's not too old to realize you'd 
		just get in the way.

	Justin ignores his little brother's remark and sneaks 
	a look over the ridge at the Lettow spacecraft.  Akira 
	moves out of the rocks some distance away and starts 
	toward the starship.  Bink moves to the ridge next to 
	his brother, his chrome lazerrifle sparkling in the 
	reflected red light of Ogana.

				 BINK
		He's making his move.

				 JUSTIN
		Watch your guard... and cover 
		that weapon.  It shines like a 
		beacon.

	Bink reluctantly move away and watches the other 
	direction.  Akira has almost reached the Lettow 
	spacecraft and still there is no sign of its 
	occupant.

				 BINK
		What's happening?

				 JUSTIN
		Nothing.  I don't like it.

	Akira carefully moves to the main hatch of the star-
	ship.  He kicks a valve and the hatch drops open 
	with a loud clank and rushing gas.  Justin becomes 
	more tense as his father carefully moves inside the
	spacecraft.  Everything is still.  Even the continual 
	winds seem to have died down.  Moments pass with no 
	sign of activity inside the enemy starship.  Justin 
	watches the craft with his electrobinoculars.  The 
	waiting becomes unbearable.

				 JUSTIN
		Something's happened!  He's been in 
		there too long.

				 BINK
		Let me look!  Stand my guard.

	Bink takes the electrobinoculars from his brother and 
	studies the silent spacecraft.  Justin impatiently 
	scans the distant red horizon.

				 BINK
		I think the power just went off. 
		We'd better wait here until some-
		one comes out.

				 JUSTIN
		What if he needs help?

				 BINK
		The power went back on again....

	With the aid of the electrobinoculars, Bink watches 
	the running lights of the starship flash on and off.
	Suddenly something huge moves in front of his field 
	of vision.  Before either of the two young boys can 
	react, a large, sinister Lettow warrior in black 
	robes and a face mask  looms over them.  He carries 
	a long lazersword which cuts young Bink down before 
	he or his brother is able to raise his weapon.  The 
	startled Justin backs away in horror, then settles 
	down and ignites his lazersword which creates an 
	eerie red glow.  He stumbles over rocks as he attempts 
	to avoid the charging Lettow warrior.  The evil 
	warrior swings his mighty lazersword, but Justin 
	manages to deflect the intended deathblow.

	Finally, Justin is able to assume a defensive stance, 
	and the two warriors stand, sizing up each other.  The 
	legionnaire is at least seven feet tall, and dwarfs 
	the young Dai.  They stand for a few moments, almost 
	frozen, then in a flurry of blows, lazerswords clash 
	with the sound of electric snapping and popping. 
	Justin is barely able to hold his own against the 
	experienced warrior.  Many blows are exchanged before 
	the Lettow warrior is able to back Justin up against 
	a deep crevasse.  Justin stumbles and almost falls 
	over the cliff to his death.

	The legionnaire suddenly senses something behind him 
	and whirls around to face Justin's father, Akira Valor, 
	a Dai Nogas master.  The Lettow warrior raises his 
	lazersword, but is cut in two before he can bring it 
	down again.  Akira moves to the fallen legionnaire 
	and studies him carefully.  Justin, still a little 
	wobbly from the whole experience, attempts to stand. 
	Akira sees his dead son Bink and goes to him.  He 
	lifts him into his arms and begins to weep.  Justin 
	stands bewildered, watching his father cradle the 
	dead child.

5.   INTERIOR LETTOW STARSHIP - VALLEY OF COLORED LAKES - 
	OGANA

	Akira Valor slides into one of the four seats of the
	small Lettow starship.  Through the front viewing 
	canopy, he watches Justin drag Bink's body to a small
	crevasse.  Justin places a small locket around his 
	brother's neck, makes a complicated sign, and dumps 
	the body into the shallow depression.  The giant 
	engines of the spacecraft begin to whine, kicking up 
	large clouds of dust.

	Justin climbs into the seat beside his father and 
	removes his breath mask and goggles.   There are 
	tears in his eyes.  Father and son look out across 
	the wasteland towards Bink's grave.  The thunderous 
	clap of an explosion is followed by a small mushroom 
	cloud rising out of the depression.  Justin throws a
	container down in a fit of rage.

				 JUSTIN
		How many more of them are there?  I 
		want to finish it, once and for all. 
		I'm sick of running.  When will it 
		stop?

	Justin's father waits silently until the tirade is
	finished.  Justin sits silently for a few moments.

				 JUSTIN (Cont.)
		I'm sorry.

				 AKIRA
		Son, plot a course for TOWNOWI.

	Justin lights up like a Geenick at feeding time.

				 JUSTIN
		Townowi!  You mean we're going home?

				 AKIRA
		We both need a rest.

	Akira pulls back on the throttle and the powerful 
	spaceship lifts off the surface of the Fourth Moon 
	of Ogana.

6.   CLOUD SEA - GRANICUS

	A title card appears over a sea of billowing clouds 
	on the gaseous planet of GRANICUS:

		Granicus:   Capital of the New 
		Galactic Empire.

	The towering yellow oxide clouds pass, revealing the 
	Royal City of Granicus.  The magnificent domed and 
	gleaming city is perched, mushroom-like, on a tall 
	spire which disappears deep into the misty surface 
	of the planet.  The peacefulness of this nebulous 
	idyll is broken by the increasing wail of ion 
	engines.  Four sleek stardestroyers from the Royal 
	Fleet burst out of the huge cumulus range.  The 
	craft are flying in a tight formation as they bank 
	steeply, and head toward the royal   capital of the 
	New Galactic Kingdom.

7.   INTERIOR STARDESTROYER - GRANICUS

	Stardestroyers are two-man spacecraft crammed with
	sophisticated electronic weaponry.  The pilot and 
	gunnery officers sit side-by-side surrounded by 
	lighted readouts and switches.  They wear the gleaming 
	black uniforms of the King’s elite corps.

				 PILOT
		Tok-One to Chicks:  Shape it up. 
		Let's make it good.

				 CHICK-ONE
		Does that glare bother you?

				 PILOT
		Use your face shield, Chick-One.

	The pilot is cold and professional as he maneuvers 
	his craft closer to the others.  The positions of 
	the ships are displayed on a read-out, along with a 
	graphic representation of the city.  The pilot gives 
	the gunner a quick look before he flips his sunshield 
	over his eyes.

				 PILOT
		Here we go.  Count:  three, two, 
		one, now!

8.   REVIEW STAND - PLAZA OF THE DONNS - GRANICUS

	On a huge austere platform stands the dark SON HHAT, 
	Lord of Granicus, Consul to the Supreme Tribunal, and 
	ruler of the Galactic Kingdom.  He is a thin gray 
	looking man with an evil mustache hanging limply 
	over his insidious lip.  Standing at rigid attention 
	on his right are several generals  dressed in the 
	black and grey uniform of the realm.  Five members 
	of the Supreme Tribunal sit off to the side.  On 
	Hhat's    left stands MARA HORUS, newly appointed 
	Governor of the Townowi Systems.  He is a young 
	treacherous man with stone-cut angular features and 
	piercing gray eyes.

	They all gaze skyward as the four gleaming star-
	destroyers scream low overhead in an impressive 
	barrel-roll formation.  As the sound of the space-
	craft resonates throughout the glass canyon of the 
	Plaza, the group of dignitaries return their atten-
	tion to the parade of  royal   shock troops and 
	giant air tanks (which ride magically, two or three 
	feet above the ground).

	The Plaza of the Donns is filled with hundreds of rows 
	of troops as the last brigade marches into position. 
	The sound of three thousand men snapping to attention 
	is followed by a strange silence.  A light wind blows 
	the great red banner of the kingdom creating a subtle
	flapping sound.  The king's amplified voice startles 
	many of the troops as it cuts through the quiet.

				 SON HHAT
		Upon this battle depends the survival 
		of the Galactic Kingdom. Upon this 
		battle depends the life and long con-
		tinuity of our civilization.  Not 
		since the great Dai Rebellion has our 
		destiny been placed in such a balance. 
		This is to be the most magnificent 
		campaign of all!  You have never been 
		called without doing something to be 
		remembered, something notable and 
		striking.  The conquering of the 
		Townowi System, the last of the inde-
		pendent systems and the last refuge 
		of the outlawed, vile sect of the Dai, 
		will have such important and lasting 
		consequences, that I can't but consider 
		it as an epoch in history.

	To the rear of the Plaza, watching the spectacle over 
	the shoulder of a curious bureaucrat, stands CLIEG OXUS, 
	a tall, blond young man about twenty years old.  He seems
	interested in what the  King   has to say, but keeps 
	looking around nervously as if someone were after him. 
	His arm rests across his head, as he carefully but coolly
	adjusts a glowing blue ring on his index finger.  The 
	King nears the end of his speech.  Mara Horus has moved 
	up to stand next to the sinister monarch.  The troops 
	shout a royal salute in response to a particularly 
	partisan statement.

				 SON HHAT (Cont.)
		... I have personally asked the Townowians 
		to accept this Treaty of Alliance.  During 
		the period of negotiation, they have only 
		decided to be undecided.  We will barter no 
		longer.  Governor Horus has been appointed 
		the First Lord of the Townowi System and 
		Surrounding Territories.  This is the last 
		frontier and the final stone in the great 
		wall of the Galactic Kingdom.

	The troops cheer, and the King escorts Horus inside.
	Oxus moves quickly away from the Plaza, passing through
	several check stations, where he is forced to show his
	identification.

9.   NIGHT CLUB - GRANICUS

	Oxus walks into the glass and chrome splendor of one 
	of the famous nightclubs of Granicus.  He moves to the 
	long mirrored bar and sits next to a rough looking man, 
	BOMOJE ESPAA, dressed in the distinctive gold and furs 
	of the galactic traders.

				 OXUS
		Your glass is empty.

	Oxus speaks into a small intercom on the bar front.

				 OXUS (Cont.)
		A dantic and...

	He looks in Espaa's glass.

				 ESPAA
		No thanks, Clieg.  I've had enough.

				 OXUS
		Just a dantic, then.  Espaa, it's 
		not like you to refuse a drink. 
		You're going to give the galactic 
		traders a bad name.

	A drink appears magically from a small elevator in the 
	bar.  Oxus takes it, and then places a pen-like trans-
	mitter he has taken from his pocket next to the inter-
	com.  It creates a low electronic buzz.

10.  BAR OBSERVATION CENTER - GRANICUS

	A controller sitting in front of a row of monitors taps 
	his headphones, then flips a switch back and forth a 
	couple of times.  He is obviously annoyed.

				 CONTROLLER
		Number eighteen is out again.  Give 
		me a maintenance check.

	The controller yawns and puts his feet up on the control
	panel.

11.  NIGHTCLUB - GRANICUS

	Espaa leans in close to Oxus.  He is suddenly very serious.

				 ESPAA
		Clieg, we've got problems.  They've 
		just grounded all spacecraft, in-
		cluding trade frigates.  Even the 
		ships under royal registry can't 
		move.  Something big is up.

				 OXUS
		I'm afraid they're not waiting for 
		the Alliance Treaty.  They're 
		already moving against the System. 
		I've got to get word back.

				 ESPAA
		The chrome companies are protesting 
		the embargo, but it's going to take 
		some time.

				 OXUS
		Isn't anything moving?

				 ESPAA
		Military ships, but...

	They are interrupted by a royal officer and several
	storm troopers.  The officer shouts over the P.A. 
	system as the troops rush to block the exits.  Oxus 
	and the galactic trader are tense, but remain cool.

				 OFFICER
		Attention:  All captains and first 
		officers of Guild Trade frigates 
		will accompany me to the Ministry 
		of Transport immediately.

	Espaa gives Oxus a hopeless look as the troops check 
	their papers, and then take Espaa away.  A small fight 
	breaks out in the back of the nightclub as one of the 
	trader captains expresses his dislike of the kingdom. 
	Oxus slams his glass to the bar in a gesture of hate 
	and frustration.

12.  GOVERNOR HORUS’ QUARTERS - GRANICUS

	The large white-on-white executive quarters resound 
	with the high-pitched laugh of the evil Governor
	Horus.  He slaps DARTH VADER, a tall, grim looking 
	general, on the back and the general's mouth makes 
	the slightest gesture at a smile.

				 HORUS
		Success!  I told you.  We are no 
		longer under the control of the 
		GREAT FAMILIES.  We've gained a 
		true advantage.

	VANTOS COLL, a member of the Supreme Tribunal, and a 
	man of the grossest dimensions, appears to be a little
	worried.

				 COLL
		A rather dangerous advantage. 
		You still have a system to 
		conquer.

				 HORUS
		But this system will bring us 
		more scientific wealth than that 
		of any other house in the 
		tribunal.  We will easily gain 
		control of the directorship.

				 COLL
		Don't underestimate the armies of 
		Townowi.  They're lead by a Dai 
		warrior.

				 HORUS
		I've told you about Commissioner 
		Coll, General.  He worries a lot.

				 VADER
		It's a myth that any Dai still exists.

				 COLL
		General Skywalker is no myth.  When 
		I first arrived at court, he was 
		the first bodyguard to the King.
		He lead the Dai Rebellion.

				 VADER
		NGAI THUC lead the Rebellion.

				 COLL
		So the King would have you beieve, 
		but I was there.

				 VADER
		Then why wasn't he hunted down like 
		the others?

				 COLL
		Because he is too dangerous, too 
		clever.  Besides, his presence on 
		Townowi is still only a rumor.

				 HORUS
		Then why do you believe it?

				 COLL
		Because I knew him.  He's there 
		all right.  I can sense it.  Mark 
		my words, Townowi will not be 
		easily conquered.

13.  COURTYARD - PALACE OF LITE - TOWNOWI

	A low, sleek landspeeder (an auto-like transport which
	travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic field) 
	glides into the courtyard of the palace of Townowi. 
	The planet, with its bright green sky, is a desert 
	wilderness;  but the palace is a sparkling oasis, with 
	low concrete walls and great turrets spilling over with 
	foliage from rooftop gardens.  The speeder stops before 
	an enormous shaded corridor.  Fountains line the 
	beautiful and highly polished  tile  walkway.  Two 
	young boys, OETA (7) and PUCK (5) are helped out of the 
	speeder by AMBER, a one-armed bodyguard dressed in the 
	flowing white robes of the Townowi military.  The two 
	boys run through the long corridors, yelling and 
	screaming, their little footsteps echoing throughout 
	the palace.

14.  LIBRARY - PALACE OF LITE - TOWNOWI

	The palace library is a dim, cool room, projecting an 
	aura of time-worn comfort and security.  In the 
	distance, the children can be heard screaming through 
	the corridors.  KING KAYOS, silver haired but amazingly 
	youthful under a tanned and leathery face, motions for 
	one of his aides to shut the partially closed door. 
	He is in the middle of an emergency meeting of the 
	Townowi High Senate.  The twelve men sit in overstuffed 
	chairs, placed in a large circle.  A large, sallow-eyed 
	galactic trader named AAY ZAVOS, fiddlesnervously with 
	a small scrap of leather as he speaks.

				 ZAVOS
		My Lord, the chrome companies are with 
		you in spirit, but you must understand, 
		they can't openly support you.  Royal 
		trade restrictions are very unfavorable 
		and we, of course, favor your indepen-
		dence.

				 KAYOS
		If there were to be war, would your 
		frigates still supply us?

				 ZAVOS
		Your bluntness is to be commended. 
		It could be arranged.

	COUNT SANDAGE, a corrupt noble of the senate, jumps to 
	his feet in a rage.

				 SANDAGE
		This is nonsense!  We have no choice 
		but to approve the treaty.  If there 
		is war, the New Galactic Kingdom will 
		destroy our entire system with a snap 
		of the finger.  General Skywalker is 
		a dreamer if he thinks he can mount 
		any meaningful resistance, and you're 
		dreamers if you believe him.  So much 
		trust in one aged man.  You must see...

	At that moment, all heads turn as someone enters the 
	room.  It is General Luke Skywalker, Commander of the 
	Townowi Star Force.  He is a large man, apparently in 
	his early forties, but actually much older.  Every-
	one senses the aura of power that radiates from this 
	great warrior.  Here is a leader:  a Dai general.  He 
	looks weary, but is still a magnificent looking warrior. 
	His face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates, is 
	set off by a close silver beard, and dark, penetrating 
	eyes.  Sandage is somewhat embarrassed and quietly sits 
	down.

				 SKYWALKER
		Is there anyone here so naive he 
		believes the Galactic Kingdom 
		would even bother negotiating if 
		they were contemplating destruction 
		of this system?  Your Excellencies, 
		this is more than a simple raid on 
		your resources.  You must reach a 
		decision.

	MIR NASH, a thin, birdlike senator, turns to General 
	Skywalker.

				 NASH
		General Skywalker, war is a serious 
		business... a deadly business.

				 SKYWALKER
		Procrastination is a deadly business, 
		Senator.  War is my business.  Have 
		you approved my defense measures?

	The GRANDE MOUFF TARKIN wears the long black robes of 
	the Townowian religion.  He speaks with a high, 
	cracking voice.

				 TARKIN
		An actual war with the Galactic Kingdom
		is still only a remote possibility.  As 
		a military treatise, your proposal has 
		certain merits, but in the harsh light 
		of reality, an attack against the Galac-
		tic Kingdom appears to be a somewhat 
		extreme defense.

				 NASH
		You must understand, General, we’re
		interested in avoiding a war, not 
		starting one.

				 SKYWALKER
		There are times when offense makes 
		the best defense.  If that Alliance 
		Treaty isn't signed, we will need 
		all the advantage we can get.

				 KAYOS
		Count Sandage, I want you to head 
		the delegation to Granicus.  You 
		will leave tomorrow with our answer 
		regarding the treaty.  My decision 
		will be forthcoming.

	The senators whisper among themselves.

				 KAYOS (Cont.)
		All right, then.  May the force 
		of others be with you all.

	The senators leave in a flurry of hushed conversation. 
	The general is lost in thought, and remains in his chair. 
	Oeta and Puck, King Kayo’s two young sons, storm through 
	the existing senators, and rush on to Kayos' lap.  The 
	King is obviously very proud of the two young princes. 
	He throws Oeta into the air, and then catches him again.

				 PUCK
		Me too! Me too!

				 OETA
		Zara's leaving!  Zara's leaving and 
		you gotta say good-bye.

	The King picks up Puck and swings him around, then puts 
	him down.

				 KAYOS
		Okay, whippersnapper, go tell your 
		mother and your sister that I'm on 
		my way.

	The two boys run out of the room and are heard yelling 
	and screaming down the hallway. The king starts out, but
	stops in front of the general.

				 KAYOS
		Luke, my daughter is leaving for the 
		academy at Chathos. Won't you come 
		and wish her well?  It would mean a 
		lot to her.  She truly idolizes you, 
		you know.  Come on, the war will 
		wait.

				 SKYWALKER
		Of course. I'm sorry, My Lord. 
		Politics always seem to distress me.

	General Skywalker rises, and as they head for the door, 
	Kayos pats him on the back.

				 KAYOS
		I know, Luke.  I feel THE FORCE also.

15.  COURTYARD - PALACE OF LITE - TWONOWI

	A large, four-seat speeder sits gleaming in the sun-
	soaked courtyard.  The PRINCESS ZARA, about fourteen 
	years old, possessing a soft beauty and iron will, is
	embracing her mother, QUEEN BREHA, a warm, silver-
	haired matron.  There are tears in the princess' blue 
	eyes.  Oeta and Puck jump around inside the speeder, 
	disrupting the efforts of the one-armed Amber to pack 
	several plaxiform cases.

	Zara embraces the King as he approaches with the 
	general.

				 ZARA
		Oh, Daddy, I'll miss you so.

				 KAYOS
		The semester will be over before you 
		know it.  You'll have a grand time. 
		There are so many new things to learn. 
		I wish I were going.
	He gives her a fatherly smile, and she hugs him again. 
	The general stands rather formally to one side.  The 
	princess, her long auburn hair tied in braids, moves 
	to the general and he bows before her.

				 SKYWALKER
		May your studies do you honor.

	Zara is somewhat embarrassed by the general's formality 
	and can only manage an awkward smile before returning 
	to her parents at the speeder.

				 BREHA
		Hurry, Zara.  You must make it to 
		Yuell before nightfall.

	The princess' maids-in-waiting, ALANA, a short stocky 
	girl, and MINA, more comely (somewhat that same stature 
	as Zara) with long dark hair, giggle and straighten 
	Zara's dress before she enters the speeder.  The prin-
	cess and Mina hug Alana, whose giggles have turned to 
	tears.  The two boys scramble out of the speeder as 
	Amber helps the princess and her maid into the back 
	seat.  The speeder is piloted by a trooper of the 
	first order.  Amber jumps into the seat beside him, 
	and the speeder starts with a low buzzing sound.  The 
	princess waves to her family, and Mina waves to Alana 
	as the speeder slowly glides out of the courtyard.

16.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	The huge war room is a mass of glass enclosures, 
	electronic wall displays, monitors, and computer 
	stations.  General Skywalker enters a control station, 
	followed by a covey of military aides of various ranks. 
	As the group hurry through the crowded room, men rise 
	and salute the new arrivals.  The general stops before 
	a giant display of the galaxy.  Small symbols flash on 
	and off over various portions of the big board.  The 
	general studies it intently.

				 SKYWALKER
		Montross!

	CAPTAIN MONTROSS, one of the general's aides, snaps to
	attention.

				 MONTROSS
		Sir!

				 SKYWALKER
		What's the TQ on this?

				 MONTROSS
		The last frigate to leave Granicus 
		was at twenty-three forty, Sir.

				 SKYWALKER
		Have any ships at all left the 
		planet?  (to another aide)  Check 
		with the Guild on NORTON THREE.

				 MONTROSS
		At twenty-four hundred, a full 
		battalion of stardestroyers left 
		for what is projected to be 
		ANCHORHEAD, or a nearby system.

				 SKYWALKER
		And no word from Oxus.  He should 
		have reported by now.  CAPTAIN PRUE!

	An older, academic looking aide, steps forward.

				 PRUE
		Sir!

				 SKYWALKER
		What do you make of this?

				 PRUE
		A battalion is invasion force, but the 
		Royal Galactic Kingdom controls that 
		entire part of the galaxy.  A revolution, 
		maybe?  At any rate, they're going in the 
		wrong direction to be any trouble for us.

	The general ponders this for a few moments, then speaks
	almost to himself.

				 SKYWALKER
		I don't know.  It doesn't feel good.

				 MONTROSS
		Put 'em on alert.

	A loud uproar is heard on the far side of the war room.
	Everyone turns to see a foreign dressed warrior pushing 
	his way past several guards and war-room bureaucrats. 
	The warrior, with his long hair tied in an odd bun on 
	the top of his head, is Akira Valor.  He is followed by 
	his son, Justin, who rudely pushes the pesky bureaucrats 
	out of the way.

				 BUREAUCRATS
		It's restricted.  You'll have to 
		wait.  (etc.)

				 AKIRA
		Get out of my way, boy, before I 
		grind you into the surface. (etc.)

	As the dauntless Akira approaches the general, the guards
	stop in bewilderment as General Skywalker rushes up to 
	the warrior and embraces him.  The two Dai warriors 
	laugh jubilantly and slap one another, as the aides and
	bureaucrats look on in amazement.

				 SKYWALKER
		Akira Valor - you old muscle-rat! 
		What a sight!  We heard that you 
		had been executed.

				 AKIRA
		So the Galactic Kingdom would have 
		you believe.  I've been in the 
		KESSIL System.  You remember little 
		Justin.

	Akira puts his arms around his son, who has been making 
	eyes at one of the cute young female aides. He bows 
	before the general.

				 SKYWALKER
		He takes after his mother!  (they laugh)  
		It's so good to see you.

				 AKIRA
		It's wonderful to be with another 
		Dai again.  There are so few of us 
		left.

	The cute aide goes back to her duties, flirting with 
	Justin as she passes.  The young warrior pinches her 
	on the ass, which startles her, but she goes on like 
	nothing has happened.

				 SKYWALKER
		What a sight!

	The two Dai stand looking at one another, hardly believing
	the other is real.  Finally, the general realizes his 
	aides are standing around, gawking at the duo.

				 SKYWALKER (to the aides)
		Wake up, gentlemen.  You're on alert. 
		Keep me posted on that battalion.

17.  CONTROL STATION - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	The general, Akira and Justin enter a small glass enclosed
	control office.  They sit, and an awkward silence ensues 
	as each man waits for the other to speak.

				 AKIRA
		I've come for your help.

				 SKYWALKER
		Anything you ask.  You're a Dai 
		brother.  We're one.

				 AKIRA
		My friend, we've been through much 
		together.  I've been through much 
		since we parted.  I've lost much. 
		The Legions of Lettow have chased 
		us half way across the galaxy.  There 
		is no refuge.  One day they will come 
		here.  Take my son as your JUWO 
		learner.  He would be a Dai.  I've
		trained him from birth.  He's reached 
		the fifth stage. He fought in the 
		Kessilian civil wars and commanded a 
		Hubble expedition to the CONE Systems. 
		He's a good boy, Luke, and one hell 
		of a fighter.

	The general looks down, somewhat embarrassed. He scratches
	his head, then smiles.

				 SKYWALKER
		Old friend, you do me too much honor. 
		I was never a match for you.  Why don't 
		you finish his training yourself?

				 AKIRA
		I'm too old, Luke. I can't go on. 
		You must finish it.

				 SKYWALKER
		What kind of talk is this?  You're 
		not the old Valor I remember.  Too 
		old?!?

	Akira Valor suddenly ignites in a rage and swings 
	his left forearm down with a mighty blow across the 
	solid chrome desk the general is sitting at.  The 
	old Dai warrior's forearm cracks in two, spewing forth 
	wires  and many fine multicolored electronic components. 
	The artificial limb flops lifelessly to Valor's side. 
	The warrior rips open his tunic, revealing a plastic 
	chest stuffed with flashing electronic parts.

				 AKIRA (angrily)
		I'm not the same.  There is nothing 
		left but my head and right arm.  I've 
		lost too much, Luke.  I'm dying.

	The general bows his head in sorrow for one of the 
	greatest warriors in the galaxy and a dear friend.

				 SKYWALKER
		I'm sorry...

				 AKIRA
		I'm sorry.  I keep losing control. 
		I'm very tired.  Take my son!  The DAI 
		NOGAS must survive.  We must pass it 
		on.  Only a Dai can stop Son Hhat. 
		We're very old, Luke.  A new 
		generation of Dai must be started. 
		Take him;  teach him the way of 
		the Dai Nogas.

	Captain Montross bursts into the office and somewhat
	excitedly salutes the general.

				 MONTROSS
		Sir, we have picked up something! 
		An asteroid, or solid comet moving 
		away from the Anchorhead System.

18.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	The general rushes out of the control station and back 
	to the giant galactic display.  He is followed by 
	Montross, Akira and Justin.

				 SKYWALKER
		Are you sure it's not the battalion?

				 MONTROSS
		A solid object.  It's as big as our 
		Third Moon.

				 PRUE
		It's too large to be man-made, and it's 
		too slow to be a comet.

				 SKYWALKER
		Analysis?

				 MONTROSS
		It's too far out.

				 SKYWALKER
		I'll be with the king.  Report as soon 
		as you can get a reading on it.  (turning 
		to Akira's son)  Captain Valor, from now 
		on you stick close to me.

	The older Valor smiles, and puts his good arm around 
	his old friend.

19.  DINING CHAMBER - PALACE OF LITE - TOWNOWI

	King Kayos moves his arm around Breha's waist as they 
	stand on a balcony watching two giant twin suns in the 
	green sky disappear behind a distant dune range.  The 
	general enters, rather in a rush, followed by the 
	young Valor, who is now dressed in the white uniform of 
	the Townowi star force.  (He still wears the distinctive
	Kessilian hair knot.)  They bow before the King.

				 KAYOS (pointing to the suns)
		Aren't they beautiful, General? 
		"Always and never the same." 
		You're just in time for dinner.

				 SKYWALKER
		I have come for other reasons.  
		Could...?

				 KAYOS
		Relax, General.  We will discuss it, 
		but over dinner.  There are times, 
		Luke, when I find you a bit too rigid. 
		Is this your new disciple?

	Justin is ill at ease and bows again.

				 JUSTIN
		Justin Valor, sir.

				 KAYOS
		Where's your father?

				 SKYWALKER
		He left for the spaceport at GORDON 
		to visit an old friend, Han Solo, 
		the UREALLIAN.

				 KAYOS
		We are becoming quite a refuge.

	The group sit at a large table and food is brought in by
	servants.  They eat.  Justin is nervous and watches the
	general, to make sure he is being proper.

				 SKYWALKER
		My Lord, several events have occurred 
		which lead me to believe we are in 
		imminent danger of attack.  There is 
		no longer time for discussion and debate.

				 KAYOS
		What events?

				 SKYWALKER
		Oxus, our best agent, has disappeared 
		in the galactic capital. There is 
		unusual military traffic in the S-4 
		sectors.

				 KAYOS
		Unless you have direct, concrete proof 
		of a pending attack, there is nothing 
		I can do.

				 SKYWALKER
		By the time we have proof, it may be 
		too late.

				 KAYOS
		Luke, I'm leaving tonight for AMSEL. 
		I'm meeting with the full assembly 
		first thing in the morning.  I am not 
		going to approve the Alliance Treaty, 
		and I will get your defense measure 
		approved.  Just be patient.  You will 
		have the war code.

				 SKYWALKER
		Tomorrow may be too late.  My Lord, 
		I need the war code now.  We must 
		get our forces into space.

				 KAYOS
		But it must be done legally, with 
		everyone's approval.  Tomorrow you 
		will have that.  I doubt the New 
		Galactic Kingdom would attack before 
		receiving our answer.  The separation 
		of war powers is the one condition 
		upon which you assumed command of our 
		forces.  You're a friend, Luke, and  
		I trust you;  but you're also an out-
		lander who controls a great deal of 
		power.  I can't forsake my oath any 
		more than you can.  Just be patient. 
		You will have the code tomorrow.

	Captain Montross enters the large chamber and bows before 
	the King.

				 MONTROSS
		I bring a report to General Skywalker, 
		My Lord.

				 KAYOS
		You may deliver it.

				 MONTROSS
		Sir, the asteroid has disappeared from 
		our scopes.  There is no trace of it.

				 SKYWALKER
		Were they able to analyze it?

				 MONTROSS
		It never came within range, sir.

	The general rises, quickly followed by Captain Valor.

				 GENERAL
		Excuse us, My Lord.  We'd better 
		get back.  I will wait patiently 
		for the approval.

	The general and Montross exit the chamber.  Valor takes 
	one last bite of his dinner, then dashes after his mentor.

20.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	The general sits rigidly  facing the big galactic display
	board.  Several aides and bureaucrats rush to and fro,
	ignoring the general.  He is asleep.  Captain Prue 
	approaches the general and snaps to attention.  The 
	general's eyes open.

				 SKYWALKER
		What are the results?

				 PRUE
		Negative, Sir.

				 SKYWALKER
		Are you sure?

				 PRUE
		Absolutely.

				 SKYWALKER
		It's just not possible.  Something 
		that size can't just disappear with-
		out a trace.  Check it again.

				 PRUE
		That's the tenth negative, Sir.

				 SKYWALKER
		I said check it again.

	Captain Prue retreats to a computer station. The general
	looks around for Captain Valor.

				 SKYWALKER
		Valor!

	Everyone near the general turns, but Valor doesn't show.

				 SKYWALKER
		Where is that boy?  Montross!

	Montross rushes up to the general and snaps to attention.

				 SKYWALKER
		Page Captain Valor.

	Montross goes back to his station and a few moments later,
	Captain Valor is paged over the P.A. system.  The general
	waits, watching the big board.  Eventually, Justin stumbles
	out of an enclosed computer closet, fastening his pants and
	tucking in his tunic.  A moment later, the cute female aide
	rather sheepishly exits the computer closet.  She also is 
	in the process of putting her uniform back together.  Justin
	rushes up to the general and snaps to attention.

	The general lets him stand there for a moment, not acknow-
	ledging his presence;  then, suddenly without warning and 
	in one masterful flash motion, the general stands, grabs 
	a small baton attached to his belt (which immediately 
	ignites into a four-foot glowing lazersword) and swings 
	at the young warrior's head.  In an equally quick movement,
	Justin ignites his lazersword and blocks the general's 
	blow.  Everyone in the war room is surprised and startled.
	After a moment, they rush to the general.  Justin and the
	general stand motionless for a few moments, with lazer-
	swords locked in mid-air.  Finally, the general grins and Justin
	hesitantly relaxes.  They lower their swords and turn them off.

				 SKYWALKER
		You are trained well, but remember, 
		a Dai must be single-minded, a 
		discipline your father obviously 
		never learned, hence your existence.
		Clean yourself up.  Discipline is 
		essential.  Your mind must follow 
		the way of the Nogas.

				 JUSTIN
		It won't happen again, sir.  There 
		are many new....

				 P.A.
		General Skywalker, white com.

	The general moves to a control station and picks up a phone.

				 PHONE VOICE
		Sir, Captain Oxus has just been 
		admitted to Med Vac.

				 SKYWALKER
		What's his condition?

				 PHONE VOICE
		No data, sir.

				 SKYWALKER
		I'm on my way.

21.  MED VAC EMERGENCY ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Captain Valor waits in an outer chamber as General Sky-
	walker rushes into the Med Vac emergency room where
	several doctors are working on the prostrate Oxus.

				 SKYWALKER
		What's his condition?  Is 
		he conscious?

				 DOCTOR
		Partially.  He'll be all right - 
		a few bruises, primary exhaustion...

	Oxus thrashes around in a semi-conscious state.  He sees 
	the general.

				 SKYWALKER
		What happened, boy?  What's going on?

				 OXUS (with difficulty)
		The Royal Starforce is already on its 
		way, not far behind me.  They're going 
		to attack.

				 SKYWALKER
		Are you sure?

				 OXUS
		I have tapes.  A giant space fortress...

	He struggles to give General Skywalker his ring.

				 SKYWALKER
		As big as our Third Moon?

				 OXUS
		Bigger.  It's unlike anything 
		I've ever seen.  Sophisticated 
		deflection systems - works in 
		opposition to the suns.

				 SKYWALKER
		Then they will show up on our 
		screens at sunrise.  They'll 
		attack before that.

	The general rushes into the outer chamber where Captain
	Valor is waiting for him.

				 SKYWALKER
		Take the fastest landspeeder to 
		Chathos.  Pick up Princess Zara -
		and only Princess Zara.  Return by 
		way of the Great Reef.  Most speed.

	Valor exits and the general goes to an intercom and
	pushes several buttons.

				 SKYWALKER
		Montross!

				 MONTROSS
		Sir!

				 SKYWALKER
		Full alert - everything!  Get the 
		Royal Family back here.

				 MONTROSS
		The princess is at Chathos.  There 
		are no transports...

				 SKYWALKER
		I've already sent Captain Valor for 
		her!  Contact the King, first priority. 
		He's probably still en route to Amsel.  
		Use the scan com.  I'm on my way.

22.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	The war room is on full alert.  Everyone is at attention
	waiting for the command that will put each of them into 
	action.  The general enters a communication center, 
	followed by many aides.  Captain Montross and the com 
	aide salute.

				 MONTROSS
		We're having a problem getting 
		through, sir.  There is a great 
		deal of interference.

				 PRUE
		It could be jamming.

				 SKYWALKER
		Try a surface link through Amsel.

	The aides go back to the com-link system to try to get a 
	line through to the King.

				 PRUE
		We should be able to spot them at 
		sunrise.  That's not too far off.

				 SKYWALKER
		They'll attack with sunrise.  Until 
		the King gives us the code to start 
		the war computers, we'll just have 
		to sit tight.

				 PRUE
		All units are on alert, sir.

				 SKYWALKER (to Montross)
		Have you made contact yet?  (to himself)  
		This is one hell of a way to run a war.

				 PRUE
		Sir?

23.  COURTYARD - ACADEMY OF CHATHOS - TOWNOWI

	A landspeeder roars into a courtyard of the academy at
	Chathos.  Valor jumps out, and runs up to the large,
	heavy doors of the academy.  They are locked.  He 
	bangs madly on the carved metallic door until finally 
	an old woman manages to swing it open.  Valor rushes 
	past her into the main courtyard, where Princess Zara 
	and her handmaiden, Mina, struggle with two large cases. 
	They are followed by two very old matrons, dragging 
	several more cases.

				 JUSTIN
		Forget the cases;  we've no time.

				 ZARA
		These are my things.  They must...

				 JUSTIN
		I said forget them, and hurry.

				 ZARA
		Just who do you think you are?

	Valor grabs the princess by the arm, and hauls her to the
	speeder.  Mina and the old women run after them.

				 ZARA
		I will not be treated like this!  You 
		bring my things.  My father will have 
		your head (etc.)

	Zara struggles to break away from the young warrior's grasp, 
	as he opens the door of the speeder.

				 JUSTIN
		Settle down!

	When the door to the speeder is opened, Mina starts in, 
	and Valor stops her.

				 JUSTIN
		You must stay.  Here, take the crest.

	Captain Valor rips the royal crest from the princess' 
	neck, and hands it to the startled handmaiden.  The old 
	women gasp in horror.  The princess starts hitting 
	Captain Valor with little result.

				 PRINCESS
		Mina's not staying.  I'm not leaving 
		her.  You can't...

	Valor punches her square on the jaw and knocks her cold. 
	Mina is panic stricken, one of the old women faints, and 
	another starts for Valor with a large staff.

				 JUSTIN
		She'll be all right.  I'm taking her 
		to safety, as ordered.  You will wear 
		the crest and continue as before.

	The authority of Captain Valor's voice stops the old lady.  
	He places the princess into the speeder, and maneuvers it 
	out of the courtyard.  Mina puts on the crest as the speeder
	races away from the academy.

24.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Queen Breha, Oeta and Puck are escorted into a rest area 
	of the war room.  General Skywalker sits rigidly in a chair 
	in the communications area, apparently asleep.

				 MONTROSS
		We've made contact, sir!

	The general opens his eyes and takes the intercom mike.

				 KAYOS
		What is it, General?

				 SKYWALKER
		The Royal Starforce will attack on the 
		rising of the sun.  My agent made it 
		back.  I now have proof.  I need the 
		war code.

				 KAYOS
		I'll relay it directly to the computer. 
		Is Breha...?

				 SKYWALKER
		The Royal Family is safe.  Captain 
		Valor has gone after Princess Zara.

				 KAYOS
		I'm on my way back.

25.  RED PLAINS - TOWNOWI

	The small caravan of four speeders sits motionless on the 
	vast red plains of Townowi.  The King returns the intercom 
	to the pilot and takes a small metallic card from around 
	his neck and gives it to the co-pilot.

				 KAYOS
		Send this sub-land, priority one.  
		(to the pilot)  Get us back to 
		CALVAS immediately!

	The four speeders turn around and scream away in the
	direction from which they came.   They pass a huge, ultra-
	sleek powerplow which is planting green fungus in endless
	furrows.  Two clay-covered farmers riding atop the pon-
	derous machine watch the speeders disappear over the 
	horizon.  The twin suns peek over the distant hillside. 
	and make their way into the vivid green sky.  A bright 
	object twinkling in early morning heavens  catches the 
	eye of the older of the two farmers  and he brings the 
	machine to a lumbering halt.  The younger farmer also 
	notices the object  and stares into the green sky, shading 
	his eyes to get a better view.

	Suddenly there is a huge, bright atomic flash on the 
	horizon.  A few moments later, a thunderous shaking, 
	followed by high winds, tumbles the older farmer from his
	perch.  A second flash on the opposite horizon brings 
	another jolting earthquake, and the younger farmer col-
	lapses, terror frozen on his face.

26.  READYROOM - SPACEPORT OUTPOST - TOWNOWI

	Chaos - red scramble lights are flashing.  Alert horns 
	and attack buzzers create an unbelievable cacophony. 
	Air warriors, with the distinctive circle and cross 
	medallion on their white space suits, scramble out of 
	the low concrete readyroom, grabbing helmets and space-
	packs as they race out of the door.

27.  ATTACK RUNWAY - SPACEPORT OUTPOST - TOWNOWI

	Thirty pilots and navigators dash in unison to a line of
	waiting two-man starships of the destroyer class.  Ground
	crews scurry back and forth, loading last-minute armament
	and unlocking power couplings.  PILOT LEADER, a rugged,
	handsome boy  of twenty, gives his ground crew a signal 
	that his is okay.  He has a winning smile and a distinctive 
	scar along the side of his face.  His crew chief pats him 
	on the back.

				 CHIEF
		Knock them all the way back to 
		Granicus.

	The canopy is closed and the powerful starship moves 
	onto the runway.  Other crewmen say good-bye to their 
	pilots, some grinning and others kidding - all with a 
	great deal of hidden emotion.  The din of four dozen
	retrorockets cuts through the uproar, and fifteen 
	silver spacecraft leave the runway and disappear into 
	the morning cloud cover.

28.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	The general stands before a giant display of the 
	Townowian solar system.  Montross signals the general.

				 MONTROSS
		They're away, sir.  Fifteen from 
		Gordon, twenty from Amsel.  All 
		other spaceports were destroyed. 
		The King hasn't arrived yet.

				 SKYWALKER
		Keep checking.  Put the starship’s 
		intercom over the P.A.

	The general sits at one of the intercom panels  and puts 
	on a headphone.  A row of monitors is before him.  He 
	turns to Montross.

				 SKYWALKER
		Where are they?

29.  SPACE - TOWNOWI IN ECLIPSE

	The eerie reddish-yellow planet of Townowi slowly drifts
	into view from total eclipse.  A small, bright speck, 
	orbiting the planet, sparkles in the light of the twin 
	suns.  The six deadly starships settle ominously into the
	foreground, moving swiftly toward the orbiting speck.  As 
	the sleek starships move closer, the orbiting speck is 
	revealed to be a gargantuan space fortress.  The moon-
	sized satellite fortress dwarfs the approaching fighters. 
	Every few moments, explosions create blinding flashes on 
	the planet's surface, as the fortress bombards the planet 
	with a fusillade of lazer bolts.

30.  TOWNOWIAN STARSHIP - INTERIOR

	Pilot Leader, in the first ship, signals to his navigator 
	who sits in a small, isolated glass bubble to the rear of 
	the craft.  General Skywalker is seen on one of many 
	monitors.  A view of the space fortress is on another. 
	The rest are filled with various computer readouts and
	displays.  One of the other starships reports to Pilot 
	Leader.

				 DEVIL SIX (intercom)
		Look at the size of that thing! 
		Hey, Coelo, I hope you remembered 
		to bring your pop gun, 'cause I 
		think we caught us a big one this 
		time.

				 PILOT LEADER
		Cut off, Devil Six.  Stand by.

				 SKYWALKER (monitor)
		It looks like they're still using 
		the basic quad-tristation configura-
		tion.  Use a "ranger defense." 
		Concentrate on breath ports and lock 
		areas.

				 PILOT LEADER
		Affirmative base.  Copy and transmit.
		Devil Two, check your rotation plates.

				 DEVIL TWO
		Roger, Boss.  We're getting a thresh-
		hold disturbance on gyro-three.

				 SKYWALKER (monitor)
		Switch over, Five.  Cover it! 
		Devil pack, generate a spread six 
		formation.  May the force of others 
		protect you.

				 PILOT
		Settle in. Devil pack, stand by. 
		Mark five, break off. Here we go! 

31.  SPACE - TOWNOWIAN STARSHIP

	Fuel pods are jettisoned.  The half-dozen fighters break 
	off into a powerline attack on the huge fortress.  Multiple
	lazer bolts streak from the starships, creating small 
	explosions on the complex surface of the fort.

32.  INTERIOR MAIN CORRIDOR - ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS

	The chaos of battle echoes through the vast corridors of 
	the fortress.  Walls buckle and cave in, sucking debris 
	and personnel into the vacuum of outer space.  Alarm 
	sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo-powered 
	lazer gun emplacements.  Sergeants yell orders through the 
	smoke and confusion.  Men and robots of various shapes and 
	sizes run to their battle stations.

33.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	The monitors with pictures from the starships suddenly go 
	blank.  Technicians check channels as others in the war 
	room silently listen to the action over the intercom. The
	general remains calm but concerned.

				 PILOT LEADER (intercom)
		Tighten it up, Devil Two.  Tighten it up. 
		Watch those towers.

				 DEVIL TWO 
		Heavy fire, Boss, twenty-three degrees.

				 PILOT LEADER
		I see it. Pull in.  We're picking up some 
		interference.

				 DEVIL SIX
		Wow!  I've never seen such fire power.

				 PILOT LEADER
		Pull in, Devil Two.  Pull in! 

				 DEVIL TWO 
		I'm all right, Boss.  I've got a target.

				 DEVIL SIX
		There’s too much action.  Get out!

				 PILOT LEADER
		Break off...acknowledge.  Devil Six, 
		can you see Devil Two?

				 DEVIL SIX
		I've lost him.  There's a very heavy 
		fire zone on this side.  My radar's 
		jammed.

				 DEVIL FIVE
		He's gone....No, wait.  There he is.
		Fin damage, but he's all right.

	A sigh of relief sweeps across the war room.  The monitors 
	flash on, then off again.

				 DEVIL FOUR (intercom)
		Watch your back, Boss!  Watch your 
		back!!

34.  TOWNOWI STARSHIP

	The speedy little fighters dart back and forth across the 
	soft underbelly of the fortress, leaving a trail of des-
	truction behind them.

				 PILOT LEADER
		Converge on south axis point, point three 
		nine four.  It appears accessible.  I'm 
		going to map the surface.  Devil Four, 
		cover me.

	Pilot Leader and Devil Four dive in unison through a forest 
	of radar domes, antennae, and gun towers.  Devil Four fires 
	into the protrusions as the two starships criss-cross the
	surface of the fortress.  Suddenly, a dense barrage of 
	lazerfire erupts from a tower, catching Devil Four broad-
	side.  The spacecraft bursts into a million flaming pieces.
	Pilot Leader reacts to the loss of his wing man, but con-
	tinues on his mission.

35.  SUB-HALLWAY - ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS

	Constant explosions rock the interior of the fortress.
	Civilians, including women and children, scurry for safety 
	in the panic-ridden hallways.  Two construction robots, 
	A-2 and C-3, are blown, slipping and sliding across the 
	hallway floor into some freight canisters.  Both robots 
	are rather old and battered.  A-2 is a short (three feet) 
	claw-armed triped.  His face is a mass of computer lights,
	surrounding a radar eye.  C-3 is a tall, gleaming android of
	human proportions.  He is thin, with a totally metallic 
	surface.  The robots attempt to get out from under the
	canisters, but rushing gas from a broken pipe keeps knocking
	them over.

				 C-3
		This is madness.  We're going to be 
		destroyed.  I'm still not accustomed 
		to space travel.

				 A-2
		The external bombardment does appear 
		to be concentrated in this area.  The 
		structure has exceeded the normal 
		stress quotient by point four, although 
		there appears to be no immediate danger.

				 C-3
		No immediate danger!  You're faulty. 
		This is madness!

	A-2 gives C-3 a sheepish look and clings to a siderail for 
	dear life, as debris flies through the hallway.

36.  TOWNOWI STARSHIP

	Devil Two, a young hotshot of about sixteen years, miracu-
	lously dives his ship through a virtual wall of lazerfire, 
	and blasts a huge radar disc into dust.  Devil Two signals 
	his navigator, who lets out a whooping cheer as the craft 
	veers into a victory roll.

				 PILOT LEADER
		Great moves, Devil Two.  Re-group at point 
		two, zero one.  Coincide, Devil Six.

				 SKYWALKER
		Devil One, your map projection shows a 
		weak point at south portal:  niner point 
		six.  Concentrate the attack on that 
		point.  Coordinate.
		
				 PILOT LEADER
		I see it.  It looks good.

	Devil Five and Devil Three bob and weave in formation 
	toward a giant transformer jutting from the fort's 
	surface.

				 DEVIL THREE
		I've got a... We're hit.  We're hit!

				 PILOT LEADER
		Eject...Eject.  Babs, Babs, do you read?

				 DEVIL THREE
		I'm okay.  I can hold it.  Clear me
		a little, Devil Five.  Watch it! 
		Watch it!

	Devil Three wobbles a little, then drops away sharply,
	plowing into a lazergun emplacement, causing a hideous 
	series of chain reaction explosions.

37.  SUB-HALLWAY - ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS

	A huge explosion rips a large hole in the ceiling of a sub-
	hallway.  A-2 and C-3 are in a state of shock as they 
	scramble through the rubble.  There is a constant sound of
	creaking and snapping as the sections of the hallway re-
	settle in the fortress superstructure.

				 A-2
		You're a mindless, useless philosopher. 
		Come on!  Let's go back to work;  the 
		system is all right.

				 C-3
		You overweight glob of grease.  Quit 
		following me.  Get away!  Get away!

	Suddenly, the hallway lurches, and a dead trooper falls
	through a gaping hole in the ceiling.  The foot of a carcass 
	is caught in the rubble and it hangs upside down, staring at 
	the two robots.  A-2 grabs C-3 and they cling to each other 
	in terror.

				 A-2
		We're lost.  We're destroyed.

	Three sharp blasts from an airhorn send the two androids 
	running for cover in a burned-out doorway.  Five grim-
	faced troopers riding small rocket platforms  pass the 
	two mechanical men.

38.  GOVERNOR'S QUARTERS - ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS

	The five troopers race through several hallways, and 
	finally stop in front of an important-looking office 
	complex.  Two officers dismount and enter the complex. 
	They pass through several heavily guarded doorways 
	until they reach the main chamber.  Seated behind a large
	cluttered desk, surrounded by generals and attaches, is
	Governor Horus.  General Vader paces in front of a row of 
	blank monitors.  The two officers salute General Vader.

				 FIRST OFFICER
		All com-link power is out.  Twenty-
		two transformer sections have been 
		destroyed.  The situation is grave 
		on all southern levels.  Com-link 
		communication should be repaired 
		shortly.

	The officers salute, turn and leave the chamber.  The 
	general turns to Governor Horus, who looks a little
	worried.

				 VADER
		Don't look so worried.  Not even a 
		Dai could penetrate this fortress.
		We've already wiped out most of 
		their forces.

				 HORUS
		If it goes on too long, we'll run 
		over budget.  When do the landings 
		begin?

				 VADER
		As soon as the attack has been 
		broken:  not long.

	A short, stocky attache salutes the general.

				 ATTACHE
		Contamination has set in on quadrants 
		B-5 and R-4.  All sections are sealed. 
		We've lost two major power stations 
		in the southern quadrants.  That puts 
		section 5-1 in serious trouble.

	The general turns away in controlled anger and embarrass-
	ment.

39.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	The general sits in a glass-enclosed computer station,
	watching the battle progress on several monitors.  An 
	officer enters and salutes the general.

				 OFFICER
		Analysis reports those ZQ configurations 
		are definitely power transformers.  Every-
		thing in the southern sectors of the 
		fortress is out.

				 SKYWALKER

		I'm surprised they are still using exter-
		nal power units.  It's a definite weak 
		point.  Concentrate on searching for the 
		main crosslink transformer.

	The officer exits as Montross rushes in.

				 MONTROSS

		The senate has voted to end the war.

				 SKYWALKER
		They can't do anything without the 
		King's approval, which gives us a 
		little time.  Have you been able to 
		regain contact with the King?

				 MONTROSS
		No, sir.  All ground communications 
		are jammed.

				 SKYWALKER
		Send four men  from third squad  to 
		meet the King  and escort him back. 
		Let me know before he arrives.  Is 
		Captain Valor back with the princess?

				 MONTROSS
		No, sir.  They're long overdue.

	Pilot Leader checks in over the intercom.

				 PILOT LEADER
		All right, base one, we're in 
		position.

	An officer with headphones looks to the general.  He 
	signals to attack.

40.  TOWNOWI STARSHIPS

	All four starships dive in formation toward a main trans-
	former area  flanked by several solar towers.

				 PILOT LEADER
		Hold your fire until we're within point 
		zero five four.  Make it count.

	Several ack-ack lazers begin to open fire on the approaching 
	spacecraft.  The starships direct their fire at a large 
	black transformer  which when hit  spurts bright blue and 
	white electrical arcs.  One of the starships (Devil Five) 
	explodes and careens out of formation, leaving an erratic 
	trail of smoke, before eventually crashing into a solar 
	panel.

41.  SUB-HALLWAYS - ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS

	The impact of the exploding starship can be felt throughout 
	the giant fortress.  The tall gleaming C-3 races through 
	several corridors, yelling at A-2, who struggles vainly to 
	keep pace with his stubby mechanical feet.

				 C-3
		I don't care what you do, but I'm 
		getting out.  All the power's out. 
		Those explosions are coming from 
		the reactor section.  This is the 
		end. Abandon ship!

				 A-2
		Our work - we can't leave!  It's 
		desertion.  It's not possible. 
		It's not possible.

				 C-3
		Your programming is so limited. 
		My first order is preservation. 
		You stay.  I'm going to eject 
		before the whole thing goes up.

	C-3 breaks open the seal on an emergency lifepod.  A 
	red warning light begins to flash, and a low hum is 
	heard.  The lanky chrome android works his way into 
	the cramped four-man craft.

				 A-2
		These lifepods aren't for us. 
		It's not right!

	A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and 
	debris through the narrow passageway.  Flames lick at 
	the two robots.  The runt-sized A-2 jumps  into the 
	lifepod.

				 A-2
		It's the end.  Eject.  Eject.

	The safety door snaps shut, and the pod ejects from the
	fortress.

42.  TOWNOWI STARSHIPS

	The terrified androids in the lifepod speed away from 
	the fortress  and pass the attacking starships.

				 DEVIL TWO
		Object approaching.  Attack bearing.

				 DEVIL FOUR
		It's a lifepod.  Forget it.  We've got...

	Devil Four is hit by lazerfire, and disintegrates, leaving 
	a trail of flaming particles.  The two remaining craft 
	continue the assault.  Devil Two and Pilot Leader watch 
	the remains of Devil Four disappear.  The general appears 
	over one of the monitors.

				 SKYWALKER
		Analysis indicates transformer code 
		zero three is the main relay.  Hit it, 
		and the whole thing goes dead.

				 PILOT LEADER
		We're on our way.

43.  GOVERNOR'S QUARTERS - ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS

	A row of monitors and the main overhead lights go on, and 
	a trooper appears on one of the screens.

				 TROOPER
		Internal relays operative.  All 
		power restored.  All contaminated 
		areas sealed.

	An officer appears on another monitor.

				 OFFICER
		Only two enemy craft remain operative. 
		We calculate victory by zero three 
		hundred.

	General Vader switches to another monitor.

				 VADER
		Alert the invasion forces.  (turning 
		to the governor)  The planet is ours. 
		A three-hour war.  You expected 
		longer.  Dai or not, we've beaten 
		him, and the culture is intact.

				 HORUS
		A truly great prize for the kingdom. 
		They have a treasure of biotic science. 
		Genetics, cloning - they've added two
		hundred years to a lifespan.  Remember, 
		you must capture at least one member of 
		the Royal Family alive.  The Townowi 
		family has ruled this system for ten 
		thousand years.  The people will follow 
		no other.  If the royal line is broken, 
		there is a good chance the entire 
		population will destroy themselves and 
		their knowledge before submitting to our 
		rule.

	The general is interrupted by a call on one of the 
	monitors.

				 OFFICER (on monitor)
		We've received a message from the 
		planet.

44.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	General Skywalker watches a giant computer display of 
	the space fortress mapped by the starships.  An aide
	approaches.

				 AIDE
		Sir!  The King's convoy has destroyed 
		at Caldin.  All the bodies were con-
		taminated.

				 SKYWALKER
		I will audience with the Queen. 
		Who knows of this?

				 AIDE
		Many.  It came through civilian 
		sources.

				 SKYWALKER
		Confine Senator Sandage to his 
		quarters.  Use any pretext.  Where 
		is the senator now?

	Sandage and several other senators enter the computer
	station.

				 SANDAGE
		Right here, General.  It's over. 
		We've already relayed peace terms 
		to the kingdom, and they've been 
		accepted.  Your war has ended.

	The general is angry and stands pointing at the senators.
	They jump back, as if the general were pointing a gun at
	them.

				 SKYWALKER
		Senator, this war isn't over.  It's 
		just begun.  I take my commands 
		from the Royal Family.

				 SANDAGE
		The Queen concurs.  I have her 
		written decree.  It is to be 
		implemented immediately.  I order 
		you to cease the attack.

				 SKYWALKER
		Not likely.

				 SANDAGE
		Treason?  Revolution?  The people 
		won't follow you, General, nor will 
		your troops.  I suggest you follow 
		your orders.

	General Skywalker stands angrily pondering the situation.
	Sandage and the other senators are tense, a little afraid
	that he might cut them down on the spot.

				 SANDAGE
		Well, General?

45.  LIFEPOD - GREEN SKY OVER TOWNOWI

	The reddish-yellow mass of Townowi seems to engulf the 
	tiny lifepod containing the two fleeing androids, as it 
	descends into the greenish atmosphere.

				 A-2
		It's desertion.  They'll destroy us. 
		How could this happen?

				 C-3
		That's funny.  The damage doesn't 
		look as bad from out here.

46.  TOWNOWI STARSHIPS

	Pilot Leader and Devil Two make a second dive on the now
	smoldering transformer area.  All firing from the fortress 
	suddenly stops.  Pilot Leader looks back to his navigator, 
	who is equally puzzled.  The two fighters continue to attack 
	the now silent fortress.

				 DEVIL TWO
		I don't get it.  What do you 
		think, Boss?

	General Skywalker appears on the monitors.

				 SKYWALKER (with difficulty)
		Base one to Devil Leader, scramble code 
		niner.  Break your attack and return to 
		base.  Repeat, break your attack. 
		Confirm.

				 PILOT LEADER
		They're hurt, sir, but they still have 
		power.  We should finish...

				 SKYWALKER
		Break off.  The war is over.  Run on 
		white lights.  Get back here, Mace. 
		We're going to need you.

				 PILOT LEADER
		Confirmed base one.  We're on our way. 
		Did you copy, Devil Two?

				 DEVIL TWO
		Roger, Boss.

	The two starfighters break off the attack and start back
	toward the planet.  Without warning, the fort directs
	concentrated fire at the two starfighters.  Devil Two
	instantly bursts into flames, then disintegrates.  Pilot
	Leader's tail section is hit, and the ship pinwheels 
	toward the planet.  Blood covers Pilot Leader's immobile 
	face.

				 PILOT LEADER'S NAVIGATOR
		We're under fire.  They're still shooting.  
		I thought it was over.  We're hit!  We're 
		hit!  Pilot is dead.... Ejecting.

	The dead Pilot Leader is jettisoned free of the craft, but 
	the navigator's eject panel is dead.  He struggles with it, 
	then bangs on the canopy to no avail.  The navigator is 
	still trapped in the craft when it explodes, leaving only 
	a puff of pink smoke reflected in the rim light of the 
	planet.

47.  DESERT NEAR OUTPOST - TOWNOWI

	Pilot Leader's dead body drifts toward his arid mother-
	planet.  Automatic rockets kick in occasionally to direct 
	and soften the landing.  Two gray-clad troopers stand next 
	to a military landspeeder, watching the descending air-
	warrior through electrobinoculars.  Mace's corpse hits the
	ground rather hard, creating a whirlwind of dust, and the 
	two troopers rush over to the pilot.  The younger of the 
	two troopers, a young boy in his teens, cradles the dead 
	starpilot in his arms and begins to cry.

48.  WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	General Skywalker sits alone, meditating in the deserted 
	war room.  Montross approaches the contemplative general.

				 MONTROSS
		No sign of Captain Valor or the 
		princess.  There was much damage 
		in that area.  The Queen will see 
		you at ten hundred.

	The general doesn't reply.

49.  ASSEMBLY - DEPARTURE AREA - ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS

	General Vader stands behind a row of men at computer 
	control panels overlooking a huge assembly of troop, 
	tanks, and transports. A commander reports to the general.

				 COMMANDER
		All enemy craft destroyed.  First 
		and fifth division troops and 
		equipment standing by.

	The general gives a sly smile of approval and takes a
	microphone from one of the computer technicians.  He 
	speaks to the troops and pilots waiting in their huge 
	war machines for the invasion order.

				 VADER
		The war is won.  With the conquering 
		of this  system, we have ushered in a 
		new millennium for the New Galactic 
		Kingdom which will echo throughout the 
		universe.  Our reward is the knowledge 
		this system possesses.  This planet 
		must be controlled with a minimum 
		of force, but you must not think 
		lightly of this enemy.  They have 
		exacted a heavy toll.  Today you will 
		make the kingdom complete.  Do so with 
		pride and care.

	Vader puts down the mike, and turns to his commander.

				 VADER
		Let the invasion begin.

50.  EDGE OF THE DUNE SEA - TOWNOWI

	KUROLAND, or "No-Man's Land," where the rugged desert 
	mesas meet the foreboding dune sea.  The two helpless astro 
	robots kick up clouds of dust as they clumsily work their 
	way across the desert coastline.  The short A-2 struggles 
	desperately to keep up with the long-legged C-3.

				 A-2
		It's not possible.  We're not 
		built for this.  You're nothing 
		more than a dim-witted, emotion
		brained intellectual.  Why you 
		were created is beyond my logic 
		systems.  Thanks to you, we're 
		now deserters, and will probably 
		be destroyed on sight.  And on 
		top of that, you're going the 
		wrong way!  All this filth is 
		getting...

	The towering C-3 stops short and turns on the blabbering 
	mechanical runt.

				 C-3
		I've had enough of you, you 
		pragmatic, nearsighted scrap 
		pile.  You go your own way.

	He picks up the tiny robot and tosses him several feet into 
	a large sand dune.  C-3 starts off in the direction of the 
	dune sea.  A-2 struggles to his feet and shakes a metallic 
	claw arm at his disappearing ex-partner.

				 A-2
		You'll be malfunctioning within a 
		day.  You're going the wrong way, 
		but your way is always the wrong 
		way.

	C-3 stops and yells to the smaller android.

				 C-3
		And don't let me catch you following 
		me, begging for help, because you 
		won't get it from me.

	A-2’s reply is a rather rude sound, which only an electronic 
	person could make.  He turns and trudges off in the opposite 
	direction into the rocky desert mesas.

51.  DUNE SEA - TOWNOWI

	C-3, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of the dune, 
	only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless 
	miles.  He looks back in the direction he came.

				 C-3
		You little malfunctioning twerp. 
		This is all your fault.  You tricked
		me into going this way, but you'll do 
		no better!

	He sits in a huff of anger and frustration, knocking the 
	sand from his joints.

52.  DESERT MESA - TOWNOWI

	A-2 stumbles through a narrow canyon until he climbs over 
	a small boulder and sees before him a sight he first thinks 
	is a mirage.  Nestled in a rock formation is a deserted 
	landspeeder.  Once the little robot is convinced that he 
	is alone, he approaches the battered speeder and begins to 
	analyze it.  He climbs into the pilot's seat  and attempts 
	to start the unfamiliar transport.  He hears a sound and 
	stops for a moment.  He sees nothing, so he continues to 
	fiddle with the control panel until the speeder lurches 
	forward with a start, banging into a large rock.  The 
	stubby android is shaken, but neither he  nor the speeder 
	seems to be damaged.

	Shivers run down A-2's metal spine, and again he has an
	eerie feeling that he is being watched.  He slowly looks
	around  and sees a large man, Captain Valor, standing 
	directly behind him.  He is startled, then terrified.

				 JUSTIN
		Where is your master?

	The little robot clicks and rattles, but doesn't speak.

				 JUSTIN (Cont.)
		Can't you speak?  How do you relate 
		your data?  You're of Karollian manu-
		facture.  You should be able to talk. 
		Are you damaged?

	Valor pokes at the machine  but doesn't see any damage. 
	A-2 eyes him suspiciously.  The robot turns with a start 
	and discovers a young girl, Princess Zara, has been 
	standing next to him for some time.

				 PRINCESS (sarcastically)
		Well, General, who's your friend?

				 JUSTIN
		I don't know.  He doesn't seem to 
		be able to talk.  Damaged, probably...
		Jettisoned from a damaged ship...

				 PRINCESS
		What do you intend to do with it?

				 JUSTIN
		We'll take it with us.  Could be a 
		storehouse of valuable information.

	Justin guides the android into the small luggage area 
	behind the front seat, then hops into the driver's seat.

				 PRINCESS
		I don't want to ride with that thing. 
		I order you to destroy it immediately.

				 JUSTIN
		Get in!  We've got to hurry if we're 
		going to get across the "dunehedge" 
		by nightfall.  You're coming, one way 
		or the other.  Will you join us peace-
		ably?

	The princess reluctantly gets into the speeder, and it starts 
	with a jolt.

53.  LANDSPEEDER - DESERT MESAS - TOWNOWI

	The speeder flies along, a foot or so above the landscape.

				 PRINCESS
		You are such a barbarian.  I'll have 
		my father cut you into little pieces 
		when we get back...and I'll take 
		pleasure in feeding you to the Gonthas,
		a little bit each day.  I may save your 
		eyes though.  I'll have them petrified 
		and made into a necklace.

				 JUSTIN
		Your sweetness is only surpassed by your 
		beauty.  Just try to remember, I'm only 
		following orders.

				 PRINCESS
		To beat and abuse me?
					 
				 JUSTIN
		I'm afraid I've only learned one way 
		to treat wild animals.

	A-2 thrashes about, trying to relieve the pressure on his	 
	cramped legs.

				 PRINCESS
		You stay out of this.

54.  DUNE SEA

	C-3 struggles to the top of a large dune.  He is dirty and 
	hot.  His plight seems hopeless.  He searches the horizon 
	for any sign of life.  A glint of reflected light in the 
	distance  reveals an object speeding toward him.  The 
	chrome android waves frantically  and yells at the 
	approaching speeder.  The sleek landspeeder races past 
	him about a hundred yards away.  He runs after it, 
	screaming in desperation, until he stumbles and falls 
	head over heels down an enormous sand dune.  Silently,	 
	the speeder sweeps around in a circle and stops behind 
	the immobile robot.  Valor jumps out of the speeder and 
	is quickly followed by A-2.

				 PRINCESS
		We're in a hurry, remember!  If 
		you're going to stop for every 
		unfortunate along the way, we'll 
		never get back.  We're lucky you 
		got the speeder running as it is.

	A-2 waddles up to his fallen partner and starts pulling on 
	his leg, then runs up and starts pulling on his arm.

				 A-2
		Function!  Function!  It's me. 
		Come on, function.

				 VALOR
		Well, my little friend, you've 
		found your tongue.

				 A-2
		We must help him.  We've been 
		lost.

				 VALOR
		Where did you come from?

	The little robot runs around his fallen partner giving him 
	small electric charges from his claw hand.  C-3 shudders 
	from head to toe, then regains consciousness.

				 C-3
		What happened?

				 A-2
		You're overheated.

				 VALOR
		Where did you come from?

				 A-2
		We were jettisoned from six twenty-
		nine P.R. one.

				 VALOR
		I'm unfamiliar with that ship. 
		What type is it?

				 C-3
		It's a class M station, not a 
		conventional craft.

	C-3 then stands and shakes the young Dai's hand.

				 C-3
		I'm C-3, Human-Cyborg Relations.  
		Your kindness is greatly appreciated.

	Captain valor and the two robots walk back to the speeder.

55.  LANDSPEEDER - DESERT CANYON - TWONOWI

	Both A-2 and C-3 are stuffed into the tiny luggage com-
	partment.  It is late in the day when the speeder rumbles 
	to a stop in a small desert canyon surrounded by steep 
	cliffs and broken boulders.

				 JUSTIN
		We'll rest here.

				 C-3
		At last.  The transport is welcome 
		but my joints are frozen.

	Everyone climbs out of the low-slung speeder.  Valor
	watches the two androids as they stretch their mechanical 
	limbs.

				 A-2
		I've got a bad case of dust contami-
		nation.  I can barely move.

				 C-3
		What a foresaken place this is.  We 
		seem to be made to suffer.  It's 
		our lot in life.  Sir, could you 
		tell...?

	C-3 turns and notices that Valor and the princess have 
	disappeared.  He looks all around.

				 C-3
		Where did they go?  They've dis-
		appeared.

				 A-2
		Maybe they were attacked. 
		I sense danger!

56.  HIDDEN FORTRESS ENTRANCE - DESERT CANYON - TOWNOWI

	Captain Valor and Princess Zara hurry through a maze of 
	large boulders  until they reach a sheer rock face.  Valor 
	looks around to see if they were followed.  Suddenly  a 
	large section of the rock slides away  revealing a well-
	lit corridor carved out of the rock.  They enter  and are 
	greeted by two jubilant guards.  Valor gives them some 
	orders and points in the direction of the speeder.  The 
	secret rock door silently slides closed.

57.  MAIN HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Captain Valor and the princess are greeted by General 
	Skywalker and Montross.  They bow before the princess.

				 PRINCESS (angrily pointing at Valor)
		General, I want you to do something 
		with this...this barbarian.  Where's 
		my father?

				 GENERAL
		The King is dead, Your Highness.

	All anger suddenly drains from the princess. She almost
	timidly asks the next question.

				 PRINCESS
		My mother?... and brothers?

				 GENERAL
		She's here.  She's safe, so are your 
		brothers.  They're in the main chamber.

	Zara, now looking more like a frightened young girl than 
	a vindictive princess, runs down the hallway toward the 
	main chamber.  She vainly attempts to hold back the tears.

58.  DESERT CANYON - TOWNOWI

	The two puzzled androids sit on the landspeeder, pondering 
	the disappearance of their saviour.

				 C-3
		Do you suppose we're in danger?

				 A-2
		The logic of this environment 
		escapes me.

	As night begins to fall, and the shadows begin to lengthen, 
	the two robots begin to get a little edgy.  The sound of 
	approaching feet startles A-2, and he ducks behind his 
	taller friend.  Two guards approach the robots.

				 GUARD
		You will remain calm, and you will 
		remain here.

				 C-3
		Certainly. I'm C-3, Human Cyborg 
		Relations.  Your kindness is greatly 
		appreciated.

	A-2 sits rather suspiciously behind his extroverted friend.

59.  ROYAL CHAMBER - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	General Skywalker bows low before Princess Zara.  She sits 
	on a raised platform, dressed in the royal robes of a 
	planetary ruler.  The Queen sits off to one side on a
	smaller platform.  The princess waits for a few moments 
	before she allows the general to rise.

				 QUEEN
		The senate has been corrupted.

				 SKYWALKER
		They cannot rule without your 
		wish.

				 QUEEN
		I rule by marriage.  With the King 
		dead, I am not strong enough to stop 
		them.  Zara is now the true Queen. 
		She must be protected.  The line must 
		be preserved.  I am placing the 
		future of our people in your hands. 
		You must deliver Zara and her 
		brothers to the OPHUCHI System. 
		They will be safe there.  General, 
		you must understand.  I had no 
		alternative but to condone an end 
		to the hostilities.  I deeply 
		believe your campaign could have 
		been successful, but there are 
		things that...

				 SKYWALKER
		I understand, Your Highness.

				 QUEEN
		The chrome companies on Ophuchi have 
		offered to supply you with the men 
		and ships necessary to return Zara 
		to the throne.

				 SKYWALKER
		Can the chrome companies be trusted?

				 QUEEN
		The price for their cooperation is 
		high.  It is waiting for you in 
		Med Center blue.  Guard it as you 
		would the princess herself.  No-one 
		must know of this mission.  There 
		are those among the trusted who 
		would wish us ill.  Take only two 
		of your best officers with you, the 
		most loyal.  May the force of others 
		be with you.

				 ZARA
		Mother, you must not stay.

				 QUEEN
		I am too old for such a journey.  The 
		kingdom already controls the space-
		port cities.  You have a long way to 
		travel.  It won't be easy.

				 SKYWALKER
		We will have to travel in disguise. 
		I must have full command.  No-one 
		can suspect wealth or royal training. 
		I fear the new Queen will not stand 
		for this.

				 ZARA
		Do not put words into my mouth. 
		I will stand for what is necessary.

	The general simply smiles.

60.  SUB-HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	The general walks briskly through an isolated hallway,
	closely followed by Montross.

				 SKYWALKER
		How is Captain Oxus’ recovery?

				 MONTROSS
		Very good;  he's up and around.

				 SKYWALKER
		Fine!  Have Oxus and...ah, Captain 
		Valor report at zero three hundred. 
		I want two converted transports,  
		agricultural type, and two days' 
		provisions, travel papers, weapons. 
		Contact Han Solo at the Gordon 
		spaceport.  I'll talk to him...with 
		speed!

	Montross turns and rushes down another hallway.

61.  MEDICAL CENTER BLUE - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	The general enters a stark white waiting area filled 
	with scholarly looking gentlemen.  An attendant greets 
	General Skywalker and takes him into a small observation 
	chamber overlooking a large operating theatre. An 
	elderly doctor greets him.

				 DOCTOR
		Good to see you, General.  I'm afraid 
		we're not quite ready yet.  Thank God 
		you'll be the one taking them, though.

	An attendant brings in one of the scholars from the waiting 
	area and places him on a large operating table surrounded 
	by strange looking equipment.  An ominous looking clamp is 
	placed on the man's head.

				 SKYWALKER
		How many are going?

				 DOCTOR
		Thirty-three of the greatest scientific 
		minds in our system...A high price for 
		freedom.

				 SKYWALKER
		Thirty-three scientists!  Transporting 
		a group that size, undetected... I don't...

				 DOCTOR
		Don't worry, General.  All you'll be 
		taking are their minds.

	The doctor moves over to a safe-like cabinet guarded by 
	two attendants.  The doctor gingerly picks up a small 
	clear vial filled with gray fluid.  It has a label which
	reads:  Faubun, Astro-dynamics.  In the background , the 
	scholar on the operating table is undergoing a form of
	mechanized brain surgery.

				 SKYWALKER
		"Bloodory's distillation?"

				 DOCTOR
		Yes.  It has been greatly perfected. 
		The brain is condensed into five 
		ounces of fluid.  Cloning cell samples 
		are included so that a structural 
		duplicate of the scientist can be 
		reproduced.  When the  duplicate child 
		reaches the age of six, he or she 
		begins a series of injections of the 
		brain fluid.  By the age of ten years, 
		they have received all the knowledge 
		and memory of an experienced scientist:  
		an old mind in a young body.  We have 
		prepared a special shock belt to carry 
		the vials.

	In the background, the limp body of the scholar on the
	operating table is removed, and another scientist is 
	escorted into the operating threatre.  Dr. Bloodory, a 
	portly doctor in his forties, enters the room and shakes 
	hands with the general.

				 DOCTOR
		General, this is Dr. Bloodory. 
		He'll be making the trip with 
		you.

				 BLOODORY
		It's an honor to meet you, General. 
		I'm sure I couldn't be in safer 
		hands.
					
				 SKYWALKER
		The chrome companies are exacting 
		a high price indeed!  Politics will 
		be the ruin of us all.

				 BLOODORY
		Careful.  If we could rid ourselves 
		of the politicians, generals would 
		no longer be necessary.

				 DOCTOR
		We should be ready by zero three 
		hundred.

	The doctors exit, leaving the general alone to watch the 
	huge machine extract another brain.

62.  SPACEPORT - OBSERVATION DECK - TOWNOWI

	Governor Horus, General Vader walk down a boarding ramp to 
	an observation deck overlooking the conquered city of 
	Gordon.  They are followed by a number of aides and officers 
	from the royal fleet.  Below them, air tanks and other 
	military equipment and supplies are being unloaded.

				 VADER
		Not much of a planet.

				 HORUS
		Darth, you've done well.  Do you 
		think you will have the Royal 
		Family by nightfall?

				 VADER
		An advance expedition is already 
		on its way to their underground 
		hideaway.  They should reach it 
		by nightfall, but only if this 
		Count Sandage can be trusted.

				 HORUS
		A man hungry for power can always 
		be trusted... to betray those in 
		power.  I'm sure his information 
		is correct.

63.  HIDDEN FORTRESS CANYON -TOWNOWI

	The huge rock face of the canyon opens, and two shabby
	agricultural landspeeders are pushed into the late after-
	noon sun.  A-2 and C-3 stand on the far side of the canyon 
	with their guards  watching in amazement.  The general and 
	Captain Valor walk behind the men pushing the landspeeder.

				 SKYWALKER
		We'll take them with us.  They 
		know more about that fortress 
		than any ten men.  They will be 
		very useful.

				 JUSTIN
		Can they be trusted?

				 SKYWALKER
		Loyalty can't be programmed. 
		They can be trusted never to 
		harm a living creature, and to 
		always give accurate information
		as they know it, to anyone who 
		asks.  You just have to remember 
		not to tell them anything that 
		you don't want to fall into the 
		wrong hands.

	The general approaches the two robots. A-2 shyly moves
	around his taller companion.

				 SKYWALKER
		Greetings.  I'm Luke:  Agricultural 
		Engineering.  We're going to be 
		travelling together.  You're going 
		with us to help set up a hortastation 
		on KANDALAR.

	C-3 shakes hands with the general.

				 C-3
		I'm C-3:  Human Cyborg Relations.  
		Your kindness is greatly appreciated.

	C-3 and the general both look down at A-2.  C-3 gives the 
	smaller android a little kick.

				 A-2
		A-2:  Fusion Repair.

				 SKYWALKER
		Load them into one of the speeders.

	Captain Oxus, walking with a slight limp, emerges from the 
	underground fortress with the Royal Family.  A small group 
	of guards and aides are lined up, standing at attention. 
	The two young princes, Oeta and Puck, hug and kiss their 
	mother good-bye, then jump into the back of the larger 
	four-man speeder.  The princess bows before her mother, 
	then embraces her.  Tears roll down her cheeks.  Her 
	mother wipes them away.

				 QUEEN
		You must learn strength.

	The princess turns and moves to the larger speeder where 
	she is helped aboard by Captain Valor.

				 PRINCESS (fuming)
		I don't need your help, thank you.

	She gives the general an angry look.

				 SKYWALKER
		I'm afraid he's necessary.

	A commotion erupts at the mouth of the underground fortress. 
	Count Sandage, several senators and ten to twelve troopers 
	rush into the canyon and block the speeders.

				 SANDAGE
		Where are you going?  What is 
		this?

	In one quick movement the general moves between Sandage and 
	the Queen.  Oxus and Valor assume defensive positions in 
	front of the princess and her brothers.

				 QUEEN
		Zara and the boys are being taken to 
		safety.  It is my wish.

				 SANDAGE
		The King has assured their safety.  
		They must stay.

				 QUEEN
		It is not my wish....

				 SANDAGE
		General, you've gone too far this 
		time.  (to the troops)  Arrest him.

	Five troops start to move on the general, as Sandage draws 
	his lazerpistol.  Before anyone can complete his action, the 
	general ignites his lazersword and cuts the senator in two. 
	He drops to the ground in a heap, and the approaching troops 
	stop in their tracks.

				 QUEEN
		Stop this!

	The general, Valor, and Oxus replace their swords, and bow 
	low to the Queen.  All of the troops, senators, and aides 
	do the same.  The formalness of the occasion is broken when 
	the Queen embraces the general.  She then turns and embraces 
	each of the captains.  They are both flustered, and somewhat 
	embarrassed.

				 QUEEN
		May the force of others be with you.

	The general and his captains head for the speeders, while 
	the Queen and all the others return to the underground 
	fortress.

64.  DESERT BLUFF - TOWNOWI

	The two speeders edge their way onto a bluff overlooking the 
	hidden fortress canyon.  They stop for one last reflective 
	moment.  Forced to leave their closest friends and relatives, 
	the group is deeply moved.  The two robots, for the most 
	part, are puzzled.  Suddenly, there is a huge atomic flash, 
	followed by a loud rumble, and the entire canyon collapses 
	into a large crater.  The group quietly watches the dust 
	settle.  The hidden fortress and all its inhabitants have 
	been destroyed.  The general watches the princess, who 
	appears to take it well.

				 SKYWALKER
		It was the only way we could be 
		safe from treachery.

65.  DUNE SEA - TOWNOWI

	The two sleek landspeeders glide effortlessly through the 
	vast hills and valleys of the dune sea.  At the base of the 
	towering ridge, the four-man speeder stops.   The smaller 
	speeders, with Valor and the two robots, makes its way to the 
	top of the ridge.  Captain Valor stops the speeder just short 
	of the top of the ridge.  He gets out and continues the rest 
	of the way on foot.  The young captain peeks over the ridge 
	into the canyon below.  Muted sounds and large dust clouds 
	rise from the canyon floor.  Valor immediately ducks back 
	behind the ridge with an amazed look on his face.  He 
	quickly returns to the speeder  and picks up the intercom.

				 JUSTIN
		Sir, you'd better take a look at 
		this.  But come easy.

	The four-man speeder starts with a crack  and slowly moves 
	up the side of the imposing dune.  It stops next to the 
	smaller speeder.  The general and Oxus get out and make 
	their way to the top of the ridge where they join Valor. 
	Far in the distance, crossing the endless dune sea, is the 
	royal invasion army.  It is immense.  A convoy of giant 
	tanks, troop carriers, and supply ships stretch from 
	horizon to horizon.  Cavalry, mounted on giant dunebirds 
	ride the line from one end of the convoy to the other. 
	Hundreds of troops ride one-man jetsticks in precision 
	formation.  Their lances form a giant pin-cushion. It is 
	an awesome sight.

				 SKYWALKER
		They're coming from the spaceport at 
		Anchorhead, which means they control 
		everything between here and the space-
		port at Gordon.

				 JUSTIN
		Can we go around them?

				 SKYWALKER
		No.  We'll have to wait for them to 
		pass.  Captain Valor, see if you can 
		monitor any of their communications 
		on the com-link in the big speeder.

	Valor returns to the speeder.  He collapses in the large 
	speeder next to the princess  and flips on the com-link 
	radio, moving back and forth across the dial.

				 PRINCESS
		Must you do that?

	Valor smiles rather sarcastically.

				 JUSTIN
		Orders... The invasion force has cut 
		us off.  We'll probably be here for 
		some time.  You ought to stretch a 
		bit.

				 PRINCESS
		Is that a command, General?  Maybe I 
		feel like watching after my brothers.

	Valor looks back at the two sleeping boys.

				 JUSTIN
		They're not going anywhere.  They're 
		asleep.

				 PRINCESS
		I want to stay with them.

66.  LIBRARY - PALACE OF LITE - TOWNOWI

	The King's old library has been converted into an office 
	for General Vader.  He is sitting behind his desk as 
	Captain Dodona of the Lettow legions enters and salutes. 
	The legionnaire is dressed in the fascist black and chrome 
	uniform of the legendary Lettow One Hundred.  The general 
	returns his salute.

				 VADER
		Welcome, Captain Dodona.  Your 
		exploits are legendary.  I have 
		long waited to meet you.  If there 
		is any way I can assist you, my 
		entire command is at your bidding.

				 DODONA
		I want a tie-in to your computer 
		network, a control center, and 
		communication access.

				 VADER
		Right away!  I'll also transfer 
		all information we have on the general. 
		His command post was destroyed, but we 
		believe he is still alive.  Do you 
		really believe he's a Dai?

				 DODONA
		If he was not a Dai  I wouldn't be 
		here.

67.  WASTELAND - TOWNOWI

	The speeders make their way across the gray desert.  It is 
	dawn.  The twin suns have yet to rise in the green sky.  The 
	speeders are coated with dust and grime, indicating that 
	they have travelled far.  The two captains drive through the 
	night as everyone else sleeps.  Valor calls Oxus on the 
	intercom.

				 JUSTIN
		How are your fuel packs?  I'm reading 
		minus four.

				 OXUS
		I'm too low to transfer any.

	The general, who appeared to be asleep, opens his eyes, and 
	takes the microphone from Oxus.

				 SKYWALKER
		There is a fuel station fourteen 
		degrees by two meters.  The occu-
		pation force should have control 
		of it by now, so hide your weapons,
		but keep them within reach.

68.  FUEL STATION - TOWNOWI

	A series of low concrete structures rise out of the desert. 
	The speeders stop in front of an old weather-beaten block 
	house.  The rusted hulk of a landspeeder lies half-buried 
	to one side of the building.  Valor and Oxus jump out of the 
	speeder and go into the block house.

69.  INTERIOR - FUEL STATION - TOWNOWI

	The two young captains, dressed as farmers, enter the dingy 
	little fuel station.  It is quiet.  A few power packs line 
	the walls and a dismantled speeder rests in the repair bay. 
	There is a sharp dripping sound coming from the speeder.  It 
	appears that no-one is there.

				 JUSTIN
		Greetings!  Who's in charge here?

	They look around the deserted station, but find no attendant. 
	An eerie quiet pervades the building.

				 OXUS
		I don't get it.

				 JUSTIN
		You don't have to.  It's abandoned.

	Oxus opens a door leading to a storage area, and stops 
	short.

				 OXUS
		Not quite abandoned.

	Valor moves to the doorway and sees the attendant, his wife, 
	and small daughter hanging upside down, tortured to death. 
	Oxus cuts them down.

				 OXUS
		They shouldn't have resisted.

	Valor grabs two power packs from the shelf.

				 JUSTIN
		Help me with these power packs. 
		We'd better move out of here.

	Oxus covers the family with an old work tarp.  He bows to 
	the dead, then reluctantly grabs a couple of power packs 
	and they start for the door.  Oxus stops for a moment.

				 OXUS
		Hear that?  Someone's here.  (yelling)  
		We're friends.  Show yourself.
		
	Silence.  Oxus shrugs his shoulders and they start out the 
	door, only to run straight into a burly stormtrooper.

				 STORMTROOPER
		Get out of here!

70.  FUEL STATION - TOWNOWI

	Oxus and Valor are pulled out of the doorway and shoved into 
	the center of a group of fifteen or twenty royal storm-
	troopers who have surrounded the two speeders.  Several 
	troops have pulled General Skywalker out of the speeder. He 
	acts senile, like a man twice his age.

				 SKYWALKER
		I'm all right.  I can still move 
		about by myself.

	A rough looking sergeant grabs Captain Oxus.

				 SERGEANT
		What are you doing here?
			
				 OXUS
		We're out of power, sir.

				 SERGEANT
		Let me see your passes!

				 OXUS
		I have it here, somewhere.  We've 
		been relocated to a hortastation, 
		by royal order...

	Oxus fumbles to retrieve something from his pocket, and 
	eventually pulls out a small  round disc.  The sergeant 
	puts the disc in a small portable reader.  Various computer 
	readouts are displayed on the monitor.  Valor starts to put 
	a power pack into one of the speeders.

				 SERGEANT
		What are you doing there?  All 
		power has been restricted.

				 SKYWALKER
		We've run out.  We must have power, 
		or be forced to stay here  and 
		become your responsibilities.

	The sergeant thinks about this for a moment  as the old 
	wise general watches him.  Tension fills the air.  Valor 
	shuffles around to a position where he can reach his weapon. 
	A trooper hands the sergeant a message.

				 SERGEANT (to Oxus)
		Take only two of those power packs 
		and then move out quickly.

	The sergeant hurries to a military craft, where he takes a 
	call on an intercom.  General Skywalker and his two young 
	captains load the remaining power packs into the speeder 
	and roar away from the station.

71.  WASTELAND - TOWNOWI

	The speeders race along through the rocky desert wasteland. 
	The general speaks into the intercom to Valor

				 SKYWALKER
		Keep a close watch.  If that sergeant 
		runs an analysis on those passes  we 
		might be seeing him again.  We should 
		be safely inside Gordon within the day.

	Everyone is in good spirits.  The princess and her young
	brothers sing a Townowi melody, which is transmitted to Valor 
	in the smaller speeder.  The general takes little Puck,  and 
	lets him sit on his lap in the forward compartment of the 
	speeder.  A-2 flexes C-3's arm back and forth  attempting 
	to discover the cause of a loud squeak.

				 A-2
		Oilar doesn't seem to help at all.

				 C-3
		It's all this filth and dust.  This 
		environment is murderous.

	Valor notices a small speck on the horizon.

				 JUSTIN (into intercom)
		Object approaching, bearing three 
		point two.

	The general looks through an electrotelescope mounted in the 
	speeder.  He spots a distant row of troopers riding strange 
	dune birds.

				 SKYWALKER (to Justin)
		It's a patrol.  It could mean trouble. 
		We'd better split up.  You stay on a 
		direct course.  We'll meet you at the 
		western edge of ravine 23-64.  Stay in 
		contact.

	The larger speeder makes a sharp left turn, speeding off
	across a deep ravine.  Valor can begin to distinguish the 
	approaching troopers.

				 JUSTIN
		It looks like there are ten of them. 
		They're heading right for me.  Wait 
		a second.  They've disappeared.  I've 
		lost them.

				 SKYWALKER
		Continue on ahead.

72.  WASTELAND LAKEBED - TOWNOWI

	Oxus deftly maneuvers the bulky speeder through a narrow 
	boulder-strewn ravine.  They eventually come out on a dry 
	lake bed, where they stop.  Standing not more than a hundred 
	feet away, apparantly waiting for the speeder, are five 
	royal troops on their dune birds.

				 SKYWALKER
		We've found them, five of them, 
		anyway.  Watch yourself.

	The troops slowly ride their huge birds over to the speeder 
	and dismount.  The officer in charge is a vicious looking 
	warrior  with a large scar across his face.

				 OFFICER
		Let me see your passes.

	Oxus hands him the small pass disc, and he places it in his 
	reader.  He studies the computer readout for a few moments 
	and then returns the disc to Oxus.

				 OFFICER
		Have you seen any other transports 
		in this area?

				 SKYWALKER
		We saw two heading south.  Going 
		towards Ansel, looked like to me.

				 OFFICER
		All right.  Be on your way.

	The officer mounts his dune bird, and the patrol moves away. 
	Oxus winks at the princess  and smiles at the general, as 
	the speeder starts off across the dry lake.  The general 
	fiddles with the intercom.

				 SKYWALKER
		Captain Valor, are you clear?

				 JUSTIN
		I have five troopers approaching. 
		Any problem your end?

				 SKYWALKER
		We came through all right.  You 
		shouldn't have any trouble, but stay 
		alert.

				 JUSTIN
		Best wishes!  Here they come.

	Everyone rides along in silence, a little worried about
	Captain Valor, especially the princess.

				 PRINCESS
		Do you think he'll be all right?

				 SKYWALKER
		He can take care of himself.

	Oeta is looking out the back window of the speeder.

				 OETA
		Hey look!  They're coming back.

	Everyone looks to see the patrol quickly gaining on them.

				 SKYWALKER
		Stop!  They're faster.  Get 
		your weapon.

	The speeder screeches to a halt in a cloud of dust.  The
	general and his captain jump from the transport with lazer-
	pistols drawn.  The patrol bears down on them, swords drawn, 
	at full charge.  Both the general and Oxus fire.  Two of the 
	troopers and their dunebirds explode in a cloud of smoke. 
	The remaining three troopers are upon the duo in a matter 
	of seconds.  The general ignites his lazersword and cuts down 
	two of the troops as they pass.  The last turns his bird 
	around before reaching the speeder, and hightails it back 
	towards the ravine.  The general jumps onto one of the 
	riderless dunebirds and takes off in pursuit.  Oxus checks 
	the dead troopers.

73.  WASTELAND RAVINE - TOWNOWI

	The general rides at breakneck speed after the fleeing
	trooper.  His lazersword is raised high over his head, ready 
	to deal a deathblow.  The lumbering birds race through the 
	winding ravine.

74.  WASTELAND RAVINE - TOWNOWI

	The intercom warning buzzer begins to scream.  Oxus rushes 
	for it  but the princess gets there first.
					 
				 PRINCESS
		Are you all right?

				 JUSTIN
		Two riders heading your way.  I 
		got three, but two got away. 
		Watch yourselves!

75.  WASTELAND RAVINE - TOWNOWI

	The general is riding neck and neck with the trooper.  He
	swiftly brings his sword down and the trooper drops from 
	his saddle.  The momentum of his charge carries the general 
	around a bend in the ravine  and right inTO the path of two 
	more troops charging down on him.  The two troopers are 
	taken by surprise.  They stop their birds  and so does the 
	general.  They stand there, about fifty yards apart, sizing 
	up each other.  Suddenly, the two troopers start for the Dai 
	warrior at full speed.  The general raises his sword  and 
	starts for them.  The troopers are no match for the general 
	who kills them both before they are even able to swing their 
	swords.

76.  WASTELAND LAKEBED - TOWNOWI

	Valor stops near the larger landspeeder and gets out.  He 
	is wounded.  Blood streams from his left arm.  Oxus rushes 
	to help him.  The princess shows a great deal ofconcern.

				 OXUS
		It looks worse than it is.  You'll 
		be all right.

	Oxus motions to the princess, who looks a little relieved.

				 OXUS
		Bring me the med aid pack.

				 PRINCESS
		It he was clumsy enough to get hurt, 
		maybe we ought to let him bleed to 
		death.

	She hands Oxus the kit, as the general rides up and dis-
	mounts.  He moves to Valor.

				 SKYWALKER
		You missed two.

				 JUSTIN
		I know. I couldn't...

				 SKYWALKER
		Don't let it happen again. 
		We'd better move out.  They might 
		have reported in.

77.  CONTROL ROOM - PALACE OF LITE - TOWNOWI

	The dark and sinister Dodona moves several markers on a
	large map readout to form a line from the destroyed under-
	ground fortress to the spaceport at Gordon.  An aide enters 
	with General Vader.

				 AIDE
		The patrol was lost, sir.  All 
		ten of them.

				 DODONA
		It's to be expected.

				 VADER
		Have you found them?

				 DODONA
		They're heading for the spaceport 
		at Gordon.  I'm going there.  Have 
		all security doubled.  Make it an 
		alert.

78.  THE OUTSKIRTS OF GORDON - TOWNOWI

	The speeders stop on a bluff overlooking a small cantina on 
	the outskirts of Gordon.  The spaceport can be seen in the 
	distance.  The general and Captain Oxus walk over to the 
	smaller speeder.  Valor helps the two androids out of their 
	cramped quarters.

				 C-3
		Your kindness is greatly appreciated.

				 JUSTIN (to Skywalker)
		I'm fit enough to...

	The general gives him a hard look and he shuts up.  Oxus 
	and the general climb into the speeder.

				 SKYWALKER
		We'll make contact at zero four 
		hundred.  If we're not back by 
		fifty-five forty, get worried.

	The speeder starts off toward the cantina.

79.  SPACEPORT CANTINA - TOWNOWI

	The speeder pulls up in front of the low  blockhouse style 
	cantina.  Various strange forms of transport are parked out-
	side the bar.

				 SKYWALKER
		Take care here.  If there is any 
		trouble, get back to the others.

	The general and Oxus enter the shabby cantina.  The murky 
	little den is filled with a startling array of weird and 
	exotic alien creatures, laughing at the bar.  At first, the 
	sight is horrifying.  One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry, 
	scaly armed creatures with tentacles and claws huddle over 
	drinks.  The general looks over the patrons, but does not 
	see the contact, Han Solo. A large multiple-eyed creature 
	shoves the general.

				 CREATURE
		Assha dughi wouldugga?

	The general tries to ignore the creature  and turns back to 
	his drink.  A short  grubby looking human  and an even 
	smaller  rodent-like creature join the first creature.

				 HUMAN
		He doesn't like you.

				 SKYWALKER
		I understood him.

				 HUMAN
		I don't like you either.

				 SKYWALKER
		I'm sorry.

	The big creature is getting agitated  and yells at the
	general.

				 HUMAN
		Don't insult us.  You just watch 
		yourself.  We're wanted men.  I 
		have the death sentence on twelve 
		systems.

				 SKYWALKER
		I'll be careful then.

				 HUMAN
		You'll be dead.

	The short rodent yells something  and everything at the bar 
	moves away.  The general assumes a defensive position.  His 
	three adversaries ready their weapons.

				 SKYWALKER
		You insist on a fight then?

				 HUMAN
		Just try and kill us.

				 SKYWALKER
		It will hurt a little.

				 HUMAN
		We aren't cowards.

				 SKYWALKER
		Then it can't be helped.

	The general's lazersword sparks to life.  An arm lies on the 
	floor.  The rodent is cut in two  and the large  multiple-
	eyed creature lies doubled, cut from chin to groin.  The 
	general  with quiet dignity  replaces his sword in its sheath. 
	The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds.  A 
	figure stands in the doorway watching the general.  As soon 
	as the general notices him, he leaves.  The cantina goes back 
	to normal, as if nothing had happened, although the general 
	is given a respectable amount of room at the bar.  The Dai 
	finishes his drink  and then leaves.  Captain Oxus follows.

80.  SPACEPORT ALLEYWAY - GORDON - TOWNOWI

	General Skywalker embraces Han Solo, the underground contact. 
	Han is a huge  green skinned monster with no nose and large 
	gills.

				 HAN
		You old stardog.  Took a war to get 
		you out here...

	Oxus arrives with Captain Valor, the princess, and her
	brothers, and the two puzzled androids.

				 SKYWALKER
		It's been too long.  We've been through 
		much together.  It will be good to have 
		you out of retirement and back at my 
		side.  How is General Valor?  (putting 
		his arm around the young Captain Valor)  
		This is his son.

				 HAN
		You're all the old boy will talk about. 
		He's still holding up.  Come, let's get 
		off the street.

	The group enters a small doorway at the far end of the alley-
	way.  On the main street, within view of the doorway, giant 
	royal airtanks and other military hardware rumble through 
	the city.  Starving refugees sit in the gutter watching the 
	immense display of force with a mixture of awe and terror. 
	The princess stops for a moment  and stares at her people, 
	watching the might of the kingdom.  The general escorts her 
	through the doorway with the others.

81.  SLUM DWELLING - LIVING AREA - TOWNOWI

	The seedy dwelling is dark and dingy.  The group is greeted 
	by three underground leaders, and the old Dai, Akira Valor. 
	Justin embraces his father as the underground leaders bow 
	before the princess.

82.  SLUM DWELLING - DINING AREA - TOWNOWI

	The princess walks through the dining area, followed by Oxus 
	and Valor, who carry the two sleeping princes.  The general 
	sits at a large table  finishing dinner with Han, Akira, 
	and the three underground leaders.  Oxus returns from the 
	bedroom.

				 SKYWALKER (to Oxus)
		Captain, why don't you take the 
		androids into the other room for 
		a game of chess?  I'm sure they'd 
		enjoy it.

				 C-3
		A wonderful idea.  Your kindness 
		is greatly appreciated.

	Oxus escorts the two robots into the next room.  DATOS, a 
	thin  wizened old man, seems greatly relieved.

				 DATOS
		You're taking a great risk travelling 
		with them.  This whole operation 
		sounds bad to me.  I don't trust the 
		chrome companies.  Time is growing 
		short.  The King's attempts at control 
		have already caused a great deal of 
		suffering to our people.

	OCCO, a brash young rebel  about the same age as Captain
	Valor  slams his fist on the table.

				 OCCO
		It must happen now!  We are ready. 
		Each day the royal S.B.T. finds and 
		destroys a few more in the organiza-
		tion.  We cannot wait any longer.

				 SKYWALKER
		Any uprising without a coordinated 
		attack on the death star is out of 
		the question.

				 HAN
		He's right.  As long as it's 
		operational, any action down here 
		would be meaningless.  We must 
		proceed as planned.  Are the 
		arrangements secure?

	QUIST, the third member of the underground, sparks to life 
	and places several discs and badges on the table.

				 QUIST
		All passenger transport has been 
		suspended, so we've arranged for 
		you to travel as the crew of a 
		Baltarian freighter.  The boys 
		will have to be placed in suspended 
		animation and hidden in shielded 
		micropacks.  It's the only way we 
		will be able to get them past the 
		scanners.

				 DATOS
		Were you able to aquire the necessary 
		power packs?

				 QUIST
		It's become a serious problem.  All 
		power supplies have been restricted. 
		S-4 units are impossible to come by.

				 HAN
		I know an agent who might be able to 
		acquire them for us.  I'll check with 
		him.  It will be risky, but we've no 
		other choice.

83.  SPACEPORT OBSERVATION DECK - TOWNOWI

	The dark figure of Dodona stands overlooking a group of
	Townowi partisans who are being tortured in the plaza below. 
	Two royal officers are finishing a report to the evil legion-
	naire.  They salute smartly, then leave the observation 
	balcony  passing KURO, one of General Vader's aides, who 
	approaches Dodona  and bows low before him.  Kuro and the 
	legionnaire carry on an animated conversation;  it is 
	inaudible over the screams of the tortured partisans.

84.  SLUM DWELLING - ALLEYWAY - TOWNOWI

	Residents glance fearfully from their windows as six royal 
	stormtroopers make their way through the crowded slum alley-
	way.  Han Solo and Captain Valor move cautiously past the 
	royal patrol  and disappear into the shabby hideout of the 
	partisan underground.

85.  SLUM DWELLING - MAIN AREA - TOWNOWI

	The two men enter the dingy main room of the slum dwelling 
	and are immediately attacked by Oeta, wielding a toy sword. 
	Valor good-naturedly fends off the young prince  as Han, in 
	a more serious mood, goes into the other room.  A-2 and C-3 
	are helping Puck put together a block-like puzzle.  Princess 
	Zara comes in to see what all the commotion is about, just 
	as the young captain grabs Oeta by the foot and holds him 
	upside-down.   Valor and Oeta are laughing uproariously. 
	Zara gives the captain a stern  disapproving look, then 
	returns to the other room.

86.  SLUM DWELLING - DINING AREA - TOWNOWI

	General Skywalker, Captain Oxus, and Datos are in the process 
	of assembling two micropacks on the kitchen table.  Han pulls 
	a small silver powerpack from his pocket, and places it on 
	the table.  The old Dai, Akira Valor, reaches over with his 
	one good arm  and takes it.  He inspects it carefully. 
	Princess Zara sits quietly behind the general.

				 HAN
		We could only get one unit.  Their 
		methods are proving to be very 
		effective.

	Akira places the powerpack back on the table.  The pain from 
	those simple movements shows on his face.

				 AKIRA
		This will work fine.

				 HAN
		One of the boys will have to stay.
		
				 DATOS
		We can't hide him for very long.
		The risk is too great.  Which-
		ever boy doesn't go must be des-
		troyed.

	The princess is alarmed, and looks to the general for support. 
	He gives her an understanding look.

				 SKYWALKER
		Not while they're in my charge. 
		Find another way to get him through.

				 DATOS
		There's no other way.  We've 
		analyzed every possible alter-
		native.  You can't jeopardize 
		the enitre...

	Captain Valor enters the room.

				 HAN
		We have no time for discussion. 
		The freighters leave at zero 
		three hundred.  We must get 
		started.

	Through a break in the door, Oxus watches A-2 and C-3 
	play with the two young princes.

				 OXUS
		What about A-2?  Could we loboto-
		mize him and use his energy pack?

				 SKYWALKER
		They're not compatible.  We'd 
		have to completely change the 
		system.

				 HAN
		It could work.

				 DATOS
		There isn't enough time.  You can't 
		do it.

				 AKIRA
		You won't have to.  My power unit 
		has more than half life.  Use it.

	The withered Dai opens his tunic  revealing a metallic chest 
	covered with electrodes.  With his one good arm  he grabs 
	his chest and rips loose a miniature power unit similar to 
	the one on the table.  Everyone is taken by surprise.  The 
	general and the young Valor both rush to the side of the 
	dying Dai.  The old man turns to his son.

				 AKIRA
		Trust my judgment, Son.  Serve your 
		new teacher well.

	The Dai's breathing becomes more difficult as he turns to 
	the general.

				 AKIRA (Cont.)
		An honorable death, my friend. 
		May the force of others be with 
		you.

	Akira Valor passes on to the other world.  Everyone is 
	stunned.  The general breaks the moment of silence.

				 SKYWALKER
		May he be welcomed as a man above 
		men.  Take him downstairs.

	Justin takes his father in his arms and is followed out of 
	the room by Han and Datos.

				 SKYWALKER
		Prepare the boys!  We have little 
		time.

	Princess Zara and Captain Oxus rush out of the room, as the 
	general places the power units in the micropacks.

87.  SLUM DWELLING - MAIN AREA - TOWNOWI

	Oeta and Puck are not happy about being dragged away from 
	their puzzle.  Oxus takes the robots into the sleep area.

				 ZARA
		Now straighten up, Oeta.  Remember, 
		father expects you to follow his ways. 
		We are going on a trip.  There will be 
		great danger.  You must go to sleep. 
		When you wake, you will be in a strange 
		land, so don't be alarmed.

				 OETA
		Are you going to sleep too?

				 ZARA
		I will be looking after you.  Now 
		be good boys and stand still.  Lift 
		your sleeve.

	Puck lifts his sleeze and Zara injects him with a sleep
	serum.  Oxus enters just as the little prince collapses 
	into a deep sleep.  Quick as lightening, he catches the 
	boy before he can hit the floor.  The princess injects 
	her other brother  and he collapses into her arms.

88.  SLUM DWELLING - DINING AREA - TOWNOWI

	The limp bodies of the two young princes are carried in 
	by Zara and Captain Oxus.  They are carefully squeezed 
	into the hollowed out microcases.  Zara pensively watches 
	as the general expertly attaches electrodes to her 
	brother's skull.  Han and Datos return from the burial 
	of Akira.  The general looks up from his operation.

				 HAN
		He is at rest.  Are the systems 
		working all right?

				 SKYWALKER
		Full power.  Is everything ready?

	Datos nods yes, as the general closes the case holding Puck. 
	The strain of watching her brothers placed in suspended 
	animation is too great for Zara  and she retreats into the 
	main room.

89.  SLUM DWELLING - MAIN ROOM - TOWNOWI

	Captain Valor stands brooding near a window overlooking 
	the crowded alleyway.  He does not acknowledge Zara's 
	entrance.  She walks over to the window and stands next to 
	the young captain.  They are very close but do not touch.

				 ZARA
		I'm sorry.

	He does not respond.  She is moved by his sorrow  and 
	starts to touch the side of his face  but can't bring her-
	self to do it.  Her royal training is too strong to let her 
	show her true affection for Justin.  She breaks down and 
	runs from the room.  The young Dai continues his meditation.

90.  SPACEPORT AT GORDON - SECURITY RAMP - TOWNOWI

	The spaceport is very crowded.  People rush about in a
	panicked rush as loudspeakers blurt out indiscernible
	announcements.  The Royal Galactic Kingdom is in the process 
	of changing the boarding procedures and the result is chaos. 

	Many flights are delayed, and people are running to and 
	fro, switching boarding ramps.  Han guides the rebel group, 
	dressed as a Baltarian crew, through the crowded terminal. 
	Oxus and Valor carry the large micropacks strapped to their 
	backs.  The robots follow a few paces behind.

				 HAN
		They're changing the boarding 
		procedures.  I don't like it.

	They are swept into a boarding gate and finally reach a
	security ramp scan station.  There are a great number of
	troops and guards standing around the security area.  An
	officer demands to see their passes and orders.  The ten-
	sion builds as the officer confers with an aide about the 
	passes.  The aide speaks quietly into a phone.

				 OFFICER
		Where are your component receipts?

	Valor and Oxus hand the officer two additional discs, 
	which are placed in the computer.  A few moments later, 
	the readout appears  and the group is motioned through the 
	electron scanners.  On the other side of the scanner, new 
	computer discs are issued to the group.  The group seems 
	slightly relieved as they walk through several hallways 
	leading to where the freighter is docked.  Valor moves 
	next to  the general.

				 JUSTIN
		I don't like the feel of this.

				 SKYWALKER
		Your senses are strong.  It's a 
		very small disruption.

				 JUSTIN
		It's a Lettow legionnaire.

				 SKYWALKER
		Possibly.  Stay alert.  Warn 
		the others.

	The group walks through the docking links and into the
	Baltarian spacecraft.  Several royal guards pass them, 
	and everyone is ready for the suspected trap, but 
	nothing happens.

91.  INTERIOR - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI

	The group stops in a narrow electronic  passageway near 
	the bridge of the ship.  Valor and Oxus unstrap the 
	micropacks containing the two young princes, and check 
	the voltage packs.

				 OXUS
		Little Oeta is losing power faster 
		than normal.  I'd better check it 
		out.
		
				 SKYWALKER
		Wait until the situation is secure. 
		Stay here, and keep on your guard.
		Han!

	The two young captains grow suspicious of several workmen 
	gathering around the main exit hatch.  Han and the general 
	enter the bridge area.  Several crewmen sit at elaborate 
	controls and computer stations.

				 SKYWALKER
		Where is your captain?

	One of the crewmen directs him to a small chamber above the 
	bridge.  Valor and Oxus strap on their micropacks as more 
	workmen converge at the main hatch and begin to close it. 
	The two robots, A-2 and C-3 are confused about what is 
	going on  and wear their gear in anticipation of moving.

92.  PILOT CHAMBER - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI

	Han and the general enter the small pilot's chamber and 
	greet the captain, whose face is hidden in the shadows of 
	a computer bank.

				 CAPTAIN
		Welcome, gentlemen.  You must 
		have had a difficult journey. 
		We'll be departing shortly.

	Four 	armed troopers silently enter the room behind the two 
	old Dai;  their lazerswords are drawn.

				 CAPTAIN 
		I have been authorized to accept 
		payment for the chrome company 
		cooperation.  I assume you've 
		brought it with you.

	The captain moves out of the shadows  and is revealed to 
	be Dodona.  Instantly, both Han and the general understand 
	the situation.  They turn, drawing their lazerswords in 
	the move  and cut down the four royal troopers.  The door 
	to the chamber instantly seals shut.  Dodona hasn't made 
	any moves  and remains unusually calm.  The two Dai turn
	to face him.

				 DODONA
		It’s over, gentlemen.  The chamber 
		is sealed.  Don’t force me to 
		release the Jai gas.

	A tone sounds, and Dodona turns to an intercom.

				 INTERCOM
		Situation secure.  Prisoners taken to 
		hold "B";  Twelve casualties... gas 
		was necessary.

	Han and the general relax and drop their weapons.  The 
	door silently opens behind them and six guards enter wearing 
	facemasks.  They bind the two Dai with chrome microcuffs.  A 
	satisfied smile creeps across Dodona's face.  General Sky-
	walker seems unimpressed with the trap.

				 DODONA
		At last, it's ended.  (to guard)  Take 
		them to hold "G."  I don't want them 
		with the others.  Prepare for departure.

	The troopers escort Han and the general out of the chamber 
	and down several hallways.

93.  INTERIOR - BALTARIAN FREIGHTERS - TOWNOWI

	Eight troops march Han and the general into the hold of the 
	ship.  They pass near the main exit  where A-2 and C-3 
	stand deserted, looking lost.  C-3 sees the general pass in
	a nearby hallway

				 C-3
		Well, there he is.  Come on.

	The robots waddle off after the Dai prisoners.  As the 
	small procession passes detention cell B where the princess 
	and the others are being held, Han and the general let out 
	a horrifying Dai scream and leap to the corridor ceiling, 
	thrusting their bound wrists into the lighting fixtures. 
	They land on top of the troops, instantly breaking the 
	necks of four guards, with expertly placed blows.  The 
	eight surviving guards are momentarily dumbfounded.  Han 
	and the general grab lazerswords from their victims  and 
	swiftly cut down the remaining troops.  Han grabs a small 
	card from one of the dead guards  and starts for detention 
	cell  B.

				 SKYWALKER
		Watch it!   Those are cutters.

	The general grabs one of the dead troopers and tosses him
	against the cell door.  Red rays engulf the body  and holds 
	it there.  Han then places the card in a slot  and the door 
	silently slides open.  Valor and Oxus leap for the dead 
	guard, then notice the death ray surrounding him.  General 
	Skywalker grabs another body and throws it into the doorway.

				 SKYWALKER
		Pass between them!

	Captain Valor squeezes between the slain guards  and is 
	untouched by the rays.  Oxus and the princess quickly follow, 
	picking up weapons as they leave.

				 JUSTIN
		They've taken the cases.

				 SKYWALKER
		Are they aware of the boys?

				 OXUS
		I don't think so.

				 SKYWALKER
		Find them.  Use your seeker. 
		We'll meet you at the main 
		hatch.  Watch yourselves.  If 
		an alarm is given, they'll gas 
		the entire ship.

				 OXUS
		Yes, Sir.

	Oxus and Valor each take a small humming device from their 
	utility belts and head down a narrow hallway.  The general, 
	Han, and the princess continue toward the main hatch.  A-2 
	and C-3 have been completely confused by the turn of events. 
	They eventually follow the general toward the exit hatch.

94.  ELECTROCLOSET HALLWAY - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI

	The two young captains reach a storage area of the huge
	spacecraft.  They watch their seekers as they move along a 
	row of electroclosets.  They quietly sneak past a group of 
	workmen assembling a large gyrohousing.  A second row of 
	micropacks is searched to no avail.

				 OXUS
		If they were discovered, they would 
		have been sent to a medical station.

				 JUSTIN
		There are more storage areas on the 
		far side.

95.  MAIN HATCH AREA - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI

	Han and the general reach the main hatch, closely followed 
	by Zara and the two robots.  Several lights over the hatch 
	flash on and off.  The general cuts a camera off the wall 
	with his lazersword.

				 HAN
		They're going to take off.  It's 
		too late.
		
				 SKYWALKER
		C-3,  come over here!

	The lanky chrome man approaches the general, who is studying 
	a complex computer control panel next to the hatch.

				 C-3
		Yes sir.  May I be of service?

				 SKYWALKER
		Get this hatch open.  Counterlock 
		the departure pattern.

	The robot immediately starts pushing buttons on the panel.

96.  ELECTROCLOSET HALLWAY - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI

	Captain Valor and Oxus reach a second series of electro-
	closets.  A signal appears on the seekers  and Valor cuts 
	down the door of one of the small cabinets.  Oxus stands 
	guard.  Approaching troops are heard in the distance. 
	Valor quickly rummages through the electropacks until he 
	spots the familiar cases containing the two boys.

				 OXUS
		Troops!

	Valor straps on one of the backpacks  and hands the other 
	to Oxus, as they duck into a narrow passageway.  Four 
	troops march through a nearby hallway.  After they have 
	passed, the young captain checks to make sure the way is 
	clear, then runs down a hallway toward the main hatch.

97.  BRIDGE - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI

	As the crew makes the final preparations for the blast off, 
	the main hatch light blinks on.  One of the pilots notices 
	the light and begins to check it out.

				 PILOT (into intercom)
		Is the main hatch secure?

98.  MAIN HATCH - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI

	The intercom sparks to life, and the general answers it.

				 SKYWALKER
		Everything looks secure, but give 
		me a minute to check it out.

				 PILOT
		All right.  Stand by.

	The general winks to Han, as C-3 continues his attempt to 
	override the hatch computer.

99.  HALLWAYS - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI

	Captain Valor and Oxus cautiously move down a long hallway, 
	ever watchful of royal troops.  They reach an intersection, 
	carefully check in all directions, then rush down a main 
	hallway.  They are about half-way down the hallway, when a 
	squad of royal guards appears at the end of the hallway 
	facing them.  The troops start toward the two captains, with 
	lowered lazerrifles.

				 VALOR
		Here's where it gets tricky.

	Valor, then Oxus, quickly and smoothly draw their lazer-
	pistols and fire at the troops.  A giant explosion destroys 
	the far end of the hallway.  A few lazerbolts are returned, 
	but streak harmlessly overhead  and explode out of range. 
	The exchange of gunfire lasts only a few moments.  When the 
	smoke clears, the troops have been destroyed.

100. MAIN HATCH - BALTARIAN FREIGHTER - TOWNOWI

	The main hatch slowly begins to slide open, when the 
	rumbling explosion of lazerfire echoes through the hallways. 
	Han looks to the general  and they both instantly realize 
	what has happened.  Han draws his weapons.  The hatch is 
	now fully open.  Everyone stands silently  watching for the 
	two captains.  Alarms start screaming throughout the ship, 
	and the giant hatch slowly begins to close.

				 SKYWALKER
		Come on.  We can't wait.

	The group reluctantly exit the spacecraft, giving one last 
	look back to their lost friends.  The hatch continues to 
	slowly close, as the alarm sirens wail.  Suddenly, Valor 
	and Oxus round a corner and head for the ever-closing 
	hatch, battling several royal troopers as they go.  Han and 
	the general move up to the hatch and give cover fire.  Oxus 
	slips through the shrinking opening, and yells to Valor to 
	hurry.  Many more troops bear down on the young Dai as he 
	squeezes through the very slim opening.  One of the troops 
	dives after him  but is caught  and crushed by the emergency 
	hatch.

101. BOARDING RAMPS - GORDON SPACEPORT - TOWNOWI

	The general leads the group through various corridors.

				 HAN
		Once the alarm sounds, the entire 
		spaceport will shut down.

	They stop at a junction.  At the far end of one hallway,
	several troops guard a restricted passageway.

				 SKYWALKER
		That's the military section.

				 JUSTIN
		Fighter craft!

				 HAN
		But it's very heavily guarded. 
		We can't take it with subtlety.

	Before the general can answer, the acute scream of the
	spaceport alarm reverberates through the corridors.  The
	general, followed by his two young captains, charge toward 
	the heavily guarded military passageway.  Han, with the 
	princess and two robots, follow at a safe distance behind. 
	A guard sees them coming  and orders them to stop.  Captain 
	Valor and the general fire their lazerpistols and the 
	passageway entrance and the troops disappear in a huge 
	explosion.

	The group jump over the dead guards and smoking rubble, then 
	run through a series of hallways leading to a starship. 
	They  stop just short of an intersection leading to a boarding 
	ramp.  Valor peeks around a corner at two guards standing in 
	front of the boarding ramp.

				 JUSTIN
		Cutters!  We'll have to draw them 
		out. A blast might alert the crew.

				 SKYWALKER
		A-2,    Come here.

	The little robot waddles over to the old Dai.

				 SKYWALKER
		Move to that intersection and sound the 
		alarm.

	The mechanical dwarf dutifully marches into the intersection 
	and lets out a high, electronic scream.  The guards shut off 
	the deadly lazer cutters, and cautiously approach the wailing 
	robot.

				 GUARD
		What is it?  What's wrong?

	With incredible speed, both guards are dropped by a few
	precision blows from the two young captains.  They immediately 
	drag the unconscious guards into the starship.

				 SKYWALKER
		Valor!  Oxus!  Stand guard.  I'll 
		signal at take-off minus thirty.
		And reverse that cutter!

102. INTERIOR - ROYAL STARSHIP - TOWNOWI

	Han and the general, followed by Zara and the robots, enter 
	the royal starship.  They rush through several narrow hall-
	ways leading to the bridge.  Two crew members leaving a con-
	trol station  stumble into the group and are quickly dis-
	patched by Han.  The princess waits with the robots as the 
	general and Han enter the bridge.  The two pilots and 
	navigator are taken by surprise and are promptly subdued. 
	Han switches on the intercom and listens.

				 HAN
		How are we going to get them to 
		open the silo cover?

				 SKYWALKER
		Send C-3 in here.  Dispose of any 
		crewmen left on board.

103. BOARDING RAMP - SPACEPORT - TOWNOWI

	Valor and Oxus now wear the uniform of the royal guard. 
	Oxus has removed a plate from the cutter machinism and is 
	crossing a few wires.  He replaces the cutter plate just as a 
	squad of stormtroopers rushes toward the door.  An officer 
	salutes them.

				 OFFICER
		Have you seen them?

				 JUSTIN
		No, Sir.

				 OFFICER
		They're in this section somewhere. 
		I'm doubling all the guards.  Stay 
		alert.

	Two guards take up positions just outside the cutter areas, 
	and the squad moves on to another starship.  Valor gives 
	his partner a philosophical look.

104. INTERIOR - ROYAL STARSHIP - TOWNOWI

	The gleaming chrome C-3 sits in the pilot's seat  talking 
	on the intercom to a controller.  He breaks off his continual 
	drone of take-off instructions to the controller  and turns 
	to the general, shaking his head.

				 C-3
		They won't buy it.  I think they're 
		getting suspicious.

	Han enters.

				 HAN
		The crew is taken care of.

				 SKYWALKER
		Well, they're not going to open 
		the silo cover, so I'm afraid we'll 
		have to take it with us.

				 HAN
		We're going to sustain considerable 
		damage if we blast off through that 
		cover.

				 SKYWALKER
		It's a thin  shell.  There is no 
		choice.  (to C-3)  Signal the boys.

105. BOARDING RAMPS - SPACEPORT - TOWNOWI

	Warning lights flash and the main hatch to the starfighter 
	slowly begins to close.  The two royal stormtroopers yell 
	at Valor and Oxus.

				 STORMTROOPERS
		Watch it!  Don't fire into those 
		cutters!  (to Valor)  Shut down 
		the cutters!

	The two captains pretend to be confused  and not understand. 
	At the last minute  they leap aboard the starship.  The hatch 
	slides closed  and the boarding ramp drops away.  Several 
	more guards arrive  and give the troopers a special card, 
	which turns the small cutter warning lights from red to green. 
	The guards rush on to the boarding ramp and are wiped out by 
	the reversed cutters.

106. INTERIOR - STARSHIPS - TOWNOWI

	They strap themselves into lifepods.  C-3 and the general 
	move forward, and the giant ship shudders as it starts to 
	lift off the launch pad.  With tense expressions, they all 
	brace for the impact of the silo cover.

107. STARSHIP - SPACEPORT SILO - TOWNOWI

	The mighty starship thunders out of the silo, crashing
	through the cover plate, sending shrapnel in all directions. 
	The ship leaps toward the heavens.

108. BOARDING CAMPS - SPACEPORT - TOWNOWI

	Royal flight crews rush to their starships.  Pilots receive 
	their clearances  and several giant silo covers swing away 
	revealing deadly hunter-destroyer spaceships.

109. INTERIOR - BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE

	Han and the general watch as five hunter-destroyers leave the 
	spaceport at Gordon.

				 SKYWALKER
		We suffered light damage to a deflector 
		fin.  It will take them quite a while 
		to catch up with us now.  Tell the boys 
		to get some rest.

110. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE

	Han retreats to the aft section of the ship, where the two 
	captains are checking out the two main lazercannons mounted 
	in large rotating bubble turrets.

				 HAN
		The old boy says you two should get 
		some rest.  You've got some time 
		before they catch up to us.

	Han notices the packs containing the young princes.

				 HAN (Cont.)
		Better store the boys in a lifepod. 
		Secure them well.

	He heads back toward the bridge, followed by Oxus.  Valor 
	carries the two mircropacks to a lifepod and straps them in. 
	He checks Oeta's energy supply.  It is low.  Zara approaches 
	him.

				 ZARA
		Couldn't we let them out now?

				 JUSTIN
		It's better this way.  Things are 
		going to get rough.

				 ZARA
		Will we make it?  Is there any 
		hope?  Stay with me.  I love you.

	Captain Valor is slightly shocked at this outburst.  The 
	princess starts to cry and clings to him for support.

				 JUSTIN
		No-one is going to die, so stop acting 
		like a child and start behaving like a 
		queen.  What is this silly talk of love?  
		You belong to the people of Townowi  and 
		my job is to return you to them, nothing 
		more.  Now straighten up and get into a 
		lifepod.

	She's deeply hurt by his callousness.  She breaks away from 
	him and runs down a hallway into a lifepod.  He is tired 
	and angry at the whole incident.

111. BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE

	C-3 guides the starship toward the Ophuchi system.  The 
	general watches the computer readout estimate the position 
	of the royal hunter destroyers.

				 C-3
		Hostile craft will intercept at 
		thirty plus.

112. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE

	Captain Valor rests in one of the lazercannon pod bays.  He 
	is thinking about Zara.  Slowly, a smile creeps across his
	face.  He makes a decision, jumps up  and hurries down a
	hallway.  He taps on the lifepod bulkhead  and Oxus opens 
	the door.  Valor is surprised.

				 OXUS
		What is it?

				 JUSTIN
		Where is Zara?

				 OXUS
		She went forward.  What's going 
		on with you two?
		
				 JUSTIN
		I love her.

				 OXUS
		You're asking for trouble.  She's a queen. 
		Do you know what you're saying?

				 JUSTIN
		I don't care.  I've got to talk ...

	Oxus just shakes his head, but before Valor can finish his 
	sentence, the ship is rocked by a bombardment of proton 
	torpedoes.  The intercom squawks to life.

				 SKYWALKER (over intercom)
		Get to those guns!

	Captain Valor and Oxus rush to the lzercannons and jump into 
	the protective suits and helmets.

113. BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE

	Han enters the bridge and sits before a fire control center. 
	The general sits in a chair  slightly behind and above C-3, 
	directing the robot pilot.

				 SKYWALKER
		Turn around!  Let's face them.

	A-2, sitting quietly in a corner, watches as C-3 punches 
	new information into the computer and the giant starship 
	swings around in a sharp circle.  Several torpedoes explode 
	near the ship.  The general switches on the intercom.

				 SKYWALKER
		You boys ready?

114. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE

	The captains adjust the lazercannon controls in front of 
	them and check in with the general.

				 SKYWALKER
		They should be within range in 
		twelve seconds...

	Captain Valor adjusts his giant lazer ack-ack cannon, 
	searching his electronic tracking screen for the hunter
	destroyer.  Oxus is having a problem with one of the
	rotating mechanisms on the huge gun.  He curses, climbs 
	out of the chair, and attempts to fix it.

				 OXUS
		My vertical rotating circuits are 
		out.

	The princess straps herself into a small lifepod.  Only the 
	slightest hint of concern or worry shows in her face.  She 
	listens to her protectors relay instructions as the enemy 
	approach.

115. BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE

	The starship shudders as the hunter destroyers open fire.
	Han relays the ship's status to the general  as C-3 struggles 
	to keep up with the barrage of orders.

				 HAN
		We're losing deflectors three 
		thirty-one and ten forty-two.

				 SKYWALKER (to C-3)
		Cut hard to maridian nine zero 
		six.  Level to three degrees.
		(into the intercom)  We're 
		coming under one.  Wait for my 
		signal.

116. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE

	The constant flashing of deflected lazer bolts reflect in 
	the interior of the lazercannon bubble.  Captain Valor 
	rechecks his firing swithces.  Oxus adjusts his headphones 
	and lowers a glare reflector.  He raps on the power rotation 
	circuits  and gives them a little test burst.  The pod 
	instantly rotates a few degrees.  The large starship heads 
	directly toward the three enemy ships and at the last moment 
	dives under the attacking craft.  Valor watches the smaller 
	crafts pass overhead, aching to open fire.  He calls Oxus on 
	the intercom.

				 JUSTIN
		I've got no signal.  I'm on 
		target.  What's wrong?  What 
		is he waiting for?  I've got 
		an open shield.

	The three royal craft are firing incessantly at point blank 
	range.

				 OXUS
		Wait for the signal.

	But Captain Valor has a perfect shot and he can't wait.  He 
	squeezes the trigger and the giant lazercannon, with a burst 
	of smoke and electrical charge, opens up on the enemy craft. 
	Moments later, the signal lights flash on and Oxus commences 
	firing on the receding  hunter-destroyers.  Two of the royal 
	craft break off, and prepare for another attack run.  The 
	third is hit by a concentrated barrage from the two captains 
	and begins spinning out of control until it finally explodes. 
	Oxus gives the victory wave, which Justin gleefully returns. 
	These moments of triumph are broken by the intercom.

				 SKYWALKER
		Captain Valor, next run you wait for 
		my signal.  We haven't much power to 
		spare on your inaccurate grandstanding!

	Justin's pride is wounded.  He resets his accelerators as 
	the two remaining hunter-destroyers begin a second run.

117. BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE

	Han turns to the general.

				 HAN
		We have a weakened shield on the 
		port turret...

				 SKYWALKER
		Warn Captain Valor.  Get him out of 
		there.  (to C-3)  Change your 
		heading by point five.

118. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE

	Princess Zara listens to Han warn Valor.

				 HAN
		Your shield power is down.  Abandon 
		that position and seal that section. 
		Report!  Captain, do you hear me?  
		Captain?!!!

	Zara becomes worried that something has happened to Justin. 
	The young captain switches off the intercom system and 
	signals to Oxus that the system has gone dead.  Before Oxus 
	can answer, the two hunter-destroyer spacecraft are upon 
	them once again.  Lazer bolts flash all around them.  The 
	general's signal flashes on, and the captain starts to 
	return the fire.  One of the royal fighters concentrates 
	its fire on Valor's weakened gunport.  A direct hit blows 
	open a hole in the turret and everything that isn't bolted 
	down is sucked into outer space, including Captain Valor. 
	He bangs against the side of the starship, held only by a 
	weakened lifeline.

	The princess hears Oxus explain Valor’s predicament  and 
	rushes back to help him.  She is stopped by a pressure 
	locked door leading to the gun emplacement.

119. BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE

	The general orders C-3 to swing the spacecraft around and 
	start a new attack.  He turns to A-2.

				 SKYWALKER
		Use the aft port.  See what you can 
		do for Valor.

	A-2 hurriedly waddles out of the bridge.  C-3 and Han 
	simultaneously turn to the general.

				 C-3
		More craft approaching!

				 HAN
		It looks like at least six or seven.

	The general studies the radar scopes and then checks a
	galactic map displayed on one of the monitors.

				 SKYWALKER
		Change course to three point one.

				 C-3
		That will head us directly into 
		the path of the Norton Asteroid 
		Belt.

				 HAN
		That asteroid belt is too dense 
		to pass through.  The ship won't 
		make it!

				 SKYWALKER
		We'll never defeat them in combat. 
		It's our only chance to lose them.

	C-3 punches in new coordinates  and the starship veers away 
	toward the treacherous asteroid belt.

120. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE

	Oxus fires on one of the two hunter-destroyers which is
	pacing the rebel starship.  Captain Valor unsuccessfully 
	tries to pull himself back inside the spacecraft.  The enemy 
	craft maneuvers wildly in an attempt to get into a better 
	position to fire on Valor.  Oxus blasts away until the royal 
	spacecraft spews forth equipment and personnel, careens off, 
	and eventually explodes.

	A-2 wobbles along the exterior of the ship until he reaches 
	the stranded captain.  He attaches a new lifeline to the 
	young Dai's spacesuit and makes his way back inside the 
	wounded craft.  Valor is pulled to safety just as the star-
	ship enters the asteroid belt.  A barrage of small and large 
	asteroids begins to pelt the ship, causing a great deal of 
	damage.

				 SKYWALKER (over intercom)
		Secure yourselves.  We may have to 
		eject.  Abandon the turrets.

	The princess rushes back to her lifepod and straps herself
	in.  Oxus and A-2 help Valor make his way out of the lazer-
	cannon turrets and through a series of locks, to the life-
	pod area.

121. BRIDGE - STARSHIP - SPACE

	The asteroids hit hard.  The ship is buffeted to and fro as 
	the general, Han, and C-3 struggle into their spacesuit-
	like lifepods.  The royal hunter-destroyer closest to the 
	rebel ship explodes in the on-rush of deadly asteroids. 
	The new reinforcement hunter-destroyers turn back and give 
	up the pursuit.  They disappear from the tracking monitors. 
	The asteroid bombardment becomes almost unbearable.  Warning 
	lights begin to flash.  Extending foils, antennae, and arma-
	ment pods are scraped away from the starship hull.  A base-
	ball sized hole is punched through the midsection, and 
	hundreds of objects are sucked into space.  A large locker 
	eventually plugs the opening.  The starship and her passengers 
	shudder and sway under the punishment of the asteroid storm.

				 C-3
		The ship is breaking up.

				 HAN
		We're almost clear of the storm.

				 C-3
		We'll never make it.  Eject.  We 
		must eject.

	The general watches the computer monitor as the starship
	emerges from the far side of the asteroid belt.

				 HAN
		We're approaching one of the 
		Forbidden Systems.

				 SKYWALKER
		We've got to achieve orbit.

				 C-3
		We'll never make it.

	The starship heads for a small blue-green planet in the
	distance.

122. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - SPACE

	Captain Valor was considerably shaken in the destruction of 
	his lazerturret.  He is slightly dazed as Oxus straps him 
	into a lifepod with A-2.

				 OXUS (to A-2)
		You watch him.  Make sure this 
		pod gets off all right.

	A-2 nods  and Oxus moves to the second lifepod and straps 
	himself in next to the princess.

				 ZARA
		Will he be all right?

				 OXUS
		I think so.  His feelings for 
		you are dangerous.  You should 
		discourage him.

	She is surprised that Valor has any feeling for her  but 
	keeps her emotions to herself.

123. BRIDGE - STARSHIP - YAVIN ORBIT

	The general is strapped into the lifepod with the two 
	micropacks containing the young princes.  Han and C-3 are 
	in the second lifepod.

				 HAN
		We're in orbit.

				 C-3
		We've got to eject now!  Those reactors 
		won't hold much longer.  This ship's 
		going to end up in a million little 
		pieces  and I don't want to be one of 
		them.

				 HAN
		All lifepod systems are operative.

				 SKYWALKER (into intercom)
		If you boys are ready back there, 
		we'll get off this bucket.

				 OXUS
		All systems operative.  I 
		have the signal.

				 A-2
		All systems operative.  We 
		have the signal.

	Han salutes the general  and his lifepod jettisons away 
	from the crippled starship.  He is quickly followed by 
	the general.

124. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - YAVIN ORBIT

	A-2 pushes the jettison switch  but nothing happens.  Cap-
	tain Valor slowly and with some difficulty  pushes the 
	switch two or three times.  Nothing happens.  He begins to
	look a little worried.

				 A-2 (into intercom)
		We've got a problem.  Wait a 
		second.

	A-2 pushes the switch again  and the lifepod blasts off in 
	a cloud of smoke and debris.  Oxus also seems to be having 
	a problem.  Half the lights on his control panel have gone 
	dead.  He struggles to reactivate them.

				 OXUS
		My power's out!

				 SKYWALKER (over intercom)
		Is it a faulty switch?

				 OXUS
		No.  The whole bank is out.

	Oxus gives the princess a reassuring look, then punches some 
	information into the computer.  The monitor flashes: "Income 
	line main power."  He looks outside the lifepod and sees a 
	damaged cable.

				 OXUS
		I've found it.

				 SKYWALKER
		You haven't much time.  The 
		auxiliary units have already 
		blown.

	Oxus scrambles out of the lifepod and rushes over to the 
	severed connector.  He works on it for a few moments, then 
	stops with a rather defeated look.  The princess watches 
	him as he tries to think of a solution.  A great explosion 
	is heard in the forward part of the ship.

125. LIFEPODS - SPACE - YAVIN ORBIT

	The two lifepods containing the general, Han and C-3 drift 
	away from the disabled starship.

				 SKYWALKER
		Where's Captain Valor?

				 HAN
		I can't see him either.

	Captain Valor uses the small rockets on his lifepod to 
	maneuver back toward the burning starship.  He can hear the 
	general over the intercom.

				 SKYWALKER
		Captain Valor, where are you? 
		Report in.

	Valor reaches down and switches off the intercom.

126. AFT SECTION - STARSHIP - YAVIN ORBIT

	Oxus appears to have found a solution to his situation and 
	rushes back to the princess.  He reaches in and locks on the 
	power switch.

				 OXUS
		There is only one possible solution 
		and we must use it.  Lock the hitch 
		and make sure it is sealed.

				 PRINCESS
		But what of...?

	Another explosion creates a large bulge in the wall of the 
	aft section.

				 OXUS
		We've no time!

	He slams the hatch shut and runs to the power connector.
	Smoke begins to fill the chamber, as Oxus slams a large 
	metallic dampening tool across the damaged connector ter-
	minals, and the lifepod jettisons away.

127. LIFEPODS - SPACE - YAVIN ORBIT

	The princess jettisons free, as Captain Valor moves toward 
	the crippled ship.  Zara calls the general on the intercom.

				 ZARA
		I'm all right, but Clieg is 
		still on board.

				 SKYWALKER
		Captain Valor, stay out of 
		there.

	With a rumble, the starship disappears in a spectacular
	explosion, sending debris in all directions.  Valor stops 
	his lifepod and it starts to drift.  He is weeping.  Han 
	and the general watch the remains of the explosion drift 
	away.

				 SKYWALKER
		Captain Valor, stay near Zara. 
		Use your beacon.  Coordinate 
		with us.

	Valor's intercom is weak and there is a great deal of static. 
	The lifepods drift toward the awesome blue-green Yavin 
	surface.  The general loses sight of the other lifepods as 
	they descend through the cloud cover.

				 SKYWALKER
		Captain, I'm losing your beacon. 
		Send me a new signal.

	All he gets is static.  The planet surface rushes toward the 
	falling lifepods.  Retrorockets automatically kick in and 
	slow the pods.  Two of the small craft break through the 
	brown clouds and land in the dense, steaming jungles.  The
	sky is a strange light brown color.

128. VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN

	The general's lifepod crashes through the foliage until it 
	comes to rest in the middle of a large vine-covered tree. 
	He grabs the two micropacks and climbs out of the lifepod 
	and onto a large  moss-covered limb.  Han and C-3 run to the 
	base of the huge tree.

				 HAN
		Are you all right?

				 SKYWALKER
		Fine.  Any signal from Captain
		Valor?

				 HAN
		Nothing yet.  I think they landed 
		further south.

	The general attaches a thin cable from his utility belt to 
	the tree trunk  and slides to the ground.  Han takes the 
	micropacks from him. The general looks around at the jungle.

				 SKYWALKER
		This is dangerous country.  We'd better 
		stay together.

				 C-3
		The wildlife in the Forbidden System 
		is extremely hostile.  Perhaps we 
		should seek shelter?

	Han inspects the power units of the micropacks.

				 HAN
		Puck's unit is very low.  I can't 
		tell if the unit is still functioning.

				 SKYWALKER
		We have to find a place to revive 
		them.  We'll start moving south.  We 
		should find protection along that 
		ridge.

	The general grabs one of the micropacks and starts off into 
	the murky jungle.  Han and C-3 quickly follow.  The jungle 
	is a strange and eerie fog-laiden purgatory.  Gruesome and 
	unnatural sounds permeate this ghostly wasteland.  Everyone 
	is cautious and on the alert for an unseen danger.

129. FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN

	Captain Valor's lifepod is also caught in the limbs of a
	gargantuan tree.  The lifepod has been ripped in half by the 
	crash landing.  The unconscious Dai hangs half out of the 
	damaged craft.  A two-foot high insect-like creature scoots 
	down a branch and onto the back of the dormant warrior.  The 
	insect lets out a chilling hissing sound and a slimy tube 
	emerges from its hairy mouth, waking Valor.  He is immediately 
	aware of the insect.  His eyes are open but he doesn't move.  
	Suddenly with one quick blow he knocks the creature against 
	the side of the spacecraft and it is squashed lifeless.

	Captain Valor is a little groggy but he manages to climb 
	out of the wreckage.  He looks around for A-2.

				 JUSTIN
		A-2!  A-2!

				 A-2
		Help!

	Valor turns and sees the little robot hanging upside down, one 
	of his three feet caught in a vine.  He lifts A-2 out of his 
	predicament and places him securely on a wide limb.

				 JUSTIN
		Did you see Zara?

				 A-2
		She landed on the other side of those 
		trees, approximately eight hundred 
		meters.

				 JUSTIN
		Well, come on, old buddy.  Let's get 
		ourselves out of this tree.

130. VINE JUNGLE RIDGE - YAVIN

	The general, Han, and C-3 reach a shallow cave near the top 
	of a steep ridge.  They quickly pull off the micropacks and 
	place them on a clear piece of ground at the mouth of the 
	cave.

				 SKYWALKER (to Han)
		Check out the inside.  C-3, stand 
		guard.  Keep you eye on the country-
		side.

	He looks at the power units on the micropacks and shakes his 
	head with a worried look.  Han returns from a survey of the 
	inside of the cave.

				 HAN
		It doesn't go very far.  There's 
		nothing back there.

				 SKYWALKER
		Help me with this.

	Han helps the general lift the top from the case containing 
	Puck, the younger of the two princes.  The small boy appears 
	lifeless as the general pulls him from his encasement and 
	rests him on the cave floor.  Han pulls a small respirator 
	out of the micropacks and places it over the boy's nose.  The 
	general attaches two electrodes over his heart.

				 HAN
		He doesn't look good.

	The little prince begins to turn blue.  The general grows
	tense.  Puck starts to regain consciousness  but begins
	coughing and choking, then goes limp again.  The general
	quickly props Puck's mouth open with a small plastic rod and 
	checks the reading on his powerpack.

				 SKYWALKER
		We need more power.  Tap off Oeta’s 
		unit.  Quickly!

	He then places Puck's arms behind his back and starts pressing 
	on his chest with sharp, rhythmic movements.  Han attaches 
	new electrodes to the boy's heart.  Puck again comes to, 
	choking and coughing.  Finally, he begins to cry.  The general 
	takes the plastic tube from Puck’s mouth and tenderly pats 
	him on the back.

				 SKYWALKER
		Let's get Oeta out of there.  He 
		shouldn't be a problem.

131. FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN

	Valor slams closed the hatch of Princess Zara's lifepod. 
	In the distance the subhuman cries of lonesome tree beasts 
	cut through the forest murmur.

				 A-2
		Perhaps she went in search of 
		us.

	Valor studies the ground around the capsule.  There are a 
	great many footprints and much broken foliage.

				 JUSTIN
		Someone's got her.  She put up 
		quite a fight.  It's an easy 
		trail to follow.

132. VINE JUNGLE RIDGE - YAVIN

	Both Oeta and Puck are sleeping restlessly on the floor of 
	the cave.  Han watches over them as the general scans the 
	valley below with a pair of electrobinoculars.

				 C-3
		It's about fourteen degrees below 
		the horizon...a little to the left.

	The electrobinoculars sweep the rich green landscape until 
	they come to rest on a bright reflection revealing some 
	type of structure.

				 SKYWALKER
		It's too small to be a military 
		base.  Could belong to a trapper.

				 C-3
		Highly unusual.

				 SKYWALKER
		It's on the way.  Perhaps we 
		should investigate.
		
	Little Oeta wakes up with a giant yawn.

				 OETA
		Hey!  Where are we?

133. FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN

	The gargantuan trees are shrouded in mist, and the ominous 
	sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air.  Captain Valor 
	moves quietly and cautiously, followed by A-2, who 
	inadvertently makes a loud clicking sound.  The young 
	warrior stops and motions to the stubby little robot.

				 JUSTIN
		Wait here.  If I don't return by 
		zero two hundred, come looking 
		for me.

	The mechanical dwarf acknowledges with his computer light.
	Valor moves swiftly and silently forward, until he hears 
	laughing and voices.  He climbs up the bankside of a huge 
	tree and inches his way out onto one of the huge overhanging 
	branches.  Below him he can see a group of scruffy alien 
	trappers sitting around a nutron stove, joking and telling 
	stories.  Parked on either side of the group are two large, 
	tank-like jungle-crawlers.  Behind the crawlers, five Jawa’s 
	(huge gray and furry beasts) hang upside down in a tree. 
	Occasionally they thrash about in great anger and frustration.

	The trappers speak in a strange language, and although they 
	appear slightly human, they are slimy, deformed, hideous 
	looking creatures.  Two of the trappers yell at each other 
	in a friendly argument.  One shirtless creature goes into a 
	crawler and the remaining eight laugh hysterically.  Captain 
	Valor moves further out on the limb to get a better view.  A 
	couple  of pieces of bark break loose, and float a hundred 
	feet to the ground.  The trappers fail to notice.  Moments 
	later, the shirtless trapper emerges from the crawler with 
	the princess held unconscious and half naked over his head. 
	Valor's rage knows no bounds.  With a terrifying Dai war cry, 
	the young captain jumps from the tree, sails over a hundred 
	feet, and with great agility, lands in the middle of the 
	startled trappers.  In one continuous rapid motion, he ignites 
	his lazersword and cuts down three of the vile creatures.  The 
	shirtless trapper swings the princess over his shoulder  and	 
	runs back into the huge jungle crawler.  Two other trappers 
	reach for their pistols, but the Dai has killed them before 
	their weapons can clear leather.  The three remaining 
	creatures have their pistols out and start firing.  Explosions 
	erupt all around Valor.  One blast hits the branch holding 
	the Jawa’s  and they collapse with a loud screech in a heap. 
	One of the trappers is caught in the crossfire and is blown 
	apart.

	When the smoke clears  Valor lies unconscious amid the 
	burning rubble.  The jungle crawler begins to move out of the 
	camp.  The last two trappers run after it.  One is able to 
	jump on board, but the second trapper runs too close to the 
	now freed Jawas.  Boma, one of the furry giants, grabs him 
	and snaps him in two, like a stick of wood.  The jungle 
	crawler disappears in the forest mist.  The eight foot Boma, 
	who resembles a huge, gray bushbaby with fierce baboon-like 
	fangs, struggles to free his companions.

	Valor regains semi-consciousness, and attempts to get up, only 
	to groan and collapse back into unconsciousness.  The Jawas 
	gather around him and poke him a couple of times to see if 
	he is still alive.  They squawk and jabber, apparently in 
	some kind of argument.  Finally, Wann, the largest of the Jawas 
	picks up Valor and puts him over his shoulder.  The group 
	disappears into the jungle foliage.

134. TREE HOUSE - FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN

	Han and C-3 carry the two little boys on their shoulders. 
	The general stops on the edge of a clearing and motions for 
	the others to be still.  Oeta turns around and signals his 
	little brother to be quiet.  On the opposite side of the 
	clearing, a small metal structure is attaached to one of the 
	huge trees.  It is a small, weatherbeaten hut of futuristic 
	design.  It appears deserted.  The general cautiously 
	approaches the structure.

				 VOICE
		Howdy stranger.  What can I offer you?

	The general spins around and sees Huu Tho, an aged and scruffy 
	looking anthropologist.

				 THO (Cont.)
		I'm Huu Tho of Bastine.

	The general takes the old man's extended hand.

				 SKYWALKER
		I'm Luke Skywalker of Townowi.

	He signals for the others to join him in the clearing.

135. WOOKEE CAMP - YAVIN

	The small caravan of Jawas, led by Boma, enters a small 
	clearing surrounded by many bark and mud hovels.  Young 
	Jawas race ahead of the group, yelling and running in and 
	out of the grubby little dwellings.  Giant, bushbaby-like 
	Jawas of all ages and sizes make their way into the clearing. 
	Many stand dumbfounded, but others let out a joyful scream 
	and rush up to members of the group, hugging and kissing them.

	Wann dumps the unconscious captain on a raised area in the 
	middle of the clearing.  Armed Jawas immediately surround the 
	helpless human.  Boma enters the largest of the lodges.  He 
	is greeted by his father, Auzituck, chief of the Kaapauku 
	tribe.  He is an old and feeble Jawa dressed in royal skins 
	and headdress.

136. INTERIOR - ANTHROPOLOGIST HUT - YAVIN

	Anthropologist Tho, the general, Han and the children sit 
	around a large table eating.  Tho yells into the kitchen.

				 THO
		Beru!  Where's the thanta sauce?

	BERU THO, Kuu's warm plump wife, enters carrying a small 
	pitcher.  She smiles at Kuu.

				 BERU
		I swan!  I put it right here in 
		front so you'd see it.  (to Han)  
		Here's some bum bum extract. 
		It's very mild.

				 THO (to general)
		There are no settlers to the south 
		since the Dau family was wiped out. 
		I'm afraid I couldn't even get in 
		there to bury them.  Those Jawas 
		are the fiercest critters I've ever 
		run across.  A new tribe moved in 
		down there about a year ago  and 
		it's been hell ever since.  Only 
		Yourellian trappers venture in 
		there now  and many of them don't 
		even come back.

				 SKYWALKER
		Where's the nearest city?

				 THO
		No cities at all, only a few 
		scattered settlers and -- one 
		royal outpost.  But the troops 
		are of no help.  They kill and 
		plunder rather than protect.
		Enough.  If your friends landed 
		farther south, I'd fear for them.

				 HAN
		How far is the outpost from here?

				 THO
		Five leagues...an oppressive 
		blight.

				 SKYWALKER
		What class is it?  How many 
		support craft?

				 THO
		It's very small, a class two.  
		Only ten or twelve starraiders, 
		I think.

	Beru fusses over the boys, who refuse to eat their vegetables. 
	She makes up a game  which tricks them into eating.  The 
	general ponders the situation.  Han eats like he hasn't eaten 
	in years.

137. JAWA CAMP - YAVIN

	Captain Valor is surrounded by Jawas.  Young ones push through 
	to get a better look, as the adults jabber and argue about the 
	human.  Valor regains consciousness with a groan, and a sudden 
	hush sweeps over the gathering.  Valor staggers to his feet, 
	and the group of Jawas back away en masse.  The young dai 
	surveys the situation for a few moments.  The Jawas appear 
	to be frightened of this brave warrior.  He reaches for his 
	weapons  but they are gone.  Three guards with long spears 
	attempt to contain Valor.  With a loud shout, he lunges at 
	them and they give him a little room.  Jommillia, a large	 
	ferocious Jawa, steps forward.  He says something to the 
	guards and they quickly move away.  He struts before Captain
	Valor, boasting and taunting him with his spear and battle 
	ax.  The captain studies the Jawa warrior as he paces back 
	and forth, his helmet plumes dancing and chest armor jangling. 
	Without warning, Valor lets out another loud yell, startling 
	Jommillia into backing off.  Captain Valor continues his 
	verbal assault, calling the uncomprehending Jawa all manner 
	of vile and degrading things.  Jommillia continues to back 
	into the surrounding crowd, momentarily confused by this odd 
	behaviour.  Slowly, Jommillia begins to grin.  He takes a 
	defensive stance, then begins to laugh hysterically.  This 
	stops Valor.  The giant Jawa swings his deadly double-bladed 
	battle ax over his head and expertly throws it directly at 
	the young captain's head.  To the amazement of Jommillia and 
	the other Jawas, Captain Valor, with Dai Nogas skill and 
	concentration, catches the ax in mid-air, then charges his 
	furry opponent.

	Jommillia is caught off-guard, but manages to block Valor's 
	attack with his spear.  The two warriors engage in a savage 
	and fantastic duel.  Valor cuts the Jawas spear in half, but 
	is hit along the side of the head by the shaft and is momentaril 
	dazed.  The battle ax is knocked from his hands.  He grabs the 
	spear shaft and rams the giant creature in the belly.  A loud 
	command from outside the crowd stops the fight.  The Jawas 
	part, revealing Boma and his father, who approach the two 
	warriors.  Jommillia bows before his chief, and is commanded 
	to move away.  Boma speaks to Valor.  The captain doesn't 
	understand, but welcomes the chance to catch his breath. 
	Boma then presents his father, who steps forward and bows 
	before the mighty Dai.  Boma bows also as the crowd of Jawas 
	chatter in disbelief.  When the chief and his son rise, Valor 
	bows before them.  This pleases the Jawas and they screech 
	and cheer.

138. TREE HOUSE - FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - YAVIN

	Mr. and Mrs. Tho stand on the balcony of their tree house 
	with C-3 and the two little princes, Oeta and Puck.  Han and 
	the general emerge with large survival backpacks and multi-
	plelazer weapons.

				 SKYWALKER (to C-3)
		We'll call for you when we've found them.

				 C-3
		Your orders are quite clear.  The 
		boys will be quite safe.

				 THO
		Don't worry.  The patrols never 
		come out this far.  We'll take good 
		care of the boys.

				 SKYWALKER
		Your kindness will surely be 
		rewarded.

				 THO
		Just be careful out there.

	He pats Skywalker on the back as the old Dai and the ever 
	faithful Han descend from the tree house.  At the base of 
	the huge tree, the warriors climb aboard two small rocket 
	powered platforms.

				 THO (yelling down to them)
		They're pretty old.  I hope they'll 
		be all right!

				 SKYWALKER
		Out here they're a wonderment.

	C-3 and the kids wave as the jelsticks start with a whine. 
	They idle about five feet above the ground.

				 THO
		Good hunting!  May the force of 
		others be with you.

	Han and the general wave as they ride off into the foreboding 
	Yavin sunset.

139. JAWA CAMP - YAVIN - NIGHT

	A beautiful but frenzied fire festival is underway.  Jawas 
	perform the Waita Tar dance, and yodel in a barking fashion 
	around a large fire.  The female Jawas arrive, carrying 
	torches  and move in a circle around the males.  The giant 
	creatures are too involved to notice little A-2 make his way 
	around the dancers.  The stubby robot stops near one of the 
	mud huts and looks around.   He then wobbles off toward the 
	large chief's quarters and enters.

									  - Dissolve -

140. JAWA CAMP - YAVIN - MORNING

	A-2 exits the chief's hut and looks around.  It is a quiet 
	gray morning.  A low mist hangs over the now deserted 
	clearing.  He turns and signals back into the hut.  Captain 
	Valor cautiously emerges from the mud house.  He wears a 
	crude backpack and carries a large battle ax.  They start 
	across the clearing.  Suddenly, out of nowhere, Boma is 
	standing before them.  He says nothing, but scratches his 
	head and then circles around Captain Valor.

				 JUSTIN
		We are leaving.  We must go. 
		Stand away!

	The huge Jawa kneels and bows down in front of the young Dai. 
	Valor looks down and smiles.

				 JUSTIN
		Rise my friend.  We will meet 
		again.

	Valor walks toward the jungle and Boma scurries ahead of him 
	and bows down once more.

				 A-2
		What does he want?

	Valor shakes his head and rubs his several days growth of 
	beard.  He leans down toward Boma.

				 JUSTIN
		Stand up so we can talk properly.

	Boma jabbers in a questioning fashion.

				 JUSTIN
		I am grateful to you and your 
		people, but I must go.  I wish 
		you understood me.  I would 
		make things so much easier.  
		Go!  Go!

	Valor turns away, and begins to walk toward the jungle again. 
	Boma gets to his feet and runs after the Dai, following a few 
	paces behind.  Valor notices the Jawa following them  and 
	shakes his head.

141. FOREST OF THE GARGANTUANS - TRAPPER SIGHT - YAVIN

	The bodies of the killed trappers are covered with rat-sized 
	insects.  A lazer explosion erupts in the middle of the slimy 
	creatures and they scatter into the underbush.  Han and the 
	general turn over one of the dead trappers.

				 HAN
		They ran into something.

				 SKYWALKER
		It's strange they left their 
		dead.  Something...

	The constant cacophony of jungle creatures suddenly stops. 
	The two warriors scan the jungle for possible danger.  Han 
	draws his lazerpistol.  The cacophony starts again as the 
	general ignites his lazersword.

				 HAN
		Two or three moving this way 
		from the east.

	He listens more closely for a few moments.

				 HAN (Cont.)
		It's A-2.

	Captain Valor and A-2 break out of the dark foliage into the 
	clearing.  He waves to Han and the general.  A-2 waddles a 
	few paces behind.  Boma sees the humans and stops at the 
	edge of the jungle.  He watches as Captain Valor and the 
	general carry on an animated conversation.  Han sees the 
	Jawa lurking in the shadows.

				 HAN
		You were followed.

				 JUSTIN
		He wouldn't stay.  He's the one I 
		saved.

	Han calls out to Boma in the Jawa's own language  and the 
	huge lumbering creature approaches the group.  Han and the 
	Jawa talk for a few moments, then embrace as if they were 
	old friends.  Captain Valor is surprised.

				 HAN (to Valor)
		This is Boma, son of Auzituck, 
		Prince of the Sawas - a very 
		powerful tribe.  It seems they've 
		made you a god.

	The general smiles.  Captain Valor is embarrassed.

142. VINE JUNGLE RIDGE - YAVIN

	Captain Valor joins the general on a ridge overlooking the
	royal outpost of Mavassi.  All that can be seen of the
	fortress is a lone guard standing on a small pedastal jutting 
	out above the dense jungle.

				 SKYWALKER
		Their trail leads directly to the 
		outpost.  Patrols are probably 
		out looking for us by now.

				 JUSTIN
		Finding her in there isn't going 
		to be easy.

				 SKYWALKER
		Getting in there is going to be 
		impossible, but we could sure 
		use those starships.

	Captain Valor spots something moving in the jungle.  He scans 
	the area with his electrobinoculars.

				 JUSTIN
		Something's going on down there.
		Han!

	Han moves up next to Valor, followed closely by Boma.

				 JUSTIN
		Your eyes are better than mine.
		What do you make of that?

				 HAN
		They look like Jawas, hundreds 
		of them.

	Han turns and speaks to Boma, gesturing toward the movement 
	far below in the jungle.

				 HAN
		Apparently it's a siege.  They've 
		been harassing the outpost for 
		almost two years.

				 SKYWALKER
		Have they ever tried to take the 
		fortress?

	Han relays this to Boma.

				 HAN
		He says they've made several 
		assaults, but they are no match 
		for the weapons.

				 SKYWALKER
		It's only a class three fortress.  
		Maybe they just need a little 
		help.

	Captain Valor grins, and Han says something to Boma, who 
	becomes excited and screeches loudly.

143. INTERIOR - TREE HOUSE - YAVIN

	The incoming signal alarm on the anthropologist's radio
	system wails through the calm of the tree house.  Oeta,
	dragging an eight-legged, furry rodent, rushes up to the 
	old radio and flips the receiver.

				 OETA
		I'm reading yah.  Go ahead.

				 SKYWALKER
		Oeta, how are you getting along?

				 OETA
		Great!  I caught a thumper, a 
		really big one.  Its name is 
		Amber.

	He yanks on the leash, and the furry beast lets out a
	strained yelp.

				 SKYWALKER
		Good, Oeta.  How's your brother?  
		Are you taking good care of him?

				 OETA
		Oh, sure.  He's out collecting 
		"abas" with Huu and Beru.  I'm 
		in charge here.  Did you find 
		Zara?

				 SKYWALKER
		Not yet.  We'll be away for a 
		while.  You mind Tho until we 
		return.  May the force of others 
		be with you.

				 OETA
		All right.  Take care.

	C-3 enters the room carrying a plate of steaming food. Oeta 
	turns the radio off and puts the receiver away.  A crashing 
	sound and voices are heard in the clearing below.

				 C-3
		Come and eat your dinner.

				 OETA
		They're back!  They're back!  Come Amber.

	The furry rodent jumps up onto its eight stubby legs and
	rushes over to the door, but stops short and begins to growl. 
	Oeta stops behind the creature.

				 OETA
		What is it, Amber?

	Oeta peeks out the window, and sees a patrol of six royal 
	stormtroopers climbing out of an airtank.  He ducks back 
	and tugs Amber away from the door.

				 OETA
		Quiet, Amber.  Come here.  Come on.

				 C-3
		What's wrong?

				 OETA
		Troopers.  We must hide.  Stay quiet.

	Oeta and the robot scramble for a trap door near a large 
	shelf.  The troops begin to climb the ladder to the tree 
	house.  The trap door is heavy, and the robot and the little 
	boy struggle to get it open.  The troops break in the door 
	just as C-3 closes the trap door.  The troopers are led by 
	a rough looking sergeant.  They poke around, tearing every-
	thing apart.  Oeta struggles to keep Amber quiet.  Suddenly, 
	he realizes something.

				 OETA
		The food!

	The sergeant takes the bowl of food from the table and
	studies it.  He then takes a small chrome ball from his
	pocket and tosses it into the air.  Antennae shoot from 
	its surface as it floats around the room.  Eventually it 
	hovers over the trap door.  A sinister grin sweeps across 
	the sergeant's face as he moves over to the trap door and 
	puts the chrome ball back into his pocket.

	C-2 puts his arm around Oeta, who is desperately clutching 
	the struggling thumper.  All the movement above them stops 
	and Oeta looks to the robot.

				 C-3 (quietly)
		They're still up there.  Stay 
		still.

	The silence continues, then suddenly the trap door swings 
	open with a loud bang.  Amber breaks away from Oeta and 
	attacks the sergeant.  One of the other troopers cuts the 
	thumper in half with his lazersword.  The sergeant pulls 
	Oeta out of his hiding place.  Oeta stares at the dead 
	thumper.

				 SERGEANT
		Well, well!  Here's one of them, 
		anyway.  Send seekers in all 
		directions.  Find the others!

144. VINE JUNGLE RIDGE - YAVIN

	The general sits at the head of the large stone table
	pushing small markers around.  Han explains what the general 
	is doing to ten or fifteen Jawa chiefs gathered around the 
	table.  Occasionally, Boma puts in a word of further explana-
	tion or answers a question.  Captain Valor sits back silently 
	watching the Jawa warriors and listens to the general's plan.

				 SKYWALKER
		... then they pull back to here.  
		That's where the trap will be set.  
		No-one must advance.  An assault 
		on the perimeter is useless.  Our 
		only hope is to use their weapons 
		against them.

	The general pauses while Han and Boma translate.

				 SKYWALKER 
		Once we acquire those tanks, our
		prime object must be to secure the 
		starship.  No-one must escape.

145. IMPERIAL OUTPOST - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN

	Three officers run along a row of giant airtanks to a perimeter 
	bunker.  There, two stormtroopers are watching the jungle. 
	When the officers arrive, the troopers let them look through 
	the powerful mounted electrobinoculars.  One of the troopers 
	points out several areas in the dense jungle.

146. INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM - ROYAL OUTPOST - YAVIN

	A trooper sitting at an elaborate control panel turns to an 
	officer watching a monitor system.

				 TROOPER
		A large concentration of trestuals 
		at point E-2.

				 OFFICER
		Alert squads one through six.

147. VINE JUNGLES - OUTPOST PERIMETER - YAVIN

	The general stands in a clearing surrounded by many armed 
	Jawas carrying large shiny shields.  Han moves back and forth, 
	barking orders to the assembled creatures.

				 SKYWALKER (to Han)
		We're ready.  Give them the signal.

	Han motions to a young Jawa, who takes off, running through 
	the jungle.

148.  ROYAL OUTPOST - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN

	Three large airtanks slowly move toward the outpost perimeter. 
	The tank pilots sit on the hatch rims of the ponderous weapons, 
	studying the movements of the Jawas.  The tank personnel talk 
	to one another on an intercom system.

				 TANK PILOT
		There is a large concentration,
		red two by X-S.  Let's break 
		them up.

	The pilots slip into the tanks and close the hatches.  The 
	tanks open up with a barrage of lazerbolts which create a 
	wall of explosions.  The Jawas retreat, and the tanks follow. 
	The tank crews track the fleeing creatures with various 
	electronic scopes, and laugh at the fleeing creatures.

149. VINE JUNGLE - OUTPOST PERIMETER - YAVIN

	The general stands on a limb of a jungle tree, watching the 
	advancing tanks.  Captain Valor is on another branch a few 
	feet away.

				 SKYWALKER
		They've grown sloppy fighting 
		Jawas.  The intrafazer systems 
		aren't on.  They're in for a 
		little surprise.

	Captain Valor flashes a signal mirror, which is received by 
	a Jawa near the tanks.  The Jawas are in pairs and they hold 
	heavy stone wedges attached to woven vines, which, in turn, 
	are fastened high in the trees.  When the tanks pass directly 
	under the Jawas, they let loose with the heavy stone 
	pendulums.  The wedges fly through the air, neatly clipping 
	off the antenna groupings protruding from the tops of the 
	airtanks.

150. INTERIOR - AIRTANK - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN

	Several of the lights and monitors go dark on the main control 
	panel.  The pilot flips several switches in a panic.

				 PILOT
		All high phasing units are out.  
		We've lost all contact.

				 SERGEANT
		Send out a ground signal!

	Suddenly, all of the monitors go white, and static fills the 
	crowded tank interior.  An alarm signal sounds.

				 SERGEANT
		What is it?!!!

				 PILOT
		All signals, sensers, everything, 
		are coming right back to us.  Some 
		kind of deflection screen.  It's a 
		total blackout.

				 SERGEANT
		Get out there and see if you can 
		see anything.

	The pilot pushes a button and the main hatch slowly slides 
	away.

151. VINE JUNGLE - OUTPOST PERIMETER - YAVIN

	The pilot pops out of the hatch and sees two rows of Jawa 
	warriors holding reflective shields.  They form a circle 
	that totally encompasses the massive air tank.  Han shouts 
	a signal to a group of Jawas in another tree, and they cut 
	loose a bent limb which is attached to a noose around the 
	tank's hatch.  The noose instantly tightens around the pilot 
	and he is plucked from the tank and suspended fifty feet in 
	the air.  In an equally swift move, Captain Valor drops a 
	small gas grenade into the open hatch.  It explodes and 
	engulfs the tank in a gray mist.

	The Jawas let out a joyful yell, and charge the tank.  Han 
	yells at them to stop, but several make it to the conquered 
	craft before the gas cloud dissipates and they are felled by 
	the fumes.  Valor waits until after the smoke clears  and
	then jumps on the back of the immobile tank.

	Several signal mirrors flash their messages to Han and the 
	general.

				 HAN
		That makes four captured.

				 SKYWALKER
		Have them camouflaged.  I'm 
		going with Captain Valor.

152. INTERIOR - AIRTANK - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN

	Jawas are removing the tank crew as Valor checks out the power 
	controls.  The general slides through the main hatch.

				 SKYWALKER
		Any damage?

				 JUSTIN
		She's fine.  We're ready to 
		move.

				 SKYWALKER
		Then let's go.
		
	The general yells for the Jawas to clear the tanks, and they 
	scramble out of the hatch.

153. VINE JUNGLE - OUTPOST PERIMETER - YAVIN

	The tank starts up with a loud roar, startling many Jawas 
	resting on the mighty vehicle.  Boma yells at the warriors 
	and they fall a few feet behind the tank, their shields 
	forming a shiny protective wall.

154. ROYAL OUTPOST - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN

	Several officers stand on a parked airtank trying to get a 
	better view of the operation.  A light landspeeder pulls up 
	next to the group and a general gets out.  The officers snap 
	to attention.

				 GENERAL
		Can you see anything?

				 OFFICER
		No, sir, but they've stopped 
		firing.

				 AIDE
		Communications still can't reach 
		them, sir.

				 GENERAL
		Does anyone know what's going on?

				 OFFICER
		I'm sure they've got them on the 
		run, sir.

	A lazerbolt flashes out of the jungle and destroys a guard 
	tower about a quarter of a mile from where the men are 
	standing.  Seconds later, the airtank on which they are 
	standing explodes into a million pieces.  Out of the jungle 
	rumbles the captured airtank, driven by Captain Valor and 
	followed by a column of Jawa warriors.

	Alarms sound, troops rush from the low block-houses, and a 
	battle rages inside the outpost.  Jawas with spears, axes, 
	and arrows mange to hold their own against the lazer weapons 
	of the stormtroopers.  Explosions erupt everywhere as the 
	Jawas begin to use captured lazerrifles.  They are much 
	fiercer fighters than the soft royal troops.

155. INTERIOR - AIRTANK - OUTPOST - YAVIN

	Captain Valor works the controls of the airtank as the general 
	watches the monitors and works the lazerguns.

				 SKYWALKER
		Swing left.  They're trying to cut us 
		off.

156. STARSHIP RUNWAY - ROYAL OUTPOST - YAVIN

	Captain Valor maneuvers the airtank in front of a line of 
	ten starships  cutting off a platoon of stormtroopers.  The 
	troops open fire on the tank  but are cut down by a group of 
	Jawas who have moved in behind them.  Han and A-2 run up to 
	the tank as Valor and the general climb out of the hatch.

				 HAN
		We've taken the main control center.  
		All power units have been shut 
		down.  They're helpless.

				 JUSTIN
		Have they found Zara?

				 HAN
		They've taken her back to Townowi.  
		The ship left nor more than ten 
		hours ago.

				 SKYWALKER (to Han)
		Set up a perimeter around these 
		starships.  Use as many men as 
		you need.

157. STAFF OFFICE - ROYAL OUTPOST - YAVIN

	Captain Valor and the general sit at a large table in the
	deserted office of the Royal Chief of Staff.  The room is 
	in a state of disarray;  papers are scattered everywhere. 
	A-2 stands on a chair, projecting an image of the "death 
	star" fortress orbiting Townowi, on the table top.

				 A-2
		... and are connected to the 
		central system by a series of 
		crossing networks similar to 
		section TB4 or F687.

	The projection switches to a close-up view of the transformer. 
	The general studies it carefully, then leans back in his chair. 
	A-2 turns off the projector.

				 SKYWALKER
		I'm not going to stop you, but I 
		think it's a reckless move. Even 
		if you could get in, you'd never 
		be able to get out.  Just be patient.  
		We now have enough ships to attack 
		in force.

				 JUSTIN
		But no pilots.

	Han and Boma enter the office.

				 HAN
		Still no contact with Huu Tho 
		or the kids.  I'm afraid some-
		thing's happened.

				 SKYWALKER
		Have Boma send two of his best 
		warriors out there to get them.

	Han relates this to Boma.  The general turns back to
	Captain Valor, who watches Boma leave the room.

				 JUSTIN (mocking)
		They're fierce warriors  but you'll 
		never teach them to fly.

	The general gives him a stern look.

				 SKYWALKER
		They'll fly  and Townowi will be 
		free.

				 JUSTIN
		May the force of others be with 
		you.

	The general embraces the young Dai.

				 SKYWALKER
		Bring her back safely.

158. OUTPOST RUNWAY - STARSHIP - YAVIN

	Captain Valor, dressed as an royal skyraider, and A-2 climb 
	aboard one of the giant four-man starships.  A crowd of 
	Jawas lead by Boma give a rousing cheer for the departing 
	Dai.  Valor breaks into a smile and waves to the joyous 
	warriors.  The general watches the proceedings from a bunker 
	turret.  He is lost in thought.

159. SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Three royal space transports dock inside the huge artificial 
	moon.  The smaller convoy starships circle the larger craft 
	until the three ships are safely inside the vast fortress.

160. CONFERENCE ROOM - INTERIOR SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	General Vader of the Royal Space Fleet, hurries down a hall-
	way, followed by a group of officers.  They enter the large 
	conference room where Zara is held under heavy guard.  She 
	appears well, but saddened.  Vader approaches her and bows  
	before her.

				 VADER
		I pray you have been treated honorably?  
		I am your servant, Darth Vader.  It 
		won't be long before we will be able to 
		return you to your people.  (to an aide)  
		Are the chambers ready?

				 AIDE
		They are working on it, sir.

	Zara stares defiantly at him.  She starts to speak, but a 
	powerful electric shock engulfs her body  and she whines 
	in extreme pain.

				 VADER
		Just relax, and everything will be fine.  
		(to guards)  Take her to section twenty-
		five.

	Zara is forcibly taken from the room.

				 VADER (to officer)
		What time do the doctors from Granicus 
		arrive?

				 OFFICER
		Sixty-five hours, sir.

				 VADER
		Put all security stations on alert 
		until they arrive.

	The officer salutes smartly and exits.

161. ROYAL OUTPOST - VINE JUNGLE - YAVIN

	A huge air tank rumbles along the approach to the royal 
	outpost.  The pilot sits on the main hatch of the tank, 
	talking to his crew by headphones.

				 PILOT
		Any contact yet?. It appears 
		deserted.  I don't like it.

	The tank enters the outpost perimeter and smoking rubble 
	from the recent battle comes into view   The pilot becomes 
	alarmed.

				 PILOT
		There has been an attack!  
		Reverse direction.

	The tank comes to a grinding halt  but before it can start 
	up again  it is surrounded by the Jawa army.  From out of 
	no-where a Jawa is on the back of the airtank and has the 
	pilot in a powerful armlock.

	A Jawa chieftan rushes from a bunker, followed by an excited 
	jabbering warrior.  They reach the captured airtank just as 
	the last crewman is hauled out  and little Oeta pokes his 
	head out of the hatch.  He is frightened.  His younger 
	brother Puck follows him out of the tank.  Below them, the 
	Jawas bully the captured crewmen.

				 PUCK
		What will they do to us?

				 OETA
		I don't know  but it don't look 
		good.

	C-3 pulls himself out of the airtank, followed by Han Tho 
	and his wife.  The Jawa chieftan climbs on board and starts 
	to jabber at the group   The Jawa carries on for some time 
	gesturing wildly and continually pointing at the sky.  The 
	two boys are too scared to say anything.  Finally, the Jawa 
	kneels before them.  C-3 politely returns a short bow.

				 OETA
		I don't get it.

	The Jawa rises and again gestures skyward, just then a starship 
	wildly buzzes the field, upside-down.  All the Jawas run for 
	cover.  The chief Jawa points to the crafts, and jabbers 
	incessantly.

162. INTERIOR - ROYAL STARSHIP - SKY OVER YAVIN

	Boma sits at the controls of a four-man starship.  His face 
	is a twisted combination of complete panic and an awesome 
	religious experience.  The general  sitting next to him 
	calmly switches a few buttons on the control panel, as Han 
	watches from the seat directly behind the Jawa.

				 SKYWALKER
		You'll get the hang of it.

	Han also gives the Jawa a few words of encouragement.

				 SKYWALKER
		Now, let's see if we can get into 
		orbit.  Push this, then ease her up.

	Boma follows the instructions  but pulls back on the lever 
	too fast and the ship being to vibrate and bounce violently. 
	Boma thinks it's funny and begins to laugh hysterically.  Han 
	becomes nervous and upset.

				 SKYWALKER
		Not so fast.  Back off!  Back off!

	Han yells at the Jawa, who can't respond because he is 
	laughing so hard.  The general pulls back on the lever.  Han 
	shakes his head and gives the general a worried look.

				 SKYWALKER
		Don't worry.  Ignorance is on 
		their side.

	Han is beginning to look a little sick.  He gets up and 
	rushes to the back of the ship.

163. ROYAL SPACE FORTRESS - DOCKING AREA - TOWNOWI

	The canopy on the starship pops open and A-2 and the young 
	Dai  disguised as a starraider, climb out onto the docking 
	platform.  An officer and two groundcrew approach him and 
	salute.  Captain Valor hands him his papers.

				 JUSTIN
		I'm here to check the vent ports in 
		the rim tracks.

				 OFFICER
		Your ship is from Yavin.  We've 
		lost all contact with them.  What's 
		going on out there?

				 JUSTIN
		There is a fierce invasion just east of 
		Bull Pup station.  It's really a mess 
		out there.

	The officer smiles and the ground crew starts to check out 
	the starship.  Valor heads for the main docking exit, followed 
	by A-2.  He remembers something as he passes the control 
	station and calls out to the officer.

				 JUSTIN
		Do you mind if I use your com-link?

				 OFFICER
		No.  Go ahead.

	Valor walks into the small control area and pretends to talk 
	on an intercom system.

				 JUSTIN (to A-2)
		Find the highest security area.

	A-2 punches his claw arm into a computer socket and the brain 
	comes to life, feeding information to the little robot.

	Captain Valor watches the officer as he directs the crewmen 
	in the securing of the starship.  A-2 removes his arm from 
	the computer and the duo leave the control station.

				 A-2
		Station 325 is the highest security 
		area on board.  It's a detention area.

	They disappear into a chamber lock hallway.

164. ELEVATOR TUBE - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Valor, trying to look inconspicuous, waits for a horizontal 
	elevator.  Troops and fortress personnel come and go, but 
	no-one seems to pay any attention to the pair.  Finally  a 
	small car arrives  and Valor follows A-2 into the podlike 
	vehicle  and it takes off through a vacuum tunnel.

165. DETENTION AREA - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Valor and A-2 enter a security station.  Guards and electronic 
	cutters are everywhere.  An officer approaches Valor and checks 
	his papers.

				 OFFICER
		The B-23 can't enter this station.

				 JUSTIN
		But I need him.

				 OFFICER
		Sorry.  No mechanical personnel. 
		It's restricted.

	Valor watches helplessly as A-2 is led into a waiting area.

				 OFFICER
		You may proceed  but you'll have 
		to be escorted.

	A trooper joins Valor and leads him through a series of 
	hallways.  Valor carefully surveys the area as he follows 
	the guard.

				 TROOPER
		Mathusians just beat the PDRs again.  
		They should be in another league.  Do 
		you follow the ecometrics?

	The guard turns to discover that Captain Valor has dis-
	appeared.  He is stunned, then manages to pull out a small 
	ring radio.

				 TROOPER
		Code six - alert.

166. STARSHIP RUNWAY - ROYAL OUTPOST - YAVIN

	Six Jawas sit before Han and the general, listening to Han 
	explain something about space fighting.  Tho approaches the 
	general.

				 THO
		We've made contact with the under-
		ground on Townowi.  Things are 
		tighter.  They can only get one 
		man out.  Datos is on his way.

				 SKYWALKER
		We should be ready by the time he 
		arrives.

	Han turns to the general.

				 HAN
		They're ready to go up.

	The general makes a short statement to the Jawas in their 
	own language.  They let out a loud cheer and run for the row 
	of starships.

167. STARSHIP - SPACE - YAVIN

	The general sits next to Boma as he leads two other Jawa- 
	piloted starships in a tight formation.  They head for a 
	small cluster of asteroids orbiting near the planet's surface. 
	The general quietly gives Boma some reassuring instructions. 
	Han leads a second formation of three ships, following Boma’s 
	group.  The two formations of starships make an attack run on 
	the asteroids.  The general watches as Boma lines up and fires 
	at an asteroid blowing it into a million pieces.  The general 
	smiles and slaps Boma on the back.  The Jawas excitedly 
	chatter among themselves over the intercom system.

168. DETENTION AREA HALLWAY - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	A patrol of ten men marches through one of the long hallways 
	in the detention area.  They stop at an intersection.  The 
	officer in charge reports on the intercom.

				 OFFICER
		Ben Five to Boma.  All clear.

	The troops relax; some stand in groups, others wander a
	distance away, poking into the various small alleyways 
	running off the main hallway.  One trooper notices a small 
	reflected light in one of the narrow corridors  and carefully 
	moves down the dark passageway to check it out.  Out of no-
	where, a fist knocks the trooper unconscious and drags him 
	into a small alcove.

	The officer finishes his report on the intercom and yells 
	for the troops to fall-in.  Men scurry in all directions 
	and out of a narrow corridor emerges Captain Valor, dressed 
	in the uniform of a royal startrooper.  He joins the platoon 
	and they march away.

169. GENERAL'S QUARTERS - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	General Vader and several officers watch the progress of the 
	search on TV monitors.  The general speaks into an intercom.

				 VADER
		Have them clear the area.  Bring 
		in the seekers.
		
	On the monitors the troops are assembled in the main entry-
	way and several small chrome balls are thrown into the hall-
	way.  Small antennae pop from the chrome surface  and the 
	small balls float down the hallways.  Dodona, once a proud 
	legionnaire, enters wearing the uniform of a stormtrooper. 
	He snaps to attention before the general and hands him a 
	report.  Vader gives Dodona a sly grin.

				 DODONA
		Contact has been lost with the ship 
		carrying the doctors from Granicus.  
		The princess' treatment will have to 
		be delayed.

				 VADER
		We've just trapped your old friend 
		Captain Valor.  Watch us accomplish 
		what you found to be impossible.

	Dodona is humiliated but stays at attention.  Vader gets an 
	emergency call on the intercom.

				 VADER
		Yes. Yes.  Put it on the view screen.

	One of the TV monitors switches to an image of the unconscious 
	trooper Captain Valor stripped.

				 VADER
		Get me the Captain of the Guard.

170  DETENTION AREA - MAIN ENTRY - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Three squads of troops, including Captain Valor, stand at
	attention in the main entrance to the detention area, while 
	the Captain of the Guard gets new orders over his head-
	phones.  Valor studies the situation carefully, looking for 
	a way out of his predicament.  The Captain of the Guard calls 
	up the platoon sergeants and gives them a series of orders. 
	They return to their squads and begin to inspect the troops. 
	Valor begins to get worried.

	The sergeant works his way down the line until he gets to 
	the trooper next to Valor.  He sees no chance of escape, but 
	surprise.  Suddenly, he bolts from the ranks and races down 
	the hallway.

				 CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD
		Squad leaders!

	Ten troopers break out of the ranks and take up the chase. 
	Captain Valor runs down a corridor and rounds a corner, 
	reaching a dead end.  The troops round the corner and 
	confront the trapped Dai.  The sound of igniting lazer-
	swords fills the hallway.  Valor takes a defensive stance, 
	his huge lazersword buzzing loudly.  The troops attack. 
	They fight with skill and bravery  but are eventually all 
	cut down by the invincible Dai warrior.

	Captain Valor breaks away from the troops and runs down a 
	long hallway.  A safety door slides shut, closing off his 
	escape.  He turns around in time to see another door seal 
	off the opposite end of the hallway.  Before he can make 
	any attempt to pry open the door, gas fills the sealed 
	corridor.  Valor collapses in a heap on the floor.

171. GENERAL'S QUARTERS - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Vader laughs as he watches the unconscious Valor on the TV 
	monitors.  All of the other officers in the room are laughing 
	and joking, except Dodona, who remains grimly at attention.

				 VADER (to Dodona)
		Take him to the special section.

	Dodona salutes, and exits the offices.  Vader laughs again.

172. STARSHIP RUNWAY - ROYAL OUTPOST - TOWNOWI

	Nine gleaming starships sit in a row along the edge of the 
	vast jungle runway.  Bizarre and colorful Jawa designs have 
	been painted across the large deflector fins of the space-
	craft.  Some designs transform the ships into huge and 
	grotesque animals, while others create unique mosaic patterns.  
	The four-man Jawa crews stand proudly at attention in front 
	of their ships.  The general, along with Han and the under-
	ground leader, Datos, review the assembled Jawas.   In one of 
	the Jawa crews, a pilot is picking fleas off the back of his 
	tail gunner.  When the general passes  he snaps to attention.  
	There is a gleam in the general's eye as he shows off his 
	strike force to the crusty old underground leader.  When 
	they've inspected the last starship, Datos turns to the 
	general.

				 DATOS
		I'm speechless.  It's amazing.  A 
		most impressive display.  For the 
		first time since the take-over, I 
		feel real hope.

				 SKYWALKER
		Will your people be ready?

				 DATOS
		Our forces have already started 
		sabotaging their com-link set 
		ups.  A refugee camp on Mananyo 
		has been conducting raids on 
		shipping from Granicus.  That's 
		how we intercepted those doctors.

				 SKYWALKER (to Han)
		Get them in the ships.  We're on 
		our way.  (to Datos)  Send the 
		code signal.

173. DETENTION CELL - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	General Vader and Dodona watch as a medic revives Valor, 
	who has been strapped to an upright slab protected by 
	cutter-rays.

				 MEDIC
		He's coming round.

	The medic backs away and throws the switch which activates 
	the cutters.  A blue glow surrounds Valor as he wakes up 
	and sees Vader and Dodona.

				 VADER
		For all the myths and the trouble 
		you don't seem like much.

	He laughs and leaves Dodona alone in the room with the young 
	Dai.  Dodona appears sad and frustrated at the capture of the 
	noble warrior.  They stare at one another for a few moments.

				 DODONA
		You were insane to come here.  The 
		security on this...this thing is 
		impossible.  Why?  For her?  I can't 
		believe your loyalty is that strong. 
		You're a great warrior, but you're a 
		greater fool.  This is a place for 
		androids - no codes, no honor.  Our 
		ways are useless here.  Why couldn't 
		you have stayed away?
		
	He storms out of the cell.  Captain Valor struggles to free
	himself.

174. SLUM DWELLING - GORDON SPACEPORT - TOWNOWI

	The young partisan, Occo, listens to a small transmitter in 
	a secret closet behind the main room in a slum dwelling.  He 
	jumps up and runs  into the main room  where Quist and 
	several other men are sitting around a table covered with 
	maps and plans.

				 OCCO
		It's Datos.  We've got the go 
		ahead.

	The men cheer and starts hugging and slapping each other on 
	the back.  Finally  they settle down.

				 QUIST
		Go to your organizations. (to Occo)  
		What's the code time?

				 OCCO
		Zero three thirty.

				 QUIST
		May the force of others be with you.

	The men solemnly shake hands and leave the room.

175. GOVERNOR'S OFFICE - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Captain Valor stands on a small platform before Governor
	Horus and the High Consul.  His hands are held behind his 
	back by electric bonds.

				 HORUS
		... and I'm sure the King will 
		enjoy your execution.  I only 
		regret I won't be there myself. 
		This should end the Dai Nogas 
		myth once and for all.  Take 
		him to Granicus.

	Dodona steps forward with a squad of stormtroopers and
	escorts the prisoner away.  Vader and the governor seem 
	very pleased with themselves.  Dodona looks back in disgust.

176. CONTROL CENTER - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	In the large central control room, two officers sit above 
	a row of monitors and giant readouts.

				 FIRST OFFICER
		Look!  That whole sector just 
		went dead.  We're losing contact 
		with the surface.  Use the IF 
		link and find out what's going 
		on.

177. DOCKING AREA - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Dodona halts the squad guarding Captain Valor on an 
	observation deck overlooking a starship docking port. 
	Dodona reports to the officer in charge.

				 DODONA
		Where is the ship?

				 OFFICER
		It's on its way in.  It will just 
		be a few minutes.

	Dodona returns to his squad and watches the large starship 
	slowly move into the docking area.  He glances at Valor, 
	who stands defiant, ready to meet his fate.

	Dodona continues to study Valor.  The young Dai returns his 
	gaze.  Slowly  the spacecraft locks onto the docking port 
	with a loud jolt.  The troops snap to attention  but Dodona 
	grabs two lazerswords and in one swift move  switches off 
	Valor’s bonds and tosses him one of the lazerswords.  Valor 
	assumes a defensive stance, as the troops realize what has 
	happened and draw their swords.

				 DODONA
		This way!

	The two warriors fight their way through a side exit.  The 
	door slides closed behind them, and Dodona throws the lock, 
	trapping the troops on the observation platform.  They race 
	down the hallway and stop at an intersection.

				 DODONA
		This way!   We can get a starship 
		and be out of here before they've 
		discovered...

				 JUSTIN
		I'm not leaving without the princess.

				 DODONA
		It's impossible;  there are traps 
		everywhere.  You're mad!

	Valor just grins and runs down the passageway leading to the 
	detention area.  Dodona rushes and catches up.  An alarm 
	signal wails through the hallways.

178. JAWA STARSHIPS - SPACE

	The general leads three squads of starships toward the glowing 
	planet of Townowi.

				 SKYWALKER
		There she is.  Activate your deflection 
		 shields.

179. DETENTION AREA - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Dodona talks with the Captain of the Guard.  He gestures wildly 
	like something important had happened.  Four troops run into 
	the central detention area leading the bound princess.  The 
	captain salutes Dodona and the legionnaire, followed by the 
	four troops and Zara, leave the main area.

180. DETENTION HALLWAY - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Valor appears boldly at the end of the hallway facing Dodona 
	and the troops.

				 DODONA
		Get him!

	The troops rush for Valor, swords drawn.  They are no match 
	for the skilled Dai.  He makes short work of them,  as Dodona 
	frees the princess.  The trio then run into another hallway. 
	The princess embraces Valor.

				 DODONA
		We have only a few seconds before they 
		find us.  All of these hallways are 
		sealable.

	Valor spots a small garbage chute on the corridor wall.  He 
	goes and looks into it.

				 JUSTIN
		Is this pressurized?

				 DODONA
		They're power sealed. We'll have to 
		find another way, or some way to shut 
		the power off.

	They search the smooth-walled room for another exit.

182. GOVERNOR'S QUARTERS - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Governor Horus watches General Vader as he supervises the 
	hunt for Valor and Dodona.  They watch troops move through 
	the detention area via TV monitors.  Seekers buzz through 
	the hallways.  The general gets a report from an officer 
	on another monitor.

				 OFFICER
		We've lost contact with the surface.  
		There is a good probability of an 
		uprising.  Even the IF links are out.

				 VADER
		Use a substandard relay and put all 
		units on alert.

	The officer disappears from the monitor and is replaced with 
	the Captain of the Guard.

				 CAPTAIN
		All sections D through P-12 are clear.  
		We have reason to suspect they escaped 
		through the disposal system.  We are
		checking.  (he is interrupted by an 
		excited trooper who tells him something) 
		We've found them in Receptacle B-29. 
		You should...

	A red light flashes on one of the other monitors.

				 VADER
		Hold on.

	A controller appears on the second monitor.

				 CONTROLLER
		Starships approaching, three squads 
		of royal design, but no clearance.

				 GENERAL
		Full alert.  Battle stations...

	The general turns back to the Captain of the Guards.

				 CAPTAIN
		You should have them on your 
		screen.

	Alarms sound throughout the fortress.  Lights flash a
	warning.

182. GARBAGE RECEPTACLE - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	A floodlight switches on  revealing Dodona and Valor 
	attempting to cut open the door.  The princess stands up 
	and stares into the floodlight.  Vader's voice comes over 
	an intercom.

				 VADER
		I'm afraid I have no more time to 
		deal with you.  A senseless and 
		futile attack by your friends has 
		forced me to take a rather un-
		pleasant course of action.  Your 
		execution will have to be expedited.

	The intercom clicks off and a loud rumbling begins to shake 
	the room.  With a loud shriek, the princess points to the 
	far wall;  it has started to move toward the trio.  The 
	situation looks desperate.

183. SPACE - JAWA STARSHIPS - TOWNOWI

	Lazerfire from the space fortress creates a wall of death, 
	which the three squadron of Jawa starships miraculously 
	emerge through undamaged.  The general barks orders to the 
	Jawa craft and Boma and his squadron break off and start an 
	attack dive.  Lazerfire from Boma’s brightly colored ship 
	hits one of the prime power terminals on the fortress sur-
	face.  It explodes, creating weird electric arcs as it goes.

	Han and the general also concentrate fire on the distinctive 
	black power terminals.  Two more are destroyed in an arcing 
	spectacle.  A chain reaction is set off, creating a series of 
	explosions leaping across the surface of the fortress from 
	power terminal to power terminal.

184. GARBAGE RECEPTACLE - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	The shock of the explosion can be felt over the rumbling of 
	the trash masher.  The wall has moved within a few yards of 
	squashing Dodona, Valor and the princess.  They are still 
	frantically trying to somehow stop the relentless wall, to 
	no avail.  The lights blink off, then on again  and the 
	moving wall rumbles to a halt.  Zara breathes a sigh of 
	relief.

				 VALOR
		They must have knocked the power 
		out.

	Dodona runs over to the door  and kicks it open.  They rush 
	out of the would-be death trap.

185. SPACE - JAWA STARSHIPS - TOWNOWI

	One of the Jawa starships is caught in a crossfire and dis-
	appears in a cloud of smoke.  Another ship for some unknown 
	reason dives headlong into the surface of the fortress, 
	creating a huge explosion.

186. MAIN HALLWAY - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Captain Valor, Dodona and the princess are thrown to a hallway 
	floor by the explosion.  They get up and start down the hall-
	way again.  A voice calls out from a connecting corridor.

				 A-2
		Hey!  Over there.
		
	The trio turn and see little A-2 standing at the other end of 
	the corridor.  He waves his claw arm at them and wobbles over
	to them.

				 A-2
		The power core has exceeded the 
		normal stress quotient by point 
		eight.  The magnetic fusion pods 
		have evaporated.  There appears 
		to be an immediate danger.

				 DODONA
		There is a lifepod station at the 
		other end of this section.  Hurry.

	The group followed by A-2, make a dash for the lifepod, 
	but are knocked to the ground by another explosion which 
	rocks the hallway.  A hole is ripped in one wall, sucking 
	debris into space.  Everyone holds on to wall fixtures for 
	dear life.

187. GOVERNOR'S QUARTERS - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	Aides and officers rush through the office, as Vader tries 
	to keep things under control.  Governor Horus remains calm, 
	watching the progress of the battle.  Vader turns to the 
	governor.

				 VADER
		They've pinpointed every terminal.
		It's impossible.  What are they?  
		Where did they come from?  An 
		electromagnetic transfer has started.
		There's no stopping it.

				 GOVERNOR
		Continue the fight.

				 VADER
		We've already lost control of the 
		planet.  We must abandon ship while 
		there is still time.  Conditions are 
		much worse than...

				 GOVERNOR
		Continue the fight.  This fortress 
		is invincible.  I will not give up.

	A giant explosion sweeps through the office.

188. SPACE - JAWA STARSHIPS

	The tiny starships race the chain reaction explosions across 
	the surface of the fortress.  Lazerfire is everywhere.  One 
	of the starships skimming across the surface lags behind and 
	is caught in an explosion and disappears.

				 SKYWALKER
		Han!  Get everyone out of here. 
		The whole thing's going to go.
		Return to Gordon.  Get them out.

	Han relays the order to the Jawas, and then starships pull 
	away from the crippled fortress.

189. MAIN HALLWAY - SPACE FORTRESS - TOWNOWI

	The group has made their way past the hole in the wall and 
	are climbing into the lifepods.  Captain Valor helps the 
	princess into one, while Dodona and A-2 get into the other. 
	Warning sirens scream throughout the hallways.  Three troops 
	run toward the lifepods, firing lazerpistols.  dodona returns 
	the fire, stopping the oncoming troops.  Hatches are closed 
	and the lifepods eject into space.

190. LIFEPODS - SPACE - TOWNOWI ORBIT

	The two lifepods drift toward the calm of the planet's
	surface.  Captain Valor and the princess embrace  and he 
	kisses her tenderly.  They watch the ominous fortress grow 
	smaller and smaller as they drift away.  Suddenly, a great 
	flash replaces the fortress and rubble streaks past the 
	lifepods.  Several giant explosions follow, then there is 
	only a smoke cloud where the mighty fortress once orbited 
	Townowi.

191. THRONE ROOM - PALACE OF LITE - TOWNOWI

	Queen Zara, in all her grandeur, sits on the magnificent
	throne of Townowi.  Captain Valor and the general stand to 
	her right.  Several old advisors stand to her left.  Han 
	presents Boma and a delegation of Jawas with a treaty, 
	gifts, and a medal of honor.  They bow and exit.  Han moves 
	to one side of the crowded court.  Dodona stands next to 
	him.  They watch as the two robots, A-2 and C-3 approach 
	the Queen and bow.

				 ZARA
		Your service to Townowi is greatly 
		appreciated.  You are designated 
		class A-4, and will serve Justin 
		Valor, the new Lord Protector of 
		Townowi.  Rise!

	The robots rise and exit through the long entrance hall to 
	the throne.  The Queen turns and smiles at Valor and the 
	general.  The general and Valor salute their new Queen.

										FADE OUT
