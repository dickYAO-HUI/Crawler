                           twenty years or unremitting hard-
                           ship and misery to reach the North
                           Pole, finally, in 1909.

                           It would have astounded Peary to
                           learn that, by the late 1950's
                           and early 60's, the vast, frozen
                           top-of-the-world he pioneered had

                           ...but also deep under the ice,
                           in the frigid, five-million-square-
                           mile depths of the Arctic Ocean.


            4     SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CARGO SUB STURGEON - DAY

                  The huge, heavy vessel glides smoothly along, between
                  underwater mountains, following the well-beaten Polar
                  route.

                            Here great passenger and cargo-
                            carrying atomic submarines glided
                            by the dozens, back and forth
                            across the Pole, until a series
                            of mysterious undersea disasters
                            threatened to close the Arctic
                            route forever.


            5     SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE SHOT - STURGEON

                  As it glides, very close, PAST CAMERA, so we can read
                  the name:  U.S.A.S. STURGEON (United States Atom Sub
                  Sturgeon) on the bow.  We may spot the closed-circuit
                  TV camera on the surface of the conning tower.

                                        NARRATOR
                            The decisive moment came May 3, at
                            1315 hours, when the undersea
                            atomic liner, Sturgeon, largest of
                            them all, reached 87 degrees, 10
                            minutes north latitude - only a
                            few miles from the North Pole it-
                            self!


            6     SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - UNDERWATER ICE CAVE - DAY

                  In the depths of it appears a distant, faint ball of
                  glowing light.  The ball begins moving toward CAMERA,
                  slowly, becoming larger and larger.  There may be a
                  FAINT, WEIRD ELECTRICAL HUM just audible from it.


            7     SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CARGO SUB STURGEON

                  It moves ahead, unconscious of impending doom, the Peep-
                  Peep of its sonar impulses now gradually increasing in
                  pitch, Doppler effect, as they echo back from the
                  approaching blob of light.


            8     SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER - DAY

                  Dimly seen, a vague, indistinct shape (thru this sequence
                  -- it approaches -- a huge, oval-shaped disc, with what
                  seems to be a revolving turret, or lighthouse, on top.
                  The Peep-Peep of the Sturgeon sonar has now risen to a
                  frantic scream, and the MAGNETIC, LOW-FREQUENCY HUM from
                  the saucer becomes louder and louder

                                                                      3.


            9     SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - PAN SHOT WITH STURGEON

                  The great atom sub glides past camera, but now, as we
                  are shooting from her stern over the bow, we see the
                  screws halt, then go into reverse, and she begins to
                  back away, back TOWARD CAMERA.  Then, in the b.g., we
                  see the saucer, the great, eerie 'eye' or whatever it
                  is, looming like a searchlight on her top, and the
                  oval shape seeming like a great mass of glowing energy.
                  The saucer is easily overtaking the reversed Sturgeon,
                  when:


            10    SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER

                  It moves to a position nearly filling screen, when...

                  A great bolt of sheer high-frequency energy - like an
                  undersea lightning bolt - stabs out from somewhere in
                  the saucer, and lances out TOWARD CAMERA.


            11    SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER AND STURGEON

                  The great, stabbing bolt of energy impinges on the hull
                  of the Sturgeon, and for an instant, the entire sub
                  seems to glow with radiant light.  Then, in closer de-
                  tails, we see the effects...


            12    SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - BOW OF STURGEON

                  It seems to melt away (or collapse) like a shell of
                  paraffin over a fire.  The water boils and hisses
                  about it.


            13    SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CONNING TOWER

                  The radio antenna, the periscope, the mast, the tower
                  itself - all seem to melt, and collapse.


            14    SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE STURGEON

                  What is left of the Sturgeon, glowing and hissing,
                  still red hot, begins rising to the surface, towards
                  the ice-layer.


            15    SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER

                  It reverses, draws back into the ice-cave from which
                  it issued.

            16    SPECLAL EFFECT SHOT - ABOVE ICE - DAY

                  And now, she seems to be rising in a tremendous crunch-
                  ing, grinding, writhing activity.  Finally, it breaks
                  completely, and for a moment, the red-hot hull of the
                  Sturgeon is visible in the cracking, grinding masses
                  of ice.  Then, a larger hiss of steam, and finally a
                  ROAR of earthquake volume, a fireball, then a mushroom
                  cloud.  The atomic reactor of the Sturgeon has blown up,
                  the ship is vaporized to nothingness.  As the atomic
                  cloud rises up toward camera...

                            war room.


            21    INT. WAR ROOM - DAY - MATTE SHOT - EST. SHOT

                  This room is, more than anything else, a system of maps
                  and charts - a huge detail of the Arctic ocean occupy-
                  ing an entire wall behind the conference table.  On it
                  are small, magnetic models of submarines, defense
                  stations, etc.  Also, to one side, is a huge globe of
                  the world, on a revolving stand.  File cabinets, rolled
                  maps and charts, shelves of references, navigation
                  guides, etc.  All business; no time wasted on decora-
                  tion.  There is an electric lock on the door; no one
                  can 'burst in' on the excuse of making a mistake.


            22    CLOSE SHOT - ADMIRAL TERHUNE

                  The burly, grim-faced Admiral, in uniform, is at the
                  head of the conference table.  There is an intercom
                  on a small stand beside his position at the table.  The
                  Admiral has a sheaf of reports and photographs, also
                  a stack of mimeographed 'briefs' at his elbow.  No
                  nonsense; Terhune speaks in clipped, brief phrases,
                  almost as if he has digested sentences down to short,
                  terse bursts before 'releasing' them from his lips.
                  The Admiralts lips are moving as we first see him,
                  but we do not hear his speech until the Narrator is
                  finished.

                                        NARRATOR
                            Admiral Terhune, in charge of the
                            Arctic Theater for the Joint Chiefs,
                            well knew the effect the 'leak' of
                            any of the explosive information
                            would have on the world civilian
                            population.  So the Admiral was
                            determined:  There would be no
                            leaks!

                 And now we see Admiral Terhune in the close f.g., and
                 the other participants of the meeting - DR. CLIFFORD KENT,
                 a practical, 'egghead' scientist, Chief of Scientific
                 Research and Weapons Development; SIR IAN HUNT, English,
                 winner of the Nobel prize for Oceanography, and Defense
                 Secretary Murdock, distinguished, white-haired.

                 There is a KNOCK.  Admiral Terhune presses the button,
                 the lock BUZZES, and the door opens.

                 COMMANDER WENDOVER steps inside.  He is a hard-bitten,
                 intelligent young-old man of about forty.  Years of
                 responsibility have made him older mentally than physically.
                 He is the highest type of the professional navy man, the
                 elite of the new craft, the atomic submarine.

                 They take their seats at the table.  Terhune indicates
                 a place for Wendover; meanwhile, he pulls a sheet of
                 paper from a file folder in front of him.  Looking at

            29    TIGHT GROUP

                  The Admiral looks up expectantly into the faces.

                                       ADMIRAL
                           Now we come to you, Dan.  You

                  The Admiral pulls a cross-section of the Tiger Shark
                  from his pile of documents, uses a pencil to indicate
                  his point as he says:

                   LIEUTENANT DAVE MILBURN, ex-Naval Academy halfback
                   and inter-collegiate boxing champion, hard-nosed and
                   trigger-tempered, is reluctantly taking leave from
                   Reef's party.  His pretty, placid wife, HELEN, is
                   indeavoring to get him through the open door and cut
                   his 'farewell scene' short.  Dave is slightly, but
                   not objectionably, high.  REEF HOLLOWAY, a handsome,
                   capable, relaxed Annapolis-type, is smiling amiably
                   and bantering with Dave, all the while trying to
                   usher him out with determined speed.  But it is not
                   easy to get Dave through the door.  He is chattering
                   constantly, in a lecturing tone, to someone inside
                   the apartment o.s.

                   sailor who only comes up for air and 'so forth'

                               chance!

                               Helen.  I appeal to you -

                                   (clutching Dave by both
                                    shoulders and staring him in
                                    the eye)
                               Dave!  Look at me!  I am the mother
                               of your three children!  Now please
                               take me home to them.  At once!

                   Dave smiles weakly, now feeling the drinks, bows
                   heroically to the room at large, and exits scene
                   under Helen's guiding arm.  Reef closes the door
                   behind them with an elaborate sigh, then CAMERA
                   PANS WITH HIM into scene with Julie.  She looks up
                   at him impishly and smiles:

                                        JULIE
                              Dave is exaggerating.  Just think, a
                              man spends three months in a deep freeze.
                              It'd take his whole shore leave just to
                              thaw him out.  By that time, he's ready
                              to report back!

            33-F   TIGHT TWO SHOT - BIG HEADS - REEF AND JULIE

                   In a deep, torried kiss on the couch.  Eyes closed,
                   they enthusiastically plumb the depths of feeling, then,
                   at last, reluctantly, they break apart.  Julie sighs
                   deeply.  Reef shakes his head, like a boxer who has
                   sustained a knockout punch, trying to clear it.  CAMERA
                   PULLS BACK for MED. TWO.  Julie, unable to speak for a
                   moment, throws a quick look at Reef, who seems to be
                   gulping for air, then she reaches for a cigarette from
                   a box on the coffee table.  She drops two or three as
                   she fumbles for one and finally gets it in her mouth.

                   Reef picks up a table lighter, strikes it, holds it to
                   her cigarette.  But his arm is trembling so he cannot
                   hold it steady.  Finally, Julie grasps his wrist, holds
                   the flame steady, then contrives to bring the tip of the
                   cigarette in contact with it.  She leans back, takes a
                   deep drag, only now dares to speak.

                                        JULIE
                                      (ruefully)
                               What was I saying...about thawing
                               out icebergs?

                   Reef manages a tiny smile.  Then he observes:

                                        REEF
                               You never can tell about ice-
                               bergs.  Only one-ninth above water.

                   Julie weighs this, then studies Reef appraisingly:

                                        JULIE
                               After that kiss - I'd say that's
                               about right.

                   Reef snuggles closer to her, slips an arm about her
                   waist, murmurs:

                            Are you kidding???

                  She takes a couple of rapid puffs, reaches for her
                  drink, takes a long pull at it.

                                   (staring off, as
                                   if to recall)
                            Isn't the next chorus something
                            about:  'Let's not waste one
                            precious golden moment - any

                            on the door, and -

                  Reef covers her mouth with his fingertips, murmurs:

                  He snaps his fingers.  Now Julie covers his lips,
                  murmurs with unmistakable import:

                                        JULIE
                            Then by all means, let's not
                            waste time!

                  And she kisses him - hard, enthusiastically.  Immedi-
                  ately, happ1ly, Reef enters into the spirit of the
                  thing.

                            What's that pounding?

                  Reef, eyes still closed, takes her hand, places it over
                  his heart.

                 And now Julie, looking over Reef's shoulder, sees an
                 envelope pushed under the door from the hall outside.
                 She reacts, taps him on the shoulder.

                                        JULIE
                                     (insistently)
                              Reef - look!

                 Reluctantly, he turns, sees the envelope.  He frowns at
                 her.  With extreme reluctance, he goes to the door,
                 stoops down, picks up the envelope, removes the contents.
                 Julie waits anxiously.

                 Suddenly, Reef grasps the significance, slaps his fore-
                 head in exasperation.

                                         REEF

                 She jumps up, goes over to him, grasps his wrist, looks
                 at the papers.  She, too, reacts, as Reef tragically slaps
                 his forehead again, looks regretfully at her - this lovely,
                 willing morsel.

                                         WENDOVER
                                     I did go.  Just back.

            42     PAN WITH WENDOVER TO SEAMAN

                                       WENDOVER
                             Tell Chief Griffin to report to
                             me as soon as the crew is aboard.

                   The seaman acknowledges the order and exits.

                                       WENDOVER
                                 (to Kent and Sir Ian)
                             My yeoman will show you to your

                                       SIR IAN
                             Thank you.

                   One of the seamen leads the way out bulkhead door
                   to the wardroom.

            42A    EXT. NAVY YARD - AT GATE (as in 40-A)

                   The seaman who reported Wendover's message is just
                   exiting scene.  Griffin is checking names off on his
                   roster as YEOMAN CHESTER TUTTLE, rumor-monger of the
                   Tiger Shark, approaches the Chief.

                                       CHESTER
                             What's the scoop, Griff?  Hauled
                             out in the middle of the night - all
                             leaves cancelled.  We goin' to war,
                             or what?

                                       GRIFF
                                    (logically)
                             Don't you worry, Chester.  When the
                             Skipper wants you to know what's going
                             on, he'll tell you.  Okay?

                                       CHESTER
                                    (not satisfied)
                             I don't like it.  This is all mighty
                             funny -

                                       GRIFF
                                    (non-commitally)
                             Isn't it, though?
                                    (then, motioning with his
                                     pencil)
                             Suppose you get aboard, anyway, huh?

                  Disgruntled, Chester passes through the gate, as Griff
                  checks him off on the roster and grins after him.

            43    INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

                  Here is the 'brain' of the sub - the controls, the
                  TV monitors, the sonar sets, the 'Christmas Tree' panel
                  of warning lights, etc.

            44    FULL SHOT - THE CON

                  Dave Milburn is already busy checking the equipment.
                  The other seamen are preparing the boat for sea.  Reef
                  turns to Wendover.

                                        REEF
                                  I think I'll stow my gear.

                  But Wendover, with a peculiar look, frowns, and says:

                                        WENDOVER
                                  I'm - afraid I have some bad
                                  news for you, Reef -
                                      (as Reef looks at him)
                                  You'll have to share quarters,
                                  this trip.

                            happen?

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (puzzled)
                            Huh?

                                   (cheerfully)
                            It'll be all right.  We're old
                            friends!

                  Now Reef is down below deck level.  Wendover turns
                  towards Dave.  Wendover shrugs helplessly.  Dave re-
                  turns it.

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (checking the plot
                                   board)
                            Get ready.  We shove off as soon
                            as Griff reports all the crew
                            aboard.

                                        DAVE
                            Right, Skipper.

                  He goes to work, as Wendover smiles peculiarly at the
                  bulkhead door through which Reef just passed.

                  HIM as he eases past a couple of seamen and arrives at
                  the entrance to the exec compartment.  He frowns as he
                  sees a sign by entrance.


            46    INSERT - CLOSEUP - THE SIGN

                  It is only stuck on by scotch tape, below the normal
                  exec sign.  It reads:  DR. NEILSEN.


            47    CLOSE SHOT - REEF

                  He hesitates only a second, knocks, then pushes drapes
                  aside.

                            I understand we'll be sharing

                                   (but then, his grin
                                   fades, becomes a look
                                   of disgust, loathing)
                            Carl!  You - !


            49    TWO SHOT - REEF AND CARL NEILSEN

                  CARL NEILSEN has the look of an ascetic - thin, sensi-
                  tive features, a nervous, intense manner - the 'egg-
                  head' appearance.  He turns, reacts to Reef's presence.
                  He is smoking a cigarette in rapid, nervous puffs.
                  Reef sinks, disgusted onto the bunk.

                                        REEF
                            I should have suspectcd, when
                            I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought
                            it was your father.

                                        CARL
                            It was supposed to be.  Dad had
                            a heart attack, two days ago.

                                        REEF
                                   (alarmed)
                            How is he - ?

                                        CARL
                            It was moderate.  He'll be
                            all right.
                                   (then)
                            But it was out of the question,
                            his coming along.

                                        REEF
                                   (disgusted)
                            And they thought you could re-
                            place the Skipper?

                  Carl displays a trace of anger for the first time.

                                        CARL
                            There was no choice.  Dad and I
                            developed the Lungfish together.
                            Except for him, I'm the only one
                            qualified to dive in it.

                            Not in two days.
                                   (then, earnestly)
                            Look:  Do you think I wanted
                            to come?  If it didn't mean
                            so much to Dad - proving his
                            depth-explorer - it's the last
                            thing I'd want!

                  Reef's lip curls contemptuously.  He mutters slowly,
                  angrily:

                                        REEF
                            That I can believe!

                  Carl drops his eyes at the intensity of Reef's stare.
                  He turns to his gear, begins unpacking his essentials.
                  Reef shakes his head vaguely, worriedly.

                  As they come in.  Reef stops, glares as he sees Carl,
                  sitting at one of the tables, making calculations on a
                  pad, sipping coffee.  Carl looks up, catches Reef's
                  eye.  Without a word, he finishes his coffee, picks up
                  his material, and goes out.  Dave watches this tableau
                  curiously.  When Carl is gone, Reef goes to the silex,
                  pours a cup of coffee for himself and one for Dave.
                  Dave joins him, puzzled.

            76    TWO SHOT - AT TABIE

                  As Reef and Dave sit down.  Dave shakes his head, be-
                  wildered.

                                        DAVE
                            I don't get it.  What's with
                            you two?

                  Reef sips his coffee.

                            - in World War Two.  He taught
                            us Engineering and Design.
                            Fought like a demon to develop

                            It broke his heart.  Then when some

                            sincere son of a war-mongering father' -

                 Dave looks questioningly at Reef.  Reef drinks his
                 coffee rapidly, then exits.

                  Chester and Powell are working on equipment for the
                  little sub, which is stored below the escape hatch and
                  will be used to launch it from the belly of the Tiger
                  Shark.

                  Reef enters, addresses the crewmen.

                            Sure, Mr. Holloway.

                            Matter of fact, he's much better.
                            He's left the hospital.

                  He hands the radiogram to Carl, who scans it eagerly,
                  relaxes, vastly relieved.  Then he frowns, puzzled.

                            Your father can be in Nome, Alaska,

                            'copter', and take you off, or the
                            Shark can put back into Nome...

                  Now Carl reacts angrily, hotly, for the first time.

                  the Tiger Shark had shattered a huge, infinite pane of
                  glass under water.  The SCENE JUMPS.  Reef looks around,
                  terribly alarmed.

                  Now there is the CLANGING of the GQ alarm, and over it,
                  Wendover's voice.

                  up the ladder.


            98    INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - MED. FULL - TOWARD INSTRUMENTS

                  Present besides the seamen are the Skipper, Dave, Dr.
                  Kent and Sir Ian.  The scene is bedlam - the Sonar is
                  screaming weirdly, the SHATTERING CRASHES are repeated
                  over and over, and the scene JUMPS WILDLY.  Dave points
                  at the view screen, yells:

                                        DAVE
                            The instruments have all gone
                            crazy!  And look at the view
                            screen!

                  The scientists peer over his shoulder, absorbed:

                  Kent's jaw sets tensely.


            99    SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - VIEW SCREEN AND INSTRUMENTS

                  This is a wild extravaganza.  The radar pattern is
                  jumbled, overlaid with a half-dozen wave-forms.  The
                  dials and lights flicker and glow with utter insanity.
                  And the view screen - it is a panoply of flashing, comet-
                  like streaks, jagged streaks resembling lightning bolts,
                  the while accompanied by staccato crashes, alarm bells,
                  shattering bolts of thunder-like sound.

                  As Reef comes scrambling up into the Con.

                  Wendover spreads his hands helplessly.  Kent is still
                  frowning at the view screen.

                                        KENT

                  He moves to the helm, begins AD LIBBING directions to the
                  helmsman.  Wendover displays crossed fingers to Sir Ian,
                  Kent and Dave.


            101   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - TIGER SHARK

                  (This may also intercut earlier dialogue)

                  It seems to be buffeted by an underwater storm.  The
                  scene is lit by underwater lightning bolts, crashes like
                  exploding skyrockets, the sub is tossed about like a
                  chip.  Finally, when it seems that nothing can survive
                  the electrical barrage, we see the nose tilt down steeply,
                  and the Shark glides deeper and deeper into the depths.
                  CAMERA HOLDS as it goes below frame.

                  As it noses deeper and deeper into the depths, the bolts
                  of lightning seem to follow it down, probing after it.
                  But at last, the bolts are left behind, the turbulent
                  waters are calm, the crashing noise subsides.  Then we
                  see that the sub is almost on the bottom.  At last, it
                  does touch and --

                  The others turn eagerly to Sir Ian.

                                        SIR IAN
                            It is rather fantastic -

                  Sir Ian hesitates.  Then, from beside his chair, he
                  picks up a large, rolled chart.  He unties the string
                  binding it.

                                        SIR IAN
                            Here is a chart of the Arctic
                            region.  On it I have plotted
                            every instance of these strange
                            phenomena - sinkings, electrical
                            storms, our own experiences...

                  He unrolls the chart on the table top.  Reef and Wendover
                  exchange a perplexed look.  Then they get up, come around,
                  peer down over Sir Ian's shoulder at the chart.  Sir Ian,
                  with a pencil, gestures on the chart.


            109   INSERT - CLOSEUP - THE CHART OF THE ARCTIC

                  And as Sir Ian's pencil moves, we see a circle of 'X's'
                  about the North Pole, equidistant from it, each marked
                  with a date, and, in print too fine to be read, the
                  circumstances.  As he points to one, in the Bering
                  Straits...

                            was lost just about this area.

                            miles from the Pole.  A line
                            through the points of occurrence
                            makes almost a complete circle...

                            I cannot accept the idea that
                            these phenomena were either
                            random, or natural.

                  The others react, Wendover and Reef exchange a look,
                  then Wendover explodes angrily:

                  remotely resembling a lighthouse beacon - seemingly the
                  'eye' of the thing.  Beneath it are some sort of pro-

                  group are Sir Ian, Carl, Reef, Dave and Wendover.  Sir
                  Ian leans back, holding the pencil, while his sketch
                  is passed around from one to the next.  With a faintly
                  amused expression, Sir Ian murmurs thoughtfully:

                            Just musing about our 'one-eyed
                            adversary' and the legend of
                            Homer.
                                   (to the group)
                            'Cyclopes' were the Sons of
                            Heaven, who forged the thunder-
                            bolts thrown by Zeus.

                            Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a
                            thunderbolt, itself!

                  Now Dr. Kent appears in the doorway, carrying a well-
                  filled briefcase, from which he has extracted a manila
                  folder.

                                        KENT

                            I knew there was something
                            familiar -

                  He puts down the briefcase, takes an 8 x 10 photograph
                  from the manila folder, then lays the folder aside.
                  He tosses the photograph on the table.

                            Take a look.

                  They peer at it curiously, then someone lays Sir Ian's
                  sketch alongside it.

                  And we see that the object in the photo - a 'flying

                                        KENT O.S.
                            The picture was taken by an
                            amateur astronomer, over

                            I've had it since I served
                            on the Air Force Evaluation
                            Board, for UFO reports.

                  As Sir Ian looks up inquiringly, Carl explains:

                            That was the popular designation.

                            in the sky - not under water?

                  Sir Ian picks up the photo, studies it as he reflects:

                            This would explain why there
                            were never any reports of land-
                            ings.  It's possible that who-
                            ever - or whatever - inhabits
                            the craft is not a land creature,
                            but a form of marine life.

            163   TWO SHOT - REEF AND WENDOVER

                  Wendover considers this gravely as Reef responds:

                            What you're getting at:  You
                            think our saucer-friend has
                            to return to the Pole, regularly
                            to....recharge his batteries?

                            That may be over-simplifying,
                            but---

                  He doesn't finish the sentence, obviously implying that
                  Reef's conclusion agrees with their own.

                                         KENT
                            Now:  Our present tactics are
                            hopeless.  But suppose we
                            could place ourselves between
                            Cyclops and the Pole....

                  as Sir Ian picks up Kent's thought:

                            ...'recharging his batteries'?

                            That's it, Reef!  We'll wait until
                            the next report of trouble.  Then
                            we'll lay on the bottom, right in

                  Dave is working over his navigation chart. The tension
                  in the Con is electric.  Dave takes a compass, swings a
                  pair of arcs on the chart, looks up to announce:

            182   (CONTINUED)

                                        GRIFF
                            Sounds like we mean business!

                  Reef doesn't deign to answer.  He gestures to Griff:

                                        REEF
                            Griff, you arm No. 2.  I'll
                            handle No. 1.

                  Griff nods, moves over to one of the panel boards and
                  starts manipulating it.  Meantime, Reef is doing the
                  same thing on another panel.

                  AND DETAIL

                  As the arming is finished, and Reef moves from dials.

                                        REEF
                            Load One and Two.  Then open
                            outer doors!
                                   (grimly)
                            And stand by for action!

                  Reef hurries to the far end of the torpedo room, and be-
                  gins climbing the ladder.  He glances back to see that
                  Griff and another man are manipulating dials to open
                  the inner tube doors.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:


            185   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - EXT. OF TIGER SHARK - CLOSE ON

                  as we see the outer doors slowly lift, disclosing the
                  torpedo warheads inside.


            186   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - PAST DAVE IN F.G.

                  Now Reef climbs up into the con, demands:

                                        REEF
                            You're sure it's Cyclops?

                                   (gesturing toward

                            Take a look.

                  Reef comes over, stares, fascinated, down over Dave's
                  shoulder.


            187   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - VIEW SCREEN

                  And now, in the TV screen, we can just make out the
                  faint outlines of the approaching saucer - the oval
                  shape, the glowing turret-eye.  O.s., Dave now sings
                  out:

            188   TWO SHOT - DAVE AND REEF

                  as they look down anxiously at the screen.  Now there
                  is a VOICE over the intercom:

            190   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE CYCLOPS - MOVING TOWARD CAMERA

                  Through an undersea valley, the Cyclops moves silently,
                  its glowing eye probing ahead for possible danger.


            191   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK

                  still lying silently, in wait.

            194   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OVER TIGER SHARK - AT CYCLOPS

                  This is the first tie-in shot, showing the relative posi-
                  tions of the two craft.  The Cyclops should still be a
                  considerable distance away - merely a glowing spot in the
                  water.


            195   INT. TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - PANNING OVER TENSE FACES OF

                  And on it, we see that Dave has adjusted cross-hairs for
                  the Target Zero.  The saucer moves across the view
                  screen, toward the Target Zero.

            197   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CYCLOPS

                  It looms huge and awesome IN CAMERA, now, sweeps by and
                  above CAMERA and o.s.  There is an awful RUSHING SOUND
                  as it sweeps overhead.

                  The Cyclops approaches closer and closer to the 'x.'

                            ....eight...seven.....six....

                  And now the Cyclops moves directly into the cross of the

            203   INT. TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - MED. SHOT - GRIFF AND OTHERS

                  as Griff moves swiftly, presses the firing lever, then
                  barks into intercom:

                            Number One fired!


            204   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON TORPEDO TUBE

                  as the first torpedo bursts out and speeds away toward
                  target.


            205   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - GROUP SHOT

            206   INT. TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - MED. SHOT - GRIFF AND OTHERS

                  Griff fires Number Two, then reports:

                            Number Two fired!


            207   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON TORPEDO TUBE

                  as the second torpedo shoots from its tube after the
                  first.


            208   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - TYING TIGER SHARK AND CYCLOPS

                  And now we see the two torpedos, executing a great
                  curving arc, 'homing' on their target.  They are
                  still a considerable distance from it.


            209   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON TWO TORPEDOS

                  as they WHOOSH BY CAMERA, speeding toward their target.


            210   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - TIGHT SHOT - ABOUT DAVE AND

                  Wendover checks his watch, demands of Reef:

                  Carl, the crew, Griff and others, all silently counting
                  the seconds.


            212   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER

                  Now the luminous eye seems to turn to observe the ap-
                  proaching menace.  There is a THROBBING BUZZ as of an
                  energy discharge, and then the first torpedo comes in
                  scene, seems to swerve to avoid the Cyclops, goes
                  plunging on past it and o.s.


            213   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - SHOOTING PAST DAVE - AT VIEW
                  PLATE - AT OTHERS

                  as Dave, agony and disappointment in his tone, calls:

                            Number One...Missed!

                  There is an AD LIB response of shock.  Then Wendover
                  complains to Reef:

                                        WENDOVER
                            How could it?  We were dead on
                            target, with a homing torpedo!


            214   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER - CLOSE

                  Now, from some vent within the vehicle, a cloud of radi-
                  ant, luminescent 'jelly' seems to stream out, enveloping
                  it in a protective cloud.  Just as the cloud is well-
                  formed about the saucer, obscuring its outlines...


            215   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON SECOND TORPEDO

                  It plunges through scene and off towards the saucer.

            216   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - AT SAUCER

                  as the second torpedo burrows into the protective cloud,
                  more and more slowly, probing vainly toward the still-
                  visible 'eye.'  Then...


            217   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON TORPEDO

                  as it buries itself in the mass of luminescent jelly.
                  The propellers thrash madly, ineffectually.  Then,
                  gradually, they slow down, and the torpedo is completely
                  surrounded by the mysterious mass.

                  down and stop, buried in the mass surrounding the saucer.

                                        DAVE (o.s.)
                            Skipper - look at this!


            219   TIGHT GROUP SHOT - LOW ANGLE - UP INTO FACES

                  as Reef, Wendover, Kent and Sir Ian cluster tightly
                  about Dave.  Carl enters from the hatch, joins them.

                                        DAVE
                                   (pointing)
                            A mass of jelly-like stuff came
                            out of the thing, and caught our
                            torpedo!

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (exclaims)
                            What???

                  Kent frowns, points.

                                        KENT
                            It must function like a de-Gaussing
                            field.
                                   (dubiously)
                            We'll never get a torpedo through
                            that!

                  Now Wendover's jaw sets grimly.

                                        WENDOVER
                            Maybe not a torpedo...

                  They look at him as he moves o.s. to the intercom.

            220   CLOSE SHOT - WENDOVER

                  as he barks into the intercom:

                            This is the Captain:  Blow bow

                            Soon as we're off the bottom,
                            I want all ahead, flank speed,
                            pronto!


            221   FULL SHOT - THE CONTROL ROOM

                  as Dave asks alertly:

                            What course, Skipper?

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (with grim purpose)
                            Right at our one-eyed friend!

                  There are AD LIB surprised exclamations from all.  Reef
                  is incredulous:

                                        REEF
                            Right at him?

                                        WENDOVER
                            That's what I said!

                                        REEF
                            But - what can we accomplish?

                                        WENDOVER
                            We can ram him!

                  The others exchange quick, frightened looks.  Dave is
                  incredulous.  Carl moves over to Wendover, admonishes
                  quietly:

                                        CARL
                            You've weighed the consequences,
                            Captain - the lives involved?

                  Reef glares at him.

                                        WENDOVER
                            Doctor -- I've weighed the lives
                            Cyclops has taken, already...and
                            will take, in the future, unless
                            we can stop him, now!

            221   (CONTINUED)

                                        CARL
                            We might find other means...

                                        WENDOVER
                            What other means?  If the Tiger
                            Shark can't destroy him, no power
                            on Earth can!  Now brave yourselves!

                  Carl subsides, catches Reef's eye, looks away.

            224   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK - ON BOTTOM

                  Now it begins to rise slowly from its bed in the depths.
                  Water pours from the ballast tanks.  Then, with the boat
                  floating free in the water...


            225   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE SHOT - SCREWS

                  as they begin to churn, picking up speed, then, finally,
                  churn the water into a foamy wake.


            226   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK

                  Like a great, predatory fish, it rises from the bottom,
                  moving more and more swiftly.  It makes a great climbing
                  turn directly TOWARD CAMERA, then goes overhead and out,
                  speeding toward the saucer.


            227   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - REACTION SHOTS - PRINCIPALS

                  They are all braced against the impending crash.


            228   CLOSE SHOT - WENDOVER

                  as he speaks into the intercom.

                                        WENDOVER

            230   INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - MED. FULL SHOT

                  as Griff AD LIBS orders for the men to lie in their
                  bunks, brace themselves against structural members,
                  etc.


            231   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - TIGER SHARK

                  It has climbed to a level with the saucer, now levels
                  off.  It is picking up speed.


            232   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - CLOSE SHOT - DAVE

                  He adjusts the TV view screen, tenses for the shock.
                  Reef appears just behind him.  They exchange a grim
                  look, then eye the screen, fascinated.


            233   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - THE TV SCREEN

                  Now we see the saucer looming up hugely, directly ahead.


            234   CLOSE THREE SHOT - WENDOVER, KENT AND SIR IAN

                  as we hear Dave's voice:

                            Stand by -- five seconds...four...
                            three...two...


            235   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - SAUCER AND TIGER SHARK

                  as they meet.  The Tiger Shark plows into the protective
                  jelly, which slows but cannot stop the juggernaut.


            236   CLOSER CUTS - TIGER SHARK

                  plowing into the protective jelly.


            237   FULL SHOT - THE CRASH

                  as the Tiger Shark, unstoppable, plows inexorably through
                  the protective coating, slams against the saucer itself,

            237   (CONTINUED)

                  then buries its bow deep within the Cyclops - like a har-
                  poon driving into a huge creature of the depths.  Perhaps
                  a third of the Shark's length is driven deep into the
                  saucer.  Tremendous RENDING, TEARING NOISES accompany the
                  crash, after which...complete, eerie silence.


            238   CLOSER CUTS - THE CRASH

                  As the bow rends the outer envelope of the saucer, the
                  screws of the Tiger Shark churn powerfully against the
                  restraining jelly...then a CLOSE SHOT of the Cyclops'
                  'eye' shows the glow diminishing.


            239   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OVER

                  And we see the situation, that the nose of the Shark is
                  buried deep within the saucer.

                                        DAVE
                                   (triumphantly)
                            We got him, Skipper - drove right

            240   GROUP SHOT - ABOUT DAVE - UP INTO FACES

                  as Wendover manages a grim, satisfied smile.  Kent and
                  Sir Ian eagerly check the view plate, and the gauges.

                                        REEF
                            Speared him like a fish!

                  Wendover moves to the intercom, announces:

            243   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - TIGER SHARK AND CYCLOPS

                  Jammed together, they are sinking slowly in the water.


            244   CLOSER SHOTS - THE PROPELLERS

                  Overcoming the initial resistance of the jelly, they
                  begin slowly turning.


            245   FULL SHOT - TIGER SHARK AND CYCLOPS

                  It is obvious, now, that they are headed for the
                  bottom.


            246   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT

                  The room seems to vibrate as the mighty atomic reactor
                  turbines exert full power on the propellers.  Then Reef
                  shakes his head, discouraged.

                                        REEF

                  as Wendover, momentarily puzzled, remarks:

                            pulling the Shark and Cyclops
                            right to the bottom.

                                   and order)
                            Stop engines!

                  Reef repeats the command into the intercom:

                  sinking through the water, pulled lower and lower by
                  the Shark's engines.  Now the propellers stop.  The
                  two craft still continue sinking, but more slowly now.

                            lying here, waiting to die!

                  Now Reef explains an idea he has been toying with:

                                        REEF
                            Suppose there's an atmosphere,
                            of some kind, inside Cyclops?

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (blankly)
                            What?

                                        REEF
                                   (to the group)
                            If we could get inside the saucer
                            - use our torches - maybe we could
                            cut the Shark loose?

                                        SIR IAN
                            That's all very fine, young man.
                            But how would one go about get-
                            ting inside Cyclops?

                  Reef takes a deep breath, throws a glance at Carl, then
                  says:

                                        REEF
                            Through the eye - with the
                            Depth-Explorer!

                  Carl seizes this eagerly.

                                        CARL
                            Yes - the Explorer was built to
                            operate at even greater depths --

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (disturbed)
                            But suppose there isn't an atmos-
                            phere inside the saucer?

                                        REEF
                                   (bluntly)
                            Then the idea's no good.  But
                            we're no worse off than we are
                            right now.

                  Dave picks this up eagerly.

                                        DAVE
                            You've got to let us try, Skipper --

                                        DAVE
                                   (ignoring him)
                            Reef and I can take the Explorer
                            down, clamp it around the eye,
                            and ---

                                        CARL
                                   (firmly)
                            No, you can't.  But I can --
                                   (to Reef)
                            I can deliver you to the eye.
                            Then you --

                            to ban flying saucers!

                  Carl bridles angrily.

                                        CARL
                            That's enough, Holloway.  I've
                            told you before, wearing boards
                            on your shoulders, and parading
                            with a stiff spine doesn't auto-
                            matically endow you with back-
                            bone - !

                                        REEF
                            - any more than being the son
                            of Captain Neilsen does!

                  Wendover is watching this exchange with growing dis-
                  pleasure.

                                        CARL
                            However our ideas disagree, as
                            I've said before, I'm not a
                            coward!  And it happens you've
                            got no choice:  Either I take
                            you down there, in the Lungfish,
                            or you don't get there -

                                   (bitterly)
                            I'd sooner swim!

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (snaps)
                            That's enough, Reef! Both of
                            you!
                                   (to Reef)
                            It so happens Dr. Neilsen's
                            right.  The odds are long
                            enough, without making them
                            longer.
                                   (he turns to Carl)
                            Get the Explorer in the airlock,
                            ready for launching.

                  Carl nods.  Throwing a final look at Reef, he goes to
                  the passage way, climbs down.  Wendover turns back to
                  Reef, suggests:

                                        WENDOVER
                            You better take Powell and

                            With their underwater experience,
                            they'll be invaluable.  Take
                            sidearms, and flare pistols --

                            Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (holding up crossed
                                   fingers)
                            We hope!

                  Wendover holds out his hands, shakes both theirs.
                  Reef turns to Dave.

                            Let's get ready.

                  They head for the passage way and exit.  Wendover looks
                  at Sir Ian and Kent, shakes his head solemnly.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

            253   INT. TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - AT AIRLOCK

                  We see the single hatch open, in which the Depth Explorer
                  has been mounted.  Carl, in a jumper and helmet, waits
                  by the step with Powell and Carney, dressed in their
                  rubber suits, with helmets and face plates.  They carry
                  breathing apparatus.  Behind them, Dave and Reef appear,
                  dressed similarly, carrying their equipment - portable
                  torches, a bag of tools, sidearms, flare pistols, and...
                  in Dave's case...a machine pistol (burp gun).  Over
                  this:

                            hour.  At 1100, everything was
                            ready for this last, desperate
                            attempt.

                  Now the four men join Carl at the airlock.  Carl is
                  tense, tight-lipped.  Reef frowns, concerned.

                                        REEF
                            There's still time.  You could
                            show me how...?

                  Carl shakes his head firmly, gestures toward the hatch.

                                        CARL
                            Get in.

                  the action of the five men climbing down hatch (into
                  Explorer).  When all are inside, Griff steps forward,
                  closes the hatch.  Then he closes the airlock, and
                  goes to intercom.

                  Wendover glances once at Kent and Sir Ian.  Then he
                  moves to the mike.

            256   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - BELLY OF TIGER SHARK

                  Now we see the lock door slide open.  A moment later,
                  the Depth-Explorer moves out through the opening, like
                  an animal being born.  It hovers for a moment, just
                  below the Shark.  Then it maneuvers o.s. towards the
                  Cyclops.


            257   INT. DEPTH-EXPLORER - DAY - TIGHT - (AND WE MEAN TIGHT)
                  GROUP SHOT

                  Carl operates the controls.  The five men are wedged in
                  shoulder to shoulder.  Reef makes a gesture of direc-
                  tion.  Carl nods, complies.


            258   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE CYCLOPS

                  Now the Depth-Explorer moves into frame, drifts directly
                  toward the great 'eye' - which still has a faint glow.


            259   CLOSE SHOT - AT CYCLOPS' EYE - SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT

                  The Depth-Explorer moves up with its hatch clamped
                  magnetically, directly over the eye.


            260   INT. DEPTH-EXPLORER

                  Reef nods.

                                in case.

                  The others all apply oxygen tubes to their mouths, go
                  down hatch, Reef picking up a large tool like a wrecking
                  bar.

           260A   UNDER HATCH

                  Reef and Dave come down hatch into scene.  We see the
                  iris and Reef goes to work on it with the tool.

                                                               WIPE TO:

                  as Reef's tools batter at it.  Suddenly, it gives away.

           262    SHOOTING AT EYE

                  as, suddenly, it SEEMS TO OPEN, LIKE A CAMERA IRIS,
                  leaving a circular opening, big enough to crawl through.

           262A   REACTION - DAVE & REEF

                  Now Reef sniffs at the atmosphere that pours in from
                  the saucer.  Surprised, enthused, he removes his oxygen
                  tube, breathes deeply.

                             You all wait here.  I'm going inside,

                  Though we see nothing of its construction at this
                  point.

          276A    INSERT - CLOSE SHOT - PROBING SPINES - TRICK SHOT
                                                   (SPECIAL EFFECTS)

                  The black, catfish-or-sea urchin-like spines seem
                  to rise from limp supineness.  They stiffen, grope
                  like fingers, move towards a series of grommet-like
                  openings in the translucent wall of the sphere.  Now
                  a spine nears a grommet, slips into it, apparently
                  making 'contact', for somewhere, a FAINT LIGHT comes
                  on, and the scene becomes lighter.  In a moment,
                  another spine slips into another grommet-hole.

                  To an accompanying tympany BEAT, a LIGHT SPOT, appears.
                  A moment later, another drum beat, another LIGHT SPOT.
                  (Note:  This business may continue behind subsequent
                  dialogue - more beats, more lights coming on)

                  As Reef continues working with the torch.  Dave pushes
                  up his goggles, reacts, surprised.  He taps Reef on the
                  shoulder.

                                        DAVE
                            Hey - you know somethin'?  It's
                            getting lighter in here!

                            You know - it is?

                  Now they give a sudden lurch.  Dave looks down at his
                  feet, then into Reef's face.

                                        DAVE
                            And if I didn't know better - I'd

                  A grim reaction, all around.

                  as, now, the last of them contact their proper control
                  points, and a complete circuit of lights FLASHES ON.
                  The LIGHT INTENSITY rises.


            282   INT. CHAMBER SECTION - DAY - GROUP SHOT - THE MEN

                  working on the ram.  Now, with a final cut with the
                  torch, there is a CLANG, A RINGING SOUND, and then
                  the ram drops free.

                            can pull clear!

                  Now, we hear a weird, mechanical voice:

                            Commander Holloway!  Listen!

                  Reef reacts.

                                        REEF
                            You hear that?

                            The sound again?

                  Now the voice repeats:

                                        SAUCER-VOICE
                            Commander Holloway.  Make no

                            A voice, this time.  It spoke
                            my name!

                  Reef draws his gun and Dave raises his machine gun.

            284   MED. GROUP SHOT

                  And now the voice comes from another quarter:

                                        SAUCER-VOICE
                            You will see that avails nothing!

                  Reef looks around, startled.


            285   PAN SHOT - WITH POWELL

                  His nerve is going.  He edges away from the group, then
                  turns to bolt out of scene, heading for the Depth-
                  Explorer.  But just as he takes his first steps...

                  As he stumbles through the darkness.

          286A    FLASH OF LIGHT

                  A flash of light comes down at Powell from somewhere.

          287     CLOSEUP - POWELL

                  The light envelops him, and he cringes.

                                      POWELL
                               Carney - help!

                  Reacting to Powell's cry.

                  Carney moves o.s.

          287B    CLOSEUP - POWELL - MAKEUP SHOT

                  We see the horrible effect of the light on his face.

          287C    TRICK EFFECT - POWELL SHRIVELLED - PRODUCTION SHOT

                  Powell is shrivelled by the light.  The last thing we
                  see of him is...

          287D    TRICK EFFECT - POWELL'S HANDS - SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT

                  They disintegrate to Jelly, and Powell is completely
                  gone.

          288     PANNING WITH CARNEY

                  As he reaches the spot where Powell was killed.  He
                  reacts, horrified.

          288A    PANNING WITH CARNEY

                  As he moves away hurriedly.

          288B    PANNING WITH CARNEY

                  As he turns, from the blackness, a burst of steam
                  issues forth into his face.

          288C    CLOSEUP - CARNEY

                  He screams as the steam envelops him and sinks out
                  of scene.

                  They come clambering down the ramp, reach the platform
                  level.  Then, awed, they look around them.


            291   EST. SHOT ON FLOOR (PLATFORM) - CAVERNOUS INTERIOR -
                  BACK AT TINY MEN ON PLATFORM - MATTE SHOT

                  We see a long, slender bridge, or catwalk, extending
                  out into space, apparently reaching toward a great,
                  opalescent sphere that seems to hang suspended on
                  cushioning points, some sort of shock-absorbing system,
                  in the very center of the saucer.  A weird GLOW, seem-
                  ing to become ever brighter, emanates from inside this
                  sphere.


            292   TWO SHOT - DAVE AND REEF

                  Awed, round-eyed, silent, they stare open-mouthed at
                  the sight.  But before they can make any comment...

                            The voice again?

                  But Reef is too intent on the voice.  Now he begins dis-
                  arming as Dave looks incredulous.

                                        DAVE
                            What're you doing?

                  Now, at the very tip of the spine-bridge, an IRIS
                  OPENING appears in the side of the sphere.

                  Reef has a distant look as he hands his weapons to

                                   (flaring)
                            Oh it does???

                  Reef moves o.s. toward the bridge.  Dave waits, very
                  unwillingly.


            295   INT. SECTION OF BRIDGE - LEADING TO SPHERE - DAY -
                  REEF - ONTO BLACK

                  He inches his way tortuously across the slender support,
                  toward the iris opening.


            296   MATTE SHOT - BEHIND REEF - TOWARD SPHERE

                  He crawls cautiously towards the opening.


            296A  INT. PLATFORM - BLACK BACKING - DAY - CLOSE SHOT - DAVE

                  Angry, impatient, he sets Reef's weapons down.  Then he
                  clutches his submachine gun, watches Reef o.s.


            297   INT. SPHERE - DAY - MED. SHOT - FROM INSIDE - IRIS
                  OPENING

                  Now Reef appears, crawls cautiously up into the opening,
                  then stands, looks inside.  His eyes nearly start from
                  his head as he takes in the incredible sight.


            298   TRICK SHOT - FROM REEF'S P.O.V. - INTERIOR OF SPHERE -
                  SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT

                  His eyes range over the ceiling of the glove, then as he
                  shifts his gaze to the bottom of the sphere, we see 'it'
                  - a horrendous organism, like a giant sea urchin, the
                  long, black, writhing spines now all in proper contact

                  with their grommet-sockets.  And out of the center of
                  the pulsating central 'body' rises a long stalk, and on
                  the very tip of it a great, glowing 'eye.'  The setup
                  is like a monstrous rendering of the eye of a snail.


            299   MATTE SHOT - UP PAST 'EYE' AT REEF IN IRIS

                  So he appears a tiny, miniature man compared to the
                  cavernous size of the sphere.  And now, apparently
                  from the 'eye' itself, which seems to flicker and
                  glow like an electron beam spectrometer, comes the
                  saucer-voice again:

                            you Earth inhabitants would
                            express it - we meet 'face to

                  He cannot contain himself any longer, is now crawling

                  Now, to Reef's consternation, Dave suddenly appears be-

                            What - ?

                  Then, Dave's mouth drops open, and he stares, incredulous.

            300G  TWO SHOT - DAVE AND REEF

                  As Dave, before Reef can stop him, steps forward
                  belligerently, levels and submachine gun down at the
                  creature.

                                        DAVE
                                   (menacingly)
                            So this is 'headquarters,' huh?

                            you....

                  And he looses a burst with the sub-machine gun, so that
                  we don't hear the appropriate name.

            306   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE 'EYE' OF THE ORGANISM

                  an unearthly, shattering WAIL from the organism itself.


            307   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON 'EYE'

                  as the flare burns a hole in the iris, and the water,
                  or whatever it contains, seems to drain from it, like
                  a plastic bag when it is torn.

                  He reacts quickly, astonished at the effect of his

                  back out.  SCREAMS OF PAIN from the creature follow
                  him.


            309   INT. SECTION OF BRIDGE - DAY - FAST PAN - WITH REEF

                  Heedless of the danger of falling, he scrambles madly
                  back across the bridge.  Beams of the death-dealing
                  light just miss him as he goes, and SCREAMS from the
                  wounded creature shatter the cavernous silence.

                  He reaches the platform, races madly for the ramp.
                  Beams of light again just miss him.


            310B  PANNING WITH REEF - UP RAMP

                  And suddenly, as he reaches the iris, he YELLS with
                  pain, his foot caught in the iris.

         312      INT. DEPTH-EXPLORER - DAY - AT HATCH WINDOW - OVER
                  CARL'S SHOULDER

                  Carl reacts as the iris begins closing.  Quickly, he
                  grabs a crowbar, or other prop, wedges it into the
                  iris, holding it open momentarily.  A moment later,
                  Reef literally hurls himself into the little sub,
                  slams the hatch behind him, and exclaims:

                                    REEF
                             Back to the Shark - right
                             now!

                  Carl does not hesitate, begins working the controls.

                                    CARL
                             What about Dave - and the

                            'Fortunes of War!'

                  Carl frowns.  Now Reef grasps the radio microphone, says
                  quickly:

                            This is Reef, Skipper -- in the
                            Depth-Explorer.  Don't wait for
                            us - start engines, and pull loose!


            313   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

                  as Wendover nods, responding to the radio message.

                                        WENDOVER
                            All right, Reef.

                  He turns to the intercom, orders:

                                        WENDOVER
                            Reactor Room!  This is the Skipper!
                            I want all reverse full-emergency

            314   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK PROPELLERS

                  They begin to turn, slowly at first, then picking up
                  speed.


            315   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - SHARK AND DEPTH-EXPLORER

                  It moves away from the saucer, back up through the water
                  to the belly of the Shark, at the airlock.


            316   INT. LOWER CHAMBER OF SAUCER - DAY - SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT
                  - CLOSE ON 'EYE'

                  And now we see, through a SERIES OF DISSOLVES that the
                  eye is healing - restoring itself, like a balloon being
                  blown up (maybe this would do it).


            317   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE 'FINGERS'

                  Purposefully they probe into the 'circuit' apertures,
                  and the power lights begin to glow radiantly.

            318   INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - AT AIRLOCK

                  As Griff superintends preparations to open the lock door,
                  the men from the control room - Wendover, Kent and Sir
                  Ian, hasten in.  Now Griff cracks the hatch on the lock
                  door, and in a moment, Reef staggers out, then helps Carl
                  from the Explorer.  Wendover frowns, glances inside:

                                        WENDOVER
                            What about --- ?

                  Reef only shakes his head.  Faces are tense, then Reef
                  declares bitterly:

                                        REEF
                            We didn't kill it, Skipper.  And
                            if it ever gets...back where it
                            came from...the Earth is doomed,
                            and everything and everybody on it!


            319   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - TIGER SHARK AND SAUCER

                  And now, the mighty engines of the Shark succeed - the
                  bow of the Shark pulls out of the hull of the saucer,
                  and the two vehicles float freely in the water.


            320   INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - GROUP SHOT

                  The scene JUMPS AND LURCHES.  Then there is an exultant
                  voice:

                                        VOICE
                                   (over intercom)
                            We've pulled loose, Skipper!
                            We're free!

                  Wendover and Reef exchange an exultant look.  Then they
                  turn and run out toward the ladder to the con.  Kent,
                  Carl and Sir Ian follow more slowly.


            321   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

                  As Wendover and Reef come scrambling up the ladder and
                  through the hatch, the man at the helm indicates the TV
                  screen.  Wendover and Reef peer eagerly at it.  Wendover
                  smiles tightly.

            322   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - THE TV SCREEN

                  And we see the saucer floating loose in the water.  But,
                  suddenly, with a tremendous burst of speed, the saucer
                  moves away through the water, so rapidly as almost to
                  become a blur.

                                        REEF (o.s.)
                                   (despairingly)
                            There it goes!


            323   UP INTO FACES OF REEF AND WENDOVER

                  as Reef adjusts the dials of the screen, and Carl, Kent
                  and Sir Ian appear behind them.

                                        REEF
                            Straight to the Pole - at almost
                            fifty knots!

                                        WENDOVER
                            Nothing we can do, now.

                                        KENT
                            Excuse me, Captain - there may
                            be one last, desperate chance -
                            a one-in-a-thousand shot...

                                        WENDOVER
                                   (desperately)
                            Anything ---

                                        KENT
                            It's possible I could adapt one of
                            the torpedo guidance systems to the
                            ICBM - so it would 'home' on the
                            saucer when he rises from the Pole.

                                        WENDOVER
                            What about time...?

                  We see a round, black hole of open water in the ice
                  field.

                            What's the corrected bearing

                  Wendover sets a knob on the screen, peers at it again.


            330   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - POV

                  All we see is fields of ice and snow.  Finally the cross-

            331   MED. SHOT

                  as Wendover gestures toward the controls.

                  Reef nods, looks at TV screen.  Wendover moves to the

                            Well, that's all we can do --
                            until our space-friend decides
                            to blast-off.


            332   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK

                  And now, on the bow, we see the mighty ICBM lift from a
                  recess on the deck, in front of the conning tower.  It
                  stands on end in its cradle, ready.

                                                          WIPE TO:


            333   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - MED. TWO SHOT - REEF AND
                  WENDOVER

                  Reef's eyes on screen.  Wendover waits tensely.
                  Now Reef reacts.


            334   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - THROUGH SCREEN -
                  THE ICE

                  Suddenly, a phenomena like an undersea volcano rising.
                  The ice rends and cracks, rises in a great bulge.


            335   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE ICE

                  It breaks up, boils, tremendous rending, tearing NOISES.
                  Then, from the depths of the water below, a familiar oval
                  shape - smooth, glittering, beautiful - surmounted by the
                  gleaming cyclops eye appears.  The saucer rises from the
                  water like a great porpoise, hovers just above the ice,
                  then begins rising slowly into the air.


            336   INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - REACTION SHOT - WENDOVER AND
                  REEF

                  as Reef exclaims excitedly:

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                                        114.


            336   (CONTINUED)

                                         REEF
                            Skipper - I think - it is!
                            It's Cyclops!

                  Wendover pushes him aside for a quick look himself.
                  Then, he leaps for the intercom, barks:

                                         WENDOVER
                            This is the Skipper!  Fire!
                            Fire!


            337   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK

                  Now we see a discharge like compressed air below the
                  ICBM.  It floats up and away from the Shark, in a ver-
                  tical position.  Then, straight as an arrow, it heads
                  for the surface.


            338   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE HOLE IN THE ICE

                  Now, from the black water, the ICBM leaps into-the air,
                  like a suddenly released, air-filled ball.  As it leaps
                  above the surface, the mighty rocket engines ignite with
                  a ROARING BLAST, and the ICBM leaps high into the air,
                  roars up o.s.


            339   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - WITH ICBM

                  It rises higher and higher, faster and faster, into the
                  sky.


            340   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER

                  It, too, is moving faster and faster, on what should
                  appear to be a converging course with the missile.


            341   SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SKY

                  This is the 'money' shot - to make or break the picture.
                  In one corner of the frame, the saucer rises swiftly.
                  But as it moves to center frame, in from the opposite
                  corner comes the ICBM, heading straight and true for the
                  saucer.  They meet.

                  The explosion is tremendous - a mighty, nuclear fireball,
                  great chunks of debris hurled sizzling into space in all
                  directions, a booming, pounding after-shock wave, then a
                  great sweeping mushroom cloud.  After this.....nothing
                  but empty sky.

           342    CUTS TO COVER - THE PHENOMENA ABOVE

           343    INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - REACTION SHOT - PANNING
                                               ALL THE PRINCIPALS

                  The shock, the exultation, the relief, then the
                  sagging easement of tension...it is beyond words.
                  Wendover looks at Kent, with a look more eloquent
                  than an hour speech.  Sir Ian's eyes are misty with
                  gratitude.  Carl begins trembling with reaction, and
                  Reef puts a comforting arm around him.  Griff sags
                  onto a stool, head down, just moving his head aimlessly
                  from side to side.  Reef and Wendover exchange a look
                  of silent understanding.

                                                     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

           344    EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT - LONG UP SHOT - THE NIGHT SKY
                    (STOCK)

                  on a moonless night, the stars glinting and sparkling
                  like billions of distant diamonds.

           345    SHOT - BOW OF SUBMARINE - SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT

                  as it swishes through the water on the homeward voyage.

                                                           DISSOLVE:

           345-A  STOCK SHOT - NAVY YARD - NIGHT (as in 38A)

           346    EXT. NAVY YARD - NIGHT - TWO SHOT - REEF AND CARL

                  As they slowly walk away from the o.s. submarine towards
                  the gate.  Carl looks thoughtfully up at the sky as he
                  stops for a moment.

                                       CARL
                              They're so remote - cold - beautiful,
                              the stars.  But now - I wonder -

                                       REEF
                                     (smiling fondly)
                              Yes?

                                       CARL
                                     (whimsically)
                              Which is the one - we have to worry
                              about?

                  Reef also looks up at the sky thoughtfully, shakes
                  his head.

                                        REEF
                            Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their
                            ship doesn't return - they'll
                            decide not to come here, after all.

                                        CARL
                            But if they do?

                                        REEF
                                   (soberly)
                            I don't know.

                                        CARL
                                   (a slight smile)
                            I wouldn't worry.  So long as we
                            have boats like the Tiger Shark -
                            and people like you, the Skipper,
                            Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -

                                        REEF
                                   (smiles)
                            And his 'egghead' son!
                                   (he punches Carl's
                                   arm jovially)
                            We'll give 'em a rough reception,
                            won't we?

                  They go out.
