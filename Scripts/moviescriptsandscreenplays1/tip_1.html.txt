Trouble in Paradise
 
			SEQUENCE A 

FADE IN  NIGHT
  
MED. SHOT   DOOR OF A HOUSE   
A cheap residential district. The house has no architectural 
character; it is not certain where we are. Near the entrance 
door is a garbage can, full.

A dog is nibbling at some of the garbage. We hear whistling, 
footsteps. A garbage man comes into the picture. He shoos 
the dog away. Without pause in whistling, he lifts the 
garbage can and, followed by camera, goes to the end of the 
block, which is only a few steps. Now we discover we are in 
Venice. In the background is a major canal and a typical 
bridge--romantic background. Gondolas are passing. In the 
foreground at the sidewalk is the garbage gondola, piled 
high with garbage. The man dumps his load, leaves the empty 
can on the sidewalk, gets in the gondola, and paddles away 
with the grace of a gondolier. Now, in a beautiful tenor 
voice which is quite a contrast to the garbage, he starts 
singing a passionate Italian love song.
 
LONG SHOT  A GONDOLA 
Two tourists. Husband and wife. They are in a sentimental 
embrace. In back is the gondolier. Camera follows gondola 
a few seconds, coming closer.
 
ANOTHER GONDOLA 
Camera shoots down. Gondola is covered by a typical little 
canopy, so that gondolier cannot see the passengers. Camera 
cuts canopy on one side so that we don't see, at first, who 
is paddling. In the gondola seat is a woman in evening gown, 
lots of jewels. She lies in the arms of the gondolier. They 
kiss. Camera moves up and discovers who is paddling the 
boat. It is the husband of the lady who is having such a 
good time with the gondolier. Husband is in tuxedo and 
straw hat, smoking a long cigar. He is enjoying it like a 
child with a new toy.
 
			HUSBAND
	Darling!
 
			WIFE'S VOICE
	Yes, sweetheart.
 
			HUSBAND
	What a canal!
 
SIDEWALK 
in front of the hotel. Camera shoots down from the hotel on 
the sidewalk, including part of sidewalk and canal. The 
water reflects the electric-lighted name of the hotel. At 
sidewalk is moored a gondola in which are four people. A 
man climbs out, starts to sing, the others in the gondola 
playing accompaniment. We hear a romantic Italian song, 
irresistible. The four look up to the hotel windows, 
expecting coins.
 
HOTEL ROOM INT.
photographed against the open window. In the background is 
the canal. Through the window we hear the street singers. 
Near the window is a table where five men are in a poker 
game, not listening to the music. We hear, over the music, 
the rattling of the chips. After a few moments the noise of 
the chips stops and the singing comes through more clearly. 
Casually one of the men, cards in hand, walks to the window, 
closes it, and returns to game.
 
ANOTHER HOTEL ROOM  CLOSE SHOT 
at open window. A woman is on a chair by a small table, 
telephoning.
 
			WOMAN
	Uh-huh ... Uh-huh ...
 
During the scene we hear the same street singers. The woman, 
annoyed by the singing, closes the window.
 
ANOTHER HOTEL ROOM 
Shooting over the bed toward an open window. Same singers 
are heard. On the bed, in the foreground, is a woman lying 
in her chemise and crying. In the background, sitting on 
the arm of a chair which is by the open window, is an 
elegantly dressed man. Evening clothes, overcoat, hat, 
walking stick. Annoyed by the crying and by the outside 
music, he gets up and slams the window shut with a bang.
 
FRANÇOIS'S HOTEL ROOM  MED. SHOT 
In the background is an open window with French doors 
leading to a little balcony. This room is on the other 
side of the hotel, looking out on a side canal. Close 
outside the window we see trees. The same music is still 
audible, but much fainter. Near the window is a desk. The 
drawer is open and all the papers are scattered on the 
floor. At the other side of the window is a trunk, open, 
all the drawers out and the contents thrown around. Room 
looks as if it has been rifled. For a little while we hear 
nothing but the faint music. Then we hear the door buzzer. 
There is no reaction. The buzzer rings again. Suddenly from 
behind the camera, a man comes into the picture. He is in a 
tuxedo. His back is to the camera, so we cannot identify 
him. He goes quickly to the window, jumps from balcony to a 
tree, and, climbing down, disappears. Buzzer rings again.

Camera goes toward the tree to a very big close-up of a 
little branch. We see, on this little branch, a false 
moustache. We hear the man reach ground and receding 
footsteps as he hurries away. Again we hear, a little 
fainter, the buzzer.
 
[EXT.HOTEL  MED. SHOT 
On wall in moonlight. We see shadow of tree and of man as 
he reaches the ground. In silhouetted shadow, we see him 
take off moustache and sideburns and toss them out of the 
picture.
 
FRANÇOIS'S HOTEL ROOM  MED. SHOT 
toward window, low. Camera draws back and comes to a close 
shot on the feet of a man outstretched on the floor behind 
the camera. Buzzer is heard again, loud.]
 
HOTEL CORRIDOR  CLOSE SHOT 
at room door. We see the numbers 253, 5, 7, 9. At the door 
are two Italian dames, obviously disreputable. One is 
pushing the buzzer. They speak in Italian, but their 
emphasis and pantomime make the following clear to English-
speaking audiences: Girl No. 1 brought Girl No. 2 to see the 
gentleman of room 253. Girl No. 1 rings again. Girl No. 2 
complains to Girl No. 1 that she should have known better 
than to have brought her here and wasted her time. Girl 
No. 1 apologizes and indicates her watch as if to say, "The 
appointment was definite. I can't understand it." She rings 
again--viciously this time.
 
LONG SHOT  FRANÇOIS'S HOTEL ROOM 
Sprawled on the floor, his head resting on a chair, 
François is motionless. We see that a crime has been 
committed. François is an elegant man, about thirty-five, a 
conceited bon vivant. He is in a tuxedo. We hear the 
buzzer, insistent.
 
CORRIDOR  CLOSE SHOT 
at door Girl No. 1 presses buzzer angrily. Girl No. 2 
accuses her loudly. Girl No. 1 answers just as loud. Girl 
No. 1 now bangs on the door, shouting insults to occupant 
of the room. Girl No. 2 joins her.
 
CLOSE SHOT  HOTEL CORRIDOR
at door across the hall from room 253. It is numbered 254. 
We hear the voices of the angry Italian girls. The door 
opens, and an old gentleman, white beard, dressing gown 
over evening clothes, steps out. He politely but firmly 
asks, in Italian, for silence.
 
CLOSE SHOT  DOOR ROOM 253
The girls turn quickly toward the man. No. 2 says she can 
talk as much as she wants to.
 
CLOSE-UP  OLD GENTLEMAN
He states emphatically that he won't stand for this.
 
CLOSE-UP  GIRL NO. 1  
She looks over the old gentleman and makes a nasty personal 
remark.
 
CLOSE-UP  OLD GENTLEMAN
He loses his temper and insults the girls venomously.
 
CLOSE SHOT  TWO GIRLS  
They are at the height of their fury. No. 2 walks out 
quickly toward the old gentleman.
 
CLOSE SHOT  DOOR ROOM 254 
Old gentleman is in the open doorway. Girl approaches. The 
two stand toe-to-toe trading verbal punches. The old man, 
disgusted, retreats. He is about to close door, but girl, 
still vociferous, follows him into his room and closes door 
behind her.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GIRL NO. 1
Still in front of 253. In the sudden silence, she looks 
amazed toward 254. No. 2 has disappeared!
 
CLOSE SHOT  DOOR ROOM 254
Door opens quickly. No. 2 sticks her head out and, with a 
characteristic jerk, says in Italian, "Come in." She 
disappears, door slightly ajar.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GIRL NO. 1
at 253 She goes to 254, enters, closes the door. The camera 
swings fast to opposite side of corridor and stops at 253. 
We hear telephone ringing inside.
 
FRANÇOIS'S HOTEL ROOM 
Shooting from outside of the window into the room. In the 
foreground is the window frame. We see François on the 
floor. Phone is ringing. François awakes, tries to struggle 
to his feet. But, still under the influence of dope, he 
falls. As he falls he drags with him, from nearby little 
table, a tray with glasses, making a loud noise.

(The window frame in the following moving shot across 
windows outside will be done with a miniature hotel 
building.) 

Camera swings swiftly along the hotel front, around the 
corner of the hotel, and up to the third floor. It stops at 
a little balcony. Behind the balcony, leaning against one 
of two open French doors, stands Gaston, in a tuxedo, 
smoking a cigarette, looking romantically into the night. 
We see, in the room, a waiter setting a dinner table for 
two. The waiter arranges some flowers; then he comes 
forward, offering Gaston the menu. Gaston does not respond.

			WAITER 
		(breaking into Gaston's reverie)
 	Yes, sir? 
		(Gaston still looks into the 
		night.) 
	What shall we start with, Baron?
 
			GASTON
		(coming to)
	Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy. 
		(Half to himself.) 
	Beginnings are always difficult.
 
			WAITER
	Yes, Baron.
 
			GASTON 
		(directly to the waiter, 
		presenting a problem)
	If Casanova suddenly ... turned out 
	to be Romeo ... having supper with 
	Juliet--who might become Cleopatra 
	... How would you start?
 
			WAITER 
		(in a professional and 
		prosaic tone)
	I would start with cocktails.
 
			GASTON
	Um-hum. Very good. Excellent! 

Suddenly Gaston sees something on the canal.
 
MED. SHOT  GONDOLA  
In gondola, Lily, in evening dress, looks up at Gaston and 
waves graciously.
 
BALCONY  CLOSE SHOT 
Gaston and waiter. Gaston bows--the bow of a gentleman to a 
lady of degree--and waves back. This is the woman he is 
waiting for.
 
			GASTON 
		(still looking at Lily)
	It must be the most marvelous supper. 
	We may not eat it, but it must be 
	marvelous.
 
			WAITER
	Yes, Baron.
 
			GASTON 
		(turning)
	And, waiter--you see that moon?
 
			WAITER
	Yes, Baron.
 
			GASTON
	I want to see that moon in the 
	champagne.
 
			WAITER
 	Yes, Baron. 
		(Writing; very businesslike.) 
	Moon in champagne.

			GASTON 
	 	(groping for words)
	I want to see-- 
		(An ecstatic sigh escapes him.)
 
			WAITER 
		(continuing to write)
	Yes, Baron.
 
			GASTON
     	And as for you, waiter--
 
			WAITER 
		(eagerly; expecting a tip)
	Yes, Baron?
 
			GASTON
	I don't want to see you at all!
 
			WAITER
	No, Baron! 
		(With a little bow, waiter 
		starts to leave. Suddenly he 
		sees something on the back of 
		Gaston's jacket. Gaston looks 
		at him, puzzled. Waiter 
		reaches over, lifts a leaf 
		that is clinging to the coat, 
		and holds it up.) 
	I beg your pardon.
 
			GASTON 
		(takes the leaf calmly)
	Thank you.
 
Waiter goes. We hear the door shut. Gaston is thoughtful a 
brief moment. Then idly he tosses the leaf over the balcony 
rail into the night.

TELEPHONE ROOM OF HOTEL  CLOSE SHOT
of an operator. In the background we see two other 
operators. We hear the girls answering in Italian. Our 
operator is delivering a lengthy message. While she is 
talking she looks up to the switchboard because she sees:
 
CLOSE SHOT  SWITCHBOARD 
at No. 253. The light is flashing on and off very quickly. 
We hear the operator's voice, still busy with the message 
she is delivering. Now she plugs in on 253.
 
CLOSE-UP OPERATOR 

			OPERATOR
 	Si, signore. 
		(We see by her expression 
		that the man in room 253 is 
		reporting the robbery; 
		excitedly.) 
	Yes, sir! Right away!
 
She disconnects 253 and plugs in on the manager. She tells 
the manager, in Italian, what has happened.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GLASS DOOR 
In Italian, English, French, and German: Manager. Door 
opens and manager hurries out.
 
BIG CLOSE-UP  OPERATOR 
talking very fast in Italian, reporting the robbery to 
someone else.
 
CLOSE SHOT  A DOOR 
opens, and another man, apparently a detective, comes out.
 
STAIRCASE 
Another hotel attendant is running up.
 
BIG CLOSE-UP  TWO MAIDS
talking excitedly in Italian, apparently discussing the 
robbery.
 
ANOTHER PART OF CORRIDOR 
Camera shoots down over the back of a waiter. He holds high 
over his shoulder a tray on which are several empty dishes. 
A little bellboy is standing beside the waiter, looking up 
and explaining in Italian excitedly what has happened.
 
STAIRCASE 
TWO maids on opposite landings. Steward comes up stairs and 
tells them of robbery.
 
TELEPHONE ROOM 
Another operator talking excitedly.

CORRIDOR
A hotel official dashes along. We hear many voices talking 
at the same time. Camera pans with him up to room 253 where 
he stops. Door is open. Half in room, half in corridor, are 
hotel attendants, detectives, the manager. With excited 
gestures, they are discussing the situation in Italian. 
Their voices become increasingly loud.
 
MED. SHOT
to room 254. It opens quickly. Girl No. 2 appears, hair 
slightly disarranged. She looks annoyed and shouts in 
Italian for them to keep quiet.
 
MED. SHOT
of room 253. The men stop talking, look quickly over toward 
the girl.
 
CLOSE SHOT GIRL NO. 2
Indignantly and crudely, she wants the noise to cease. She 
closes the door.
 
MED. SHOT AT ROOM 253 
The men, talking quietly, go into the room and close the 
door.
 
GASTON'S HOTEL ROOM MED. SHOT 
at door, inside. Gaston opens it, and Lily enters quickly. 
Gaston closes the door, looks at Lily questioningly. She is 
excited and out of breath.
 
			LILY
	Oh, my gracious--he almost saw me. 

			GASTON 
		(the crook in him worried 
		for a second)
	Who?
 
			LILY 
		(almost hysterical)
 	The Marquis de la Tours. He was in 
	the lobby. But I don't think he saw 
	me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank 
	heaven! ... But when I came up here, 
	right out in the hall there was 
	King Boris of Alconia!
 
			GASTON
	The tennis player? 

			LILY 
	The tennis player. He saw me. He 
	bowed. What could I do? I nodded. 
		(Summing up in panic.) 
	Baron, I shouldn't have come!
 
			GASTON
		(goes to her, takes her hand; 
		with great feeling)
	But you came. And you must forget 
	everything-- 
		(Lily looks at him, 
		a little afraid) 
	except that you are here, Countess. 

Gaston helps her off with her wrap, puts it on a chair. 
Lily nervously walks out of the picture.
 
CLOSE SHOT  AT WINDOW 
shooting from inside. Lily comes in, stops at a chair, sits 
nervously, stands, moves to window, and looks off from 
balcony. Gaston comes in. He touches her hand. She turns to 
him.
 
			LILY 
	Out there in the moonlight 
	everything seemed so perfect, so 
	simple--but now--but now--
 
Gaston, thinking her mood is changing to a love mood, is 
about to embrace her.
 
			LILY 
		(in a frightened tone)
	Do you know King Boris?
 
			GASTON 
	No--no.
 
			LILY 
	Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
 
			GASTON 
		(with a little smile)
	I would like to.
 
			LILY 
	 	(agitatedly)
	You'd better not. He's really very 
	dull. But anyhow, when the king 
	tells the marquis he saw me, the 
	marquis will tell the marchesa. And 
	the marchesa is the best friend of 
	the Duchess of Chambro. And she 
	will phone the Princess de Costa. 
	The princess doesn't like me--but I 
	don't care!

			GASTON 
	Why should you?
 
			LILY 
		(as if arguing)
	But she talks a lot. And before 
	this night is over, all Venice will 
	know it. And tomorrow it will be 
	Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
 
Exhausted, she moves away, drops into an armchair. Gaston 
goes to her, sits on the arm of the chair, leans over.
 
			GASTON 
		(tenderly)
	Don't stop. Keep right on 
	complaining. It's beautiful.
 
			LILY 
		(looks at him for a 
		moment, quietly; then)
	You know, when I first saw you, I 
	thought you were an American.
 
			GASTON 
 		(flattered)
	Thank you!
 
			LILY 
		(With great delight)
	Someone from another world--so 
	entirely different. One gets so 
	tired of one's own class--princes 
	and counts and dukes and kings--ah! 
	And everybody talking shop--always 
	trying to sell jewelry ... And then 
	I heard your name and found you 
	were just one of us.
  
			GASTON
	Disappointed?
 
			LILY 
		(leaning back with lure) 
	No--proud. Very proud!
 
Gaston takes her in his arms and kisses her. She returns 
his embrace. We hear the phone ringing. The embrace breaks, 
and both look startled. Gaston obviously is nervous because 
he is a crook. We don't know why Lily is nervous. Gaston 
goes quickly toward the phone.
 
CLOSE SHOT  LITTLE TELEPHONE TABLE 
Gaston enters, picks up the phone.
 
			GASTON
	Hello ... The countess?
 
CLOSE-UP  LILY 
She is still in the chair. Frightened, she rises quickly.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON
 
			GASTON
  	Just a moment. 
		(Hands over the receiver.) 
	The Duchess of Chambro.

CLOSE SHOT  LILY 
at the window.  She is perplexed for a moment.  Then she 
hurries out toward the phone.
 
CLOSE SHOT
at the phone. Lily enters. She makes a gesture as if to 
say, "You see? They know already!" 

			LILY
	Hello, Your Grace. Yes, Your Grace. 
	How did you know I was here? Oh, 
	the marquis-- 
		(She gestures to Gaston as if 
		to say, "Didn't I tell you?") 
	Yes, Your Grace. I see. 
		(Gaston walks out 
		of the picture.) 
	Dinner tomorrow--at your palace. Oh, 
	I'd be delighted. King Boris will 
	call for me ... 
		(She makes a gesture of 
		annoyance to Gaston.)
 
SECOND-CLASS HOTEL ROOM 
It is very much in disorder. On the night table is a phone. 
The woman who speaks is frowsy, fat, common. She is 
apparently Lily's companion, maid, and intimate friend.
 
			WOMAN
 		(voice guarded and low)
 	Listen, Lily. When you come home, 
	slip up the back way. I can't talk 
	now, but do what I tell you. 
		(In a loud voice.) 
	And listen, Lily. You know what 
	that darn dog of yours did--?
 
CLOSE SHOT  LILY 
at the phone.
 
			LILY
	So, he really did! How charming! 
	Well, my compliments to the duke. 
	Goodbye. 
		(She hangs up, faces Gaston, 
		makes a desperate gesture.) 
	There you are. The scandal is on!
 
MED. SHOT  GASTON
standing by the dinner table, thoughtful. He looks over to 
Lily.
 
CLOSE SHOT  LILY
She has sunk into a sofa. 

			LILY 
		(half-despairingly)
	Oh! 
		(She puts her head 
		in her hands.)
 
MED. SHOT  GASTON 
looks sadly at the table, realizing that the dinner he had 
pictured so charmingly may be spoiled. He goes to Lily.
 
MED. SHOT  LILY
in the chair, still holding head in hands. Gaston enters, 
touches her hair lightly, controls himself.
 
		GASTON
	Countess, I'm sorry. 
		(With great feeling.) 
	If you think it's best for you to 
	go--well--
 
CLOSE-UP  LILY 
She looks up at Gaston, amazed.
 
CLOSE-UP  GASTON 
He looks at Lily with great tenderness.
 
CLOSE SHOT  LILY 
She looks tenderly at Gaston. She rises, camera rising with 
her to include both Gaston and herself. She touches his 
arm. She is moved and confused. Her real feeling starts to 
break through at this manifestation of chivalry.
 
			LILY 
		(in a tremulous voice)
	I think that's very nice--yes, very 
	nice. 
		(They look at each other 
		a few seconds.) 
	I think--I think we should have a 
	cocktail.
 
Gaston is delighted. He kisses her hand, goes quickly to 
the dinner table.
 
CLOSE SHOT 
at the dinner table. Gaston walks in, picks up the cocktail 
shaker. He shakes it, smiles happily at Lily.
 
MED. SHOT  FRANÇOIS'S HOTEL ROOM 
François has recovered his memory. His hair is still 
disarranged, eyes still glazed. For a few moments, he is 
incoherent, then he gradually becomes almost normal. 
Grouped near him are five Italian hotel officials, a 
detective, and the manager. They are gesturing excitedly, 
all talking at the same time. The dialogue is fragmentary, 
ad lib, Italian. The manager, who speaks English, turns to
François.
 
			MANAGER 
		(indicating the detective)
 	The representative of the police 
	wants to know how much money you 
	had, M'sieu Filiba.
 
			FRANÇOIS
	I had exactly twenty thousand lire. 
	I had just cashed a traveler's 
	check and put it in my wallet.
 
Manager turns to the others and translates.  They go into a 
huddle and talk excited Italian.
 
			MANAGER 
		(to François)
	Why did you let this man in, M'sieu 
	Filiba?
 
			FRANÇOIS
	Well, he knocked at the door. You 
	see, I was expecting two--uh--two 
	business associates.
 
Manager turns again to our Italian friends and again we see 
the same excitement.

			MANAGER 
		(again to François)
    	And then what happened, M'sieu 
	Filiba?
 
			FRANÇOIS
 	I said, "Come in." And there he was. 
	A fine-looking man with a moustache 
	and long sideburns. He said, "Good 
	evening. I'm the doctor." I said, 
	"Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. 
	I came to see about your tonsils."
 
Manager turns back, translating. It creates a sensation.
 
			MANAGER 
		(to François)
	The representative of the police 
	wants to know if there is anything 
	wrong with your tonsils.
 
			FRANÇOIS
	No!

			MANAGER 
		(to group)
	Niente!
 
			FRANÇOIS
	That's just what I tried to tell 
	him. Well, one word led to another. 
	He really was a very charming 
	fellow. So we talked for about ten 
	minutes.
 
Manager translates. Again excitement. 

			MANAGER 
		(to François)
	What did you talk about?
 
			FRANÇOIS
	About tonsils.
 
			MANAGER 
		(to the group)
	Tonsili!
 
			FRANÇOIS
	So I said to myself, "All right, if 
	he wants to look at them, let him 
	look at them. No harm in that." And 
	then he said, "Say ah." And then I 
	said, "Ah." And that's all I 
	remember ... And when I woke up, I 
	still had my tonsils, but my 
	pocketbook was gone.
 
Manager translates. Again excitement.

GASTON'S HOTEL ROOM   MED. SHOT 
at dinner table. Gaston and Lily are seated, eating. Waiter 
is pouring champagne.
 
			GASTON 
		(With casual interest)
	Was it lots of money?
 
			WAITER
	Oh, it must have been, Baron. The 
	gentleman occupies the Royal Suite--
	two fifty-three, five, seven, and 
	nine. I think his name is M'sieu 
	Filiba.
 
Lily apparently is even less interested.
 
			GASTON
	You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
 
			WAITER
	But please, Baron. We're not 
	supposed to breathe a word of it. 
	You won't tell anybody I told you?
 
			GASTON
	You can trust me.
 
			WAITER
	Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
		(Waiter goes.)
 
HOTEL CORRIDOR  MED. SHOT 
at door of Gaston's room. The number is 300-302. Waiter 
comes out, closes door.
 
GASTON'S ROOM  CLOSE SHOT 
at dinner table. Lily serenely continues to eat.
 
			GASTON
	That's hotel life. In one room a 
	man loses his wallet 
		(very tenderly) 
	and in another room a man loses--
	his head.  
		(He tries to kiss Lily.)
 
   			LILY
		(holding him off gently)
  	Please.
		(Very sincerely.) 
	When I came here it was for a 
	little adventure--a little game 
	which you play tonight and forget 
	tomorrow. But something has changed 
	me--and it isn't the champagne. 
		(Gaston, also with sincerity, 
		takes her hand.) 
	The whole thing is new to me. Very 
	new. I've got a confession to make 
	to you. 
		(After a slight pause.) 
	Baron, you are a crook. 
		(Gaston's expression 
		doesn't change.) 
	You robbed the gentleman in two 
	fifty-three, five, seven, and nine. 
		(Still Gaston's expression 
		doesn't change. After a 
		slight pause, Lily turns 
		back to the table.) 
	May I have the salt?
 
			GASTON 
		(passes the salt with 
		an elegant gesture)
	Please.
 
   			LILY
	Thank you.
 
			GASTON
	The pepper, too?
 
   			LILY
	No, thank you.
 
			GASTON
 	You're very welcome. 
		(There is a short silence as 
		both continue with the meal. 
		Then, with great candor.) 
	Countess, believe me, before you 
	left this room I would have told 
	you everything ... And let me say 
	this with love in my heart--
	Countess, you are a thief. 
		(Lily drops her 
		knife and fork.) 
	The wallet of the gentleman in two 
	fifty-three, five, seven, and nine 
	is in your possession. I knew it 
	very well when you took it out of 
	my pocket.

	In fact, you tickled me.

	But your embrace was so sweet ...

at the window. Gaston enters, closes the window, and pulls 
the curtains. Looking back at Lily with smiling promise, he 
returns to the table.
 
CLOSE SHOT  TABLE 
Gaston goes to her, takes her hand, and draws her to her 
feet. She looks at him expectantly. Gaston takes her in his 
arms. It looks like the start of a passionate love scene. 
Suddenly, unexpectedly, he grabs her by the shoulders, 
shakes her violently.
 
INSERT 
Of their feet. Wallet falls from Lily's dress.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON AND LILY 
Gaston reaches down, picks up wallet, puts it casually in 
his pocket, then gracefully holds chair, inviting her to 
sit.
 
			GASTON
	Countess.

Lily sits with all the poise of a lady. Gaston sits. They 
continue the meal as if nothing has happened.
 
			LILY
	I like you, Baron.
 
			GASTON 
		(fervently)
	I'm crazy about you. 
		(He reaches in his side 
		pocket, takes out a diamond 
		brooch which Lily wore when 
		she came in.) 
	By the way, your pin.

Lily is flabbergasted. She looks down to her bosom. Indeed, 
the pin is missing. She accepts the pin.
 
			LILY 
		(With a little 
		smile of shame)
	Thank you, Baron.
 
			GASTON
	Not at all, Countess ... There's 
	one very good stone in it.
 
			LILY 
		(as she fastens the pin)
	What time is it?
 
Gaston reaches for his watch, discovers it is missing. He 
gives Lily a look of admiration and astonishment. Lily 
smiles triumphantly, opens her purse, lifts out the watch, 
hands it to him. He takes it with a bow.
 
			LILY
	It was five minutes slow, but I 
	regulated it for you. 

They bow to each other like two Chinese mandarins.
 
			GASTON 
		(tenderly)
	I hope you don't mind if I keep 
	your garter.

Lily almost leaps out of her chair. She raises her skirt; 
her hand searches for the garter. It is missing. Gaston 
takes the garter out of his breast pocket, shows it to her, 
kisses it, puts it back, and buttons his coat. Lily is 
delighted. This is the highest compliment ever paid to her. 
She slides into his lap, embraces him.
 
			LILY
	Darling! 
		(They kiss; very excitedly.) 
	Now tell me--tell me all about 
	yourself. Who are you?
 
			GASTON
	You remember the man who walked into 
	the Bank of Constantinople and 
	walked out with the Bank of 
	Constantinople?
 
			LILY 
		(thrilled) 
	Monescu!
 
			GASTON
	Gaston Monescu.
 
			LILY 
		(melting away)
	Gaston!
 
They embrace and kiss again.
 

COUCH  
Lily is lying on the couch, Gaston at her side, leaning 
over adoringly.
 
			GASTON
 	I love you. I loved you the moment 
	I saw you. I'm mad about you. My 
	little shoplifter! My sweet little 
	pickpocket! My darling! 

He takes her in his arms. They embrace and kiss.

Camera centers the handbag. We hold this, then camera pans 
up to Mariette's face. She is looking at the stage. Camera 
pans quickly down again to handbag. We stay on the handbag. 
Major's hand comes in and touches Mariette's hand 
caressingly. She brushes his hand aside. Camera moves 
quickly up to Major. He is looking ardently at Mariette. He 
leans over to her. Camera with him. Both in the picture. A 
dialogue scene now follows, but even though it is a 
close-up, we can't hear them because they are through 
binoculars from a distance. In this inaudible but visually 
expressive scene, Major tells her he can't understand her 
attitude toward him. She impatiently asks him to leave her 
alone to enjoy the opera opera. Major persistently says he 
loves her. Mariette insists that he stop it.  She takes out 
of her lap  (which is not in the picture) opera glasses and 
holds them to her eyes. Major gives up, leans back in chair. 
Camera centers Mariette, alone. Then camera, still framed 
in opera-glass vignette, pans down and comes to rest on

	and made it into a lamp for my night 
	table?

CLOSE-UP  GASTON 
He looks at her with emotion, gets up, and goes to her.
 
MED. SHOT  LILY 
Gaston sits close to her, caresses her hair.
 
			GASTON
	I remember the lamp, I remember the 
	night table, and I remember the 
	night. 
		(They kiss.) 
	Everything will be all right again. 
		(As he gets up; with a 
		valiant little smile.) 
	Prosperity is just around the corner!

He goes out of the picture. Lily smiles after him with total 
confidence.
 
CLOSE-UP  GASTON'S CHAIR 
Gaston returns, sits, picks up paper, resumes reading.
 
CLOSE-UP  LILY 
at her paper. Suddenly she stares at something on the page. 
She leaps to her feet.
 
			LILY 
	Gaston!
 
CLOSE-UP  GASTON
He looks up.
  
CLOSE-UP  LILY 
Paper in hand, followed by camera, she goes to the bureau, 
opens a drawer, and takes out Mariette's handbag. She looks 
at the bag, rereads the item in the paper, looks back again.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
Puzzled, he gets up.
 
CLOSE SHOT  LILY
Followed by camera, she hastens to Gaston, hands him the 
paper, points to the item.
 
			LILY
	Read this.
 
INSERT 
A large classified ad with headline: Handbag Lost--Twenty 
Thousand Francs Reward. Before we can read the rest, camera 
moves close to the headline. Under the insert, we hear:
 
			LILY'S VOICE
	The description fits. That's our 
	bag!
 
CLOSE SHOT  LILY AND GASTON 
Gaston has finished reading.
 
			GASTON
	Twenty thousand francs ... If we 
	sold it we'd get-- 
		(He takes the bag from 
		Lily, examines it like 
		an expert.) 
	Well, it's worth forty thousand at 
	the most. She paid probably sixty 
	thousand. When we sell it ... I'd 
	say five thousand.
 
			LILY
	Darling, then let's be honest and 
	return it to the lady.
 
			GASTON
	And take the twenty thousand francs ...
 
			LILY
	Right.
 
			GASTON 
		(with sudden emotion)
	Sweetheart, what day is today?
 
			LILY
	The fourteenth of May.
 
			GASTON
	And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And 
	the day after tomorrow--
 
 			LILY 
		(not knowing what he wants)
	The six--
 
She catches Gaston's eye. Her face lights up. Very tenderly 
she embraces him.
 
 			GASTON
	We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
 
 			LILY 
		(romantically)
  	We'll take the Royal Suite!
 
 			GASTON
 	Two fifty-three, five--
 
 			LILY 
	Seven and nine!

 			GASTON
	And we'll celebrate the second 
	anniversary of the day we didn't get 
	married! 

 			LILY 
	Darling!

They kiss. After they have held the embrace a few moments, 
we hear a knock  the door. They look toward the door, hide 
the handbag instantly.
 
 			GASTON
	Come in. 

CLOSE SHOT  DOOR
Porter comes in, carrying a pair of shoes.
 
			PORTER 
		(putting them on the floor)
	Your shoes, Professor Bernard.
 
As he goes
 
[Their embrace continues. They look at each other dreamily.]

				FADE OUT

 
			SEQUENCE D
 
FADE IN 

MARIETTE'S LIVING ROOM MED. SHOT 
Mariette and an elderly woman who has seen better days. Her 
clothes, once elegant, now are shabby. She is unwrapping a 
package as camera moves toward both to a close shot. She 
takes out a handbag which also seen better days, holds it 
toward Mariette pathetically. Mariette responds with a 
kindly look.
 
			MARIETTE
 	No, I'm sorry, but that's not the 
	bag.
 
			WOMAN 
		(restraining a sob)
	I know it isn't. But it's pretty--
	isn't it?
 
			MARIETTE
		(sympathetic)
	Very pretty.
 
We hear phone ring. Mariette, annoyed at the interruption, 
goes out of the picture.
 
CLOSE SHOT  TELEPHONE TABLE 
Mariette enters, picks up phone.
 
 			MARIETTE
	Hello ... Yes .. . Where did you 
	find the bag? 
		(Amused.) 
	Where? 
		(Even more amused.) 
	Where? What? 
		(Smiling broadly.) 
	What was in it? 
		(With a change of 
		expression, outraged.) 
	How dare you! 
		(She slams down 
		receiver.)
 
CLOSE SHOT  ELDERLY WOMAN 
bag in hand, with patient hope.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE
at phone. Her expression softens. Followed by camera, she 
goes to woman.
 
			WOMAN
	You wouldn't have any use for it? 
		(Mariette hesitates.) 
	You see, I have another bag, and I 
	really don't need this. So, if you'd 
	like to buy it ...
 
Mariette sees tears in the woman's eyes. 

			MARIETTE 
		(reaching into drawer 
		of nearby table)
	Would two hundred francs be sufficient?
 
			WOMAN
		(this is much more 
		than she expected)
	Yes, madame.
 
Mariette hands her the money. 

			WOMAN 
		(overwhelmed)
	Oh, thank you, madame!
 
She goes out of picture toward door. Mariette looks after 
her with compassion, which is broken by the ringing phone. 
Increasingly annoyed, she goes to phone, newly purchased 
bag in hand.
 
CLOSE SHOT  TELEPHONE 
Mariette enters edgily.
 
			MARIETTE
	Hello ... Yes ...
 
She tosses handbag out of picture.

ARMCHAIR 
Bag falls on armchair into an assortment of several other 
bags. Mariette must have been buying bags for hours.
 
 			MARIETTE'S VOICE
 	What? Yes, this is Madame Colet.
 
CLOSE-UP  MARIETTE
at the phone
 
 			MARIETTE
	What? Yes, I lost my bag. Yes. Last 
	night at the opera ... No, no, I 
	don't want to buy a piano! 
		(She hangs up angrily.)
 
LONG SHOT  HALL 
Shooting from the direction of the living room toward the 
house entrance door. Hall is filled with men and women, 
some well dressed, some shabby. Some carry packages. Several 
women hold, each, two "found" bags. One woman carries a 
crying baby. Butler's voice comes behind the camera.
 
			BUTLER'S VOICE
	Next, please.

A young Russian Bolshevik, unshaven, with bushy hair, moves 
toward camera.
 
LIVING ROOM  MED. SHOT 
at open door. Bolshevik enters, followed by butler, who 
shuts door behind them as Bolshevik goes to Mariette. 
During all this, we hear:
 
			MARIETTE'S VOICE
	No ... No, it was not insured. But 
	right now it's too late.
 
CLOSE SHOT  TELEPHONE 
 
			MARIETTE
	What?
		(Bolshevik enters.) 
	I may lose it again? But I haven't 
	found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye! 
		(She turns toward 
		Bolshevik distracted) 
	Yes?
 
			BOLSHEVIK
		(heavy Russian accent)
	So you lost a handbag, madame?
 
			MARIETTE
		(impatiently)
	Yes.

			BOLSHEVIK
	And it had diamonds in the back. 

			MARIETTE 
	Yes.
 
			BOLSHEVIK
	And diamonds in the front.
 
			MARIETTE 
	Yes.
 
			BOLSHEVIK
	Diamonds all over.
 
			MARIETTE
	Well, have you found it?
 
			BOLSHEVIK
		(screaming)
	No! 
		(Raising his arm 
		like a prophet.) 
	But let me tell you--any woman who 
	spends a fortune in times like these 
	for a handbag--phooey, phooey, 
	phooey!
 
Butler enters officiously.
 
			BUTLER 
		(to Bolshevik)
	I must ask you

			BOLSHEVIK
 		(brushing butler aside)
	And as Trotsky said-- 
		(in Russian) 
	"Any woman who spends a fortune for 
	a silk purse is a sow's ear." 
		(In English.) 
	And that goes for you, too!
 

CLOSE SHOT  DOOR
to hall. While Bolshevik is ranting, it opens; Gaston 
enters briskly with an authoritative air, shuts door behind 
him.
 
MARIETTE, BOLSHEVIK, AND BUTLER 
Mariette is startled; she doesn't know who or what the 
gentleman is. Bolshevik is frightened. Butler is 
momentarily nonplussed.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
He steps forward commandingly.
 
MED. SHOT  MARIETTE AND BOLSHEVIK
Gaston goes to Bolshevik, puts his arm patronizingly on his 
shoulder, and tells him politely but emphatically, in 
Russian, to leave. Bolshevik makes a protesting remark. 
Gaston tells him vigorously and effectively to scram. Cowed, 
the Bolshevik goes. 

CLOSE SHOT  DOOR
Butler, recuperated and full of dignity, opens door to the 
hall. Bolshevik appears, turns to Mariette and Gaston. 

			BOLSHEVIK
		(in a final outburst)
 	Phooey! Phooey! And-- 
		(Looking for another word
		 but failing to find it; 
		twice as loud.) 
	Phooey! 

Butler shoves him out, follows, shuts door.
 
CLOSE SHOT 
Mariette and Gaston. Mariette is more bewildered by Gaston 
than by the Bolshevik.
 
			GASTON 
		(looking after the 
		departed man)
	His phooey is worse than his bite. 
		(Turning to Mariette.) 
	I must apologize for entering 
	unannounced. If I am not mistaken, 
	Madame Colet?
 
			MARIETTE
	Yes...?
 
			GASTON 
	Will you be good enough to look at 
	this bag, madame? 
		(He brings the bag 
		forth, hands it to 
		Mariette.)
 
			MARIETTE
		(with instant and 
		joyful recognition) 
	That's it! Yes, that's it! ... 
	Jacques!
 
CLOSE SHOT  DOOR
It opens and butler enters.
 
			BUTLER
	Yes, madame?
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
 
			MARIETTE 
	Dismiss all the people in the hall. 
	The bag has been found.
 
			BUTLER'S VOICE
 	Very well, madame.
 
 			MARIETTE
 	And Jacques. Call up the major and 
	tell him-- No, don't call him. Let 
	him keep on searching! And Jacques-- 
		(Phone rings. Mariette 
		picks up receiver and 
		speaks before the other 
		party can speak.) 
	Sorry--the bag's been found. 
		(She hangs up.) 
	And Jacques--
 
CLOSE SHOT  BUTLER

			BUTLER
 	Yes, madame?
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
 
			MARIETTE
	Call Cohen, Cohen, Ginsburg, and 
	Renault. Give my thanks to M'sieu 
	Renault. 
		(In high spirits.) 
	Thank them all!
 
			BUTLER'S VOICE
	Very well, madame.
 
We hear door closing. Mariette looks happily at bag, turns 
to Gaston.
 
			MARIETTE
	Where did you--
 
She discovers that Gaston is no longer standing beside her. 
She looks around.
 
CLOSE SHOT  ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM 
A beautiful Chinese vase on a table. Gaston, looking at 
vase with appraising eye, is absorbed, unaware that 
Mariette has addressed him.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
She goes toward Gaston.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(happily)
	Where did you find it?
 
			GASTON
	You know the main staircase in the 
	opera?
 
 			MARIETTE 
	Yes.

			GASTON
	Then you go to the left. There's a 
	landing. 

 			MARIETTE 
		(eagerly)
	Yes.
 
			GASTON
	Then you go into the foyer.
  
 			MARIETTE 
	Yes.

			GASTON
	And as you leave the foyer, there is 
	a little niche.
 
 			MARIETTE 
	I know that niche.
 
			GASTON
	And in that niche, there is a 
	statue of Venus.
 
 			MARIETTE 
	I remember.
 
			GASTON
		(irrelevantly)
	You like that statue?
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(nonplussed)
	Not particularly.
 
			GASTON
	Neither do I. 
		(Without any transition.) 
	That's where I found it.
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(naively, not suspicious)
	I don't know how I could have lost 
	it there.  I was nowhere near that 
	niche.
 
			GASTON
	Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are 
	you sure this is your bag?
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(a little nettled)
 	Of course it is! Are you doubting 
	me?
 
			GASTON
		(polite but precise)
 	Not in the least, madame. But you 
	see, it's a very expensive bag--one 
	has to be careful.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(half-annoyed, half-laughing, 
		and a little conceited)
	Well--I am Madame Colet.
 
			GASTON 
		(urbanely)
	And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will 
	allow me to introduce myself.
 
Mariette is perplexed. Their relationship has somehow been 
transformed. She is uncertain. Then she yields.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(With a little laugh; 
		extending her hand)
	Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
 
			GASTON
	The pleasure is mine, madame.
 
He bends over and kisses her hand. Camera goes quickly to a 
close-up of a beautiful diamond ring. As he kisses the hand 
Gaston's eye appraises the ring.
 
STREET IN PARIS 
François, package under arm, walking. It is apparent that 
he has purchased the handbag.
 
LIVING ROOM  CLOSE SHOT
at table. Gaston has just opened the bag.
 
 			GASTON 
		(With the air of an honest 
		man taking inventory)
	One purse-- 
		(shaking it) 
	empty. One vanity case-- 
		(opening it)
 
			MARIETTE
	But really, m'sieu, this isn't 
	necessary.
 
			GASTON
	Please, Madame Colet, I believe in 
	doing things correctly. Shall we 
	continue? 
		(He empties the bag.) 
	Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, 
	one box of real matches, and-- Oh, 
	yes, this letter from Major--
 
			MARIETTE 
		(quickly)
	Oh! You didn't read it!
 
			GASTON
	Naturally I did.
 
			MARIETTE 
	Oh!
 
			GASTON
	You needn't be embarrassed, madame. 
	A lady as charming as you would, and 
	should, get love letters. 

			MARIETTE 
		(embarrassed and flattered)
	M'sieu Laval!
 
			GASTON
	But one suggestion, madame. 
		(Shaking his head.) 
	Not the major. 
		(Mariette looks startled, 
		as if to say, "How did 
		you know?") 
	I don't  mind his grammatical 
	mistakes. I'll overlook his bad 
	punctuation. But the letter has no 
	mystery--no bouquet--no ... 
		(Changing the subject, 
		taking a lipstick out 
		of bag.) 
	And one lipstick ... 
		(Reading markings on 
		bottom; disapproving.) 
	Scarlet number four.
 
			MARIETTE 
	What's wrong now?
 
			GASTON
	With your skin, I prefer crimson. 

			MARIETTE 
		(now on a vital theme)
	Too much blue in crimson.
 
			GASTON
	That's what you need!
 
			MARIETTE 
	No, no, no! 
		(She sits on couch. 
		He sits beside her.) 
	I disagree with you completely! I 
	tried it once--
 
			GASTON
	What shade of powder do you use?
 
			MARIETTE 
	Peaches and cream.
 
			GASTON
	That's too dark.

			MARIETTE 
		(fighting for her life)
	Do you realize I have light eyes?
 
			GASTON
	But, Madame Colet, that's a matter 
	of eye shadow. I can straighten that 
	out in two seconds.

We hear a knock on the door.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(annoyed at interruption)
	Come in!
 
CLOSE-UP  DOOR 
Butler comes in, shuts door quickly behind him.
 
			BUTLER 
		(With a sour expression)
	The major.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON AND MARIETTE 
On couch. She makes a gesture of exasperation. So does 
Gaston. They look at each other helplessly. Then Gaston 
takes charge. He rises and goes toward butler.
 
HALL  MED. SHOT 
at living room door. Major stands waiting. Door opens; 
butler comes out, followed briskly by Gaston.
 
			GASTON 
		(before Major can speak)
	I'm sorry, m'sieu, but Madame had 
	better not see anyone.
 
Major stares blankly. He never saw Gaston before.
 
 			GASTON
 	You see, the bag has just been 
	found, and the reaction of relief 
	from her former excitement and 
	strain is just a little too much 
	for her. It's not very serious, but 
	just the same we'd better not take 
	any chances.
 
			MAJOR 
		(assuming Gaston 
		is a physician)
	Just as you say, Doctor.
 
 			GASTON
	Thank you, Major. 
		(Goes back toward 
		living room.)
 
 			MAJOR
	Good day, Doctor.
 
			GASTON
	Good day, Major.
 
The camera goes with Major toward entrance door. Major 
looks crestfallen.
 
STREET
in front of Mariette's house. François, followed by camera, 
goes to the door, rings bell. Door is opened by butler, and 
Major comes out, butler remaining in doorway. Major and 
François stare at each other. Major looks pointedly at 
François's package. Then Major turns to butler.
 
 			MAJOR
	Jacques, has the bag been found?
 
			BUTLER
	Yes, Major.
 
Major turns with bright smile to François, who looks glum 
and glances instinctively at his package.
 
 			MAJOR
	Is Madame feeling well?
 
			BUTLER
	No, Major.

Major is still looking at the unhappy François and having 
the time of life.
 
 			MAJOR
	Is Madame seeing anybody this 
	afternoon, this evening, or even 
	tomorrow?
 
			BUTLER
	No, Major.
 
 			MAJOR
	You may shut the door, Jacques.

Butler closes door. François, miserable, turns away from 
Major.
 
 			MAJOR
	Well. that leaves you holding the 
	bag. Goodbye!

Major lifts his hat, goes out of picture to right. François 
looks after him angrily, then goes out of picture to left.
 
LIVING ROOM  COUCH  CLOSE SHOT 
Gaston and Mariette. There is a moment of silence.
 
			GASTON
		(rising)
 	Well, I think I'd better be going. 
	Goodbye, Madame Colet.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(rising)
 	Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... 
	This is a rather delicate matter and 
	I don't want to ... You see, if you 
	read my advertisement carefully, you 
	must have noticed that there was ...
 
			GASTON
	In other words, madame, it 
	embarrasses you to offer me the 
	twenty thousand francs reward.
 
			MARIETTE 
	Yes.
 
			GASTON
	Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll 
	take it. I need the money. I wish I 
	were in a position to ignore the 
	whole matter. But you know, madame, 
	the stock market, bank crash ... To 
	make a long story short--a member 
	of the nouveaux poor.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(looks at him sympathetically)
	Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll 
	write you the check immediately. 
		(Followed by camera, she goes.)
 
HALL  MED. SHOT 
at staircase. Coming from living room, Mariette goes up the 
stairs, followed by camera. At first landing, as Mariette 
reaches door--
 
			GASTON'S VOICE 
	Madame Colet!
 
			MARIETTE 
		(turning) 
	Yes, M'sieu Laval?
 
GASTON  BELOW
Shooting down from her angle.
 
			GASTON
	Do you know my first name?

CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 

			MARIETTE
	No. What is it? Tell me.

CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
Followed by camera, he runs up stairs. At the landing, he 
goes close to her.

			GASTON
		(whispering ardently)
	Gaston!

She looks at him with a confused smile.

			GASTON
		(Still ardently)
	And do you know what I'd like to 
	have you do with that check?
 
			MARIETTE 
		(softly, curious)
	What?

			GASTON
		(passionate)
	Make it out to cash!
 
			MARIETTE 
	As you like. 
		(She opens door and 
		he follows her.)
 
LONG SHOT  PRIVATE OFFICE OF FORMER SECRETARY, WITH GLIMPSE 
INTO ADJOINING ELEGANT BEDROOM 
In foreground at desk, is Mariette. In bedroom background, 
Gaston is seen examining a painting on the wall with the air 
of a connoisseur. Camera moves to close-up of Mariette. She 
is opening and shutting drawers.
 
			MARIETTE
	Now, where can that checkbook be? 
	Oh, dear me, dear me! She must have 
	left it somewhere. It's always the 
	same--when you're looking for 
	something, you can't find it. 
		(She continues mumbling 
		and slamming drawers.)
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON
at the wall, still admiring the painting. Now he draws 
painting slightly away from wall and glances behind as if 
looking for a safe. He allows painting to drop back into 
place. Followed by camera, he goes on looking around. He 
stops before window, looks out, studying possible entrances 
and exits.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE
at desk, still searching.

			MARIETTE
	I can't find that checkbook. I 
	should have discharged her six 
	months ago! I really don't know 
	what to do. Where can I look now? 
		(Turning to Gaston.) 
	M'sieu Laval, I'm very sorry, but--

She tops short. Gaston is not there. She sees:
  
DOOR TO FORMER SECRETARY'S BEDROOM 
It is open.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE  
Followed by camera, she goes to bedroom.
 
BEDROOM  MED. SHOT 
at open door. Mariette enters, stops.
 
CLOSE SHOT  BED
Gaston is studying bed with the eye of a connoisseur.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
in doorway. She looks mystified. She moves toward him 
lightly because:
 
CLOSE SHOT  BED 
Gaston apparently doesn't know she is in the room. He is 
still studying bed with scholarly concentration. Mariette 
enters, stops beside him.
 
			GASTON 
		(with respect for the bed)
	Eighteenth century.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(getting it; impressed)
	Yes!
 
			GASTON
	Early eighteenth century. I should 
	say around--seventeen thirty.
 
			MARIETTE 
	Right!
 
			GASTON 
		(examining headboard)
	Beautiful specimen.
 
			MARIETTE
	It is beautiful. But I got a little 
	tired of sleeping in antiques, so I 
	gave it to my secretary.

			GASTON 
		(specially interested as 
		he learns this is not 
		Mariette's room)
	Oh? 
		(He wants to hear more.)
 
			MARIETTE 
	This used to be my secretary's room.

			GASTON 
		(with affected nonchalance)
	I see.
		(Going very close to 
		headboard, touching woodwork 
		with expert hand.)  
	She must have been very happy here.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(with a smile)
 	Too happy. That's why I discharged 
	her.
 
			GASTON 
		(his eye caught by carving 
		on one of the posts)
	Isn't that wonderful! 
		(He turns to Mariette.) 
	You see, madame--
		(He stops, noticing 
		something on the wall.)
 
MED. SHOT
In the wall is a safe. Camera moves to close-up of safe.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE AND GASTON
 
			GASTON 
		(inspired)
	Let me tell you something, madame, 
	as a man who has had all kinds of 
	secretaries ... I wonder if she put 
	that checkbook in the safe!
 
			MARIETTE 
	I hardly think so. But let's look. 
		(She goes toward safe.)
 
CLOSE SHOT  SAFE 
Mariette enters, starts turning knob, lips moving silently 
as she articulates numbers to herself. The camera pans her 
out and stops before Gaston who is now close behind her, 
concentrating on the combination.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE'S HAND 
turning knob back and forth.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON'S HAND 
It is instinctively turning an imaginary knob, following 
Mariette's pattern.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE AND GASTON 
Mariette opens safe. Gaston takes a swift good look into 
safe, but acts casual in case Mariette turns around.
 
			MARIETTE
		(rummaging with her hand)
	No, no. No, it's not here.
		(Suddenly.)  
	Oh! What do you think of that? 
		(She brings out two crisp 
		packages of bank notes.) 
	A hundred thousand francs! 
		(With a half-smile.) 
	You know, I didn't have the 
	slightest idea--
 
			GASTON 
		(severely)
 	But, madame, you keep a hundred 
	thousand francs--in your safe--at 
	home?
 
			MARIETTE 
		(worried)
	You think that's too much?
 
			GASTON 
		(emphatically)
 	No! Not enough! 
		(With the air of a banker.) 
	In times like these, when everything 
	is uncertain, every conservative 
	person should have a substantial 
	part of his fortune within arm's 
	reach.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(nodding with the gravity 
		of a woman accepting her 
		banker's advice)
	That sounds sensible. 
		(She goes out of the picture, 
		thinking it over.)

CLOSE SHOT  LITTLE SETTEE 
Mariette enters, sits.
 
			MARIETTE
	Very sensible!
 
Gaston enters, sits beside her.
 
 			GASTON 
		(sternly; an uncle)
	Madame Colet, I think you deserve a 
	scolding. First, you lose your bag--
 
			MARIETTE 
		(gaily)
	Then I mislay my checkbook--
 
			GASTON
	Then you use the wrong lipstick--
 
			MARIETTE 
		(almost laughing)
	And how I handle my money!
 
			GASTON
	It's disgraceful!

			MARIETTE 
		(with a flirtatious look)
	Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is 
	wrong?
 
			GASTON
	Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I 
	were your father--
		(with a smile) 
	which, fortunately, I am not--
 
			MARIETTE 
		(coquettish)
	Ye-es?
 
			GASTON
	And you made any attempt to handle 
	your own business affairs, I would 
	give you a good spanking--in a 
	business way, of course. 

			MARIETTE 
		(complete change of 
		expression; businesslike)
	What would you do if you were my 
	secretary?
 
			GASTON
	The same thing.
 
			MARIETTE 
	You're hired!

			SEQUENCE E
 
FADE IN 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS ROOM 
Camera moves along the table in close shots of members of 
the board. An excited murmur runs along the table. Camera 
stops in front of M. Giron, the chairman, who is talking to 
the man beside him. Now he turns to opposite end of table, 
rises.
 
			GIRON
	Speaking for the board of directors
	as well as myself, if you insist, in 
	times like these, on cutting the 
	fees of the board of directors, then 
	we resign.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
at opposite end. He gets up with an air of authority.
 
			GASTON
	Speaking for Madame Colet as well as 
	myself--resign!
 
CLOSE-UP  GIRON
 
			GIRON
		(haughtily)
 	Very well! 
		(He hesitates.) 
	We'll think it over, M'sieu Laval!

					DISSOLVE TO:
 
INSURANCE OFFICE  CLOSE SHOT 
of insurance agent at his desk. He is looking over Mme. 
Colet's policies.
 
 			AGENT
	Now, M'sieu Laval, as for Madame 
	Colet's life insurance, it totals 
	one million francs. There is five 
	hundred thousand fire insurance and 
	four hundred thousand against 
	burglary.
 
CLOSE-UP  GASTON
in a different suit. He begins to calculate with his 
fingers and murmurs figures.

			GASTON 
		(after a moment)
	Then we'd better increase the 
	burglary insurance to eight hundred 
	and fifty thousand francs.
 
CLOSE-UP  AGENT 

			AGENT 
		(happily; with a little bow)
	Thank you, M'sieu Laval!
 
CLOSE-UP  COOK 
in the kitchen. Big, fat, motherly looking.
 
			COOK
	No potatoes, M'sieu Laval?
 
CLOSE-UP  GASTON 
In still another suit. He is standing, looking stern.
 
			GASTON
	No potatoes!
 
CLOSE-UP  COOK
 
 			COOK  
	Yes, M'sieu Laval.

A fluffy, pretty little maid in Gaston's bedroom, holding a

			MAID
		(playing naughty)
	Maybe, M'sieu Laval!

  					DISSOLVE TO:

GYMNASIUM  CLOSE SHOT
of Mariette's feet and legs in gymnasium outfit, shooting 
down on an angle. Feet rise and camera follows movement 
arc-wise, comes to rest on Mariette's face.
 
			MARIETTE
		(holding the position)
	Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
erect in sweater, arms folded.
 
			GASTON 
	Absolutely, Madame Colet.
 
 					DISSOLVE TO:

CORRIDOR  CLOSE SHOT 
Gaston in doorway to his office. Evening; lights are on. 
He wears a dark business suit.
 
			MARIETTE'S VOICE 
		(coaxingly)
	Now, M'sieu Laval, please!
 
			GASTON 
	Frankly, madame, I'm too tired.
 
UPPER STAIRCASE 
from Gaston's viewpoint. Mariette, in evening dress, is near 
landing. From downstairs, the music of a tango and laughter 
of guests.
 
			MARIETTE
	Don't you want to come down and 
	join the party? Just a little tango
	--no? Oh, you with your messy old 
	papers and contracts and money-money
	-money--all those uninteresting 
	things!
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON
in doorway.
 
 			GASTON
	They're very interesting to me, 
	madame. And somebody in this house 
	should worry about money. No, 
	madame, really, I have to be up 
	early in the morning.

					DISSOLVE TO:
 
OFFICE  CLOSE SHOT  NEXT MORNING  
of Gaston at window, walking up and down dictating, followed 
by camera. We hear click of a typewriter.
 
			GASTON
	New paragraph. Furthermore, it is 
	Madame's wish--
 
CLOSE SHOT  SECRETARY 
Typing away at an appropriate desk is none other than our 
Lily. She is demure in a little blouse and skirt.
 
			GASTON'S VOICE
 	--that while half of the interest 
	shall be deposited as usual in 
	Madame's account--
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON
 
 			GASTON
	--the other half, contrary to 
	custom, shall be delivered in cash 
	into Madame's personal custody. 
		(Followed by camera, he 
		goes to Lily and takes 
		her in his arms.) 
	Darling, that means that on the 
	second of June we'll have eight 
	hundred and fifty thousand francs.
 
			LILY 
		(ecstatically)
	And her jewelry is worth a fortune!
 
			GASTON
	No jewelry! Hands off jewelry! If 
	we're broke--all right. I might 
	pick up a million-franc necklace. 
	But in times like these when we're 
	doing a cash business--why take a 
	chance on jewelry?
 
Lily gets up, goes to him.
 
 			LILY 
		(the way a wife talks 
		to a husband when she 
		wants something special)
	I know you're awfully busy, and I 
	don't like to trouble you. But she 
	has one little necklace--you know, 
	that one with the seed pearls? It's 
	so quiet and simple. It would go 
	just beautifully with my neck. 

Gaston takes her in his arms, moved. They kiss. There is a 
knock at the door. They leap into employer and employee 
positions.
 
			GASTON
	Come in!
 
DOOR
Butler enters.
 
 			BUTLER
	M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to 
	talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a 
	moment.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON AND LILY
 
 			GASTON
	Very well, Jacques.
 
We hear door close as butler goes. Lily turns to Gaston. He 
looks her over, straightens her hair a little, then pulls 
the zipper on her blouse high up to the neck.

					DISSOLVE TO:
 
MARIETTE'S BEDROOM  CLOSE SHOT 
Mariette in bed. Breakfast table. She is reading a magazine. 
Knock on door.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(putting down magazine)
	Come in.
 
DOOR  CLOSE SHOT 
Lily enters. She is now wearing glasses. (Under no 
circumstances shall her appearance be exaggerated. Lily is 
playing the part of a modest, polite little 
secretary.)
 
			LILY 
	Good morning,  madame.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE
 
			MARIETTE 
	Good morning, mademoiselle. 
		(She makes a gesture 
		inviting Lily to come

CLOSE SHOT  LILY 
She approaches Mariette.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE
in bed. Lily enters.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(indicating a chair)
	Please.
 
 			LILY
    	Thank you.
 
Lily sits on a small chair by the bed. Breakfast table is 
between them.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(busy at the 
		breakfast tray)
	You've had your breakfast--oh, 
	but of course you have.
 
			LILY
	Yes, madame. You see, I have to get 
	up very early. 
		(Chattering.)
	My little brother goes to school-- 
		(With controlled pathos.) 
	You see, Mother is dead.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(pouring her own coffee; 
		making conversation)
	Yes, that's the trouble with 
	mothers. First you get to like them 
	and then they die.
 
Lily nods sad agreement. Her glance drops to the floor.
 
INSERT 
of a diamond ring on floor by bed.
 
CLOSE SHOT  LILY 
She looks at ring with undisguised desire for an instant. 
Then she reaches for it.
 
INSERT 
Lily's hand lifts ring from floor.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE AND LILY 
Seeing that she has been observed, Lily hands ring to 
Mariette.
 
 			MARIETTE
	Oh, thanks. 

With indifference she throws it over toward night table on 
the other side of the bed.
 
NIGHT TABLE 
A little jewel box, open. The ring falls in.
 
CLOSE SHOT  LILY 
She looks toward the jewel box with regret, fingers itching. 
She pulls herself together and sits on her hands.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE AND LILY
Mariette is just about to reach for the cream. Lily, quick 
and polite, takes the cream pitcher and pours for Mariette.
 
 			MARIETTE
	Thank you! ... Now, mademoiselle, 
	the reason I asked you to come--
 
			LILY
	Two lumps, madame?
 
 			MARIETTE
	Please! 
		(Lily puts sugar 
		in coffee.) 
	Thank you. 

			LILY
		(taking a spoon)
	May I?
 
Mariette nods graciously. Lily stirs the coffee. Then she 
sits and resolutely puts her hands under again.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
She lifts cup, sips coffee. She looks over at Lily.
 
CLOSE-UP  LILY 
Looking downward modestly.
 
CLOSE-UP  MARIETTE 
She watches Lily a moment to make sure she is not looking. 
Then she dunks a roll in the coffee and takes a quick bite.

CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE AND LILY 

			MARIETTE
	Now, Mademoiselle Gautier--

			LILY
	Yes, madame?
   
			MARIETTE
	You see-- 
		(She has just picked up 
		some potato a la Julienne
		--thinly shredded, noodle-like 
		and crisp--on her fork. Then 
		she speaks furtively as she 
		suddenly remembers.) 
	Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
 
			LILY
	About what?
 
			MARIETTE 
		(almost in a whisper)
	Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat 
	them-- 
		(with a little laugh) 
	and naturally I don't want to upset 
	him.
 
 			LILY 
		(with a poisonous 
		little giggle)
 	Naturally not! 
		
Slowly her giggle dies out, and she looks at Mariette with 
sly contempt.
 
 			MARIETTE
 	Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short 
	time you have been M'sieu Laval's 
	secretary, have you noticed any 
	change in him?
 
 			LILY 
		(on guard)
    	Well--uh--yes and no.
 
 			MARIETTE
	To me he seems rather nervous.
 
 			LILY 
	Nervous? 
		(She takes a chance.) 
	Um-hum. He smokes too much!
 
			MARIETTE
	No, he works too much. 
		(Lily nods with 
		great relief.) 
	He's chained to his desk. Too much 
	detail. Now, if you could take over 
	some of his work--

			LILY 
		(with deadly sweetness)
	So he wouldn't be confined so much 
	to his office--
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(innocently pleased)
	Yes! And he would have a little 
	more time for--
 
 			LILY
	For all the really important 
	things--
 
 			MARIETTE 
	Right!
 
 			LILY 
		(rising)
	I'll do my best, madame, even if I 
	have to work every night.

 			MARIETTE 
		(frightened)
 	Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! 
	That's ridiculous. You go home as 
	usual--five o'clock every day. Now 
	I'm going to be a little bit of a 
	tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for 
	your little brother, too. Five 
	o'clock--remember!
 
 			LILY 
	Very well, madame. Thank you. 
		(She starts to leave.)
 
CLOSE SHOT  DOOR 
Lily opens door.
 
 			MARIETTE'S VOICE
	And, my dear--
 
 			LILY 
		(turns)
	Yes, madame?
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
 
			MARIETTE
 	How much is your salary?
 
CLOSE SHOT  LILY
in doorway. 

 			LILY 
	Three hundred francs.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
 
			MARIETTE 
	Well, in times like these most 
	people are cutting salaries, but 
	suppose we say, in your case, 
	three hundred and fifty?
 
CLOSE SHOT  LILY
 
			LILY
	Oh, madame, you're just too sweet 
	for words! 
		(She goes, shutting door.)
 
MED. SHOT  OFFICE
close to door. Gaston is pacing up and down. Lily enters, 
quickly closes door behind her. She takes off her glasses. 
She is seething.
 
 			GASTON
  	Well, what does she want?
 
 			LILY 
		(bitterly)
	You! And she's willing to pay as 
	high as fifty francs!
 
 			GASTON
	What?
 
 			LILY 
		(violently)
	But it's not enough!
 
MARIETTE'S BEDROOM  CLOSE SHOT
Mariette, still in bed, talking into phone.
 
			MARIETTE
	Now, François, don't be silly. I 
	have nothing against you ... Oh, no, 
	that's all forgotten ... What? ...
	Not this week, François ... 
		(Happily.) 
	Business, François, business!
 
OFFICE  MED. SHOT
which during the scene moves to a closer shot of Gaston and 
Lily. As we pick them up both are pacing up and down at the 
height of unpleasantness.

			GASTON
 	You're talking like a child. You 
	know exactly what we're here for 
	and what it's all about.
 
			LILY 
		(stopping)
	This woman has more than jewelry.
 
			GASTON 
		(dismissing it)
	Ah!
 
 			LILY
 	Did you ever take a good look at 
	her--uh--
 
 			GASTON
 	Certainly!
 
 			LILY
 	They're all right, aren't they?
 
 			GASTON
	Beautiful. And what of it? 
		(Going close to Lily; 
		with conviction)
	Let me tell you something: so far 
	as I'm concerned, her whole sex 
	appeal is in that safe!
 
			LILY
		(looks at him a moment; 
		suddenly fearful)
	Gaston. Let's open it--right now! 
	Let's get away from here! 
		(With great unhappiness; 
		holding back her tears.) 
	I don't like this place!
 
 			GASTON
		(taking her in his arms)
	Oh, no, darling. There's more sex 
	appeal coming on the first of the 
	month.  It's only ten days ...  
		(Rolling it on 
		his tongue.) 
	Eight hundred and fifty thousand 
	francs.       

			LILY
		(clinging to him)
	Darling, remember you're Gaston 
	Monescu. You're a crook. I want you 
	as a crook. I love you as a crook. 
	I worship you as a crook. Steal, 
	swindle, rob--but don't become one 
	of those useless, good-for-nothing 
	gigolos!

 	Good night, Gaston darling.
 
			GASTON'S VOICE
	Good night, sweetheart.
 
We hear sound of a kiss.
 
			LILY'S VOICE
	Well, I leave you alone with that

	Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
 
 			GASTON'S VOICE
     	Yes, Madame Colet?
 
			MARIETTE'S VOICE 
	Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
 
			GASTON'S VOICE 
	Yes--uh--
 
			MARIETTE'S VOICE 
		(With feigned regret)
 	Oh, that's too bad. You see, I 
	wanted her to do something.  Well, 
	I guess I'll have to do it myself.
 
			GASTON'S VOICE
	What is it, madame? 

			MARIETTE'S VOICE 
	I wanted to ask her to ask you if 
	you'd be good enough to go out to 
	dinner with me tonight.

We hear her laugh. He joins her. As the laugh gets louder we

From outside, faint voices. We hear door open, and a bar of

	Good night, Madame Colet. And let 
	me tell you again--you dance like a

	Well, the evening is still young.

	It's only ten o'clock.
 
She laughs. He apparently joins her again.

LIVING ROOM  CLOSE-UP
of a different, more decorative clock on mantel. Hands stand 
at eleven. As clock strikes eleven, with dainty, rapid 
chimes, pan along one side, following mantel, until clock is 
out of picture, and we see two half-empty champagne glasses.

					DISSOLVE TO:
 
CLOSE SHOT  WINDOW
Open window frames a view of garden. Foreground is dark. 
Above trees, a church steeple with a clock large enough so 
that we can read the time. It is twelve. As we hear, in 
splendid tones and a slower rhythm, the tolling of midnight, 
pan over to the side. Steeple is out of picture and full 
moon comes in.

					DISSOLVE TO:
 
HALL  UPPER END OF STAIRS 
Close shot of hall clock near Mariette's bedroom door. Hands 
indicate the hour of two, and deep tones strike the hour. 
Apparently there is only a dim light. Camera pans to door of 
Mariette's bedroom. In half-open doorway stands Mariette, 
evening dress, looking toward office door, eyes languorous.
 
			MARIETTE
		(reluctantly) 
	Good night, M'sieu Laval.
 
CLOSE SHOT  OFFICE DOOR 
In half-open doorway stands Gaston, white tie and tails.
  
 			GASTON

	Good night, Madame Colet.
 
MED. SHOT  HALL 
At one end, at her open bedroom door, is Mariette. At other 
end, as we have seen, is Gaston. They look at each other for 
a vibrant moment.
 
			MARIETTE
		(since nothing happens; sadly)
	Good night.
 
			GASTON 
		(also sad)
	Good night.
 
Mariette goes into her room, closes door. Gaston stands a 
moment in his doorway, undecided. Then, with a decisive air, 
he goes halfway toward Mariette's door. He stops abruptly at 
the one light, a lamp on the wall. He turns it out. Then he 
goes back to his office-bedroom slowly. Camera moves closer 
to him and up to his door. He goes in, shuts door, and we 
hear the lock click from inside. Camera pans quickly to 
Mariette's door. We hear similar click.

					FADE OUT
 
 			SEQUENCE G
 
FADE IN 

LIVING ROOM 
A large window, consisting of four or five framed units, 
fronts on a terraced garden in which a small informal party 
is underway. 

Close shot of the first frame, showing part of garden and 
terrace. Windows are shut; we cannot hear what is going on. 
Beyond window, on terrace: a group of society people, 
teacups, butler serving cakes from tray. Mariette comes from 
garden to join group, a cordial hostess As she moves her eye 
is caught elsewhere.
 
CAMERA PANS QUICKLY to the last window frame, following her 
glance, and stops before Gaston and two very attractive 
young ladies who seem delighted at what he is saying. 
Mariette comes quickly into the picture and, pretending she 
wants to introduce him to someone else, takes Gaston from 
his dangerous companions.
 
CAMERA MOVES 
back along window with them. As soon as the two young ladies 
are out of the picture, Mariette brings Gaston intimately 
close toward window and camera. (Assumption is that living 
room is empty and no one can see them from behind camera.) 
Charmingly and with a twinkle in her eye, she reprimands 
him, in a guarded whisper, about flirting. He answers and 
apparently says something that makes her laugh, disarming 
her. With a sudden return to party manner, she moves with 
him along the framed windows. Camera goes with them as she 
introduces him to a few little groups. By this time, they 
are back in the first window frame, and now they move out 
of picture.
 
CAMERA CONTINUES 
past window and discloses inside corner of living room. In 
a chair, sitting stiffly as if in a waiting room, is M. 
Giron, the chairman of the board, briefcase on knees, 
flower in buttonhole. He seems in a bad mood--apparently 
the financial cut hasn't agreed with him. We hear a door 
opening.
 
			BUTLER'S VOICE
	M'sieu Giron, Madame will be with 
	you presently.
 
			GIRON
	Very well, Jacques.
 
We hear door closing. Giron, irritated, gets up and, 
followed by camera, goes toward the window.
 
TERRACE  CLOSE SHOT 
at window shooting into living room. Giron comes toward 
window and looks into garden. His face gets stern and angry 
as he sees:
 
GARDEN  CLOSE SHOT 
Giron's view, of Gaston and the major, animatedly conversing. 
Camera angle must be so that Gaston is more prominent, thus 
giving impression that Giron's attention is focused on 
Gaston.
 
			GASTON
	No, no, my dear Major. There's a 
	limit to what you can do with 
	infantry. If have you the proper 
	artillery backing, I would say--
	maybe.
  
TERRACE  CLOSE SHOT 
toward window. Behind window stands Giron, muttering 
imprecations under his breath.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MAJOR AND GASTON
 
 			MAJOR 
	No, no, no! I disagree with you 
	absolutely. That's the trouble with 
	you artillery men.
 
 			GASTON
 	Now just a minute, Major--
 
 			MAJOR
   	No, Captain, I tell you--

Mariette comes into the picture.
 
 			MARIETTE
 	Now, Major, you mustn't monopolize 
	M'sieu Laval. 
		(To Gaston.) 
	Please! 
		(She leads Gaston away, 
		camera with them. They 
		stop before another group. 
		She introduces Gaston.) 
	May I present M'sieu Laval? Madame 
	Chotard, Madame Leconte, Madame 
	Poncelet. 
		(Camera moves with them 
		to a lady and a gentleman.) 
	Madame Rudaux, M'sieu Legrand--
	M'sieu Laval. 
		(They move to François 
		and a lady.) 
	M'sieu Laval--Madame Boucher. M'sieu 
	Filiba. 
		(François bows, not 
		recognizing Gaston. 
		Camera moves along 
		with them to others.) 
	M'sieu Laval--Madame Jeantaud, 
	M'sieu Gentil.
 
Gaston, his back to camera, bows politely; then suddenly--
a second "take"--he looks over his shoulder toward François. 
It is apparent he has recognized François. Mariette moves 
Gaston along.
 
CLOSE SHOT  FRANÇOIS AND LADY
 
 			LADY
	That's that M'sieu Laval.
 
 			FRANÇOIS
 	Laval? Who is M'sieu Laval?
 
 			LADY
	I don't know. She says he's her 
	secretary.
 
François turns and looks searchingly at Gaston, who has 
paused with Mariette at another group.

 			FRANÇOIS
	Oh? ... So!
 
  			LADY
	And he says he is her secretary. Maybe 
	I'm wrong--maybe he is her secretary. 
		(She laughs cynically.)
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
Mariette has apparently left the last group, and he remains. 
The others, at the moment, are busy with tea and cakes; no 
one talks. Gaston, back to camera, steals another look over 
his shoulder at François.
 
CLOSE SHOT  FRANÇOIS 
from Gaston's viewpoint. He is staring at this new and 
dubious figure in Mariette's life--Gaston. 

CLOSE SHOT  GASTON
with the group. He sees that François is staring at him, 
becomes a little uncomfortable. With sudden decision, he 
turns to the group.
 
			GASTON  
	Excuse me, please. 

Followed by camera, he steps over to François. Camera stops 
in a close shot on Gaston, François, and lady. Gaston bows 
to lady, faces François.

			GASTON  
	Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the 
	feeling we have met somewhere 
	before. 

			FRANÇOIS 
		(snobbish, polite)
 	I'm sorry, but I don't seem to 
	recall the occasion. No, I'm 
	afraid ...
 
			GASTON
		(courteously)
	Well--then it must be my mistake. 
		(Bowing.) 
	I beg your pardon. 

He smiles, ignoring the snub, as François stands with 
frozen superiority. Gaston goes. François looks after him.
 
			FRANÇOIS 
		(to the lady)
	That man never met me, and he knows 
	it. Trying to make social 
	connections!
 
LIVING ROOM  MARIETTE AND GIRON
On a table is a pile of business papers and an empty 
briefcase. Giron has fountain pen in his hand, ready to 
turn it over to Mariette for signature.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(With a despairing 
		little laugh)
 	But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm 
	having a tea party. Must I be 
	bothered with all these papers now?
 
			GIRON
	I'm sorry, madame, but there are 
	still certain matters which I think 
	you should attend to yourself. And 
	I, personally, would not care to 
	refer them to--to-- 
		(He hesitates.)
 
 			MARIETTE
 	To M'sieu Laval?
 
Giron doesn't answer. There is a pause.
 
 			GIRON 
		(With dignity)
 	Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the 
	confidence of your family for more 
	than forty years. 
		(With great feeling.)
	I was a school friend of your 
	husband's ...
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(looking at his white hair, 
		which tells the whole story 
		of her marriage; grimly)
	I know!
 
 			GIRON  
	Madame, let me ask you: Who is 
	M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he 
	come from? What is he?
 
			MARIETTE 
		(crisply)
 	He is my secretary! I hope that 
	answers all your questions, M'sieu 
	Giron.
 
 			GIRON 
		(after a pause)
	You know what Paris is saying 
	about the Countess Falconier and 
	her chauffeur?

			MARIETTE 
		(outraged--furious, then 
		icy; turning to door)
	Jacques!
 
CLOSE SHOT  DOOR 
It opens; butler enters.
 
			BUTLER
 	Yes, madame?
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE AND GIRON 

			MARIETTE
	Ask M'sieu Laval if he will be 
	good enough to come in. 

			BUTLER'S VOICE
	Very well, madame. 

We hear the door closing.
 
GARDEN  CLOSE SHOT 
of lady and François at a table. François is very fidgety.
 
			LADY
	Now, please. Please calm yourself!
 
			FRANÇOIS
	I'm like that--I can't help it! I 
	know I never met that man, and yet--
		(Looking in Gaston's 
		direction.) 
	Laval, Laval ... You know, if I 
	like a man, I remember him. And if 
	I don't like a man, I never forget 
	him. In a nutshell, madame, it's 
	little things like that that drive 
	me crazy! Excuse me! 
		(He gets up and walks 
		out of the picture.)
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
in garden. He is about to join another group when François 
stops him.
 
			FRANÇOIS
	M'sieu Laval ...
 
			GASTON
	Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
 
			FRANÇOIS
	You see-- 
		(He stops to look Gaston 
		over from all angles, 
		tortured with uncertainty. 
		Shaking his head and 
		smiling.) 
	No, no! And yet-- 
		(He looks at Gaston 
		intently again.) 
	Did I--did--now where could we have--

They are interrupted by entrance of butler.
 
			BUTLER 
		(to Gaston)
	Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet 
	would like to see you in the
	living room. 

			GASTON
	At once, Jacques. 
		(To François.) 
	We'll continue later.
 
He goes. François now has jealousy added to his confused 
suspicion. As he glares after Gaston the major enters.
 
			MAJOR
	Now see here, my good man, let's 
	face the facts. I'm having a dinner 
	party, and one man turned me down 
	at the last minute. 
		(Very cutting.) 
	Have you a dinner jacket? 
		(François stiffens.)
 
MED. SHOT  LIVING ROOM 
Giron and Mariette. The situation is tense. Gaston enters.
 
			GASTON 
		(With a bow)
	Madame.
 
 			MARIETTE
 	Will you be good enough to run 
	through these papers with M'sieu 
	Giron?
 
			GASTON
	I'll be delighted.

			MARIETTE 
		(to Giron, sharply)
	And so will M'sieu Giron. 

Giron bows. Mariette turns.
 
LIVING ROOM  DOOR 
Mariette goes out.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GIRON AND GASTON 
For a moment the men eye each other. Gaston smiles, but 
Giron maintains a frigid face. Gaston calmly takes the 
papers, sits, and starts to go over the figures.
 
			GIRON
 	M'sieu Laval, there are several 
	things I've wanted to ask you for 
	quite a while. I understand you are 
	from Marseilles. 

			GASTON 
		(pretending to be absorbed 
		in the figures; absently)
	Um-hum ... 

			GIRON 
		(persistently)
	You must be related to the Lavals 
	of Marseilles.
 
			GASTON 
		(With pretense of being 
		mildly distracted)
	Just a second. 

He goes over the papers even more thoroughly, turns several 
pages, then turns back, apparently comparing items, 
muttering figures to himself.

			GIRON 
		(sarcastically)
	I hope you find the figures correct. 

			GASTON 
		(pointedly)
	I hope so, too.

			GIRON 
		(with indignation)
 	M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the 
	confidence of this family--

			GASTON 
		(not looking up)
	For more than forty years. So Madame told me. 

			GIRON 
		(change of tone; 
		very deliberately)
	And I have known the Lavals of 
	Marseilles for more than thirty 
	years.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON
Deaf to Giron, concentrating on figures, he turns absently 
to the window and suddenly comes awake, for he sees:
 
CLOSE SHOT  WINDOW  
Gaston's viewpoint. Outside window, on terrace, stands 
François. He is staring at Gaston as if to say, "Where did 
I see him?"
 
BIG CLOSE-UP  GASTON 
He smiles cordially at François.
 
CLOSE SHOT  FRANÇOIS 
through window. He begins to smile, then shakes head as if 
saying, "No, that's not the fellow." He goes out of the 
picture.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON AND GIRON 
Gaston still smiling toward window. Now he turns back to the 
papers and begins muttering more figures.
 
			GIRON
		(in a cutting voice)
 	M'sieu Laval, you seem to be 
	avoiding my questions.
 
			GASTON
	And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be 
	disturbing my examination of this 
	report.
 
			GIRON 
 	Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are 
	you insinuating? I have enjoyed the 
	confidence of this family for more 
	than forty years. How long have you 
	enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three 
	weeks, I believe.
 
			GASTON 
		(coolly)
	Two weeks and three days.
 
			GIRON 
		(nastily)
 	Um-hum!
 
 			GASTON 
		(very softly)
	Are you insinuating anything, M'sieu 
	Giron?
 
 			GIRON 
		(With equal softness 
		and a sudden smile) 
	No, not at all! 

			GASTON 
		(beaming)
	Well, that's fine. Then you are not 
	insinuating that I am avoiding 
	questions. And I am not insinuating 
	that you won't let me examine this 
	report.

			GIRON 
		(continuing the friendly 
		note; with an innocent 
		chuckle)
	I was only asking if you are related 
	to the Lavals of Marseilles.
 
 			GASTON 
		(even more friendly)
	And I was only asking you if you 
	would let me examine your report 
	without interruption.
 
			GIRON 
		(like a man about to 
		make a new friend)
 	I don't see why any man should get 
	excited when he is asked about his 
	hometown.
 
 			GASTON
 	And I don't see any reason for any 
	man getting nervous when somebody 
	checks over the figures of his 
	report.
 
 			GIRON 
		(sudden change; enraged)
	Are you insinuating that this is 
	not an honest report?
 
			GASTON 
		(With vigor)
	I am only insinuating that you are 
	nervous.
 
 			GIRON 
		(furious)
	Nervous! Why should I be nervous? 

			GASTON 
		(With deadly sincerity)
	I don't know, M'sieu Giron!
 
Outraged, Giron picks up the batch of papers, shakes it in 
Gaston's face.
 
			GIRON
	Are you trying to say that there 
	is anything in these figures to 
	make me nervous?
 
Gaston pauses, and we see his suspicion has become a 
certainty.
 
			GASTON 
		(with a quiet smile) 
	No, not at all.
 
With quick, casual movement, Gaston takes the report from 
Giron's hand, drops it in desk, locks desk, and puts key in 
his pocket. Giron is speechless, frightened to his heels.
 
			GASTON 
		(getting up; amiably)
 	We'll keep these papers here. 
		(Taking Giron by the arm, 
		he leads him toward door. 
		Camera follows them from 
		behind.) 
	And tomorrow morning I'll drop in at 
	your office, and I'll tell you all 
	about the Lavals of Marseilles. 
		(Giron looks back over 
		his shoulder toward the 
		desk in a panic.)  
	And there won't be any tea party to 
	interrupt us! 

They reach the door. He escorts Giron out, follows, closes 
the door.
 
GARDEN  CLOSE SHOT
at a table. On table is an ashtray. François is sitting by 
table, an unlighted cigarette in his hand, very thoughtful, 
still trying to place Gaston. He puts cigarette in his 
mouth, takes a match from ashtray, which is equipped with 
matchbox. He lights cigarette and suddenly looks at ashtray.
 
CLOSE SHOT  ASHTRAY
It is made in the shape of a gondola.
 
CLOSE-UP  FRANÇOIS 
staring at the gondola. We see that his mind is grappling, 
trying to connect gondola, Venice, and Gaston. He rises, 
brain working.
 
MED. SHOT  DOOR IN ENTRANCE HALL 
In the half-open doorway stands Gaston.
 
			GASTON
		(out toward street)
 	Goodbye, M'sieu Giron! 

He shuts door quickly and goes out of picture toward stairway.
 
LONG SHOT  STAIRWAY 
Gaston runs quickly up.
 
MED. SHOT  OFFICE
at the door. Gaston opens door, enters, closes it quickly 
with great excitement.
 
CLOSE SHOT  DESK
Lily is typing. She is startled at Gaston's sudden entrance 
and gets up.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
at door. Followed by camera, he goes to Lily.
 
			GASTON
	Do you know who is here? 
		(There is a knock on the 
		door. Lily goes quickly 
		back to typewriter.) 
	Come in!
 
CLOSE SHOT  DOOR
Butler opens.

			BUTLER
	M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would 
	like very much to see you.
 
CLOSE SHOT  LILY AND GASTON 
 
			GASTON
	In a moment.

We hear door shut. Lily gets up, puzzled. The name sounds 
slightly familiar to her.
 
			LILY
	Filiba ...
 
			GASTON
	Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel--
	room two fifty-three--
 
			LILY 
		(it dawns on her)
	Five, seven, and nine--
 
			GASTON
	Yes! 
		(With swift reassurance.) 
	Now don't worry! 

Followed by camera, he hastens out, closing door behind him.
 
LONG SHOT  STAIRWAY 
Gaston comes quickly down, goes out toward entrance door.

ENTRANCE HALL  CLOSE SHOT
of François, waiting, hat in hand, ready to leave. Gaston enters.

			FRANÇOIS
	I wanted to say goodbye to you. 

			GASTON
		(quickly)
 	Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
		(He starts away. 
		François stops him.)
 
			FRANÇOIS
	But before I say goodbye I want to 
	ask you one question: Have you ever 
	been in Venice?

			GASTON
	No.
 
			FRANÇOIS
	You've never been in Venice?
 
			GASTON
	No ... 
		(Suddenly.) 
	Have you ever been in Vienna? 

			FRANÇOIS
		(taken aback)
	No.
 
			GASTON
	Amsterdam?

			FRANÇOIS
	No.
 
			GASTON
	Constantinople?
 
			FRANÇOIS
	No.
 
			GASTON
		(with astonishment)
	You've never been in Constantinople? 

			FRANÇOIS
	No!
 
			GASTON
	But you have been in Venice? 

			FRANÇOIS
	Yes!
 
 			GASTON
  	Let me tell you, Venice can't 
	compare with Constantinople.
 
 			FRANÇOIS
	But--
 
			GASTON
	I don't care what you say! In 
	Constantinople at least you have 
	streets, sultans, pashas--
 
			FRANÇOIS 
		(up a new alley; with a 
		new, naughty interest)
	And harems ... ?
 
			GASTON
	All kinds.
 
François leans over and whispers a question. Gaston nods 
vigorously, then leans over and whispers in François's ear. 
François's eyes get bigger and bigger. The two men look at 
each other with a big smile. François extends his hand.
 
			FRANÇOIS 
		(as they shake; 
		almost singing)
	Well--Con-stan-ti-nople!
 
Followed by camera, François goes toward street door, opens 
it, then stops and turns around. His face suddenly sobers. 
He looks at Gaston.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON
at foot of staircase. He bows smilingly to François.
 
CLOSE SHOT  DOORWAY 
François looks searchingly at Gaston for a long moment, 
then turns and departs, still puzzled.
 
MED. SHOT  GASTON 
Once door is shut, there is a swift change on his face. He 
turns and dashes upstairs.
 
OFFICE  CLOSE SHOT
at door. Gaston enters and, followed by camera, goes swiftly 
to desk, past Lily, who stands fearful and ready for action, 
straight to the phone.
 
			GASTON
	Éysée seven, eight, nine, two. 
		(To Lily.) 
	We have to clear out. 
		(Into phone.) 
	Railroad station? Ticket office, 
	please.
 
 			LILY
		(excitedly)
	He recognized you!
 
			GASTON
	No--not yet--but-- 
		(Into phone.) 
	Two tickets to Berlin--first class
	and sleeper--night train ... Right 
	... Right ... Leave them in the 
	name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... 
	Right ... Thank you. 
		(Hangs up.)
 
 			LILY
		(who already has got at 
		a telephone directory)
	Spanish passports?
 
			GASTON
	Correct. Now the train leaves--
 
 			LILY
	At twelve twenty. I know. 
		(She grabs phone.) 
	Lyons two, four, seven, one. 
		(Hand over mouthpiece.) 
	Two more days and we'd have seven 
	hundred and fifty thousand francs 
	more!
 
 			GASTON
	Well, we'll have to take what's 
	here. A bird in hand is worth two
	in jail.
 
 			LILY
 		(into phone)
	Hello ... Is this the Spanish 
	consulate? This is Doña Ignacio 
	Fernandez. 
		(In Spanish.) 
	My husband and I are leaving tonight 
	for Berlin ... Is it too late to get 
	a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank 
	you, thank you. 
		(She hangs up. To 
		Gaston; in English.) 
	How long will it take you?
 
 			GASTON
	I don't know. Fortunately, she has a 
	dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet 
	you at the station--midnight.  
		(Lily hastens out.  Phone 
		rings. Gaston answers.) 
	Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found 
	a handbag? Well, you're three weeks 
	too late! 
		(He hangs up. Lily 
		swiftly returns, wearing 
		hat and jacket.)
 
			LILY
	Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
 
 			GASTON
	By the way, how is your German?
 
			LILY
	Grossartig--kolossal!
 
			GASTON
	Also, um zwoelf Uhr.
 
			LILY
	Am Berliner Zug.
 
			GASTON
	Auf wiedersehn.
 
			LILY
 	Auf wiedersehn. 

A quick kiss. She speeds out.

			GASTON 
		(into phone)
	Marchand two, nine, one, one ... 
	Hello ... Is this the Petit Flower 
	Shop? This is Don Ignacio Fernandez. 
	I'd like you to take five dozen 
	roses--deep red roses--and I'd like 
	you to put them in a basket and send 
	the basket tomorrow morning to 
	Madame Mariette Colet. The Madame 
	Colet ... Yes ... You have the 
	address? ... Good! And attach a 
	card: "In memory of the late M'sieu

	it to Madame Colet. Yes.] Thank you.

razor in the other, sitting on edge of bathtub, still trying 
to figure out where he saw Gaston.
 
					DISSOLVE TO:

STAIRCASE  MARIETTE'S HOUSE  MED. SHOT 
at door to her bedroom. Mariette, in evening gown and wrap, 
comes out. About to go downstairs, she stops. Followed by 
camera, she goes to office door, knocks. Door opens, and 
Gaston appears.
 
			GASTON
	Yes, madame?
 
			MARIETTE 
		(very charming) 
	What are you going to do with my day 
	tomorrow, M'sieu Laval? 

			GASTON
		(looks at her a moment 
		with real feeling, knowing 
		he is saying goodbye)
	Well, we'll have breakfast in the 
	garden.
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(nodding)
	Um-hum ...
 
			GASTON
	Then riding together. 

 			MARIETTE 
		(nodding)
	Um-hum ...
 
			GASTON
	Then lunch in the Bois--
 
 			MARIETTE 
	Together.

			GASTON
	Then a little nap--
  
 			MARIETTE 
		(restrains an automatic 
		"together" and smiles, 
		a bit embarrassed)
 	How do you like my dress?
 
			GASTON
		(meaning it)
	Beautiful.
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(seductively)
	Hair?
 
 			GASTON
 	Marvelous.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(closer; softly)
	Lipstick?
 
Gaston leans to inspect her mouth; any moment they might 
kiss.
 
			GASTON
	Crimson!
 
			MARIETTE 
		(Still softer)
	Correct! 
		(After a slight pause; 
		extending her hand.) 
	Good night.
 
 			GASTON 
		(taking hand; slowly)
	Good night. 
		(He kisses her hand.)
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(without withdrawing hand)
	Good night.
 
			GASTON 
		(slowly letting hand drop; 
		in a slightly different 
		voice)
	Goodbye.
 
He remains in doorway looking after her as, followed by 
camera, she goes to the staircase. When she is down a few 
steps:
 
 			GASTON'S VOICE 
	Madame.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(pausing on steps)
	Yes?
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
in office doorway.
 
 			GASTON
 	Are you staying out late?

He sees she misunderstood, is a little embarrassed.

 	Why do you ask?
 
CLOSE-UP  GASTON 
He cannot tell the truth and is so truly smitten that he 
hates to lead her on.
 
CLOSE-UP  MARIETTE
convinced he is shyly in love with her and needs assistance. 

			MARIETTE 
		(repeats softly)
	Why do you ask, M'sieu Laval?
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON
 
			GASTON
		(with a helpless smile)
	Do I have to answer?
 
CLOSE-UP  MARIETTE 
Her lips form the inaudible whispered answer.
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(soundlessly) 
	No!
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON  
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
Looks after him an instant, then, followed by camera, goes 
slowly downstairs, very happy; her love affair is coming to 
a head. She stops. On impulse, she turns and, followed by 
camera, goes quickly up stairs to his office and enters, 
closing door behind her.
 
				DISSOLVE TO: 

LILY'S HOTEL ROOM 
Lily is packing--Gaston's clothes and her own. She gaily 
hums a well-known Spanish fandango.
 
LONG SHOT  UPPER STAIRCASE 
Mariette's home, including office door and door to 
Mariette's bedroom. Butler comes up stairs, goes to 
Mariette's door, knocks. Door to office opens and Mariette 
comes out, now without her wrap.
 
			MARIETTE
	Yes, Jacques?
 
CLOSE SHOT  BUTLER 
Turns, puzzled to see Mariette in office doorway.
 
 			BUTLER
	The car is waiting, madame.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
 
			MARIETTE
	I won't need the car, Jacques. I'm 
	not going. 

She turns back, shuts office door.
 
CLOSE SHOT  BUTLER 
at bedroom door.
 
 			BUTLER
		(dazed)
 	Very well, madame! 

Followed by camera, he starts down staircase, muttering to 
himself.

Door opens; Gaston comes out quickly.

 	Very well, m'sieu! 

Followed by camera, he continues down stairs, punch-drunk.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE AND GASTON 
in office. Gaston has just closed door.
 
			MARIETTE
	But I told you I don't want to go.
 
 			GASTON
	But you have an engagement, and I 
	don't want people to talk.
 
			MARIETTE
	Talk? About me--about us? 

 			GASTON
	Precisely.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(ironically)
	Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, 
	M'sieu Laval?
 
 			GASTON
	No--yours, madame. 

			MARIETTE 
		(after a slight pause)
	M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession 
	to make to you ... 

Gaston, remembering that Lily once used the same phrase 
before she him a crook, turns with a flash of alarm.
 
			MARIETTE 
	You like me. In fact, you're crazy 
	about me. Otherwise, you wouldn't 
	worry about my reputation. Isn't 
	that so? 

Gaston looks at her with relief and delight. She is as 
charming as if she herself were a crook.
 
			MARIETTE 
	But incidentally, let me tell you, 
	I don't like you. I don't like you 
	at all! 
		(Going close to him.)
	I wouldn't hesitate one instant to 
	ruin your reputation--like that! 
		(She snaps her fingers.) 

			GASTON
		(loving the game; 
		stepping closer)
	You would?
 
			MARIETTE 
		(even closer)
	Yes, I would!

			GASTON
    		(snapping his fingers)
	Like that?
 
			MARIETTE 
		(snapping her fingers again)
	Like that!
 
			GASTON 
		(playing tough)
	I know all your tricks.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(also tough)
	And you're going to fall for them.
 
 			GASTON
 	So you think you can get me?
 
 			MARIETTE
	Any minute I want!
 
 			GASTON
	You're conceited--
 
 			MARIETTE
 	But attractive--
 
 			GASTON
 	Now, let me tell you--
 
			MARIETTE
	Shut up--kiss me! 
		(Gaston embraces and 
		kisses her. She kisses 
		him ardently, then frees 
		herself for a moment, 
		holds him off.) 
	Wasting all this marvelous time 
	with arguments! 
		(Kisses him again. He 
		takes her in his arms.)
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON'S TELEPHONE 
It rings several times. No one answers.
 
LOWER HALL TELEPHONE  CLOSE SHOT 
It is ringing--a different tone from the one we have just 
heard. Butler enters and answers.
  
 			BUTLER
	Hello ... Well, I'll try him again. 
		(He pushes a button.) 
	Yes, he's in his office, but he's 
	busy ... Madame Colet? She's still 
	here--yes ... But she's busy, too 
	... Well, I'll ring again.
 
LANDING ON UPPER STAIRCASE  MED. SHOT 
office door. Telephone still ringing inside. Nobody seems 
to answer.
 
LILY'S HOTEL ROOM  CLOSE SHOT 
Lily at phone, putting down receiver. She sits, very 
thoughtful. She tries to hum the fandango she had been 
humming so gaily before. Now it comes in fragments as she 
moves about, sits, gets up. She is worried and suspicious.
 
 					DISSOLVE TO:
 
MED. SHOT  UPPER STAIRCASE 
Hall clock is striking eight. Butler comes up stairs, goes 
to office door, and knocks. To his multiple confusion, 
behind him Mariette's door opens and Gaston appears.
 
			GASTON
	Yes, Jacques?
 
CLOSE SHOT  BUTLER 
He turns to Gaston's new location.
 
 			BUTLER
	M'sieu Giron is downstairs. 

			GASTON
		(with vast authority)
	Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him 
	now. Impossible! 
		(Butler is about to leave.) 
	And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame 
	is not going. 
		(He turns back into 
		Mariette's room, 
		shuts door.) 

 			BUTLER
		(by now a confirmed cynic)
 	Yes, M'sieu Laval! 

Followed by camera, shaking his head, he goes down.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE'S BEDROOM DOOR 
It opens. Mariette appears.
 
			MARIETTE
 	Jacques!
 
CLOSE SHOT  BUTLER
 
 			BUTLER
		(looking dizzily in 
		wrong direction)
	Yes, madame-- 
		(Turning.) 
	Yes, madame!
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE
 
			MARIETTE
	Don't dismiss the car! I'll be down 
	in a few minutes. 
		(She shuts door. )
 
BUTLER  CLOSE SHOT
He finds his jittery way down the stairs.
 
BEDROOM  CLOSE SHOT 
Mariette and Gaston at foot of bed. Bed is untouched. On 
bed is her wrap. Mariette picks up wrap.
 
			GASTON 
		(passionately)
	I want you to stay, Mariette. 
	You've got to stay. You can't go 
	now!
 
 			MARIETTE
 	I must go.
  
 			GASTON
  	I'm crazy about you!
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(holding him off)
	I know it.
 
 			GASTON
 	I love you.
 
			MARIETTE
	I believe you.
 
			GASTON
	Then why do you want to go?
 
			MARIETTE
	Because I want to make it tough for 
	you.
 
Gaston takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. She 
returns kiss with even greater passion.
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(still in his arms; 
		genuine feeling in 
		its full wisdom)
	We have a long time ahead ...
 
CLOSE-UP  A MIRROR IN THE ROOM 
The couple are seen at one angle, as dialogue continues.
 
			MARIETTE
	Weeks ...
 
CLOSE-UP  ANOTHER MIRROR 
Another angle on the couple as she says:
 
 			MARIETTE
 	months ...

MED. CLOSE SHOT ON THE EMPTY BED 
Their embracing shadows lie the length of the bed, giving 
the effect of two bodies in a sex embrace on the bed, as 
she says:
 
 			MARIETTE
	years! ...

CLOSE SHOT  BOTH STILL EMBRACING 
She continues:

 			MARIETTE
	Think of that, Gaston--the future 
	lies bright before us!

A real struggle goes on in Gaston. She kisses him tenderly, 
frees herself, and, followed by camera, goes to door, stops, 
turns. 

 			MARIETTE
		(breathless; in a very 
		low voice, making the 
		rendezvous for later)
	Eleven o'clock! 
		(She is gone; door closes.)
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, 
then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
 
			GASTON
	Élysée seven, eight, seven, nine.
  
LILY'S HOTEL ROOM 
The luggage is packed and in order. Followed by camera, Lily, 
dressed for travel, paces nervously up and down. Phone rings. 
She rushes to phone.
 
			LILY
	Hello ... Darling! Oh, darling, 
	it's good to hear your voice! I 
	thought you'd never call! I tried to 
	get you ... What? What? 
		(Camera moves to 
		big close-up of her.) 
	Tomorrow morning? Why? 
		(Tears come into her eyes.) 
	Of course ... Um-hum ... Um-hum ... 
		(With a brave, 
		cheerful tone.) 
	That sounds reasonable--very 
	reasonable...

					FADE OUT
 
			SEQUENCE I
 
FADE IN 

LIVING ROOM  MAJOR'S HOME CLOSE-UP 
of Mariette. It is after dinner. We hear voices and music. 
Her thoughts are with Gaston. She sips from a champagne 
glass. Medium close-up to include her chair and a small 
table. She puts glass on the table and, oblivious to other 
guests, leans back dreamily, anticipating a night of love, 
eyes closed.

Camera pans to a couch not too near Mariette. François and 
the major, smoking cigars.  Camera moves to close-up. They 
are watching Mariette. They exchange a look of understanding. 
They have become friends, realizing that neither has a 
chance with Mariette.
 
			MAJOR 
		(intimately)
	No doubt about it--it's that 
	secretary.
  
 			FRANÇOIS
 	Funny, the kind of men women fall 
	for.
 
 			MAJOR
 	No color, no sparkle--but 
	dependable.
 
			FRANÇOIS
	The type they marry.
 
 			MAJOR
	You know, I'm not the marrying type. 
	I like to take my fun and leave it.
 
			FRANÇOIS 
		(inspecting the 
		major; friendly)
	Nice suit.
 
 			MAJOR
 	Like it?
 
 			FRANÇOIS 
	Smart. London, eh?
 
 			MAJOR
	Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.

 			FRANÇOIS 
	I thought so.

Both men lean back. A moment of silence. 

 			FRANÇOIS 
		(patronizingly)
	He's really not a bad fellow.
 
 			MAJOR
	Just dull.
 
			FRANÇOIS
	Insignificant ... He's a secretary, 
	always was a secretary, always will 
	be.
 
			MAJOR
		(with a smile)
	Funny--the first time I saw him I 
	thought he was a doctor!
 
   			FRANÇOIS 
		(sitting up suddenly)
	Doc--!
 
François looks stricken. Major, worried, thinks François has 
a heart attack. François gets up; Major gets up. François 
stares into space, then unseeingly at Major. Major becomes 
alarmed. François sits. Major sits with him. With sudden 
decision, François snaps his fingers, stands up. Major also 
stands up. François, followed by camera, goes straight to 
Mariette. Major, in a daze, follows. Mariette is still 
dreaming. François taps her on the shoulder. She looks up. 
His expression frightens her. François, waving his hand, 
tries to talk. The words don't come. Finally one escapes 
him.
 
			FRANÇOIS 
	Tonsils! 
		(Major and Mariette think 
		the man has gone insane.) 
	Positively tonsils!

				DISSOLVE TO:
 
VERY CLOSE SHOT  GASTON'S BEDROOM WINDOW
from outside. Behind the glass, Gaston's hand drumming on 
the pane nervously. Camera pulls back, and we see Gaston 
looking into the night, waiting restlessly. Suddenly he 
turns around sharply toward the door. Apparently someone 
has knocked at the office door. Camera swings over to the 
next window, and we recognize the office, which adjoins 
Gaston's bedroom. Through office window we see butler, who 
has knocked on bedroom door, waiting. Bedroom door opens, 
and Gaston emerges It is apparent that butler delivers a 
message. Camera moves down one floor and stops in a close 
shot of living room window from outside. Behind the glass 
stands Giron. He also drums nervously on the pane.
 
LIVING ROOM  CLOSE SHOT 
at door to the corridor. Door opens. Gaston enters.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GIRON 
He turns. Gaston comes into picture.
 
 			GASTON 
		(impatiently)
	I'm very sorry, but this is no time, 
	M'sieu Giron--
 
 			GIRON 
		(emphatically)
	I've got to see you.
 
 			GASTON
 	But not now.
 
 			GIRON
	Right now! It's very important, 
	M'sieu Laval.
 
			GASTON
	It may be important to you, M'sieu 
	Giron--
 
 			GIRON
	No, to you--M'sieu Monescu.
 
Pause, as they face each other. 

			GASTON 
		(cordially)
	Won't you sit down?
 
EXT. MAJOR'S VILLA 
In entrance driveway stands Mariette's car.
 
CLOSE SHOT 
of entrance door. Mariette comes out, followed by Major and 
François. All are excited.
 
 			MAJOR AND FRANÇOIS
    	But, Mariette, please... Now 
	listen--it's true ...
 
Followed by camera, they approach car.
 
			MARIETTE
	It's absolutely ridiculous! I don't 
	believe it!
 
  			MAJOR AND FRANÇOIS
	But, Mariette--
 
			MARIETTE
	I'm awfully tired anyhow. So please 
	leave me alone. Good night! 
		(She steps into car. 
		Chauffeur shuts car door 
		and goes out of picture 
		to driver's seat. François 
		and Major linger awkwardly. 
		Door opens and Mariette 
		leans out.) 
	I had a very lovely time! 
		(Door doses.)
 
LONG SHOT 
Shooting toward the car from opposite side. View of house 
and Major and François is covered by car. Car pulls away. We 
see Major and François moving toward house, chummy, 
animatedly talking.
 
			FRANÇOIS 
	So I said to myself, "All right, if 
	he wants to look at them, let him 
	look at them. No harm in that." And 
	then he said, "Say ah!" And that's 
	all I remember ...
 
They disappear into house.
 
MARIETTE'S LIVING ROOM  MED. SHOT 
Gaston and Giron at door to hall.
 
			GIRON   
		(thinking he is the winner)
	So ... You will pack your things at 
	once! 

			GASTON
		(with deceptive humility)
	Yes, m'sieu.
 
			GIRON  
	And you will be out by tomorrow 
	morning. 

			GASTON
	Very well, m'sieu.
 
			GIRON  
	Otherwise I'll call the police
 
			GASTON
	Yes, m'sieu. 
		(Giron is about to leave.) 
	M'sieu Giron!
 
			GIRON  
	What is it?
 
			GASTON
		(opening a new subject)
 	You have enjoyed the confidence of 
	this family for more than forty 
	years. You must be a man of about--
	about sixty-five. 
		(Giron looks puzzled 
		and uneasy.) 
	Let's see-- 
		(Gaston counts on 
		his fingers.) 
	You will be exactly eighty-seven 
	when you come out of prison.
  
			GIRON 
		(outraged)
	What do you mean?
 
			GASTON
	You say I am a crook.
 
			GIRON
	I know it!
 
 			GASTON 
		(amiably curious)
	Then why didn't you call the police? 
	Why don't you call the police? 
		(Conversationally.) 
	I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
 
 			GIRON 
		(trembling with indignation)
	M'sieu ...
 
 			GASTON 
		(helpfully)
	Monescu.
 
 			GIRON
	M'sieu Monescu!
 
 			GASTON 
		(with a smile)
	Just call me Gaston.
 
INT. MARIETTE'S CAR
as it drives along. Close shot of Mariette. She knows that 
François told the truth.
 
MED. SHOT  ENTRANCE DOOR 
to Mariette's house. It opens, and Giron emerges, full of 
dignity and indignation. Gaston, in the doorway, is a 
smiling host.
 
 			GASTON 
		(calling after him)
	Good night, Adolph!
 
Giron stops in his tracks as Gaston shuts door.
 
STAIRWAY
Gaston hastens up. He reaches landing and is about to enter 
his office, when outer doorbell rings. Exasperated, he 
hastens down.
 
HALL  CLOSE SHOT
at entrance door. Gaston opens. There stands Giron, furious.
 
			GIRON
	Don't you dare to call me Adolph!
 
Gaston slams door in Giron's face and turns back.
 
STAIRWAY 
Gaston starts up.
 
UPPER LANDING is about to enter office, thinks a moment, 
then goes toward Mariette's bedroom door.
 
LONG SHOT  HER BEDROOM INT.
It is dark. Door opens. Gaston enters, shuts door, turns on 
wall switch, flooding room with light. He moves to a night 
table by the bed, on which is a small lamp, turns on the 
lamp, then goes back to wall switch and turns off main 
lights. Room is now in soft shadow, with only the small 
light. He turns to window, sees that shade is not down, goes 
toward the window.
 
CLOSE SHOT 
of same window from outside. Gaston appears, is just about 
to pull down shade when he glances toward his own bedroom in 
other wing of house. He sees:
 
CAMERA PANS QUICKLY 
to other wing of house and stops outside Gaston's bedroom 
window. Behind window stands Lily looking across at him. The 
situation is clear; she knows the worst. She looks 
menacingly calm.
 
MARIETTE'S BEDROOM WINDOW
from outside. Gaston is in trouble and he knows it. He goes 
quickly toward door.
 
GASTON'S BEDROOM WINDOW 
from outside. Lily, having seen Gaston leave Mariette's room, 
pauses, makes up her mind, then draws the curtains closed.
 
GASTON'S BEDROOM  INSIDE  CLOSE SHOT 
at door. It opens. Gaston rushes in, looks toward window, 
doesn't see Lily, turns, and sees:
 
CLOSE SHOT  LILY 
at the wall safe. She has one hand on the dial and is facing 
Gaston defiantly.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
Followed by camera, he goes to Lily.
 
 			GASTON
	Are you insane? You've to get out 
	of here at once! She may come back 
	any minute.
 
			LILY 
		(grimly)
	What time is your rendezvous?
 
 			GASTON 
		(frantic)
	Now, Lily--
 
 			LILY
     	Yes, M'sieu Colet?
 
 			GASTON 
		(staggered; recovering; 
		desperate)
	You have to get out of here!
 
 			LILY 
		(bitterly)
	That's what I'm here for--to get 
	out! I want to get away from here, 
	from you--as fast as I can and as 
	far as a hundred thousand francs 
	will take me. 
		(She returns to the 
		safe, hand on dial.) 
	Sixty-five, ninety-four--
 
 			GASTON
 	Don't you realize--
 
 			LILY 
	Thirty-five to the left--sixty-
	three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for 
	another man if he were the biggest 
	crook on earth ... Seventy-six, 
	eighty-four, fifty-five-- 
		(Suddenly facing 
		him; bitterly.) 
	What has she got that I haven't got?
 
 			GASTON
	Lily, you must listen to me.

 			LILY 
	Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
 
 			GASTON
	But, Lily--

 			LILY 
	Don't you dare lie to me! 
		(Ironically.) 
	I know you love me. 
		(Pause. He is helpless.)
	Well, why don't you say something? 
	Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself 
	out of it--bluff yourself in! 
		(Gaston makes an 
	effort to speak.)  
	Shut up, you liar, you!
		(She turns back to safe, 
		opens it, looks inside.) 
	That's what I want! 
		(Taking out the stacks 
		of bank notes.) 
	This is real! Money! Cash!
 
STREET
in front of Mariette's house. Her car comes, stops.
 
MED. SHOT  HALL
Gaston's door. Lily comes out, very excited, closing door 
behind her. Followed by camera, she runs down steps, across 
hall, toward entrance door. Doorbell rings. She stops.
  
BUTLER'S PANTRY
Butler in a chair, half-asleep. Bell rings again. He gets up 
and goes out.
 
HALL  MED. SHOT 
at entrance door. Lily has disappeared. Butler comes, opens 
door. Mariette enters.
 
			BUTLER 
	Good evening, madame.
 
Sweeping past him, followed by camera, Mariette goes up 
stairs. She pauses at her bedroom door. Changing her mind, 
she goes to Gaston's door. She knocks.
 
MED. SHOT  MARIETTE'S BEDROOM DOOR 
from hall. Gaston opens the door. He sees Mariette, smiles, 
and opens her door very wide, welcoming her to her own room.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
at Gaston's door to his office-and-bedroom suite. She smiles 
at him enigmatically. Instead of responding, she opens his 
door and goes in, leaving door open. As she goes she gives 
him another smile, as if to say, "This is where it's going 
to be."
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
puzzled, but not worried. He closes her door and goes toward 
his own door.
 
GASTON'S BEDROOM 
Mariette stands in the center of the room. Gaston enters, 
closes door, goes toward her. Camera moves to close shot of 
both. She embraces him--they kiss. Then, languorously, she 
takes off her wrap. He helps her. She drops wrap on bed. 
Then she reaches for her necklace with the seductive air of 
a woman about to disrobe. She takes off the necklace, the 
jeweled pin on her bosom, then her bracelets and rings.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(as he watches her; 
		a lover, but careful)
	When a lady takes her jewels off in 
	a gentleman's room, where does she 
	put them?
 
 			GASTON 
		(gallantly)
	On the night table.
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(provocatively)
	But I don't want to be a lady. 

She kisses him lightly and moves out of the picture, the 
jewels in her hand.
 
CLOSE SHOT  SAFE 
Mariette enters with the intention of opening the safe.
 
CLOSE-UP  GASTON
He is startled. He goes quickly toward her.
 
CLOSE SHOT SAFE 
Mariette is about to turn the dial. Gaston enters.
 
			GASTON 
		(helpfully)
	May I?
 
			MARIETTE 
		(again with that 
		smile; playful)
	Ah, let me have a little fun.
 
			GASTON 
		(playing the game; graciously)
	Please!   
		(He moves away.)
 
CLOSE SHOT  ARMCHAIR 
Gaston enters, sits on the arm of the chair, and leans back, 
smiling, on guard.

			MARIETTE
		(beginning to dial)
	Now let me see--sixty-five, ninety-four--
 
			GASTON 
	Thirty-three--
      
			MARIETTE
 	No--thirty-five! 
		(She laughs.)
 
CLOSE-UP  GASTON 
He laughs, too. They are apparently having a jolly time.
 
CLOSE-UP  MARIETTE
She continues to dial.
 
			MARIETTE
	Thirty-five ... 
		(Very casually.) 
	You know, François--M'sieu Filiba--
	thinks you're a very remarkable man.
 
CLOSE-UP  GASTON 
For one swift instant his face tells us that now he knows 
the worst.
 
			MARIETTE'S VOICE
 	He was at the dinner tonight.
 
CLOSE-UP  MARIETTE

 			MARIETTE
		(continuing to dial)
	Sixty-three, eight--

CLOSE-UP  GASTON
 
 			GASTON
	Mariette!
 
CLOSE-UP  MARIETTE 
She turns toward him charmingly.
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(with pretended innocence)
	Yes, Gaston?
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE AND GASTON
 
 			GASTON
	What would you say if you found 
	your safe had been robbed?
 
			MARIETTE
	I wouldn't say anything--I would 
	act.

			GASTON
	Call the police?
 
 			MARIETTE
	Instantly.
 
			GASTON 
		(as if to say, 
		"It's a good idea")
	Um-hum ...
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(lightly)
	But why talk about robbery on a 
	night like this? 

She pauses--is it ironically? He is not quite sure. He 
takes a last chance. 

			GASTON 
		(ardently)
	You look beautiful.
 
			MARIETTE
	Thank you. 
		(Turning back 
		coolly to safe.) 
	Seventy-six, eighty--
 
 			GASTON 
		(rising; the game 
		is over)
	Mariette!
 
 			MARIETTE
 	Yes, Gaston?
 
 			GASTON
	You have been robbed--for years. And 
	not a hundred thousand francs, but 
	millions. And you know who did it? 
	Adolph.

 			MARIETTE
	Adolph?

 			GASTON
	Adolph J. Giron. 
 
 			MARIETTE
		(laughing at him)
 	And you expect me to believe that?
 
 			GASTON
	Naturally not. But I expect the 
	police to believe it. 
		(He goes out to 
		night table.)
 
CLOSE SHOT  NIGHT TABLE 
Gaston enters, picks up telephone.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
at the safe. Frightened, she goes quickly to telephone.
 
CLOSE SHOT  TELEPHONE 
Mariette enters, takes receiver out of Gaston's hand, sets 
it back.
 
 			MARIETTE
	No!
 
 			GASTON
	Why not? He's a thief--he's a 
	criminal.
 
 			MARIETTE
	I don't believe it!
 
 			GASTON
	Then why are you afraid to let me 
	prove it?
      
Mariette turns away. She is beginning to suspect there might 
be truth in what he says. 

			GASTON 
		(ironically)
	It would be a terrible scandal, 
	wouldn't it? 

 			MARIETTE
		(to herself)
	Giron...!
 
			GASTON 
	Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of 
	Colet and Company. Honorary 
	president of the Orphans' Asylum. 
	Adolph J. Giron--distinguished 
	citizen! ... Well, shall I call the 
	police? 
		(Mariette's silence 
		eloquently says no.) 
	I see! You have to be in the social 
	register to keep out of jail. But 
	when a man starts at the bottom and 
	works his way up--a self-made crook
	--then you say, "Call the police! 
	Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 
		(He glares at her 
		indignantly, then 
		goes to the safe.)
 
CLOSE SHOT  SAFE
Gaston enters, gives the dial one turn, and safe opens. The 
papers inside are in complete disorder.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
staring at the open safe.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
He goes toward her.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
Gaston enters, bows formally.
  
 			GASTON
 	I don't seem to have my calling 
	cards with me, Madame Colet. So 
	permit me to introduce myself 
	informally--Gaston Monescu. I 
	assure you in my own circles I am 
	very well known.
 
Mariette looks at him sadly for a moment. She gets up, 
restraining tears.
 
			MARIETTE
	You wanted a hundred thousand 
	francs, and I thought you wanted 
	me.

Gaston is deeply moved. Mariette turns, moves sadly toward 
window.
 
CLOSE SHOT  WINDOW 
Curtains are now open. We see the church steeple--the same 
one we saw romantically before. Mariette enters and leans 
her head against the window, her back to the camera. The 
church clock strikes eleven.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
He is crushed. Followed by camera, he goes to her, stops at 
her side.
 
 			GASTON
	I came here to rob you--but 
	unfortunately I fell in love with 
	you. 
		(No reaction.) 
	Mariette!
 
She turns, looks at him.
 
			MARIETTE
		(bitterly)
	Why did you take the money?
 
Gaston is speechless; the truth is too complicated. 
Despairing, she goes. He stands looking after her. We hear 
her steps as she crosses the room; then we hear the door 
shut. He turns to the window. Suddenly he stares toward 
Mariette's bedroom window.
 
CLOSE SHOT
Mariette's bedroom window from outside. Behind the window 
is Lily, looking across at him implacably. She has witnessed 
the scene at the opened safe and has come to her own 
conclusions.
 
GASTON'S BEDROOM WINDOW 
from outside. Close-up of Gaston. He looks at Lily, 
dumbfounded.
 
MARIETTE'S BEDROOM  CLOSE SHOT 
at door to corridor, from inside. Mariette enters. Suddenly 
she turns, and she too is dumbfounded, because she sees:
 
CLOSE SHOT  WINDOW 
from Mariette's viewpoint. Lily is still looking out at 
Gaston, her back to Mariette. She hears the door close, 
turns, sees Mariette, takes in the situation at a glance, 
and goes, proudly direct, toward her.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
Lily enters. They face each other.
 
			LILY
 	Madame, the only thing that seems 
	to stand between you and romance is 
	a hundred thousand francs. Well, he 
	didn't take it. 
		(She brings the bank 
		notes out of her jacket.) 
	I took it--all by myself. Now you 
	can have your romance!
 
			MARIETTE
		(scornfully)
	I think you'd better go.
 
			LILY
	Ever had a romance with a crook?
 
 			MARIETTE
 	I beg your pardon!
 
			LILY
	Let me give you a little advice. 
	When you embrace him, be sure to put 
	on your gloves. It would be too bad 
	if your fingerprints were found ...
  
			MARIETTE
	Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever 
	your name is--I thank you for your 
	advice, but I must ask you to go. 
	You've got your money--
 
	 		LILY 
		(violently)
	I don't want your money!
 
MED. SHOT  ALL THREE 
as Gaston appears. He stops inside the door. Both women turn.
 
			LILY 
		(looking at Gaston, 
		but talking to Mariette)
 	You wanted to buy him for fifty 
	francs. Well, you can have him for 
	nothing! 
		(She tosses the money 
		out of picture.)
 
CLOSE SHOT  BED 
The money falls on bed.
 
CLOSE SHOT  GROUP 
Lily walks toward Gaston.
 
			LILY
	And you--
 
 			GASTON 
		(pleadingly) 
	Lily-- 
		(He takes her arm.)
 
 			LILY 
		(freeing herself)
	Leave me alone! You were willing to 
	sacrifice a hundred thousand francs 
	for her. 
		(She turns to Mariette, 
		sizes her up.) 
	Well-- 
		(she has a sudden idea) 
	she's worth it! 
		[(To Mariette.) 
	You were willing to pay a hundred 
	and twenty-five thousand for a 
	handbag. You can pay a hundred 
	thousand for him!]
 
CLOSE SHOT  BED 
Lily enters, takes the money she had gallantly relinquished.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE AND GASTON 
standing like two guilty schoolchildren. Lily comes into 
picture, walks past them to door, opens door, turns.
 
 			LILY 
	Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
		(She leaves, slamming door.)
 
			GASTON 
		(calls)
	Lily!
 
He dashes to door, goes out, closes door. Behind the door we 
hear their excited voices. Mariette goes a step closer to the 
door. She is in a state confused suspense. Suddenly the 
voices cease. We hear, muffled, a woman's footsteps running 
down the stairs. Then, following, a man's footsteps. Then 
silence. Now, Mariette, followed by camera, goes to the bed 
and sinks into it heartbroken: she will never see Gaston 
again.
 
MED. SHOT  DOOR
Outside we hear the slowly returning footsteps of Gaston.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
sitting up on bed. She turns toward door with hope.
 
CLOSE SHOT  DOOR 
Gaston enters, closes door, and moves toward Mariette. He 
looks very grave.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
sitting on bed. Gaston goes to her. Pause. 

			GASTON
		(with great feeling)
	Goodbye...

			MARIETTE
		(getting up; also 
		with feeling)
	Goodbye.  
 
			GASTON
	It could have been marvelous ...
 
 			MARIETTE
 	Divine ...
 
 			GASTON
	Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, 
	if you should wake out of your 
	dreams and hear a knock, and the 
	door opens, and there, instead of a 
	maid with a breakfast tray, stands 
	a policeman with a warrant--then 
	you'll be glad you're alone.
 
			MARIETTE 
		(sighs)
     	But it could have been glorious.
 
 			GASTON
 	Lovely.
 
 			MARIETTE
 	Divine ... But that terrible 
	policeman!
 
 			GASTON
 	Goodbye ... 
		(He takes her in his 
		arms. They kiss. He 
		goes to door.)
 
CLOSE SHOT  DOOR 
Gaston opens door, turns to her.
 
 			GASTON
 	You know what you're missing?
 
CLOSE-UP  MARIETTE 
She shuts her eyes and dreamily nods.
 
CLOSE-UP  GASTON
in doorway.
 
 			GASTON 
		(shaking his head)
 	No ... 
		(Out of his coat pocket 
		he takes the necklace 
		of seed pearls.) 
	That's what you're missing! ... 
	Your gift to her.
 
CLOSE-UP  MARIETTE 
For an instant she is taken aback; then she smiles.
 
 			MARIETTE 
		(graciously)
     	With the compliments of Colet and 
	Company!
 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON 
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
 
CLOSE SHOT  MARIETTE 
She looks after the departed Gaston a moment. Her mood is 
broken by ringing of telephone.
 
			MARIETTE
		(into phone)
	Hello ... Yes ... What? ... Yes ... 
	No, no. Thank you very much, but 
	the handbag has been found 
		(sadly and with 
		another meaning) 
	exactly two weeks and three days 
	ago. 
		(She hangs up.)

					DISSOLVE TO:
 
INT. TAXICAB MOVING AT NIGHT ALONG PARIS STREETS
Close shot of Gaston and Lily. There is a strained silence 
between them. Gaston smiles toward her. He is trying to 
make up, but she sits frozen. He smiles again, anticipating 
the surprise he has in store for her. He reaches for the 
pearls in his pocket. A look of dismay crosses his face--
the pearls are not there! He looks in all his pockets, can't 
find them. Suddenly, with suspicion, he looks sidelong at 
Lily. She responds to his look with a triumphant smile. From 
her bosom she brings forth the string of pearls and holds it 
up. He is amazed, can't figure it out. She reaches behind and 
brings forth a handbag, which we recognize as the one 
originally stolen from Mariette, and she drops the pearls 
into the bag. Gaston is now smiling with admiration, yet he 
looks sly. As Lily drops in the pearls she glances into the 
bag. Her expression changes. Something is missing. She looks 
suspiciously toward Gaston. Nonchalantly, he draws, from his 
inside breast pocket, the precious bank notes, and slips them 
too into the bag. They smile at each other. Together forever, 
they embrace and kiss.
 
					FADE OUT
 
			THE END

***********SONGS***********

Trouble in Paradise
Most any place can seem to be a paradise
While you embrace just the one that you adore
There needn't be an apple tree with magic powers
You need no garden filled with flowers
To taste the thrill of sweet greed hours
Gentle perfume and cushions that are silk and soft
Two in the gloom that is silent but for sighs
That's paradise while arms entwine and lips are kissing
But if there's something missing 
That signifies 
Trouble in paradise



Colet and Compagnie
Colet, Colet, Colet and Compagnie 
Are makers of the best perfume.
If you and your beloved can't agree, 
Permit us to suggest perfume.
Cleopatra was a lovely tantalizer. 
But she did it with her little atomizer.
We'll make you smell like a rose; 
Every nose in Paris knows
Colet and Compagnie.
