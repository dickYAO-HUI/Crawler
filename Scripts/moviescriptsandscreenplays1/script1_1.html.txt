FADE 
                    IN:
EXT. 
                    LIMBO - DAY/NIGHT
A 
                    heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable. And 
                    out of that primordial fog a CROW materializes, flying toward 
                    the camera in slow motion.
  
                  SARAH 
                    (O.S.)
I 
                    believe there's a place where the restless souls wander. Burdened 
                    by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter Heaven...
  
                  Presently 
                    a second shape materializes - a FIGURE ON HORSEBACK. A warrior 
                    whose baleful eyes shine behind the familiar irony mask war 
                    paint.
  
                  SARAH 
                    (O.S.)
And 
                    so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly 
                    searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the 
                    hopes that somehow, some day...
  
                  The 
                    figure on horseback sweeps past us, disappearing once again 
                    into the mists of time.
  
                  SARAH 
                    (V.O.)
... 
                    they will be reunited with the ones they love.
  
                  DISSOLVE

                  EXT. 
                    DOCS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT
  
                  Present 
                    day. The Crow settles on a shipping container, tilts its head, 
                    watching...

                    SUPER TITLE:

                    "CITY OF ANGELS - OCTOBER 29TH - LA NOCHE DE SAN LUCAS"

                    CLOSE ON A PAIR OF HANDS tearing open a tiny glassine envelope 
                    filled with powder - our drug du jour - Trinity. The face 
                    of the envelope has been stamped with an image - a cartoon 
                    imp with a shit-eating gring giving us the thumbs-up sign.

                    A MAN lowers his face to the envelope, snorts up the powder. 
                    The man discards the glassine envelope...

                    FOLLOWING THE ENVELOPE

                    as it flutters to the ground, landing "imp-side" 
                    up. Let the rush begin.

                    PULL BACK TO REVEAL

                    Garbage-poisoned waters wreathed in fog. Although once part 
                    of a thriving shipping industry, decades of decline have seen 
                    these docks become a hellish dumping ground. Case in point:

                    A FATHER AND HIS YOUNG SON

                    are kneeling next to one another at the end of a pier, their 
                    arms linked together, then tied behind their backs. DANNY 
                    CORVEN (8) is quietly sobbing. ASHE (late 20s), tries to calm 
                    the frightened boy.
  
                  DANNY
I'm 
                    sorry, Dad...I'm sorry... I didn't mean to look...
  
                  ASHE
It's 
                    okay, Danny. It's okay...
  
                  NEMO 
                    (O.S.)
Lights...
  
                  A 
                    bright light comes on. Ashe and Danny turn their heads to 
                    avoid the glare.
  
                  NEMO 
                    (O.S.)
...camera...
  
                  CLOSE 
                    ON

                    A camcorder lens as it auto-focuses, bringing Danny's distorted 
                    face into view via the lens' reflection.
  
                  NEMO 
                    (O.S.)
...action.
  
                  CAMERA 
                    FINDS Ashe and Danny's executioners, CURVE, KALI, SPIDER MONKEY, 
                    and NEMO.

                    NEMO, a post-modern sleaze-hound, circles Danny and Ashe with 
                    a camcorder. He Pats Ashe's face.
  
                  NEMO
Make-up.
  
                  SPIDER 
                    MONKEY, lean and gangly, crouches next to Ashe, holding a 
                    marigold in his hand.
  
                  SPIDER 
                    MONKEY
Flowers 
                    for the dead, Senor?
  
                  CAMERA 
                    POV (CLOSE ON ASHE'S EYE)

                    Ashe stares directly into the camera.
  
                  SPIDER 
                    MONKEY
No? 
                    Suite yourself, then.
  
                  Spider 
                    Monkey tucks the flower behind his ear. Danny is praying now, 
                    MUMBLING a Catholic School litany.
  
                  SPIDER 
                    MONKEY
You're 
                    wasting your breath, angelito. Nobody up there's listening.
  
                  WHOOSH!

                    We cut to an extreme high-angle shot - God's omniscient POV, 
                    perhaps.

                    CURVE

                    leans up against his motorcycle a few yards away - big, burly, 
                    shaved head, a ciggie hanging from his lips. He's got a custom 
                    paint-job on his pearl drop gas tank - a buxom blonde doing 
                    the "wild thing" with the Grim Reaper. Curve's also 
                    the one who just dusted himself
  
                  CURVE
(hyped 
                    on drugs)
Let's 
                    get this over with. Judah's waiting.
  
                  Kali, 
                    a cold-eyed heavy-metal femme with a killer's casual stoicism, 
                    is methodically loading bullets into her revolver. She's taking 
                    her own sweet time, in defiance of Curve. There's a tension 
                    between them. Finally, she flicks her wrist, snaps the revolver 
                    shut. Kali walks up to them...
  
                  DANNY
I'm 
                    scared, Dad.
  
                  ASHE
I 
                    know...
  
                  Ashe 
                    turns to his executioners, pleading with them...
  
                  ASHE
Listen 
                    to me, please. He's just a kid. Let him go. He can't hurt 
                    you. He doesn't even know who you are...
  
                  ...and 
                    puts a bullet through Danny's chest. Ashe SCREAMS.
  
                  ASHE
NO!!!
  
                  Danny's 
                    body slumps forward, dragging Ashe down next to him. Ashe 
                    stares into his son's lifeless eyes.

                    Curve saunters over, stares down at Ashe, flicks his cigarette 
                    butt off into the water.
  
                  CURVE
Nothing 
                    personal, sport. Guess you were just in the wrong place at 
                    the wrong time.
  
                  BANG! 
                    BANG! BANG! Curve FIRES a gun into Ashe's back. As Ashe crumples...
  
                  CURVE
Dump 
                    'em. Let's get this cluster-fuck on the road.
  
                  CURVE

                    motions to Kali and Spider Monkey. Together, the three of 
                    them heave Ashe and Danny into the ocean.
  
                  CURVE
Bon 
                    voyage, shitheads.
  
                  EXT. 
                    OCEAN DEPTHS - NIGHT
  
                  Ashe 
                    and Danny sink down into the murky underworld, taking their 
                    place amongst a thousand other deep-sixed dreams.

                    ASHE'S POV

                    falling further and further away from the light of the surface 
                    world. Bit by bit, Ashe's struggles subside. All we hear now 
                    is an ever-slowing HEARTBEAT. Darkness begins to close in 
                    around us, womblike, peaceful...

                    ...AND OUT OF THE DARKNESS,

                    something takes shape - a CROW. Winging its way from Ashe's 
                    dream-like death up through watery depths into a smog-bound 
                    cityscape...
  
                  EXT. 
                    CITY OF ANGELS - NIGHT
  
                  The 
                    Crow flies over a bridge with spans the Styx - the city's 
                    polluted, man-made river.

                    THE CROW

                    rides the thermals above an urban sprawl riven by fires, floods, 
                    and earthquakes. Smog hangs in the air like an army of ever-present 
                    ghosts. We pass over a roof where someone has painted a smart-ass 
                    welcome mat for the benefit of anyone flying overhead - "GO 
                    BACK". Nevertheless, we continue on.
  
                  SARAH 
                    (V.O.)
They 
                    say that time cancels pain. I don't know about that. Eight 
                    years ago I lost two of my best friends. Two thousand miles 
                    later I find I'm still living in the past...
  
                  THE 
                    CROW

                    sweeps down into man-made caverns of pigeon-shit concrete 
                    and grimy glass. Through the bird's eyes we glimpse the city's 
                    silent HOMELESS. Automobile hulks littering the streets like 
                    insect husks. The shifting searchlights of police helicopters...

                    WE PASS OVER SARAH'S ROOFTOP

                    The Crow circles downward...
  
                  SARAH 
                    (V.O.)
Every 
                    night when I close my eyes the dreams come. That's how the 
                    dead talk to us, I guess. In the dark, when our souls are 
                    off wandering...
  
                  INT. 
                    SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT
  
                  The 
                    Crow lands next to an open window. It perches on the edge, 
                    looking into the loft.
  
                  SARAH 
                    (V.O.)
I 
                    just wish I understood what they were telling me.
  
                  CROW'S 
                    POV (ANAMORPHIC)

                    SARAH, early 20s, lies asleep in bed. She stirs, troubled 
                    by uneasy dreams, rolls over, opens her eyes...
  
                  INT. 
                    SARAH'S LOFT, SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT
  
                  As 
                    Sarah rises the Crow flits away like yesterday's memory. Sarah's 
                    not sure whether or not she dreamed the bird. GABRIEL, the 
                    cat Sarah inherited from Eric and Shelly, is perched on the 
                    end of the bed.
  
                  SARAH
Hey, 
                    Gabriel...
  
                  Sarah 
                    gives the cat an obligatory behind-the-ear scratch, then climbs 
                    from bed, making her way across the loft.

                    SARAH'S ARTIST LOFT

                    is furnished in thrift-store treasures. The loft has an earthy 
                    warmth to it, in stark contrast to the urban decay outside 
                    - an island amidst a sea of unrest, dominated by an arching 
                    half-circle window through which Sarah can view the local 
                    wildlife on the streets below.

                    ON SARAH'S CANVASSES

                    Turbulent oils reminiscent of history's brooding symbolist 
                    painters. Give Sarah's childhood inspiration, the subject 
                    matter is no real surprise.

                    CAMERA ISOLATES a work-in-progress. The painting depicts a 
                    woman resembling Sarah being cradled in the arms of her pale-faced 
                    lover, surrounded by a sea of watchful dead.

                    SARAH

                    reaches the shower, strips off her clothes. Her back and upper 
                    arms are decorated with graceful tattoo work - a pair of black 
                    angel wings sweeping over her shoulder blades. She's got a 
                    ring in her navel, another in a nipple...

                    In short, the skate-waif we knew back in Detroit has matured 
                    quite a bit since that fateful Devil's Night. Sarah shuts 
                    here eyes, turns her face up into the spray. For a brief second 
                    we see a flash of...
  
                  EXT. 
                    DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT
  
                  Ashe's 
                    death. Plunging into the icy waters, down into darkness. Just 
                    as suddenly we are back in...
  
                  INT. 
                    SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT
  
                  Sarah's 
                    eyes snap open. She holds a hand out to the shower wall, takes 
                    a moment to collect herself.

                    Troubled, Sarah climbs from the shower, shrugs on some clothes. 
                    Among her accourterments is a necklace featuring a silver 
                    ankh, the symbol of eternity.

                    As Sarah sites in front of her vanity we catch sight of the 
                    irony mask that used to hang by Shelly's mirror. Next to the 
                    mask is a...

                    TARNISHED WEDDING RING

                    Once Shelly's. There's an inscription inside - "FOREVER".

                    Sarah fingers the ring a moment, glancing at the irony mask. 
                    Lots of memories. Lots of ghosts.

                    Gabriel creeps up, MEOWING forlornly.
  
                  SARAH
(wistfully)
Me 
                    too.
  
                  She 
                    threads the ring onto her necklace, letting it fall next to 
                    the ankh, then slips the silver chain over her head. Sarah 
                    stands, pulls on a jacket, heads out.
  
                  EXT. 
                    SARAH'S LOFT, STREET - DUSK
  
                  An 
                    ill-wind kicks up trash and grit. Sarah glances down. Dozens 
                    of the glassine imp envelopes swirl around Sarah's feet like 
                    confetti. One of the envelopes has stuck to her heel. As she 
                    peels it off, she catches sight of...
  
                  A 
                    PALE FACE

                    in a shadowed entryway. It's a TEENAGED GIRL (16), strung 
                    out on drugs. The girl cowers in a narrow stairway, hugging 
                    herself, shivering from withdrawal.

                    Sarah draws closer, notices some of the grinning imp drug 
                    sachets at the girl's feet. The girl shies away, frightened, 
                    suspicious.
  
                  SARAH
(dryly)
Nice 
                    place you've got here.
  
                  GRACE
(a 
                    muttered whisper)
No 
                    place else to go.
  
                  Sarah 
                    can't help but recognize a part of herself in this lost soul.
  
                  SARAH
Gotta 
                    name?
  
                  GRACE
Grace. 
                    So what?
  
                  SARAH
Listen, 
                    Grace, how does some hot coffee sound? Maybe a little food?
  
                  GRACE
What 
                    do you want?
  
                  SARAH
Nothing. 
                    Guess you just remind me of someone I used to know.
  
                  After 
                    a moment, Grace offers a reluctant nod. Sarah helps her from 
                    the entryway, into the warmth of the dying light. Grace blinks, 
                    shields her eyes.

                    As they walk away down the street, camera rises up to include...

                    THE CROW

                    perched on a nearby rooftop, watching them.

EXT. 
                    GRAY GARGOYLE TATTOO SHOP - NIGHT
  
                  the 
                    Gargoyle is an usassuming ink shop - the sole oasis of light 
                    in an otherwise desolated block populated by derelict warehouse 
                    buildings. Flickering neon BUZZES in the window.

                    Nearby is a battered road sign - "END CITY LIMITS". 
                    Someone has spray-painted "OF THE FUCKING WORLD" 
                    over "city limits". In the distance, the bridge 
                    of the River Styx rises through the mist like a skeletal dinosaur.

                    SUPER TITLE:

                    "OCTOBER 30TH - LA NOCHE DE LA SANTA MUERTE"
  
                  INT. 
                    GRAY GARGOYLE TATTOO SHOP - NIGHT
  
                  CLOSE 
                    ON a sparking tattoo "gun", the needle WHIRRING 
                    as it travels over a patch of Vaseline-smeared skin.
  
                  SARAH 
                    (V.O.)
Almost 
                    finished. Doing okay?
  
                  CUSTOMER 
                    (V.O.)
Yeah, 
                    stings a little.
  
                  SARAH 
                    (V.O.)
That's 
                    why they call me the Mistress of Pain.
  
                  PULL 
                    BACK TO REVEAL Sarah expertly guiding the needle, wearing 
                    glasses, surgical gloves, concentrating.

                    Sarah's buzz-headed CUSTOMER sits in a ratty dentist's chair. 
                    Sarah is finishing coloring a Japanese dragon which winds 
                    its way over the man's forearm. She makes another line of 
                    color then sits back, smoothing more Vaseline over the man's 
                    arm. She picks up a jeweler's loupe, makes an adjustment on 
                    her needle...

                    Behind Sarah we glimpse the cluttered tattoo shop - walls 
                    covered with sheets of flash (ready-made art), bookshelves 
                    crammed with reference works. Sarah's partner, NOAH, a chain-smoking 
                    proto-punk Brit, consults with a YOUNG GRUNGE COUPLE.

                    LATER -

                    Noah is closing up shop, while Sarah sterilizes some needles 
                    in an autoclave.
  
                  NOAH
What 
                    a downer - this kid wanted me to tattoo "If you're reading 
                    this, you're too close" on his bleedin' bum!
  
                  Sarah 
                    smiles. Noah fires up a fag, flops down into a dentist chair. 
                    The two slip into a familiar, good-natured banter.
  
                  NOAH
Christ, 
                    I'm knackered.
  
                  SARAH
Beats 
                    pushing ink in Detroit.
  
                  NOAH
That 
                    it does, Princess, that it does.
(remembering)
Oh, 
                    I bought you a little present...
  
                  Noah 
                    reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls something out. It's 
                    a handmade candy sugar skull with a little strip of paper 
                    glued to the bottom - a fortune.
  
                  NOAH
They 
                    do 'em for the Day of the Dead.
(tossing 
                    the skull to Sarah)
Nice, 
                    huh? Necrophagia, Princess. Eat the dead.
  
                  SARAH
(reading 
                    fortune)
"Life 
                    is just a dream on the way to death." I like that.
  
                  Sarah 
                    studies the skull, then pops it in her mouth, nodding. Noah 
                    rises, stretching.
  
                  NOAH
Want 
                    to grab a beer, then?
  
                  SARAH
No, 
                    I gotta go home. Haven't been sleeping much lately.
  
                  NOAH
So, 
                    what's the dirty dog's name?
  
                  SARAH
I've 
                    just been having some weird dreams.
(reflecting)
You 
                    ever dream that you're dying someone else's death?
  
                  Outside 
                    we hear a MOTORCYCLE pulling up, then someone KNOCKS on the 
                    front door.
  
                  NOAH
(calling 
                    out)
Sorry, 
                    we're closed.
  
                  CURVE

                    appears outside. He POUNDS harder on the door.
  
                  CURVE
Open 
                    the fucking door!
  
                  NOAH

                    stands, moves to the door.
  
                  NOAH
Look, 
                    I said we're...
  
                  BANG! 
                    Curve kicks open the door and storms in. He PUNCHES Noah in 
                    the nose, then heads straight for Sarah.
  
                  CURVE
You 
                    think what you did to me is funny? Some kind of joke?
  
                  SARAH
What 
                    are you talking about?!
  
                  CURVE
I'm 
                    talking about the fucking tattoo you gave me! I took off the 
                    bandages. Look...!!!
  
                  Curve 
                    rips open his shirt, revealing his chest.

                    CURVE'S TATTOO

It's a crow, rendered in bold slashes of black. Or 
                    is it? Upon closer examination the crow looks like something 
                    else - two demons fighting. The design is a classic ambiguous 
                    figure - like the picture of the woman in front of a vanity 
                    which can also be seen as a skull.
  
                  SARAH
A 
                    crow...
Damn 
                    right, it's a crow. And did I ask for a fucking bird on my 
                    chest? Did I?!
  
                  Sarah 
                    shakes her head.
  
                  CURVE
Then 
                    what-the-fuck is it doing there?!
  
                  SARAH
I 
                    don't know, I was just going from the design you gave me...
  
                  SMACK! 
                    Curve backhands Sarah across the face. Noah rushes forward, 
                    blood still running from his nose.
  
                  NOAH
Stop 
                    it!
  
                  Curve 
                    pulls an automatic from his waist-band and points the gun 
                    at Noah. Noah freezes...
  
                  CURVE
What's 
                    it going to be, hero? Ready to kiss your faggot-ass good-bye? 
                    I think so. I think you're shitting yourself you're so goddamn 
                    ready.
  
                  Curve 
                    snaps open an imp bag of his favorite drug, snorts up the 
                    contents. He presses the gun against Noah's forehead.
  
                  SARAH 
                    (O.S.)
Over 
                    here, ass-hole...
  
                  As 
                    Curve turns, Sarah squeezes a bottle of tattoo ink into the 
                    killer's eyes, blinding him.
  
                  CURVE
Agh!!! 
                    SHIT!!!
  
                  Sarah 
                    plants one of her Doc Marten boots in Curve's groin. He SCREAMS, 
                    doubles over. Sarah pulls the automatic from his grasp and 
                    trains it on him.
  
                  SARAH
Get 
                    up.
  
                  Curve 
                    cups his balls, slowly rises. His eyes are glowing with manic 
                    intensity. A slow smile creeps across Curve's face. He backs 
                    away towards the front door.
  
                  CURVE
Shoulda 
                    killed me while you had the chance, sugarplum. Be seeing you.
  
                  Curve 
                    smashes his fist into the neon sign, then ducks out thedoor. 
                    Moments later we hear his motorcycle ROAR to life. He takes 
                    off, ENGINE SCREAMING away into the night.

                    Sarah lowers the gun, takes a deep breath, looks to Noah.
  
                  SARAH
You 
                    okay?
  
                  Noah 
                    wipes his bloody nose, looks to the floor where Curve discarded 
                    the drug sachet, shakes his head in disgust.
  
                  NOAH
Fuck 
                    me, wonder what they'll be snorting next?
  
                  Sarah 
                    shakes her head, at wits end.
  
                  SARAH
I 
                    just can't do this anymore... I'm so tired of this.
  
                  Noah 
                    pulls Sarah toward him, gives her a big hug.
  
                  NOAH
Easy 
                    there, luv. It'll all work out.
  
                  EXT. 
                    GRAY GARGOYLE, - NIGHT
  
                  Sarah, 
                    still clutching Curve's gun, hurries to her Galaxy 500 which 
                    is parked along the nearby train tracks.
  
                  INT. 
                    SARAH'S GALAXY - NIGHT
  
                  Sarah 
                    moves behind the wheel, dumps the gun on the seat, and rests 
                    her head in her hands. As Sarah raises her head...

                    SARAH'S POV (THROUGH WINDSHIELD)

                    The Crow is perched on the hood of her car. Sarah HONKS her 
                    horn in frustration. The Crow doesn't move.
  
                  EXT. 
                    GRAY GARGOYLE, ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
  
                  Sarah 
                    rushes out of her car, screaming at the bird.
  
                  SARAH
Get 
                    out of here! Go!!!
  
                  Sarah 
                    FIRES a wild shot into the sky. The Crow files off into the 
                    night. Sarah collapses against the hood of her Galaxy and 
                    starts to cry.

                    CUT TO:
  
                  EXT. 
                    CITYSCAPE - NIGHT
  
                  The 
                    Crow soars away from the Gargoyle, toward the beckoning lights 
                    of Downtown. In the distance, a flashing "JESUS SAVES" 
                    sign draws our attention to a monolithic tower.
  
                  EXT. 
                    JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT
  
                  The 
                    Crow makes its way towards the decaying tower, which is crowned 
                    by a weather-worn campanile. The campanile is a complex arabesque 
                    of rusted iron scrollwork, like something Antonio Gaudi conjured 
                    up from an art nouveau fever-dream.

                    Just as the Crow is about to reach the campanile, it banks 
                    away. We, however, continue to rush onward, right through 
                    one of the dark openings in the scrollwork...
INT. 
                    JUDAH'S TOWER, CAMPANILE - NIGHT
  
                  SCRITCH! 
                    SCRITCH! All we see is black, then some vague, shiny reflections...

                    CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a stag beetle, imprisoned within 
                    a box, leashed to a nail with a piece of thread. We were tight 
                    on its shiny carapace. The beetle strains at its leash, moving 
                    in a perpetual circle around the nail.

                    CAMERA MOVES UP

                    over the side of the box. Although mere inches in height, 
                    this enclosure might as well be the Great Wall as far as our 
                    little member of the Coleoptera is concerned.

                    AS THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK

                    we see crime lord Judah Earl's lair in all its sepulchral 
                    glory...

                    Dark, filled with shadows. The decor is a cross between ruinous 
                    palatial splendor and a SoHo industrial art installation. 
                    The upper reaches of the campanile are laced with a spiderweb 
                    network of steel girders.

                    Look close enough and you might see PEOPLE bound to the 
                    supporting pillars, like the half-glimpsed shapes crouching 
                    at the foot of your bed in the middle of the night.

                    VOICES draw our attention to an area partitioned off by chain-mail 
                    curtains. CAMERA MOVES IN towards a break in the curtains. 
                    We linger there for a tantalizing moment...
  
                  JUDAH 
                    (V.O.)
Talk 
                    to me, Sibyl. Tell me what you see.
  
                  SIBYL 
                    (V.O.)
I 
                    see Death returning from the veil of tears. He has your name 
                    on his tongue.
  
                  Now 
                    we plunge in through the curtains...

                    The "camera" consists of a series of lenses and 
                    mirrors which project images from the outside world onto a 
                    circular table, offering the ultimate voyeuristic view of 
                    the crumbling cityscape. TWO FIGURES stand with their backs 
                    to us, studying the camera's view. The first is...

                    JUDAH EARL,

                    A sinewy, slash-mouthed Byronic figure with a guttural voice. 
                    Old before his time, touched by childhood visions of his own 
                    death. The tower is Judah's prison in more ways than one.

                    SIBYL, Judah's blind oracle, waits by his side. Attractive, 
                    though of indeterminate sex. His/her dour features are hidden 
                    beneath a black cowl.
  
                  JUDAH
(fatalistic)
It's 
                    finally beginning, isn't it? What mask will Death wear, can 
                    you tell me that?
  
                  SIBYL
I 
                    see the face of one of your victims.
  
                  Judah 
                    lifts his head up and we see his luminous amber eyes for the 
                    first time. A kind of madness dances within them.
  
                  JUDAH
All 
                    my sins remembered.

                    sits in bed, cigarette burning in one hand, a half-filled

                    the window and the cityscape beyond - as if the answers were 
                    lying out there in the steam-cloaked streets.

                    bolts up in bed, knocking her wine glass to the floor, SHATTERING

                    within her chest.

                    she catches sight of a shadow on the wall before her - a 
                    GIANT BIRD slowly spreading its black wings.

                    Sarah turns to the window. The Crow is perched just outside.

                    PRESENTLY THE BODIES OF ASHE AND DANNY

His dead eyes suddenly open. Confusion. Pain. Fear. 
                    A stream of bubbles rushes from his mouth, obscuring our view.

                    ASHE'S POV

                    As the bubbles clear, Danny's face comes into focus just 
                    a few inches from his own.

                    Ashe panics, jerks back. The razor-wire barbs cut into his 
                    flesh. The more he struggles, the tighter the coils become, 
                    slashing his hands and face, shredding his clothes. He's caught 
                    in his son's embrace, the two of them thrashing about in a 
                    grotesque underwater ballet.

                    opens his eyes. The mud-silt which covers his face has dried 
                    and cracked, causing it to crumble away in flakes.

                    Ashe is lying on a cot in the middle of the loft. We see scattered 
                    images: candles burning, a reilgious altar overflowing with

                    sits on the other side of the loft in a paint-smeared work-shirt,

                    where bullet holes should be. Instead, he finds a series 
                    of indented welts.
  
                  ASHE
How 
                    did I survive?
  
                  Sarah 
                    suddenly comes to the terrible realization that Ashe does 
                    not know he has died.
  
                  SARAH
(coming 
                    towards him)
You 
                    didn't.
  
                  Ashe 
                    looks up at Sarah, uncomprehending.
  
                  SARAH
You're 
                    dead.
  
                  ASHE
No...
  
                  Ashe 
                    stands, enraged. He starts toward Sarah. She backs away...
  
                  ASHE
Stop 
                    looking at me that way -- stop looking -- this isn't real, 
                    none of this is real! I'm dreaming this.
  
                  SARAH
(shaking 
                    her head, frightened)
No.
  
                  The 
                    two of the struggle a moment, Ashe pushes Sarah back. Sarah 
                    reaches for him, trying to restrain him, trying to somehow 
                    keep his rising terror in check... she's not getting through 
                    to him, he can't be made to listen...

                    Finally, Sarah grabs a kitchen knife from the counter and 
                    plunges it into Ashe's chest.

                    Ashe gasps. He stares down at the incongruous sight of a knife-handle 
                    stickout out from his sternum, then he yanks the knife back 
                    out. No pain. No wound. A moment of shock, then...
  
                  ASHE
(looking 
                    at her, a tortured whisper)
I'm 
                    dreaming this.
  
                  Sarah 
                    tries to reach for Ashe again. He tears away from her, flinging 
                    her back and running for the door.

                    CAMERA ISOLATES a tempera painting on the floor that's been 
                    executed on construction paper. A brush and a collection of 
                    paint canisters are scattered around it, like the kind you 
                    might find in a primary school art class. Ashe kneels next

Hey,

No.

                  Ashe 
                    is tearing the place apart, sobbing, knocking over racks of 
                    tools. Finally, he sinks to his knees, his face a mask of 
                    tears.

                    Ashe spins, murderous rage in his eyes. Never startle an animal, 
                    right?

                    SARAH

                    stands in the doorway.
  
                  ASHE
Why 
                    are you here?
  
                  SARAH
I 
                    don't know.
  
                  She 
                    stops herself -- she does know, she just didn't want 
                    to admit it to herself.
  
                  SARAH
I 
                    want to help you. I need to.
  
                  Sarah 
                    approaches, dropping by Ashe's side. She sees Danny's painting 
                    which Ashe cradles protectively.

                    Ashe looks up at Sarah, his eyes full of questions.
  
                  ASHE
Everything's 
                    so confused...
(anguished, 
                    touching the drawing)
Danny...

He's 
                    not here anymore.
  
                  Sarah 
                    draws closer, touched by Ashe's inner struggle. She reaches 
                    out to him, drawing him into her arms. He stares up at her, 
                    eyes distant.
  
                  ASHE
There's 
                    no moon...
  
                  Sarah 
                    touches Ashe's face, calming him, trying to reach through 
                    his pain.
  
                  SARAH
You've 
                    been given another chance, Ashe -- to put the wrong things 
                    right...
  
                  Sarah's 
                    eyes drop to the canisters of paint which have been scattered 
                    nearby. She reaches for the canister of white and unscrews 
                    the lid, dipping her fingers inside...

                    Sarah's re-creation of the irony war mask has an oddly ritualistic 
                    feel to it. Yet the act is also quite erotic, for the mutual 
                    attraction between these two battered souls is almost palpable.

                    As Sarah continues to speak, she begins to paint Ashe's face 
                    using Danny's art supplies.

                    We see this transformation in bits and pieces - an eye here, 
                    fingers dipping into the canister of white there, ruby lips 
                    being smeared with black...

                    ...the face that is taking shape is both similar to and 
                    different from Eric's. It's the legacy of the Crow, as funneled 
                    through Ashe's own, unique pain.
  
                  SARAH
I 
                    believe there've always been people like you...
  
                  Sarah 
                    has finished. She sits back, surveying her work...
  
                  SARAH
It's 
                    the pain that brings people back. It makes us strong again.
  
                  CLOSE 
                    ON ASHE'S FACE as he turns towards us. A slash of light illuminates 
                    the signature black and white war-paint of the Crow in all 
                    its glory. Ashe looks like a dark saint.

                    lands on a telephone wire, studying the warehouse.

                    The walls are stained from the toxic fumes. Blacked-out windows 
                    sweat with moisture. There are heating mantles rigged with 
                    flasks and condensers, vacuum pumps - along with ingredients 
                    like battery acid, paint thinner, and Epsom salts. Nearby 
                    are dozens of 50-gallon drums containing the finished product.

                    Spider Monkey is working away at the printing press, pausing 
                    to snoot some of Judah's drug. Nearby is an old TV featuring 
                    lurid videos of amateur bull riding - we watch as a drunken 
                    participant gets gored.

                    springs from the ground, SLAMMING Spider Monkey against a

                    All your nightmares rolled into one.
  
                  Ashe 
                    removes a wooden match from his inside coat pocket. He scrapes 
                    his thumb-nail over the head, igniting it.

Whoa...this

I'll

                    MONKEY
Nemo? 
                    Nemo's an old gash-hound. He hangs out at the Peep-O-Rama 
                    on Deacon Street!
  
                  WHOOSH! 
                    Ashe blows the match out.
  
                  ASHE
Congratulations, 
                    monkey. You just bought yourself a fighting chance.
  
                  Ashe 
                    reaches into his coat pocket, pulling out a deck of cards. 
                    He fans them out, points...
  
                  ASHE
Pick 
                    a card, monkey.
  
                  Spider 
                    Monkey slowly extends his hand, half-expecting Ashe to pounce 
                    on him. He pulls a card out.

                    Spider Monkey tosses the card down, face up. He's got the 
                    Jack of Hearts. he smiles tentatively. Ashe pulls out a card 
                    of his own and flips it around - the King of Clubs.

                    emerges from the raging conflagration, walking right through

                    enters a cramped booth, clutching a handful of tokens embossed 
                    with the Peep-O-Rama eye logo on them. There's a seat, a box 
                    of Kleenex, a phone, and a grimy Plexiglas window with a metal 
                    shutter over it.

                    Nemo starts popping tokens into the slot next to the window, 
                    pockets the rest of them.

                    With a WHIR the metal shutter rises, revealing a WOMAN in 
                    a garter-belt get-up perched on a stool. In a forgiving light, 
                    she might even be beautiful.

                    An LED display starts counting down from sixty - the seconds 
                    remaining on the metered shutter. Nemo picks up the receiver.

                    shotgun. BOOM! He blows a blast into Ashe's chest!

                    Ashe starts toward Zeke, unfazed. Zeke moves to fire again...

                    Ashe snatches the shotgun from the fat man's grasp, smashing 
                    him in the face with the butt-end. Zeke falls back into a

                    down on top of him.

                    oh baby, I like it like that. You're so good. You're so good...
  
                  ASHE
Three 
                    crows a letter, four crows a boy...
  
                  Ashe 
                    HEAVES Nemo back the other way, sending him SMASHING into 
                    the front counter. Peep-O-Rama tokens go flying, bouncing 
                    and spinning every which way...

                    CLOSE ON A SPINNING TOKEN

                    On one side of the coin the eye is open, on the other it's 
                    closed - this creates the illusion of the eye blinking.
  
                  ASHE
Five 
                    crows silver, six crows gold...
  
                  Nemo 
                    utters a half-sob and rolls over, feebly wiping away the blood 
                    which is clouding his eyes.
  
                  ASHE
Seven 
                    crows a secret never to be told.
  
                  NEMO
...please, 
                    please just stop...
  
                  Ashe 
                    pries open Nemo's eyes with his fingers.
  
                  ASHE
You 
                    killed my son, Nemo. You took away the only piece of light 
                    left in my soul.
  
                  NEMO
We 
                    had to! Judah's orders. Never leave any witnesses! We didn't 
                    have a choice!
  
                  ASHE
We 
                    always have a choice.
  
                  Ashe 
                    plunges his fingers into Nemo's eyes - killing him off-camera. 
                    He lifts up his now blood-covered hands and turns...

                    Just then, Holly Daze bursts out into the hall. She sees Ashe 
                    and YELPS, certain her number's up. Ashe grabs her by the 
                    wrist, spinning her around.
  
                  HOLLY 
                    DAZE
(cringing)
...no...
  
                  Ashe 
                    touches her face and sees a split-second FLASH of...

                    HOLLY DAZE DANCING

                    Jump-cut bump and grind, CAT-CALLS, LAUGHTER, the distorted 
                    faces of men leering with their hungry eyes, tongues and sweaty 
                    palms and heavy breath and I wanna be your fucking dog, baby, 
                    and...

                    BANG! ASHE

                    shuts his eyes, reeling...

                    Ashe looks up at Holly - one victim to another. His eyes burn 
                    a laser beam into her soul.
  
                  ASHE
If 
                    you value what you've lost, you'll walk away from this place 
                    and never look back.
  
                  Holly 
                    Daze nods with conviction. Ashe releases her. She bolts like 
                    a rabbit flushed from cover.

                  EXT. 
                    PEEP-O-RAMA - NIGHT
  
                  Curve 
                    ROARS UP on his motorcycle, followed by Kali and a car-load 
                    of ENFORCERS. The team grab their weapons, head for the porno 
                    shop...
  
                  KALI
Inside!
  
                  Kali 
                    leads the crew of killers into the porno shop. But Curve stops, 
                    sensing something. He spins around...

                    THE CROW

                    is sitting atop one of the cars, watching him.
  
                  INT. 
                    PEEP-O-RAMA, BACK CORRIDOR - NIGHT
  
                  Kali 
                    and Curve move down the dark corridor. The PORN ACTRESS VOICES 
                    from the vid-booths continue their ORGIASTIC MOANS, but one 
                    voice in particular stand out.
  
                  KALI
Nemo?
  
                  DOLL'S 
                    VOICE
Ooh, 
                    oh baby, you're so good...
  
                  CAMERA 
                    FINDS NEMO'S BODY

                    at the end of the corridor, lounging in the arms of the sex 
                    doll which is still repeating its tinny refrain. Nemo's neck 
                    has been snapped and his head hangs at an awkward angle.
  
                  DOLL
...oh! 
                    Oh yea, that's the spot. Do me, baby. Do me.
  
                  There's 
                    a folded piece of paper shoved into Nemo's mouth. Curve pries 
                    it out. The paper unfolds like one of those snowflake cut-outs 
                    we used to make in grade school - only this cut-out is 
                    of a crow.

                    Written across the paper crow are the following words:


" 
                    I KNOW WHY JESUS WEPT"
  
                  A 
                    phone on the wall is RINGING. RINGING and RINGING. Finally, 
                    Curve leans in, snatches up he receiver...
  
                  ASHE'S 
                    VOICE
Do 
                    you know what they call a gathering of crows, Curve?
  
                  At 
                    the sound of Ashe's voice, Curve's eyes widen with fear.
  
                  ASHE'S 
                    VOICE
A 
                    murder. A murder of crows. Think about it.
  
                  CLICK! 
                    The line goes dead. Furious, Curve tears the phone from the 
                    wall, HEAVING it across the porno shop.
