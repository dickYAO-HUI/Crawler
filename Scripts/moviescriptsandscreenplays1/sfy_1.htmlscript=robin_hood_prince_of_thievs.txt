PETER OF DUBOIS

Thanks, I misjudged you

AZEEM

You're fast with a sword my friend

Five years I've waited for the smell of free air, that makes a man fast.
An arrow hits Peter in the chest
Peter, Peter!

PETER OF DUBOIS

It's mortal, leave me!
Give this ring to my sister Marian. Swear you'll protect her for me

Come my friend, make his sacrifice an act of honour. Come now.
Azeem and Robin run for the guards on horses
Why did you let me free, Christian?

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Whatever blood is in your veins, no man deserves to die in there.
Some guards pass their hiding place
Farewell, my friend, God'll speed your way

AZEEM

Our way lies together. With the speed of Allah. You have saved my life. Christian. Now I'll stay with you, until I've saved yours. That's my vow.

4 INT./ EXT./LOCKSLEY'S CASTLE, ENGLAND

LORD LOCKSLEY

Kind Sir, It's rumoured that you fought in King Richard's crusade with my beloved son, Robin. I fear you are returned home to desperate times. When dark forces plot against our absent king. I'm anxious for words of my son. Were you present at his capture near Jerusalem? Do you know the name of the potentate who holds him? Does he still bear me ill will? A little news, please sir. I would give all that I own for his release.

DUNCAN

Not now!

SERVANT

Help me, my Lord!

DUNCAN

You should have waited. I'm sorry you were disturbed, master.

LORD LOCKSLEY

Duncan, it's alright. Let him go:

SERVANT

They have taken my Gwen.My daughter..

LORD LOCKSLEY

Who has taken?

SERVANT

Men on horses, in masks. We tried to stop them, but:My son is dead. He's dead!

DUNCAN

Master, stay. There's an evil moon tonight.

LORD LOCKSLEY

Never fear, Duncan. The good will overcome. Trust in that.

SERVANT

I'm sorry, my lord. I had no choice
Man on horse takes his mask of; it's the SHERRIF of Nottingham

LORD LOCKSLEY

You!

SHERIFF

Locksley:

LORD LOCKSLEY

The king will hear of this!

SHERIFF

Join us

LORD LOCKSLEY

Never!
SHERIFF

Join us, or die!

LORD LOCKSLEY

For God and King Richard!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Oh, thank you Lord. I'm home! I'm home!!!

AZEEM

You are strange Christian

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Yes, but I'm free. And now I beg you to free yourself of your vow. Return with the boat.
I know how it feels to be so far from your home and family

AZEEM

Because I love them so much, I cannot dishonour them.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

I'd thought you'd say that.

AZEEM

Azeem's attacked, but wins the struggle
No one controls my destiny. Especially not one who attacks with down wind and stinks of garlic.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Come, Azeem. Our fighting days are done. By nightfall, we'll celebrate with my father.
You'll understand of course, I had to try.

AZEEM

I would have succeeded.

CUT TO

6 EXT./ ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE

Robin and Azeem are walking over a stone wall

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Why must you walk at the back of me?

AZEEM

In you country, am I not the infidel? It's seem safer to appear as your slave, rather then your equal

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

For an infidel, you have uncommon clarity of thinking. And you'll tell me nothing of yourself. For instance your name; Azeem, what doe sit mean?

AZEEM

Great one

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Great one? Really? Did you give yourself this name? It was a joke! Azeem the great one! I'm home! Look! Mistletoe. Many maids lost their resole to me thanks to this little plant.

AZEEM

In my country we talk to our women, we do not drug them with plants

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

What do you know of women?

AZEEM

Where I come from, Christian, there are women of such beauty. That they can poses a mans mind so, that they would be willing to die for her.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Wait. Was that why you were to be executed? Because of a woman?
That's it, isn't it? That's it!

AZEEM

It is close to sunset

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Who was she? The Mullah's daughter? Another man's wife? What's her name?

AZEEM

Is there no sun in this cursed country? Which way is east?

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Her name

AZEEM

East?!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Her name

AZEEM

Yasmina

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

That way!
Robin points Azeem to the East

AZEEM

You are sure?

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

I would know blindfolded, I'm five miles from home. Was she worth it?

AZEEM

Worth dying for

Little boy is being chased by soldiers and dogs

SOLDIER 1

You're dogsmeat, son, you know that?

SOLDIER 2

Get down here, you now what you've done. Down!

GUY

You're not playing by the rules, boy! Deer don't climb trees. Perhaps he thinks he's a gay bird! Shall we teach him to fly?

SOLDIERS

Yeah!

GUY

Get him down!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Hold! I'm curious:what man or creature is so fearsome that it takes six men to attack it.

GUY

This is no affair of yours

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Or are we treating the devil himself? A small boy. A truly dangerous animal

GUY

He killed one of the Sheriff of Nottingham's deer

WULF

We were starving! We needed the meat!

GUY

I advice you to move on, pilgrim, this is the Sheriff's land

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Wrong, this is my land and my tree. So whatever's in it also belongs to me

GUY

Might I have the pleasure of your name, before I have you run through?

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Robin of Locksley

GUY

Well, well, Locksley. Welcome home!  Kill him!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Azeem, it's time to redeem that vow!

GUY

Release the hounds!!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Get up, Azeem!
Points his swords in Guy's neck
Now, sir. If you'd be so kind to give me your name, before I run you through:

GUY

Guy of Gisborne, the Sheriff's cousin. The little bastard was poaching deer

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Poaching? Is it not a greater crime to starve a family?

GUY

Go on, Locksley, go on


ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

I've seen enough blood spilled to last two lifetimes. Now get off my land! And tell Nottingham what happens to scum when they pick on small children!
And you! (tegen Azeem) you've travelled ten thousand miles to  save my life and then leave me to be butchered?!

AZEEM

I fulfil my vow's when I choose!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

And that does not include prayertimes or mealtimes or any time I'm outnumbered by six to one?

AZEEM

You whine like a mule. You're still alive!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Have no fear, come down boy. Is it true boy, did you kill a deer?

WULF

Hundreds of them!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

You've scared him

AZEEM

Interesting place this England!

Cousin. I trust you justify your intrusion with news of profound value?

GUY

I met a hooded man today who made me warn you not to harm his people

SHERIFF

Who told you to cover up? His name?

GUY

Robin of Locksley

SHERIFF

The prodigal son returns! He's a whelp. This girl could vest him! Put it There!

GUY

Well, this whelp, has vested four of my men

SHERIFF

Your men were probably drunk! But you survived, cousin!

GUY

I've barely survived. He has a companion, a dark skinned foreigner with a dark face of Islam and a Saracens sword

SHERIFF

Yes yes, I'm sure it would take an army to match these roves
Locksley must have visited his manor and find the home fire still burning!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Father?! Father?! Anyone here? Duncan?  No:No!!

An old man appears in the ruins of the castle

DUNCAN

Master Robin, is that you?

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Duncan?

DUNCAN

Oh, praise thy, I thought that God had abandoned us

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Duncan, my father!

DUNCAN

It's a miracle:

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Why didn't you cut him down?

DUNCAN

Never thought to hear your voice again:

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Are you deaf?

AZEEM

Easy!! Look at him!

DUNCAN

I would have done it, if I could see.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Who did this to you, Duncan?

DUNCAN

Guy, Guy of Gisborne:and the SHERIFF and his witch looking on

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Why?

DUNCAN

They said the Sheriff captured your father worshipping the devil. He has signed a confession before the bishop

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

No, that's not possible!

DUNCAN

Nottingham declared all of Locksley's land forfeited

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Do you believe the charges?
DUNCAN

Not even when they took my eyes

AZEEM

DUNCAN

He loved you 'till the end, young master. He never gave up hope of your return

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

I should have been here
He called the crusades a foolish quest, he said it was vanity to force other men to our religion.

DUNCAN

You must (vluchten) now, head south to safety. Gisborne will surely seek revenge

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

I hear you, Duncan.
To Azeem You should go home. My world is turned upside down here. And I can not ask you to come where I'm going.

AZEEM

Alone Christian, you'll only get yourself killed. Besides there's nothing left for me to go home to

I will not rest until my father's revenged. I swear it by my own blood!

SHERIFF

Locksley! Does he affect us?

MORTIANNA

He proceeds the Lionheart

SHERIFF

If King Richard returns from the Crusades, that could prove a bit awkward. It will suffer the support of the barons. Soon?

MORTIANNA

Make haste!

SHERIFF

But my plan, is it still intact?

MORTIANNA

Aaaahhhh!!!

SHERIFF

What's wrong?

MORTIANNA

Well, then show yourself, child, for we knew each other well.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

The years have:.been kind

SARAH

Thank you. With the king away, we must guard us from villainous outlaws, who would kidnap a relative of his.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Surely you can see that I'm not one of those

SARAH

Perhaps. Now, move yourself from his house.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

I would my lady, but I've sworn to protect you.

SARAH

Protect me? Robin of Locksley was nothing but a spoiled bully. And besides as you can see, we have enough protection.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Marian, wait!
You're truly courageous against an unarmed man.

How do I know you didn't abandon him to save your own skin?

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

No one feels his loss more then I

MARIAN

Well, next time I go to London, I'll be sure to convey your condolences to my mother.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

I would think, for your safety, that you would join her there

MARIAN

No, I have no interest in life at court. All that gossip and carrying favours

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

But you're alone here

MARIAN

Hardly. These years have left us many in need. Well you and my brother were playing boy-hero Nottingham has plundered the shire.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

I see you still have your lands

MARIAN

Because I give them no excuse to take them
As the kings cousin it's my station to look after these people until he's returned

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Marian, Marian! My purpose to come here, was not to hurt you. I swore. I swore to your brother that I would protect you.

MARIAN

You can not replace my brother

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

I do not want to replace him. Marian, I've returned to my home to find it destroyed and my father murdered. And the only explanations for it are the ramblings (gebrabbel) of an old blind man.

MARIAN

All I remember of you is a spoilt bully who used to burn my hair as a child.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Please allow that years of war and prison may change a man.

MARIAN

Robin, whatever happened between you and your father, you mustn't believe...what they accused him of

I don't

CUT TO

21 EXT./ KREEK AND WATERFALL/ SHERWOOD FOREST

AZEEM

In my dreams alone have I imagined such a place

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Then imagine a way to cross it. There's hope!

After causing robin to fall in the river.

WILL SCARLET

There was a rich man from Nottingham, who tried to cross the river
What a dope, he tripped over a rope. Now look at him shiver!
Beg for mercy, rich boy!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

I beg of no man

WILL SCARLET

Well, this here is our river and each man that wishes to cross must pay a tax

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

I'll pay no tax, as you can see I have nothing. Not even my sword

JOHN

Any man who travels with two servants and claims that he's got no bloody money, is even a fool or a liar.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Who are you?

JOHN

John little, best man of the woods

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Well, best man. You lead this rabble?

JOHN

Yes I do mate. And if you want to travel through Sherwood Forrest, it's gonna cost you that gold medallion.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

This is sacred to me

JOHN

It's sacred to us to, mate. That there will feed us for a bloody month

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

You'll have to fight me for it

JOHN

Love to mate!

WULF

Be careful father, he won of twelve of the sheriff's men.

JOHN

Is that so? I reckon I'm gonna enjoy this

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

He! Is that your father?

WILL SCARLET

He's drowning!

JOHN

Lost something? Thanks for the taxes!

WILL SCARLET

Looks like the little rich boy is lost for words

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Any great ideas?

AZEEM

Get up! Move faster!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Move faster, great idea

WILL SCARLET

Watch it, John!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

We're not through yet!

JOHN

Already, my old cocker. You want another good whacking? You should have one!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

It seems like I've made it passed the gate, John Little. Or should I call you Little John?

WULF

Hit him father!

JOHN

Swimming time again, old chump!

WULF

Where is he? Do you see him?

JOHN

It's a bloody shame. He was a brave lad:Help!!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Do you yield?

JOHN

I can't bloody swim! Help!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Do you yield?

JOHN

Yes!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Good, now put your feet down

JOHN

I'll be buttered!

CUT TO

22 EXT./ CAMPFIRE/ SHERWOOD FOREST - NIGHT


JOHN

That's Max, the miller's son, Harold Brownwell and that stumpy one there is David of Doncaster, but the lads all call him Bull.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Because you're short?

DAVID

No, because I'm so long!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

No, Bull, save it, save it. Save it for the ladies

JOHN

Give the man some meat. Now I made that myself

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Is English hospitality changes so much in six years that a friend of mine is not welcome at this table.

UNKNOWN 1

But he's a savage, sire!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

That he is. But no more then you or I. And don't call me Sire

AZEEM

With regret I must decline. Allah forbids it

JOHN

You bloody lost me

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Why is it that so many of you are hiding

JOHN

Well, we are all outlaws. We have prices on ours heads. Even that young lad there. The blasted sheriff, he says we owe him taxes.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Well, your ghosts will only keep the sheriffs man at base so long

WILL SCARLET

Well, they have worked so far. Do you have a better idea?

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

You can always fight back

JOHN

I reckon I must have cracked that noble our of yours. Well these are all good lads here. They have hearts of oath but they are farmers. It would be lambs to the laughter. They say the sheriff was raised by a witch.

AZEEM

A witch?

WULF

She knows every man's thoughts, you can see her eyes fur and she flies.

JOHN

That's a load of Cotswold (onzin), Wulf.

WILL SCARLET

What does a rich son of a devil worshipper care about a bunch of outlaw pheasants:

DUNCAN

My Lord was a kind and generous man. Who among you dare to believe:

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

My father was no devil worshipper. And I'll have words with any man who says otherwise. But he's right. I was a rich man's son. When I killed the sheriffs men, I became an outlaw like you.

WILL SCARLET

You are nothing like us

JOHN

That is Will Scarlet. Take no notice of him, he's full of piss and wind. Come on lads, drink up. Don't talk about so much bloody rubbish. This here is the best that we simple men can expect. Here we're safe. We are kings!

CUT TO

23 EXT./ SHERWOOD FORREST - MORNING


ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Too much meat, old friend?

DUNCAN

Forgive me, I was asleep

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

No, no, rest yourself. What day is it, Duncan?

DUNCAN

Sunday, I think

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Do they still give alms to the poor at mass?

DUNCAN

They do, these days the need for mercy is greater then ever.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

How much?

MARIAN

One hundred goldpieces

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Is that all? I'll have to annoy the good sheriff more. Soon it'll be a thousand.

MARIAN

I would like to see that my lord

SHERIFF

If you would bring your household within the city walls I could give your every need personal attention

MARIAN

Well, thank you Lord but I'd rather stay in my family's home, for now.

SHERIFF

Well then perhaps, you do me the honour of accepting a small token of my undying devotion to your safety

MARIAN

My, King Richard would be deeply moved to hear from your concern for my welfare

SHERIFF

I'm afraid the King has many enemies, both abroad and at home. I fear for his safe return.

MARIAN

Yeah, a little

Well, so is the sheriff and today I gave him this thing he'll not forget

You fool, you've started a war!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

We're already in war

No, to lead you!

Perhaps we could create a name for him. Sometime to drive fear in to the hearts of the populous, maybe "Locksley the Lethal", or "Weakling Robin"

WILL SCARLET

We are divided, rich boy. I'm not as blind as that old man over there. You're still trying to be lord of the manor. I heard today that the sheriff now values your neck at five hundred goldpieces. I say we take him in!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Will, do you think that the sheriff will give everything back when I'm gone?

WILL SCARLETT

They'll give us the reward and our pardons

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Wrong. He'll stretch your necks one by one.

Well, what will you have us do? Fight men on horsebacks with rocks and our bare hands?

Look out!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

Thank you, Wulf. Wish to end this? Wish to go home? Then we must stop fighting amongst ourselves! And face that the price worth may be dear:But I for one would rather die and spend my life with hiding. The Sheriff calls us outlaws, but I say we are free! And one free man defending his home is more powerful then ten hired soldiers. The Crusades taught me that. I will make you no promises, safe one; that when you truly believe in your hearts that you're free then I say we can win!

DAVID

But they've got armour!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

They've got armour, so? Even this boy can be taught to find the chinks in every suit of armour.

STEPHEN
But we ain't got nothing to eat!

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

What do we need that the forest can not provide? We have food, wood for weapons. We'll find safety in the trees.

How is it that a once arrogant young nobleman, has found contentment living rough with the salt of the earth?

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

I've seen knights in armour panic at the first hymns of battle. And I've seen the loneliest, unarmed squire pull a spear from his own body, to defend a dying horse. Nobility is not a birthright, it's defined by ones actions.

MARIAN

It's interesting to hear you say that.

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

I didn't. My father did.

MARIAN

Did the holy quest raise your hatred of him?

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

I don't know. All I know was that our last words spoken in this world were spoken in anger
I was lost after my mother died. My father too and for a short time he found comfort in the arms of another woman. I thought he was betraying my mother's memory. For the love of a twelve years old boy who would never forgive him. Anyway, who says I'm content? I've my plans for the future

No?! A grander scheme than this?

ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY

No, a simpler one. A home, a family...you know

I had a very sad childhood, I'll tell you about it sometime. I never knew my parents. It's amazing I'm sane.
