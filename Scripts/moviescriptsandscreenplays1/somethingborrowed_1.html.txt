FADE IN:

CLOSE ON A WOMANS FACE, BEAUTIFUL AND STRONG. SHES CRYING.

INT. KATS BEDROOM - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

The woman is KAT ELLIS, 30. Tears stream down her face as
she sits cross-legged amid the detritus of a packing frenzy.

There is an unfortunate green bridesmaids dress hanging on
the back of the door.

Kats pain is palpable. She buries her head in her lap.

Suddenly, the doorbell RINGS.

Kat sits bolt upright, wide eyed. She looks around in
disbelief. How did this happen? What is she doing on the
floor?

                         KAT
                    (sweetly)
               Hold on!

INT. HALLWAY

A BIKE MESSENGER stands outside Kats door. He busts a
covert ipod dance while he waits.

                         KAT (O.S.)
               Coming!

INT. KATS FOYER

Kat wipes her face and inhales, summoning deep calm.

INT. HALLWAY

The Bike Messenger looks up as the door swings open.

Kat is a changed woman. Nothing like the girl we saw on the
floor. Youd never know she had been crying. Or that she
even knows how.

                         KAT
               Im so sorry. I wasnt quite ready
               for you.

Kat props the door open with her foot as she slides a plane
ticket into an envelope. She scribbles a name on the
envelope, seals it, and hands it to him.

                         BIKE MESSENGER
               Lady, you said this was a rush. I
               cant rush anything anywhere if you
               dont give it to me.

Kat looks down at the envelope, shes still holding on to it.

                         KAT
               Its a plane ticket.

                         BIKE MESSENGER
               So it is.

                         KAT
               For a date.
                    (beat)
               For my date. To my sisters
               wedding. In London.
                    (beat)
               Hes never met my family.

                         BIKE MESSENGER
               I hear that noise.

Kat wills herself to surrender the envelope.

                         BIKE MESSENGER (CONTD)
               You need to let go.

                         KAT
               Yeah.
                    (beat)
               Youre going to have to help me.

The Bike Messenger gently tugs the envelope out of her hand.

Kat smiles.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Thank you.

The Bike Messenger looks at her with genuine concern.

INT. KATS APARTMENT

Racing against time, Kat throws open a linen closet to reveal
three neat rows of plastic bins, all perfectly labeled. Kat
reaches into the bin marked "TRAVEL" and pulls out a prepacked
toiletry kit.

Kat pulls a box marked LONDON out from underneath her bed.

She opens it.

Pushing aside an old private school uniform and some letters,
she pulls out a worn London A-Z, a Ziploc marked ADAPTERS,
and her passport.

Shes about to close the box when she sees an old photo. In
it, a GORGEOUS GUY kisses Kat on the cheek. Hes holding the
camera himself -- its blurred and goofy, but full of love.

Kat jams it back in the box and shoves it under the bed.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET

The Bike Messenger darts in and out of traffic, avoiding the
throngs of NEW YORKERS enjoying this crisp fall day.

INT. KATS APARTMENT

Kat races through her apartment, packing, cleaning, getting
ready. Her place is small yet put together. Its Crate and
Barrel meets Martha. But in a good way.

INT. KATS BATHROOM

Kat, finally still, stares into the mirror as she brushes her
teeth. Theres a strange intensity to it, like shes
scrubbing away the last of her distress.

EXT. BROWNSTONE APARTMENT

The Bike Messenger passes a waiting Town Car as he pulls up
to a stoop. He hefts his bike, runs up the stairs, and slips
the envelope into the door of...

INT. BROWNSTONE APARTMENT

A tasteful flat. Stylish yet masculine. A MAN stoops to
pick up the envelope. We dont see his face, just his
ordered, minimalist apartment as he zips his carry-on and
walks out the door.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET

His face obscured, the man steps into the purring Town Car.

EXT. KATS APARTMENT BUILDING

A TAXI DRIVER slams his trunk as Kat gets in. Kats
apprehensive face peers out the window as they pull away.

INT. JFK AIRPORT

A ridiculously long line snakes towards the X-Ray machines.

Latte in hand, Kat cuts right through the middle.

Irate PASSENGERS scowl at her. Kat does this every day. She
should be used to the looks by now. Shes not. She
pointedly flashes the crowd her AIRPORT EMPLOYEE BADGE as she
sails through security.

INT. CUSTOMER SERVICE - JFK AIRPORT

Kat enters the Virgin Atlantic customer service hub. Its as
cramped as it is busy. A FEMALE EMPLOYEE approaches with a
question. Kat puts up her hand.

                         KAT
               Im off duty. I do not exist.
               Dont even look at me.

The lady backs off. As Kat hurries away, a HARRIED EMPLOYEE
matches her step and launches in.

                         HARRIED EMPLOYEE
               Ive got a tour group from Taipei
               trapped in customs, a dead poodle
               in Cargo parked at T9, and a lost
               grandmother staggering around
               International asking for her mommy.
               Oh, and theres a guy on two who
               was stuck with his in-laws for a
               week because we couldnt get him
               out of Dulles. The in-laws arent
               speaking to him anymore and, for
               some reason, hes pissed.

Kats trying not to get sucked in.

                         KAT
               I would love to help you.
               Sincerely. But my sisters getting
               married this weekend, I havent
               seen my family in two years, and my
               flight leaves in fifteen minutes.

The Harried Employee looks like hes going to lose it. Kat
struggles, then caves.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               You take Taipei. Tammys schnauzer
               just had puppies.
               Put her on the dead dog. Park reps
               with wheelchairs at every john in T8.
               If Grandma just got off a trans-con,
               shes gotta go sometime.

Kat starts to walk away.

                         HARRIED EMPLOYEE
               What about line two?

Kat spins around and glares at him.

INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

On the phone, Kat is in the middle of saying way too much.

                         KAT
                    (into phone)
               I completely understand, sir. You
               just want your in-laws to see you
               the way you see yourself. Or at
               least the way you would see
               yourself if you didnt feel so
               victimized by them.

At that moment, a CLIPBOARD manager walks by. He overhears
Kats diatribe and is incredulous.

CLIPBOARD
Hello? Calls may be monitored for
quality control?

                         KAT
               Huh?

                         CLIPBOARD
               Over-share!

Kat waves him off. Then, by rote:

                         KAT
                    (into phone)
               Mr. Rajagopal, we regret that you
               were snowed in at Dulles but
               snowstorms fall under a category
               called force majeure. Along with
               earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods.
               In short, were not liable.

Kat checks to make sure the Clipboard has moved on. Then,
she continues, softly but very quickly.

                         KAT (CONTD)
                    (into phone)
               But just this once, Im going to
               refund the full price of your
               ticket and credit you 10,000
               frequent flyer miles. Thank you
               for calling Virgin Atlantic!

INT. CABIN - PLANE

Kat sits in first class, absently scanning the safety card.

A PRETTY WOMAN across the aisle notices and smiles.

                         PRETTY WOMAN
               Your first trip?

Kat realizes shes been reading the safety card. She laughs
and puts it back in the seat pocket. As she often does, Kat
feels compelled to explain.

                         KAT
               Hardly. My family moved to England
               when I was fourteen. My stepdads
               a professor at University College,
               London.
                    (beat)
               Im going back for my sisters
               wedding...and the best mans my ex.
               In case I chicken out, I want to
               know where all the exits are.

Kat eyes the front door, nervously.

                         PRETTY WOMAN
               I dont believe in marriage. I
               believe in hot sex. Of course,
               that draws men to me like flies to
               shit.

Kat doesnt know what to say, but then a HOT GUY walks up the
aisle. Kat looks at the empty seat next to her and smiles at
him. He returns the smile but sits next to the Pretty Woman.

                         HOT GUY
               Hello, my sweet darling.

He gives the Pretty Woman a madly in love kiss. The Pretty
Woman rolls her eyes to Kat -- what did I tell you?

INT. GALLEY - PLANE

Kat is hiding out. She tries to calm her nerves as a MALE
FLIGHT ATTENDANT pours her a cup of water.

                         KAT
               Im not a knuckler. I fly all the
               time. In fact, I transferred from
               Heathrow two years ago and now I
               run Bags and Nags here at Kennedy,
               so things are going really well for
               me. The reason I cant feel my
               legs is that any minute, my date is
               going to walk in that door. And I
               need him to look really, really
               good today.

                         MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                    (not listening)
               I wish I couldnt feel my legs.

Kat peeks around the corner and spots the back of the
mysterious MAN from the opening as he loads the overhead bin
above Kats seat. Kat gasps, ducking back.

                         KAT
               Oh, no. Hes here.

The Male Flight Attendant looks out at the Man, who leans
against Kats seat as he chats with a FEMALE FLIGHT
ATTENDANT. Kats in a panic.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               What do you think? Does he look
               hot, and is it the kinda hot
               thatll translate overseas?

                         MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
               I resent your stereotyping of a man
               in my profession but...

He checks out the guy again.

                         MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONTD)
               ...darling, hed be hot on Mars.
               Id like to unwrap him like a
               Harrods gift basket.

Kat smiles, relieved.

INT. CABIN - PLANE

The mystery man is NICK MERCER, 32, commanding and classy,
yet somehow totally genuine. He carries his 40s-crooner
good looks like he has no idea that men just arent made that
way anymore.

Nick takes two glasses of champagne from the blushing Female
Flight Attendant.

                         NICK
               Thank you, Lisa.

He turns around to take his seat and finds Kat standing
there, awkwardly.

                         KAT
               Hi. Hey.

                         NICK
               Kat.

Nick kisses Kat warmly on the cheek and hands her a glass of
champagne. Nicks totally at ease. This may as well be a
candle-lit bar.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Lets sit.

Kat awkwardly negotiates her drink as they take their seats.

                         KAT
               Im glad you found it okay. The
               airport. The plane, I mean.

Nick notices Kats anxiety, tries to settle her.

                         NICK
               I really am sorry I couldnt leave
               earlier. I know you would have
               loved a few hours to settle in
               before the party.

Kat melts a little. Thats just what she was thinking.

                         KAT
               Work must be crazy right now.

Nick gives Kat a quizzical look. Theres something going on
here. Though its not clear what. Kat fills the space.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Ive gotta warn you, you know those
               families where everyones out of
               their minds but at the end of the
               day, theyre family, so you love
               them?
                    (off his nod)
               Mines not like that.

The Flight Attendant appears with a small tray. Kat notices
the womans cheeks flush as she fumbles Nicks drink.

Nick smiles warmly, but deftly ends the moment. Hes like a
famous person who has learned to manage his adoring fans with
casual grace.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               I love my dad. But since hes my
               stepdad, hes technically not
               family. Hes more like a hostage.

Kat tries to find her seat belt. Its under Nick.

She reaches beneath him, tentatively, then pulls back,
embarrassed.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               My seat belt, its....

Nick pulls out the seat belt and hands it to her. Kat
buckles up, checks that its snug, then checks again.

They sit in silence as the plane starts barreling down the
runway.

As they pick up speed, Nick takes Kats hand. She finds
comfort in his touch, her need to talk abates momentarily.

She is safe.

Kat closes her eyes as the plane levels off, then peeks over
at Nick, whos calmly staring out the window. She closes her
eyes again, this time for good.

EXT. LONDON - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM - HEATHROW

Nick and Kat wait at the baggage claim. She looks at his
tie, then down at her dress. They are the exact same color.

                         KAT
                    (concerned)
               Please tell me youre not wearing
               that tonight.

Her dress is indeed the exact same color as Nicks tie.

                         KAT
               Its no big deal. Really. It just
               looks like a tailor cut off a yard
               of my dress and made your tie out
               of it.

Nick doesnt get it. He heaves one of Kats suitcases onto a
trolley full of matching suitcases.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Dont get me wrong, matchings
               fine. Its matchy matchy youve
               got to watch out for.
                    (re: outfits)
               This is matchy-matchy.

Nick, amused, tugs the last of the bags off the carousel and
adds it to a pile of what appears to be an entire floor model
of matching luggage.

                         NICK
               You think we look like were trying
               too hard.

                         KAT
               Exactly. I want us to look like we
               fit, but not like were trying too
               hard to look like we fit.
                    (beat)
               Its welcome cocktails, not prom.
               With this level of matchy-matchy, we
               should be drinking peach schnapps
               under a bleacher somewhere.

Nick laughs at Kat. Then fixes her with an intense stare.

                         NICK
               Ill teach you a trick. If you
               look people in the eye, theyll
               never even notice what you have on.

Kat, overwhelmed by his charisma, is mesmerized.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               What color are my shoes?

                         KAT
                    (dreamily)
               You have feet?

Nick smiles sweetly and touches her cheek.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - OUTSIDE LONDON - DAY

The Heathrow Express thunders towards London.

INT. HEATHROW EXPRESS - [MOVING] - DAY

Nick stands by the W.C., flipping through Cosmo. He can do
that without looking gay. He talks to Kat through the door.

                         NICK
               I understand how important this is
               to you, but youre a beautiful
               woman and youve got everything in
               the world going for you. I
               couldnt care less what you have
               on.

Kat comes out modeling a black strapless.

                         KAT
               Dont patronize me.
               Theyve clearly been at this a while.

                         NICK
               Youre funny.

                         KAT
               Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if
               you feel like crap, its way better
               to look hot while youre doing it.

He checks her out.

                         NICK
               Mission accomplished.

                         KAT
               Really?
                    (beat)
               Dont get too attached.

She bolts back to the bathroom, nearly knocking over a ZITTY
TEENAGER whos waiting his turn.

                         ZITTY TEENAGER
               I liked the red one better.

                         NICK
               Ill let her know.

INT. W.C. - HEATHROW EXPRESS

Kat, alone in the W.C., meticulously rearranges a layer of
paper towel on the floor so she can step out of her shoes.

She expertly slides off the first dress while simultaneously
pulling another one on -- not an inch of skin shows.

She struggles as the train rocks back and forth.

                         NICK (O.S.)
                    (through the door)
               I bet youre doing that girl thing,
               where you get undressed without
               showing any skin.

Kat looks around suspiciously.

                         KAT
               No, Im not.
               Howd he know?

INT. HEATHROW EXPRESS - CONTINUOUS

Kat emerges from the bathroom wearing the new dress. Nick
checks it out.

                         NICK
               Mmm.

                         KAT
               Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--
                    (British accent)
               Gorgeous, I was insane to let you
               go!

                         NICK
               Both.

Kat looks to the Zitty Teenager for his opinion.

                         ZITTY TEENAGER
               Id do you.
                    (to Nick)
               I mean, if it was all right with
               you.

Kat gives the passenger an appreciative smile, then flies
back into the bathroom. Nick, amused by her antics, steps
closer to the door.

                         NICK
               You know, they say you can tell
               everything you need to know about a
               person from the way they act when
               theyre naked.

                         KAT
                    (popping her head out)
               I dont do naked. My sister? She
               does naked.

Kat ducks back into the bathroom.

MUSIC UP. NAKED MONTAGE:

INT. W.C. - HEATHROW EXPRESS

Kat pulls her dress over her head.

MATCH CUT TO:

ANOTHER WOMAN, PULLING OFF HER DRESS.

INT. AMYS BATHROOM

The woman is Kats sister, AMY ELLIS, 28. She graces a bath
mat in all her infinite nakedness. Totally nude, she gently
places her veil on her head and begins the ablutions of a
Greek goddess. A dot of bath oil, a pure white towel, one
squirt self-tanner, one squirt lotion.

Finally, she pulls out a bottle of olive oil, pours two drops
into her hands and rubs them together.

Then she stares in the mirror, regarding herself with a look
so blank it could be anything from admiration to revulsion.

Just then, a KNOCK.

The groom, EDWARD FLETCHER-WOOTEN, 31, enters, wearing a
robe. He flashes Amy as he does a silly dance then smothers
her inside his robe. Amy giggles and tries to break free.

At first shes laughing, but then she turns on a dime and
shoves him off more forcefully than she meant to.

She kisses him on the lips, trying to cover, and shoos him
out the door.

INT. BUNNYS DRESSING ROOM

The mother of the bride, BUNNY ELLIS, 60, drops her robe on
the floor. She is about to put on a bra when she catches her
reflection in a full-length mirror on the door.

She is momentarily surprised by what she sees. She turns and
faces her image. This is not the woman she is in her head.

This is an old woman with uncooperative skin. With one swift
movement, she slams the door.

INT. ELLIS HOUSE - ST. JOHNS WOOD

The father of the bride, VICTOR ELLIS, 65, wearing only a
pair of socks, walks downstairs. He's completely comfortable
in his nakedness and trots around as if he's fully clothed.

He sings to himself. The words of the song are
incomprehensible but he sings with an unrestrained Sinatra
sass.

Victor enters the kitchen, opens the fridge and starts
scrounging. Inside the fridge door, Victor bends over and
his bare butt sticks out. As he closes the fridge door, we
cut to...

A SHOWER DOOR SLIDING OPEN.

INT. JEFFREYS FLAT

Inside, the best man, JEFFREY JOHNSON, 31, the guy from the
snapshot under Kats bed, glistens with a post-shower flush.

Jeffrey towels off with a miniscule washcloth.

Stepping out of the bathroom, Jeffrey notices an 18-year-old
NYMPHETTE watching him through her kitchen window. He
crosses to the window but instead of closing the blinds, he
opens them wider and jumps up onto a pull-up bar.

The Nymphette blushes and looks away. As he starts pumping
and his manhood rises dangerously close to frame, we...

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. LANESBOROUGH HOTEL - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Upscale cars deliver upscale people to this stately hotel in
Central London.

INT. LOBBY - LANESBOROUGH HOTEL

Nick pays the BELLHOP, who trolleys away their bags. He
turns to find Kat. Shes wearing the red dress. The Zitty
Teenager was right. Its really hot.

Kat starts doing a yoga breath of fire, trying to relax.

Nick takes Kats hand and pulls her close.

                         NICK
               You okay, hon?

Kat nods, clearly not okay. Nick smooths a piece of hair
behind her ear. There is a practiced intimacy to the way he
touches her and Kat is almost settled by it.

                         KAT
               Im not sure I can do this.

Nick moves towards Kat as if hes going to kiss her, but then
he whispers in her ear.

                         NICK
               Youre never going to be sure of
               anything, but we still have to go
               inside.

Just then, Kats mother appears.

                         BUNNY
                    (singing)
               Baby love, my baby love.

A few BRITS dart looks at this very American display.

                         KAT
               Please, Mom. This is not the time
               to be yourself.

Bunny folds Kat and Nick into a drunken embrace. Bunny gives
Nick the once-over.

                         BUNNY
                    (to Nick)
               And who might this be?

Kats mortified but Nick quickly saves her.

                         NICK
               Im the new guy.
                    (kissing Bunny)
               Its great to meet you.

Bunny throws Kat an unsubtle, Im impressed look and leads
them into the party.

INT. LANESBOROUGH HOTEL

Bunny, Kat and Nick emerge into a sea of Burberry, floppy
hair, and unspoken judgments. Bunny turns to Nick and Kat,
all business.

                         BUNNY
               This is a marathon, not a sprint.
               After welcome cocktails, youve got
               the hen party. Tomorrow, theres a
               picnic and the rehearsal dinner and
               since youve conveniently left no
               margin for jet lag--
                    (squeezing Kats cheek)
               I need you to hydrate, baby.

Nick and Kat are stunned. Bunny hops away as Victor
approaches. Kat throws her arms around her stepfather.

                         KAT
               Dad!

                         VICTOR
               Hi, kiddo.

                         KAT
               Meet Nick.

                         NICK
               Sir.

They shake hands. Just then, Kats sister, Amy, dressed to
the nines, strikes a pose in the doorway.

                         AMY
               Im getting MARRIED!

As Kat and Amy squeal loudly and hug, Victor leans into Nick.

                         VICTOR
               I find a good, strong drink helps.

Nick smiles, looks at Victors glass.

                         NICK
               Can I get you a refill, sir?

Victor hands Nick the glass.

                         NICK (CONTD)
                    (sniffing the glass)
               Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years.
                    (beat)
               Neat, with a water-back.

                         VICTOR
               Is there any other way to take it?

Nick heads toward the bar and Victor turns to Kat.

                         VICTOR (CONTD)
               Whered you find this guy?

Kat smiles, appreciatively.

                         KAT
               The Yellow Pages.

Victor laughs. Across the room, Bunny has found a
microphone. She taps a knife on the side of a glass to get
everyones attention.

                         BUNNY
               Welcome, friends and family!

Then she taps the mic, which squeals.

ON KAT, panic stricken.

                         KAT
               Sweet Jesus, who gave that woman an
               amp?

ON BUNNY, drunk with happiness.

                         BUNNY
               Victor and I would especially like
               to thank our out-of-town guests for
               coming to celebrate with us as we
               welcome Edward and the Fletcher-
               Wootens into our family.

THE CAMERA IDs LYDIA and GEORGE FLETCHER-WOOTEN, 60s.

George shifts uncomfortably. Lydia waves as though
addressing a room full of her subjects.

ON JEFFREY, searching the crowd for someone. His eyes land
on Kat. She doesnt see him. He stares at her meaningfully.

                         BUNNY (CONTD)
               Its funny. We always thought wed
               marry off Kat first. We came close
               once, but that crashed and burned.

Nervous laughter from the crowd. Kat smiles through the
pain. Jeffrey winces sympathetically. His mind working, he
spots a piano nearby.

                         BUNNY (CONTD)
               Still, we had reason to hope. She
               was always one of the more active
               girls at the American school, and
               thats saying a lot.

Suddenly, a loud, lovely arpeggio from the piano. Bunny
looks over, surprised. Then she smiles.

ANGLE ON JEFFREY, sitting at the piano, playing.

                         BUNNY (CONTD)
               Okay, okay. I get the hint!
               Anyway, imagine our surprise when
               Ed moved in next door and fell in
               love with...the girl next door.
               Our Amy. Lucky for us, he had no
               idea it was an unforgiveable
               cliché.
                    (raising her glass)
               A toast to the bride and groom to be.
               Congratulations, babies!

Everyone claps as Jeffrey plays a final flourish.

INT. NEAR W.C. - LANESBOROUGH HOTEL - LATER

Kat is sneaking towards the ladies room when Jeffrey comes
out of the mens room. Their eyes meet. Both stop dead.

Neither can find words or even a smile. Kat pretends that
seeing him isnt a gut-punch, forces a silly grin.

                         KAT
               Thanks for, you know, with the
               piano.... It was really.... Hm.
                    (beat)
               I have to pee.

Kat slithers past Jeffrey into the W.C.

INT. W.C. - LANESBOROUGH HOTEL

Kat wills her breath back. She turns on the water as if she
were washing her hands. Then she confronts herself in the
mirror and applies a coat of lipstick like shes putting on a
suit of armor.

INT. NEAR W.C. - LANESBOROUGH HOTEL

Jeffrey, a dashing Brit, is not a man who likes to wait, but
wait he has. Kat emerges from the W.C. as if she hadnt seen
him before.

                         KAT
               Why, Jeffrey. Hello.

                         JEFFREY
               Hello, Katmandu.

As Jeffrey kisses her on the cheek, Kats eyes close and she
takes in his smell. Its like coming home. She doesnt want
it to, but something inside her stirs.

                         JEFFREY (CONTD)
               You look well, Gorgeous.

All he has to do is look her in the eyes and her big plans
fly out the window. Kat blushes.

                         JEFFREY (CONTD)
               Seeing you again....

                         KAT
               Yeah?

Just then, TJ, 30, Kats cousin, appears, wrapping Kat in a
hug. TJs deb-of-the-year perkiness is undercut by her
Longshoremans tongue.

                         TJ
               Kat Ellis! We live two hundred
               miles away from each other but I
               have to fly all the way to London
               to see you. You havent visited me
               once in D.C. Where the hell have
               you been? I have gynecologists
               that call more often.

                         KAT
               You have more than one gynecologist?

                         TJ
               Sure. Youve got to play them
               against each other. Otherwise they
               think youre easy.

TJ turns on Jeffrey like she just realized he was there.

                         TJ (CONTD)
               Hey, asshole, since you dumped my
               cousin brutally and without cause,
               you wont mind if I steal her away?

I have all kinds of interesting

things to tell her.

TJ darts Jeffrey a dirty look and drags Kat away.

INT. LANESBOROUGH HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Arms locked, Kat and TJ rejoin the party.

                         KAT
               You didnt have to do that.

                         TJ
               I wasnt saving you from him. I
               was saving you from yourself.

Youre too fucking nice.

                         KAT
               Dont worry. Im so over him.
                    (beat)
               By the way, do you know if hes
               seeing anyone?

They spot Nick talking to Bunny, surrounded by OCTOGENARIANS.

He doesnt look the least bit lost. In fact, hes charming
the Dockers off them.

                         TJ
               Why waste ten more seconds on the
               slimy limey when Mr. Tie-Me-Up-Tie-Me-

Down is waiting for you at the bar?

ANGLE ON NICK, listening patiently as Bunny pours her heart
out.

                         BUNNY
               After Kats father died and I
               married Victor, I was so desperate
               for my little girl to love him. It
               never occurred to me that she might
               love him more.

ANGLE ON KAT AND TJ, still staring at Nick.

                         TJ
               Whats he do anyway?

                         KAT
               Therapist.

Just then, Nick looks up and gives Kat an intimate, get over
here look. TJ sighs audibly.

                         TJ
               I think I just came.

INT. LANESBOROUGH HOTEL - LATER

Nick stands with Kat at the bar. The BARTENDER hands Kat a
drink.

                         AMY (O.S.)
               Can I have that?

Kat looks over and sees Amy. She puts her drink on the bar,
but Amy cant quite reach it from her stool. Amy makes an
exaggerated reaching gesture and whimpers.

Nick takes note as Kat slides the drink closer. Amy sips it
through the straw without picking it up.

                         AMY
               You know what I love about all
               this?

                         KAT
               Theres finally a reason for the
               whole world to revolve around you?

                         AMY
               Exactly! Todays my day. Tomorrow
               will be my day. And the day after
               that? My day.

As Amy gloats, Ed dances over. Hes a refreshingly
unaffected upper-class Brit.

                         ED
               Hows the future Mrs.?

Amy kisses him on the lips.

                         AMY
               Perfect. All ginny.

                         KAT
               Except its Scotch.

                         AMY
                    (ignoring Kat)
               But Im not taking your name,
               buster. Im a feminist!
                    (shaking her drink)
               I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get
               me more icey!

                         ED
               All right, then kiss me.
                    (she kisses him)
               God, Im a lucky sod.

Ed lifts Amy off the stool and spins her around. He does an
awkward dance move and steps on her toe.

                         AMY
               See what happens when you put off
               dance lessons til two days before
               the wedding?

Ed looks to Nick for support.

                         ED
               Whos ever heard of dance lessons
               for a wedding, honestly?

                         NICK
               Um, just about everyone.

                         ED
               You are taking the piss?

Ed looks to Kat, who shakes her head.

                         NICK
               Well go with you guys tomorrow. I
               suck too. Itll be fun.

Amy kisses Nicks cheek.

                         AMY
               I dont even know you, hunky-dunky,
               and I love you already.

Kat throws Amy a dark look.

                         ED
                    (to no one)
               Dance lessons. Right.

EXT. BALCONY - LANESBOROUGH HOTEL

Escaping, Nick steps outside and bumps into Jeffrey, who
teeters on the railing.

                         NICK
               Hey.

                         JEFFREY
               Oh, hello.

Jeffrey looks upset. Nick tries to break the ice.

                         NICK
               A wedding is a sacrament...a joyous
               celebration of love and commitment.

In Utopia. In the real world...

its an excuse to drink excessively
and say things you shouldnt say.

                         JEFFREY
               Ah, a philosopher.

                         NICK
               Shrink, actually.

                         JEFFREY
               Crikey.

                         NICK
               What?

                         JEFFREY
               Nothing, nothing.

                         NICK
               No, tell me.

                         JEFFREY
               You Yanks and your therapy. Its
               great.
                    (beat)
               Its all a bit too touchy-feely for
               me.

A beat as Jeffrey watches the party. He sees Kat and Amy at
the bar and slowly turns to Nick. With difficulty, he begins
to unburden himself to his new therapist.

                         JEFFREY
               Its just, theres this girl I care
               for -- God, I suppose I could even
               say I love her -- and the bugger
               is, of course, shes here with
               someone else. Bollocks!

Nick hides his surprise as Jeffrey raises his glass in a
silent toast to his misery. Nick is just clinking glasses
with him when Kat appears and slips her arm in his.

                         KAT
               Here you are.

Jeffrey is horrified. Stares at Nick, aghast.

                         JEFFREY
               Hey, Kat.

                         KAT
               Hey, yourself.
                    (to Nick)
               I see youve met my ex.

They all stand there, awkwardly.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Did I interrupt something?

Jeffrey looks desperately at Nick. Nick hesitates, then
covers.

                         NICK
               I was just telling Jeffrey how we
               met.

Kat gives Nick a confused look. Nick smiles warmly--

                         NICK (CONTD)
               The Knicks game? We both wanted
               the last hot dog?

                         KAT
               Oh, yeah.
                    (pointedly, to Jeffrey)
               So we split it. You know, as in
               share. People do that.

                         JEFFREY
               You hate sports.

Kat squeezes Nicks arm, adoringly.

                         KAT
               Not when Nick explains them.

Jeffreys desperate to get out of there.

                         JEFFREY
                    (to Nick)
               Right. I should be going. Good to
               meet you. Perhaps Ill see you at
               the stag party. My place.
                    (to Kat)
               You know the address.

Kat watches him rejoin the party.

                         KAT
               Well, he looks miserable. What
               were you talking about?

                         NICK
               Love.

Kat and Nick walk back into the party.

INT. LANESBOROUGH HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

They walk arm and arm. After the confrontation with Jeffrey,
Kats excitement is almost manic.

                         KAT
               Jeffrey knows love like he knows
               macramé.

                         NICK
               He was pretty drunk, but I think
               hes still crazy about you.

                         KAT
               Of course he is. Im here with my
               new man.
                    (beat)
               I love it! Your magics already
               working. Let the suffering begin.

Nick stops Kat and faces her. He is quiet but intense.

                         NICK
               The only one suffering here is you.
               You need to stop worrying about
               everyone else. You think you can
               do that?

Kat takes a deep, calming breath.

                         KAT
               No.

She turns and surveys the room, trying to calm down. But
then slowly her face begins to tense.

                         KAT
               What did he say exactly? I mean,
               you dont think he wants me back?

                         NICK
               I dont know.

                         KAT
               What does your gut say?

                         NICK
               Youre too good for him.

EXT. ST. JOHNS WOOD - LATER

Nick drives slowly down St. Johns Woods tree-lined main
street. Nick looks out the window as they pass a corner
market, a flower shop, pubs, restaurants.

EXT. ELLIS HOUSE - ST. JOHNS WOOD

A charming period house in a row of identical houses. Youd
never know where the Americans lived but for a conspicuous
boat trailer parked in the driveway.

Victor and Bunny try to help Nick unload Kats many bags from
the taxi. He wont let them. As Nick lugs the bags up the
driveway, he reads the name, JACK SHIP, off the back of the
dilapidated cabin cruiser.

INT. HALLWAY - ELLIS HOUSE

Nick struggles with Kats many bags as Kats parents escort
them upstairs. Kat stops by her bedroom door, doesnt go in.

                         KAT
               Well, here we are.

They stand there, awkwardly sandwiched into the small space.

                         NICK
                    (to Bunny and Victor)
               Thanks again for having me.

                         BUNNY
               Dont be silly. Its wonderful to
               finally meet you. Although,
               technically, I had no idea you
               existed because when my daughter
               turned twelve, she stopped talking
               to me, except when she needed
               money. So let me rephrase that.

It was nice to discover you existed
and then finally meet you all at
once. I love surprises.

                         VICTOR
               Okay, Bun. Thats enough.

Kat gives them a look, but doesnt open her bedroom door.

                         KAT
               Wheres Nick sleeping?

                         BUNNY
               Why, with you.

                         KAT
                    (not listening)
               My mother has a rule about men and
               women sleeping in the same room
               without a ring in the picture. She
               thinks its--

Kat puts her fingers up to do air quotes, then suddenly
realizes what her mother just said.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Huh?

                         BUNNY
                    (twinkling at Nick)
               Im not as square as my daughter
               thinks.

As Kats parents walk away, Bunny flirtatiously sidles up to
Victor and pulls him into their bedroom.

                         KAT
               She must have drowned her rules in
               the Chardonnay.

With that, Kat closes the door.

INT. KATS ROOM

The door CLICKS shut and the happy couple separates
instantly. Kat to one side of the room, Nick to the other.

Kats childhood bedroom has an aggressively floral decor.

                         KAT
               Sorry about the creepy room. I
               went through a painfully earnest
               Laura-Ashley phase.

Kat takes a brown envelope out of her purse, opens it, and
removes A STACK OF HUNDREDS.

She hands the pile of money to Nick.

                         KAT
               Count it. Six thousand even.

Nick doesnt look at the money, just tucks it into his bag.

                         NICK
               I trust you.

Kat almost lets it go, but then...

                         KAT
               No, count it, anyway.

                         NICK
               Why?

                         KAT
               Im compulsive and weird?

Nick humors her. Pulls out the stack of bills and counts it.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Six thousand, right?

                         NICK
               On the nose.
                    (beat)
               I tell you what, because youre so
               cute, Ill take care of our
               incidentals.

                         KAT
               How does it feel to get that much
               money just for being you?

                         NICK
                    (wryly)
               Great, with the occasional stabs of
               shame. Now, listen, this covers
               the weekend, but as we discussed,
               if you want to be intimate, we talk
               money before anything happens.

                         KAT
               That wont be an issue, believe me.
               I find the idea of sex for money
               morally repugnant.
                    (realizing)
               No offense.

                         NICK
               Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid
               for it. But please dont feel like
               you have to explain yourself to me.

Kat walks over to an old dollhouse. Its rooms have been
gutted, their mini furnishings replaced with a teenagers
cassette-tape collection.

Kat pulls out Guns and Roses Appetite for Destruction and
opens it. Theres no tape inside, just some nicotine
patches. Nick watches as she opens one up and slaps it on.

                         NICK
               You quitting?

                         KAT
               Im desperate to start but I dont
               have an addictive personality.
               Except for approval. That, I cant
               get enough of.

Nick notices an 80s poster of two guys with guitars, all big
hair and laser light shows.

                         NICK
               Who are they?

                         KAT
               Graham Russell and Russell
               Hitchcock.

Nick thinks about those names for a second, then his face
twists.

                         NICK
               Air Supply?

Embarrassed, Kat hastily rips down the poster and stuffs it
in the closet.

                         KAT
               My parents had a German exchange
               student a few years back.... He
               must have left it here.

Nick hides a smile as Kat ducks into the bathroom.

INT. KATS BATHROOM

Kat has left the door open a crack as she gets ready for a
shower. Unbeknownst to her, Nick watches from the bed,
enjoying the ritual.

                         KAT
                    (quietly)
               Everyone knows their greatest hits
               but some of their lesser-known
               ballads are surprisingly poignant.

Inexplicably, Kat stands on her tiptoes as she looks into the
mirror. Its a little thing, maybe the tiles are cold, but
it gives her an innocence that makes Nick smile.

                         KAT
               What?

                         NICK
               Its cute.

                         KAT
               What is?

                         NICK
               You stand on your tiptoes.

                         KAT
               I do?

Kat looks down, she never noticed before.

                         NICK
               Is it an old habit from ballet
               class or a childhood spent walking
               on eggshells?

She throws him a glance, impressed with the sharpness of his
mind.

                         KAT
               I never took ballet.

She smiles and kicks the door closed with her foot.

INT. KATS ROOM - LATER

Nick hangs up his tux. Its definitely not a rental. Kat
comes out of the bathroom, drying her hair with a towel.

                         KAT
               Have you ever done anything like
               this before?

                         NICK
               A weekend?

                         KAT
               A wedding.

Nick thinks about that. Kat wonders whats taking him so
long.

                         NICK
               No. Though strangely, Ive done
               quite a few funerals.

Kat makes a face.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Not the way youre thinking. The
               women wanted me there for support.
               You can understand that.

                         KAT
               I think thats disgusting.

Kat immediately backpedals.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Not you. Youre not disgusting.
               Youre lovely. Just the idea that
               theyd bring an escort. I mean, a
               stranger who, um, didnt...who
               never.... I mean, someones dead.

                         NICK
               Thats right. Imagine facing it
               alone.

Kat blanches.

                         KAT
               Sorry. Im a little nervous. I
               never thought something like this
               would happen to me.

                         NICK
               This happened to you?

                         KAT
               Well, happen, in the sense that I
               picked up the phone, tracked you
               down, flew you here and gave you
               six grand out of my 401K.

Nick laughs at her. Kat pulls something out of her purse.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Can I ask you something?

Nick sees what shes unfolding. Its a crinkled New Yorker
article. The artsy photo shows the FACE OF A MAN, blurred
against a neon cityscape. The title: Discretion Assured:
Diary of a Male Escort.

                         NICK
               How did you know that was me?

                         KAT
               I have a friend at the magazine.

                         NICK
                    (sharply)
               Your friend guaranteed my
               anonymity.

                         KAT
               If it makes you feel any better, to
               get your number, I had to cough up
               two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam
               and a case of mini-Baileys.

Nick shakes his head at her and pulls off his shirt. Kat
instinctively looks away.

                         NICK
               You can look. Its part of the
               package.

Kat cant tell if hes joking. She sneaks a look as Nick
disappears into the shower. Wow. Kat looks down at the
papers in her hand. She moves towards the bathroom but at
the last minute, shies away.

                         NICK (O.S.)
               Would you grab my shampoo?

                         KAT
               Shampoo, got it!

Kat grabs the shampoo and rushes into the bathroom.

INT. KATS BATHROOM

Without looking in the shower, Kat hands him the shampoo and
hurries out, way too quickly. Nick peeks out of the shower
curtain. Shes gone. He shakes his head and closes the
curtain. Suddenly, Kat reappears. She stands by the door.

                         KAT
               The part where you were a sexual
               surrogate and then started to, um,
               freelance. Is that really how it
               happened?

Kat pretends to straighten things up as she moves closer to
the shower.

                         NICK
               The real story is that my mother
               was a hippie. And a stripper. She
               was insanely inappropriate with me.
               She used to wash her lingerie in my
               bathwater. While I was still in
               the bath.

                         KAT
               Oh, no.

                         NICK
               Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find
               some way to experience intimacy and
               sex, but with rules that couldnt be
               violated.

Kats totally engrossed now. She closes the toilet lid and
sits down.

                         KAT
               Wow.

Nick pokes his head out.

                         NICK
               Yeah.

Nick sees that Kats heartbroken for him, feels bad.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Im just screwing with you.

Kat throws a towel at him.

                         KAT
               You shit!

                         NICK
               I have a different story for every
               woman who asks. I look at her and
               figure out what she needs to hear
               to feel okay about being with me.

                         KAT
               And you thought Id respond to the
               hippie stripper with no boundaries?

                         NICK
               Admit it. You were disturbed, but
               ultimately moved.

Kat gives him a dirty look, then examines the article again.

                         KAT
               This part here. You say, and I
               quote. Each woman has the exact
               love life she wants.
                    (beat)
               That seems like a pretty broad
               generalization.

Nick steps out of the shower. Kat, her eyes at the level of
his manhood, covers her subtle jaw-drop. Nick wraps a towel
around his waist as Kat tries to pull it together. She looks
down at the article, tapping it indignantly--

                         KAT (CONTD)
               So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you
               honestly think that I want to be
               single and miserable? That I want
               to be obsessed with some asshole
               who led me on for years then -- out
               of the blue -- shattered my heart.

                         NICK
               First of all, its never out of the
               blue. And second of all--

Nick levels his gaze at her.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Yes.

                         KAT
               What?!

                         NICK
               When youre ready to let go, to be
               unsingle and unmiserable, you will.
               Until then....

Nick shrugs and walks out of the room.

INT. STAIRWELL - ELLIS HOUSE - LATER

Nick and Kat walk downstairs, ready for a night out. Kats
wearing an over-the-top sexy golf outfit -- pleated mini
skirt, tight white oxford, plaid vest. On the bottom step,
Kat stops short.

                         KAT
                    (quietly)
               Is it always women?

Nick looks at her like shes crazy.

                         NICK
               Are you asking me if Im gay for
               pay?

                         KAT
               I guess so.

                         NICK
               What do you think?

Nick confronts her. She takes him in.

                         KAT
               Got it.

INT. SITTING ROOM - ELLIS HOUSE

Victor reads a book as Bunny scratches hieroglyphics on a
white board featuring an elaborate chart of information. Kat
and Nick enter, see the chart.

                         KAT
                    (to Nick)
               Moms refining her strategy for DDay.

                         BUNNY
               Im sure General Eisenhower never
               had to master the finer points of
               the seating chart and centerpieces.
                    (pointing proudly)
               Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are
               carpooling to the country with the
               Fletcher-Wootens.

                         KAT
               Sir, yes, sir!

She turns on her heel like a soldier, walks to Victor, and
holds out her hand,

                         BUNNY
               Make sure you show Nick Regents
               Park.
                    (winking)
               Its romantic at night.

Victor doesnt look up, just pulls the car keys out of his
pocket and tosses them past Kat to Nick.

                         VICTOR
               Better him on the wrong side of the
               road than you behind the wheel.

Kat huffs grumpily and they head out.

EXT. ELLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

Kat and Nick walk toward the car.

                         KAT
               So, um. What about testing?

Nick opens Kats door for her.

                         NICK
               Theres a guy on 81st and Madison.
               You get your results in 24 hours.
                    (beat)
               Do you make your lovers get tested
               before you sleep with them?

                         KAT
               My sixth-grade science project was
               entitled, Love Hurts: The
               Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus.
               Trust me, Im careful.

Kat gets in the car and Nick shuts her door.

INT./EXT. CAR - LATER

Nick drives while Kat navigates. They crawl down a small
street, which bustles with activity. PATRONS of Londons
many pubs spill out onto the pavement.

                         NICK
               I love that youre asking
               questions, but do you really want
               to get into all of this?

                         KAT
               This is awkward for me.
                    (beat)
               Talking about it makes me feel
               better.

Nick looks over at Kat, who gets quiet. She picks at nothing
on her skirt. The TICK TICK TICK of the indicator fills the
silence as Nick changes lanes.

                         NICK
               Hey.

Kat looks at him.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Dont stop asking questions, okay?

                         KAT
               Okay.

Kat smiles, but stays quiet. Then--

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Do you pay taxes?

EXT. QUIET SIDE-STREET - CONTINUOUS

Nick holds the door open for Kat as she gets out.

                         NICK
                    (with a laugh)
               I swear. I dont have a signature
               move.

                         KAT
               Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda
               of escorts.

                         KAT(cont'd)
               Getting you on the phone was harder
               than getting into college.

Nick turns off the car, gets out, walks around, and opens the
door for Kat. She gets out and stands by the door.

                         NICK
               I dont have gimmicks or play
               games. Its way more...

Nick rubs two fingers together, he cant think of the word.

                         KAT
               Subtle?

                         NICK
               I disappear. Its not about me.

Its about you.

Nick is standing very, very close to Kat now. She didnt
even see him move but there he is.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Its hard to explain.

                         KAT
               Show me.

Nick shakes his head.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Come on.

                         NICK
               Ive got this bad taste in my
               mouth. What is it? I think its
               the words: morally repugnant.

Kat tugs urgently on his waist.

                         KAT
               Show me.

Nick doesnt say anything for a moment. Then he pushes her
up against the car. Its a gentle movement, but firm. Kat
breathes in sharply from the power of it.

                         NICK
               Close your eyes.

Kats hesitant. She looks around the empty parking lot but
Nick takes her cheek and guides her eyes to his.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Close your eyes.

She does. Nick leans in close and begins whispering into her
ear with a hypnotic intensity.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Im not going to kiss you. You can
               relax. Youre safe.

Nick takes Kats head in his hands and moves his lips across
the contours of her face. Its incredibly intimate. His
mouth hovers over hers but their lips dont touch. They
breathe each other in.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Im not going to kiss you. Trust
               me. All you have to do is listen
               to my voice.

Kats body starts to relax. Slowly, she slumps back against
the car.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Hes going to be so sorry he let
               you go.

He moves his lips across her eyelids.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Hell look at you with your sexy
               dress and your perfect date but it
               wont matter because its not about
               him. Its about you.

As Nick slowly talks, he moves his lips across Kats
forehead, then her cheek, then her nose:

                         NICK (CONTD)
               I want you to let go of the hurt.
               ...the insecurity...the past. When
               you do, hell see you the way I see
               you, and, in that moment, hell
               finally understand what he lost.

Nick tips Kats chin towards him. She opens her eyes. Nick
is suddenly serious.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               But by then, the amazing thing
               is...you wont care.

Kat shudders, and gradually comes to. Her eyes are lazy, she
feels off balance.

                         KAT
               Holy crap. Youre worth every
               penny.

Nick gives her a half smile.

                         NICK
               You better get going.

Kat is turned on and cant seem to move.

                         KAT
               Okay, Yoda.

Silence.

                         NICK
               Go.

Nick turns Kat around and points her toward the bar next
door. Wearing an almost dopey look of pleasure, she adjusts
her underwear, and stumbles towards the bar. A sly smile
creeps across her lips as we...

                                                      CUT TO:

A LINE OF TWENTY SHOTS BEING SET AFLAME. WIDEN TO REVEAL --

INT. THE COCK & BOTTLE

Kat passes out the shots to a pack of WOMEN all wearing
hybrid golf-slut outfits: ass-tight polo shirts and plaid
Capri pants abound. Its Society Girls Gone Wild.

                         KAT
               Yo, ladies! Listen up! The bride
               has made the foolhardy and perhaps
               fatal request, that we play Pub
               Golf tonight.
                    (holding up a shot)
               Behold hole one. Theres a twostroke
               penalty for failure to
               finish a hole and a three-stroke
               penalty for barfing. Yell Fore!
               before you barf and its only two
               strokes.

The girls are scared shitless.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Weve got eight more holes waiting at
               eight more bars, so in the name of
               all things sacred, pace yourselves!
                    (raising her shot)
               To Amy!

Amy loves the attention.

                         AMY
               To me!

Cheering, the girls blow out their shots and do their best to
down them in one go. Just then, Nick walks in.

All eyes are drawn to him. The WORLD SLOWS as he beelines
for Kat. He hands Kat her purse.

                         NICK
               I thought you might need this.

Kat gives Nick a shy smile.

                         KAT
               Silly me, where was my head?

Kat cant help noticing that the group of girls has subtly
clustered around Nick.

                         TJ
               Stay. Have a fiery drink with us.

                         NICK
               I dont know....

A SMITTEN GIRL puts a drink in Nicks hand.

                         SMITTEN GIRL
               Stay.

Nick looks to Kat, she smiles. Amy furrows her brow
theatrically. Unfortunately, no one sees her.

INT. THE COCK & BOTTLE - LATER

Nick is surrounded by women and completely at ease. Amys
drunk and pouty. TJ stands between Kat and Amy. Oblivious
to the brewing tension, shes eating beer nuts and staring at
Nick.

                         TJ
               Its like the directors cut of 9
               1/2 Weeks.

She pops a nut in her mouth.

                         TJ (CONTD)
               The thing about Nick is, youre
               either looking at him, or youre
               pretending not to.
                    (beat)
               Me? Im looking.
                    (to Amy)
               Can you believe Kat gets to sleep
               with this guy?

Amy sneers. TJ turns back to Kat.

                         TJ (CONTD)
               Honestly, you should send God a
               bottle of wine or a muffin basket.

TJ clinks glasses with Kat. Kat appreciates the attention.

Amy appreciates it less. She suddenly wails.

                         AMY
               Why is he still here?!

This snaps Kat out of her reverie. She scurries into problemsolving
mode.

                         KAT
               Oh, sorry. Youre right. Girls
               only.

Kat turns and throws Nick a look. Nick, ever sensitive to
nuances, easily catches the hint and puts on his coat to go.

                         NICK
               Ladies, thank you for granting me
               this rare glimpse into a timeless
               female ritual.
                    (raising his glass)
               To the husbands who won you, the
               losers who lost you, and to the
               lucky bastards who have yet to meet
               you.

They all clink glasses. Kat beams, until...

                         AMY
                    (sour)
               And to the cock in the hen house.

Nick kisses Kat on the cheek and smoothly departs. They all
watch him walk out. TJ is still watching the door, as if
Nicks essence has lingered.

                         TJ
               I cant believe you met him first.
               Its so depressing. Somebody buy
               my wooha a drink.

Kat raises her drink to TJs nether region.

                         KAT
               To TJs lady business. And to Amy!

                         GUYS (O.S.)
               To Ed!

INT. JEFFREYS FLAT - SAME

A DOZEN MEN down their shots. Jeffrey immediately refills
their glasses with tequila. Alcohol and alpha abound. Nick
walks in the front door. He takes off his suit coat and
tries not to feel like the chaperone at a frat party.

Over by the bar, Jeffrey stands with Ed, eyeing Nick.

                         JEFFREY
               Whats his problem?

                         ED
               What?

                         JEFFREY
               Theres something about him thats
               just a bit odd.

                         ED
               Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?

                         JEFFREY
               No, thats not it.

Jeffrey pours Ed another drink.

                         JEFFREY (CONTD)
               You are a tosser.

Jeffreys suddenly emotional.

                         JEFFREY (CONTD)
               Remember when we went hiking in the
               lake district and Amy was wearing
               that little bikini thing.

                         ED
               No.

                         JEFFREY
               It was before you started going
               out. We had lunch at that inn on
               the lake.

                         ED
               Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and
               Parrot.

                         JEFFREY
               And Kat was fully clothed.

                         ED
               But, somehow, it was Kats arse
               that was stung by nettles. And you
               rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.

                         JEFFREY
               Thats when I realized I wanted to
               be a doctor.

                         ED
               Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.

                         JEFFREY
               Lasik surgeon, actually.

Jeffrey takes a thoughtful sip of beer.

                         JEFFREY (CONTD)
               I didnt deserve her back then.

                         ED
               And you do now?

Jeffrey looks genuinely pained, then something dawns on him.

                         JEFFREY
               Maybe I hate women.

Nick appears.

                         NICK
               All women or just the two-legged
               ones who steal your money, screw
               your friends, and vacuum during the
               World Cup?

Jeffrey laughs. He has no idea Nick is making fun of him.

                         ED
               Jeff was just reminiscing about
               your girlfriends backside.

Ed crosses away and Jeffrey glances nervously at Nick.

                         JEFFREY
               Look, the thing is. About that
               love-of-my-life nonsense. I would
               appreciate it if you didnt say
               anything to Kat. It was silly.
               Its all rather complicated.

Nick is about to respond when the music CRESCENDOS and a
STRIPPER strides in from the back room. Spotting Ed, Jeffrey
clothes-lines him and drags him off into a chorus of GUYH

OWLS and CHEERS.

INT. WOODYS WATERING HOLE - LATER

The bachelorette-party girls CHEER as they down drink number
seven at bar number seven, an Australian outback-themed pub.

Things have gone way downhill -- or uphill -- depending on
how you look at it.

Kat sits at the bar. In the background, Amy dances drunkenly
with TJ. WOODY, the dorky, sexy Australian bartender,
appears behind the bar with a drink for Kat.

                         WOODY
               This ones on the house.

Kat grabs his sleeve.

                         KAT
               Im worried. Amys not good at
               drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo
               fast. Does free alcohol get you
               less drunk or more drunker?
                    (to herself)
               Is it drunker or drunker-er?

                         WOODY
               Just drunk enough.

Woody dumps out the free drink and exchanges it with a bottle
of water.

                         WOODY (CONTD)
               If you switch now, you might be
               able to stand up for the ceremony.

Kat looks at him for the first time and realizes she knows
him.

                         KAT
               Woody?

Woody just smiles.

                         WOODY
               Not yet...

                         KAT
               ...but its getting there. 

Kat clumsily lunges across the bar to hug him, knocking over
a bottle of beer, which Woody deftly catches.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               I thought you were living in San
               Francisco. Or was it Nepal?

                         WOODY
               Close. Sydney. Turns out, I
               missed the rain.

They take each other in. Her smile is bleary.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               You look so much better.

Woodys trying not to feel shy around Kat.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Is this what youre doing?
               Bartending?
                    (beat)
               Not that its not great. Its
               just, you used to have dreams and
               plans.

Woody proudly points to Kats cocktail napkin. It says,
WOODYS WATERING HOLE.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Whoa! Good for you!

Woodys weighing something. He decides to say it.

                         WOODY
               I always wondered what happened
               with us.

                         KAT
                    (taken aback)
               I havent thought about that in
               years.

Just then, Amy comes up behind Kat.

                         AMY
               Did Kat tell you she dumped you
               because of your funky breath?

                         KAT
               Did Amy tell you she keeps her
               Homecoming tiara by the bed?

To Kats annoyance, Amy laughs.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Shes drunk. -er than me. But I
               didnt really dump you, did I?

                         WOODY
               Hard.

Woody smiles, sweetly.

                         WOODY (CONTD)
               Which was understandable -- you
               were one of the hottest girls at
               the American School, but I sort of
               thought youd be nicer...at least
               tell me why...cause we were
               friends first.

Kats on the spot. Embarrassed. Amys drunk-dancing and
mumbling to herself.

                         AMY
               And we know Kat was the hottest expat
               in school because she was voted
               Best Eyes, Brightest Smile, and Most
               Likely to Age Well. No, wait. That
               was me. Never mind.

Kat cant take it.

                         KAT
               Christ, Amy.

                         AMY
               Oh, shut up and be happy. Its always
               this or that. Youre never happy, you
               frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.

                         KAT
               Drunk isnt the same thing as
               happy, Amy.

They both know theyre serious but Amy pouts and throws her
arms around Kat.

                         AMY
               Youre my half sister, but I whole
               love you.

Kats furious but she forces a smile.

                         KAT
               Why dont you get my half sister
               her seventh hole?

                         AMY
               Bacardi 151.

Woody disappears just as Amy teeters and catches herself on
the bar.

                         KAT
               Are you okay?

Amys drunkenness turns. Tears well up in her eyes.

                         AMY
               I dont think I can go through with
               this.

                         KAT
               Pub Golf?

                         AMY
               The wedding.
                    (loud whisper)
               I am so, so bad! I dont think I
               should be allowed to get married.

Kat is blindsided.

                         KAT
               What are you talking about?

Then, as quickly as she went into the darkness, Amy pops out.

She yells over to TJ.

                         AMY (CONTD)
               TJ! Virginia Slim!

TJ comes dancing up, hands Amy a cigarette and a lighter. The
crowd watches as Amy puts the cigarette in her lips, pours
the shot into TJs open mouth and lights it on fire with her
lighter. Then she leans over and LIGHTS HER CIGARETTE ON THE
FLAMES COMING OUT OF TJS MOUTH.

The bar erupts in CHEERS but Kat is left worried, troubled by
Amys confession. A beat, then she downs her shot.

EXT. EDS HOUSE - LATER

The cheers ECHO in the night as Nick helps Ed walk towards
his house. Ed navigates the pavement like its made of
water. They reach the front door.

                         NICK
                    (propping Ed up)
               Youre okay. You got it.

Ed wobbles, then stands up by himself. Nick unlocks the
door.

                         ED
               Just because some slags been paid
               for, doesnt mean youve got
               to...you know.

                         NICK
               Its been my experience that the
               people who hire a prostitute, need
               a prostitute.
                    (beat)
               You did the right thing.

Ed blinks at Nick.

                         ED
               I think I love you, mate.
                    (beat)
               How do you know so much about so
               much?

                         NICK
               Im a hooker.

Ed bursts out laughing, pats him on the back, and walks into
his house.

EXT./INT. LONDON STREET [DRIVING] - LATER

The bachelorette girls ride home in The Pub Prowler. Its
a senior citizen med-van thats been pimped out with a full
bar and an all-shag-all-the-time interior.

The girls are drunk and rowdy. Kat climbs up behind the
DRIVER and taps her on the shoulder.

                         KAT
               Can you pull over at the next seven
               ATMs?

The Driver gives Kat a dubious look, then pulls up to a bank.

ATM MONTAGE:

EXT. STREET [VARIOUS]

--Kat jumps out of The Pub Prowler and clumsily slots her ATM
card into the machine.

--Kat checks her lipstick in The mirrored security camera of
a different ATM machine then flips through a stack of credit
cards. She pulls out a different card and slips it in.

--ECU on screen: MAXIMUM WITHDRAWAL £200. Kats at another
ATM. In the Prowler, a couple of girls heckle passers-by as
Kat rifles through her cards, desperate for some un-maxed
plastic.

--The Prowler drops off a couple more girls. Kat walks back
from an ATM and gets in.

EXT. TJS HOTEL - NIGHT

Kat and Amy wave at TJ as she trips out of the Prowler and
stumbles towards her hotel. TJ waves back with a bright,
happy smile--

                         TJ
               That was awesome! How much do we
               rock?
                    (beat)
               Fore!

She whips around and throws up in a topiary. In the Prowler,
Amy and Kat wince. TJ whips back up.

                         TJ (CONTD)
               I WIN!

She waves at Kat and Amy and trots past the STOIC DOORMAN,
who holds the door open for her.

EXT. ELLIS HOUSE

Kat and Amy stand in the driveway. They watch as the Prowler
pulls away. Amy is about to head next door, when she turns
to Kat.

                         AMY
               It was a great party. Thank you.

Amy reaches out to hug Kat. Kat wasnt expecting the hug and
its awkward. Amy senses it and pulls away.

                         KAT
               Do you want to come in for a minute?
               We could talk about--

                         AMY
               When I freaked out at the pub?
                    (she hiccups)
               That was nothing, just nerves.
               Dont worry about it.

                         KAT
               But I do. I will. Youre my
               sister.

With a post-Bacardi 151 suddenness, Amys face contorts with
shame. She recoils, an angry tear running down her face.

                         AMY
               God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to
               me. I can take anything right now
               but you being nice to me.

                         KAT
                    (wildly confused)
               What? Why? What do you mean?

Amy is suddenly in terrible distress.

                         AMY
               I should get going.

                         KAT
               Are you sure youre okay?

                         AMY
               Im fine. I promise.

Kat wants to say more but Amy is already walking away. Kat
turns towards the house and just catches the light shutting
off in her upstairs room.

INT. HALL - ELLIS HOUSE

Kat shuts the front door. She leans against it for a moment
to get her balance, clear her head.

INT. KITCHEN - ELLIS HOUSE

Kat sits at the kitchen table, a glass of water in front of
her. She downs three aspirin and stares into the darkness.

INT. HALL - ELLIS HOUSE - LATER

Kat starts up the stairs. The first step CREAKS loudly.

Remembering countless school-age sneak-ins, Kat flattens her
foot against the back of each step and soundlessly walks up
the stairs.

INT. KATS ROOM - ELLIS HOUSE

Nick is asleep in Kats bed, bare-chested under a single
sheet.

The CAMERA FINDS Kat standing with her back to the door,
staring at Nick. Nick stirs, opens his eyes, and rises onto
one arm.

                         NICK
               You okay?

Kat walks to him, takes his hand.

                         KAT
                    (whispering)
               Shhhh.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - ELLIS HOUSE

Kat leads Nick down the driveway towards the BOAT TRAILER.

On it, the twenty-six-foot CABIN CRUISER with peeling paint.

Kat unbuttons the weathered cover and peels it back. She
climbs up a ladder and hoists herself into the boat. Nick
smiles at the strangeness of this, then climbs in after her.

INT. BOAT

In the cabin, Kat flicks a couple of switches and a row of
lights flicker on. She flicks another switch and a piercing
sea-horn BLARES the William Tell Overture. She scrambles
to turn it off and checks the house for activity. A dog
BARKS in the distance.

Relieved, Kat pushes a tape into an old radio. MUSIC limps
through hollow speakers.

Kat leads Nick into the cabin and onto the bed. Without
taking her eyes off him, Kat starts to slowly undress. Her
shirt drops to the floor. Then, a moment later, her skirt.

Kat breathes deeply then reaches behind her back and flicks
open her bra. We watch Kats face as she lets it fall to the
floor. Kat is indeed a woman who doesnt do naked -- this is
killing her.

On the bed, Nick doesnt say anything, just watches. Kat
wants to read something into his stare. Longing, desire,
anything. But hes utterly inscrutable. Its both unnerving
and extremely sexy.

Kat steels herself and removes her underwear. She loses her
nerve momentarily and pulls them up again. Finally, she
slips them off and tries not to laugh as she scurries onto
the bed.

Hovering lazily in the waking dream of interrupted sleep,
Nick gazes at Kat. In a trick of light, the cabin windows
glow liquid, as though the moon were reflecting off water.

Nick runs his hand across Kats waist. Shes trying to hold
back. He knows it and likes it. He takes her face in his
hands and kisses her. Its amazing. A different kind of
kiss. They pull back and look at each other.

In one swift movement, he flips Kat underneath him.

Suddenly, the space between them collapses and they attack
each other.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - ELLIS HOUSE - DAWN

Kats house beams in the scarlet light of dawn. Two BIN-MEN
walk down the driveway toward the bins. They grab three bins
and drag them noisily past the boat parked in the driveway.

INT. BOAT

CLOSE ON Kat and Nick, asleep, their faces pressed up against
each other.

We PULL BACK to reveal Kat and Nick entwined, naked. We PULL
BACK further to reveal that theyre covered with a fleece
blanket and a pile of life vests.

Nick opens his eyes and looks at Kat, who is as calm and
content as weve seen her. Then, he realizes where he is.

Its like waking up in a strange hotel room, only weirder
because its a boat...in a driveway...in London.

Nick carefully extricates himself and begins to dress. Weve
seen this scene a thousand times before, but Nicks escape is
breathtakingly precise and practiced.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - ELLIS HOUSE

Nick climbs down the ladder of the boat just as the Bin-Men
are returning the empty bins beside the garage. Nick gives
them a nod.

                         NICK
               Morning.

The guys nod back and finish their job as Nick sneaks toward
the house.

INT. KITCHEN - ELLIS HOUSE

Victor and Bunny sit at the kitchen table. Victors buried
in the International Herald Tribune crossword puzzle. Bunny
looks out the window and sees Nick creeping towards the
house, shoes in hand.

                         BUNNY
               She still thinks we dont know
               about the boat thing.

Victor looks up from his paper. He sees Nick, snorts, and
goes back to his crossword.

INT. BOAT - LATER

Kats eyes flutter open. Her hair is plastered into an
impromptu quasi-beehive. She looks down at her pillow.

Its a buoy.

Kat suddenly sits bolt upright. She grabs a life vest to
cover her naked chest and looks around in horror. Then her
eyes widen as she remembers the rest of the night.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - ELLIS HOUSE

Kat slinks towards the house, retreading Nicks walk of
shame.

INT. KITCHEN - ELLIS HOUSE

Victor looks up from his paper and sees Kat.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - ELLIS HOUSE

Kats almost to the house when she hears a loud, POUNDING.

She looks up to see HER FATHER tapping on the window and
laughing at her. Kats mortified, but cant help smiling.

She waves and keeps walking.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. KATS ROOM

Kat looks around frantically for something. She finds her
purse and checks to see if the ATM money is still there. It
is. She breathes a sigh of relief, then, hearing footsteps,
hastily stuffs the wad back in.

Nick opens the door, carrying a breakfast-in-bed tray. Kat
spins around, guiltily.

                         NICK
               I wasnt sure what works for you,
               so Ive got a pack of Saltines, a
               bottle of Pedialyte -- preferred by
               infants and rock stars -- an eggand-
               cheese sandwich, a black
               coffee, and a Bloody Mary.

Kat slumps onto the bed. She hasnt gotten her land legs
back yet.

                         KAT
               This is really sweet of you, but I
               need to ask you something.
                    (desperately)
               What happened last night?

Nick is taken aback. He sets down the tray. Hes not sure
what to say, then makes a decision.

                         NICK
               Nothing.

Kat looks surprised, then skeptical.

                         KAT
               Are you sure?

                         NICK
               We kissed. Made out a little.
               Then you passed out.

She stares at him long and hard.

                         KAT
               Whether its true or not, thank
               you.

Kat disappears and Nick bites into a Saltine as the shower
HISSES on. Then something catches his eye. Its Kats purse
lying next to the bed. Stuffed on top,

A WAD OF MONEY. His brow furrows, Nick picks it up and leafs
through the stack of pounds and euros.

INT. KATS BATHROOM

In the shower, Kat lets the scorching water punish and purify
her.

                         NICK (O.S.)
               Whats this?

Startled, Kat peeks her head out of the shower curtain and
sees Nick holding the pile of money.

                         KAT
               Oh. Shoot. I--

She retreats into the shower, yanking the curtain closed.

                         KAT (CONTD)
                    (mouthing words)
               Shit! Shit! Shit!

Nick pulls open the curtain and Kat instantly stops her
pantomimed self-flagellation.

                         NICK
               Is this for last night?

                         KAT
               Of course not. How...how could it
               be? Nothing happened.

                         NICK
               If I was going to charge you, I
               would have told you beforehand. I
               thought I explained that.

Naked in front of Nick, Kat is trying not to flinch.

                         KAT
               I didnt want you to think I was
               expecting anything to be free or
               that I was expecting something at
               all. Well, clearly I was expecting
               something or I wouldnt have
               stopped at all those ATMs on the
               way home.
                    (beat)
               By the way, would it have been
               enough? I mean, if something had
               happened. Which it didnt?

Kat wants to slip down the drainpipe. Nick looks at her,
considers his words carefully.

                         NICK
               Dont they have a limit at those
               machines?

                         KAT
                    (quietly)
               Not if you take an advance on your
               credit card.

Now Nick has to really try to stifle a laugh. Nick puts the
money on the sink. He goes to leave, then turns back.

                         NICK
               Youre three hundred short.

With that, he walks out. In the shower, Kat gently bangs her
head against the tile. She looks down and notices something.

                         KAT
               And my Brazilian wax looks like...
               Brazil.
                    (resting against the tile)
               Awesome.

INT. KITCHEN - ELLIS HOUSE

Nick and Victor are eating breakfast, the newspaper spread
out between them. Victors still working on the crossword
puzzle.

                         VICTOR
               Whats a four letter word for
               daughter defiler?
                    (beat, writing it in)
               Oh. N-I-C-K.

Before Nick can react--

                         VICTOR (CONTD)
               You a boating man, son?

Victors expression is inscrutable. Nick weighs his options
and then--

                         NICK
               I am now, sir.

                         VICTOR
                    (laughing)
               At least somebodys using the damn
               thing.
                    (beat)
               I was gonna fix her up but we took
               one trip and the kids fought so
               much, we never launched her again.

Just then, Kat walks in with an air of feigned nonchalance.

                         KAT
               Thats not true. We checked for
               leaks a few years back.
                    (kisses her father)
               Good morning.

                         VICTOR
               Ahoy!

Kat throws him a look. He chuckles. As Nick gets up to get
himself some orange juice, Kat corners him behind the
refrigerator door.

                         KAT
                    (hushed)
               So youre telling me. If something
               had happened last night...it would
               have cost me fourteen hundred
               dollars? Thats a down payment on
               a Ford Focus!

                         NICK
               Not dollars. Pounds.

Nick pours a glass of juice and offers it to Kat. Kat shakes
her head.

                         NICK
               My rate isnt arbitrary. It was
               determined by prevailing market
               conditions. By the way, it
               includes oral. Thats the extra
               three hundred.... Pounds.

He smiles and sips his juice. She is outraged by his
presumption--

                         KAT
               And what if I didnt want you
               to...to do that to me?

                         NICK
               No, no. The three hundred is for
               you doing it to me.

                         KAT
               What?

                         NICK
               Believe me, if anything had
               happened, that would have been one
               of the highlights. For you.

                         KAT
               But nothing did.

                         NICK
               Yup. Thats why you get to keep
               your money.

Nick walks away. Sits down next to Victor. Kat glares
daggers at him. Nick smiles and toasts her with his juice.

Just then, Amy enters in a flurry of cheerfulness, as if last
night never happened. Bunny follows, carrying a clipboard.

                         AMY
               Hey, Ginger! Hey, Gilligan! How
               much do I love all this? Im going
               to get divorced and remarried over
               and over again so itll last
               forever. Kat, be a sweetie, and go
               help with the rings. No way
               Jeffreys going to get it right.

Amy breezes out.

                         KAT
                    (to no one)
               Id be happy to. Youre welcome.

                         BUNNY
               Oh, dont be that way.

                         VICTOR
                    (sticking up for Kat)
               Come on, Bun. Leave her alone.

                         BUNNY
                    (to Kat)
               Its not always about you, sweetie.

Kats stung. Nick watches out of the corner of his eye.

                         KAT
               How could you say that? Of course
               its not about me. Its never
               about me when shes in the room
               because you two are on a special
               team. You might as well have Tshirts
               made up.

Kat lowers her voice.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Im sorry. I dont know why Im
               being so sensitive. I just get
               tired of being odd man out.

Bunny looks over at Victor.

                         BUNNY
               Tell me about it.

Bunny squeezes Kats cheek and kisses her.

                         BUNNY (CONTD)
               Oh honey, its not that I love Amy
               more. Its that she lets me love
               her.

This flip comment hits Kat hard.

                         BUNNY (CONTD)
                    (obliviously)
               Im off. Ta-ta!

As Bunny walks out, Victor raises an eyebrow, then goes back
to his crossword. Kat stands a moment, feeling awkward.

                         KAT
                    (to Nick)
               Okay, then. Ill catch up with you
               at the dance thing.... Sweetie.

Nick gives Kat a casual nod. She exits. Behind the BUSINESS
section, Nicks face is a mask. Then he smiles. This girl
is nuts.

A door BUZZES.

INT. JEWELRY STORE - ST. JOHNS WOOD

Kat enters and approaches SAL, 60, a tough-talking, Cockney
teddy bear.

                         KAT
               Hey, Sal.

                         SAL
               I heard you were back in town,
               kitty cat. Youre here for the
               highland flings, I bet.

                         KAT
               I get all the glamour jobs.

He smiles and heads into the back. Kat casually looks into
the counter. Her face is blank as she scans row after row of
engagement rings.

Sal reemerges with two ring boxes. Kat takes the rings and
smiles.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Thanks, Sally.

She turns to go.

                         SAL
               The one I made for you is the
               cherries. You hang onto it or give
               it back?

                         KAT
               Give it back? Are you nuts?

                         SAL
               You pawned it.

                         KAT
               Not exactly. I wear it.
                    (defiantly)
               On my right hand. And only rarely.

Just then, the door BUZZES. Kat turns. Its Jeffrey,
tugging on the handle. Sal scowls.

                         SAL
               You want I nut him in the boat?

                         KAT
               Yes? No. What?
                    (beat)
               Save the patter for the tourists.

                         SAL
               You want me to let him in?

                         KAT
               Of course, dont be silly.

Sal BUZZES Jeffrey in and gives him the dirty eye before he
disappears into the back.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Hey, you!

                         JEFFREY
               Let me guess. Amy presumed Id
               forget the rings.
                    (off her look)
               I think Im her least favorite
               person.
                    (beat)
               You know, I am sorry.

                         KAT
                    (warming)
               Maybe not her least... Theres
               always--

                         KAT/JEFFREY
               Eds mother.

They share a moment.

                         KAT
               So, tell me, hows unmarried life?

                         JEFFREY
               I have regrets.

Kat jumps down his throat, instantly abandoning her false
largesse.

                         KAT
               Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and
               me, were the past. Im not sure
               if you noticed, but Im here with
               someone else.

                         JEFFREY
               Kat, we must talk. This guy,
               theres something not quite right.

                         KAT
               Its called character. God, youre
               predictable.

                         JEFFREY
               Is that why you brought him?
               Because of me.

Kat laughs way too hard.

                         KAT
               Dont be absurd.

Kat is about to walk out the door, but she cant help
herself. She stops.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               I brought him here because hes my
               boyfriend. Because I adore him.
               Because late at night he takes me
               in his arms and....

Kat leans in and whispers something into Jeffreys ear.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Id stick around and explain what
               that means, but even if I give you
               the instruction manual, it doesnt
               mean youve got the tools to get
               the job done.

Kat tries not to do a little fuck-you jig as she walks out
the door.

EXT. STREET - ST. JOHNS WOOD

Kat strides away but Jeffrey catches up to her. She secretly
smiles at the power she is exerting over him.

                         JEFFREY
               Kat, wait. I dont want you hating
               me. Weve never had this talk.
               You know how crap I am at this.

                         KAT
               Um, news flash: I dont give a
               shit.

                         JEFFREY
               Kat, stop it. You do. You cant
               even look me in the eye. You went
               back to the States when we split
               up.

Jeffrey sees Kat flinch. He knows hes hit something. She
looks away.

                         KAT
               That was a long time ago.

                         JEFFREY
               It was. And it took your sister
               getting married to get you back
               here.

                         KAT
                    (wavering)
               So, whats your point?

                         JEFFREY
               I should have told you why I broke
               up with you. I was a coward. You
               deserve to know.

Just then Nick walks up. He puts a protective hand on Kats
back and shakes Jeffreys hand.

                         NICK
               Hey, man.

                         JEFFREY
               Sorry, can you give us a moment?

                         NICK
               No, I cant. Were late for a
               dance lesson. I guess youll have
               to finish up later.

Kat gives Nick an angry look as he pulls her away.

INT. DANCE CLUB STAIRCASE

Kat, furious, charges up the stairs--

                         NICK
               Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate
               you. Its all just words. None of
               it means anything. What matters is
               what you do. You either stay put
               or you walk away. If you look
               back, youre not walking away!

                         KAT
               Oh, cut the crap!

                         NICK
               I just hate seeing you so stuck.

                         KAT
               He was about to un-stick me!
                    (hissing)
               I paid you to help me get closure.

                         NICK
               You paid me for a lot of reasons.
               Closure wasnt one of them.

Kat is infuriated. She huffs and pushes open the door.

INT. STEP-BALL-CHANGE DANCE CLUB

Nick and Kat burst in, late. Glistening hardwood floors,
mirrored walls. Eyes closed and hands clasped, Amy and Ed
stand in a circle with SONJA, late 50s, the melodramatic
dance teacher. Kat and Nick join the circle.

                         KAT
                    (mumbling)
               Sorry.

Sonja barely tolerates the interruption, closes her eyes and
breathes in deeply.

                         SONJA
               The wedding dance is, sans doubte,
               the most important dance-moment in
               a persons life.

Ed cracks open his eyes to see if anyone else thinks this is
a crock of shit. Nick catches Eds eye. Amy darts Ed a pay
attention look.

                         SONJA (CONTD)
               A room full of friends, family,
               enemies...watching, smiling,
               betting on how long the marriage
               will last. All youll have is each
               other and whatever skills you
               acquire today.

Kats grip on Nicks hand tightens. Ed cracks open his eyes
again. This time, he looks unnerved.

                         SONJA (CONTD)
               There are people who will tell you
               that the wedding dance is symbolic of
               a couples compatibility. Of a
               rapport that cannot be faked. That
               an unskilled man on the dance floor
               is a man who lacks grace in bed.
                    (beat)
               These people are right.

Sonja claps three times.

                         SONJA (CONTD)
               Eyes open and pair off!

They all open their eyes wide.

INT. STEP-BALL-CHANGE DANCE CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

Ed and Amy dance awkwardly to a standard as Sonja gives them
instructions.

ANGLE ON KAT AND NICK, dancing sedately, if awkwardly. There
is still tension between them. Kat, contrite, dares a glance
into his eyes.

                         KAT
               Im sorry I was such a bitch. I
               really appreciate your doing this.

                         NICK
                    (simply)
               Its my job.

Kat gazes deep into his eyes. A long look. The longest
shes been able to sustain since the boat. She cant read
him.

                         SONJA (O.S.)
                    (to Amy and Ed)
               She knows you better than anyone.
               You know her better than she knows
               herself. Where does that feeling
               live? I don't care if it's your
               heart, your head, or your crotch.
               Find that place and dance from it.

                         KAT
               You know what pisses me off? Ive
               been spilling my guts all weekend
               but I dont know anything about
               you. Not one thing.

Nick looks down at her, considering.

                         NICK
               Im allergic to fabric softener, I
               majored in Comparative Literature
               at Brown, and I think Id miss you
               even if we had never met.

Kat blinks, the power of his words hitting her hard. They
dance a moment in silence.

                         KAT
               Now will you tell me how you became
               an escort?

Nick smiles enigmatically. Then without warning--

NICK SPINS KAT AROUND, THEN REELS HER IN TIGHT.

In a hyper-romantic cinematic flourish,

THE FLOOR SWELLS AND THE WALLS DISAPPEAR.

The music sharpens as if its no longer coming from an old
record player but from a classic MGM soundtrack.

Nick and Kat are weightless as they glide across the floor.

Their eyes stay locked on each other as though it were this
connection, and not gravity, that keeps them on earth.

Kat and Nick seem to slow down but the world stays at normal
speed.

ON SONJA, astonished. She stops and watches.

ON AMY AND ED, as they notice whats going on. They stop
dancing and stare, too, slacked-jawed, as Nick and Kat float
past, completely wrapped up in each other.

Nick and Kat are incredible together.

The music CRESCENDOS as Nick gracefully spins Kat to a
perfect stop.

                         ED
               So you cant dance, eh? Bloody
               liar.

Nick and Kat crash back to earth. They stop dancing. The
walls close in and the music sucks back into the speakers.

                         ED (CONTD)
               I thought you said you were crap.

                         NICK
               I had to say something to get you
               here.

                         ED
               Fair enough, but Im stepping on
               toes here and youre waltzing
               around like...

                         AMY
               Fred Astaire and whats her face!

                         NICK
               Its not me. I swear. Its her.
               Shes magic.

Kat blushes. Sonja claps her hands, happily.

                         SONJA
               And, switch partners!

EXT. STEP-BALL-CHANGE DANCE CLUB - LATER

Nick, Kat, Amy, and Ed walk out of the studio. Ed skips down
the steps and onto the street. Then he realizes what hes
doing and abruptly stops.

                         ED
               Youd better get going. My parents
               will be round to cart you off to
               the country.

                         AMY
               Whatever you do, dont mention
               Italy. Or politics. Or baby
               buggies.
                    (beat)
               Or Edith Piaf.

                         ED
               Your probably best off pretending
               youre asleep.

Ed grabs Amy by the neck and pulls her away.

Amy laughs but Kat catches a look on her sisters face. Its
not quite nervousness. Its something closer to panic. Amy
waves over her shoulder as they walk away.

                                                      CUT TO:

A BOAT SAILING ACROSS FRAME, WIDER TO REVEAL--

EXT. KATS HOUSE - ST. JOHNS WOOD

Victor tows the boat with an annoyed Bunny in the passenger
seat. As they pull out of the driveway, they wave to Nick,
who sits on a stone wall in front of the house.

Nick talks on his cell phone, Kats bags piled high next to
him, as Pigeons walk and flap around him.

Kat appears carrying two bottles of water. When Nick sees
Kat, he hangs up too quickly. Kat pretends not to notice.

She eyes the pigeons suspiciously.

                         KAT
               Pigeons creep me out. Theyre like
               dirty doves...plotting something.

Nick playfully pulls Kat down next to him. Spooked by the
increasing number of pigeons, Kat inches away from them and
closer to Nick. Kat frowns, suddenly pensive.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               How do you have real relationships?
               You know, ones you dont get paid
               for?

Nick isnt sure he wants to get into this.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               You have had girlfriends?

                         NICK
               Sure, but its never easy. They
               say theyre okay with it, and they
               are...for a while. Then one day,
               theyre not.

They sit in silence. Its not awkward, its nice. London
beams under a rare cloudless sky.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               When I said Id never done a
               wedding before, I didnt say that
               no one ever asked. I just never
               said yes.

                         KAT
               So, whyd you say yes to me?

                         NICK
               There was something in your voice
               on the phone that day.

                         KAT
               Desperation?

Nick doesnt acknowledge her joke. Kat sneaks a look at him.

                         NICK
               I think it was hope.

Kat hides a smile as her leg touches his. They are both
keenly aware of the contact.

                         KAT
               What would you do if you weren't an
               escort?

                         NICK
               Make out with you for free.

Nick puts his arm around her. Kat laughs.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               What would you do if you stopped
               worrying about what other people
               think?

                         KAT
               Spontaneously combust?

They sit in silence a moment. Just then, Eds parents drive
up in a beautiful old Bentley. Eds mother reaches over her
embarrassed husband and HOOTS the horn.

INT/EXT. BENTLEY [DRIVING]- LATER

George drives through the lush countryside while Lydia
carries on. In the back seat, Kat drops her head on Nicks
shoulder; theyve clearly been enduring this awhile.

KAT, NICK, AND EDS PARENTS -- SCENE FORTHCOMING.

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE

Nick, Kat, and Eds parents unload the Bentley and carry
their bags up the steps of a stately stone mansion.

EXT. BOATHOUSE - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - LATER

A small boathouse sits at the edge of a charming lake that
borders the main property. Nearby, Jack Ship struggles to
say afloat as PASTY KIDS sun themselves on the moored junker.

Ed mans an elaborate grill as GUESTS in summer hats mill
about.

AT A PICNIC TABLE, Victor plays poker with Nick, Kat, and TJ.

From the pile of money in front of him, its clear Victors
kicking ass. Victor throws in ten pounds.

                         TJ
                    (shrewd poker voice)
               You know, I might just call you...
               but if I did...I would lose...
               because my hand blows.

She throws down her cards. Kat studies her hand and tosses
in a bill.

                         KAT
               Call.

All eyes are on Nick.

                         VICTOR
               Lets see what kind of a man my
               daughters found for herself.

Nick looks down at his money. Ten pounds. He reaches into
his pocket and pulls out a HUGE WAD OF CASH. Everyone is in
shock but he doesnt notice. He strips off a hundred, tosses
it in the pot, and takes back sixty.

                         NICK
               Raise you thirty.

Victor raises an eyebrow.

ON TJ, looking at Nick. She leans over to Kat and whispers--

                         TJ
                    (re: Nicks penis)
               Can I see it? Just for a sec?

Kat laughs and hits TJ.

                         TJ (CONTD)
               Come on, its so not fair. At
               least describe it to me.

Just then, Nick's cell phone RINGS. Victor plucks the phone
out of Nick's hand. Kat darts a worried look at Nick and
reaches for the phone.

                         KAT
               Daddy!

Victor wont give it up. He answers.

                         VICTOR
                    (into phone)
               Im sorry, Nick's about to win a
               pile of my money. He's gonna have
               to call you back.

Kat and Nick are frozen as Victor listens.

                         VICTOR (CONTD)
               Thank you for your understanding,
               maam. And good luck putting out
               that fire.

He hangs up the cell phone and looks quizzically at Nick.

                         VICTOR (CONTD)
               What is it you do again?

                         NICK
               What would you say if I told you I
               was a member of an elite task force
               employed to safeguard our nations
               most precious resource: your
               daughter.

Victor snorts.

                         VICTOR
               Oh, yeah, shrink. Call.

Kat hides her relief. Victor throws in the cash.

                         VICTOR (CONTD)
               Let me save you some trouble. My
               old man hit the bottle like it was
               his job and he had a mean streak as
               wide as the English Channel. So,
               me? I drink in moderation and have
               never raised my voice around a kid.

Kat throws in thirty pounds. Victor lays down a PAIR OF ACES
AND TWOS.

                         VICTOR (CONTD)
               What do you say to that?

                         NICK
               I say that feeling compelled to do
               the opposite of your parents is as
               enslaving as emulating them.

Nick lays down his hand. THREE KINGS. Victor shakes his
head. Nick glances at Kat. She twinkles at him, then lays
down a LOW STRAIGHT.

                         VICTOR
               Thats my girl!

She does a little dance as she swipes the pile of money
toward her. Nick cant believe it.

                         VICTOR (CONTD)
               Best thing about being a dad is
               when your kid starts kicking your
               ass--

                         NICK
               --and The ass of The man who adores
               her.

Nick rises from the table, but his comment lingers. Kat
searches his face, wondering if he was serious. He holds her
gaze a moment, then begins picking up the cards.

Ed appears holding a plate piled high with bangers.

                         ED
               Anybody seen my future-wife?
                    (re: sausages)
               Shell kill me if I dont serve her
               first.

                         KAT
               Have you guys ever had a real,
               honest-to-God fight?

Ed thinks about that.

                         ED
                    (lying)
               Of course.

                         KAT
               Yeah, right.

                         ED
               I hear that make-up sex is the best
               kind. Unfortunately, Ill never
               know.

Victor calls out to Nick--

                         VICTOR
               Hey, Sigmund, you think you could
               rustle up the bride and tell her to
               join the party?

                         NICK
               Will do.

Nick smiles at Kat and heads toward the boathouse. Kat
watches with a hint of apprehension.

FOLLOW NICK, walking across a carpet of pine needles. He
passes through a latticework of shadows and steps into the
boathouse--

INT. BOATHOUSE - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - SAME

NICKS POV: Amy and Jeffrey, their backs turned, are in the
middle of an argument.

                         AMY
                    (pulling her arm away)
               I said no! Im getting married
               tomorrow! What do you want from
               me?

Amy turns and sees Nick. Her face falls. Jeffrey sees him,
too, and blanches, then badly covers--

                         JEFFREY
               Right, then. Ill get you a
               Tofurky Burger instead.

Jeffrey walks out stiffly and Amy, mortified, turns and
stares blankly out the window.

                         NICK
               Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent
               me.

                         AMY
               What for?

                         NICK
               To make sure youre okay.

Amy turns around and looks at the tiny boathouse. Although
it had looked perfect to us before, under her gaze, we see
all the cracks and dirt.

                         AMY
               You know all that if these walls
               could talk stuff? Do you believe
               it? That a place has a memory?

                         NICK
               Actually, I do.

Amys expression clouds as her eyes fall on the bedroom door.

Through the open door, Nick can see a small bed surrounded by
bookshelves.

                         AMY
               This place has been in Eds family
               forever. We used to spend weekends
               out here every summer.
                    (with a sigh)
               God, I hope it doesnt remember
               everything.

LAUGHTER floats in from outside, an ironic soundtrack to
Amys desperation.

Nick pushes out the chair across from him. Amy looks at him
a moment, then sits down.

EXT. LAKE

Kat is standing with her mother, absentmindedly looking for
Nick, when Jeffrey approaches.

                         JEFFREY
               May I have a word? Itll be just a
               minute.

                         BUNNY
               Let me think. You stole seven
               years of her life with your charm
               and your bullshit and now you want
               a couple more minutes? Sure. Go
               right ahead.

As Jeffrey walks away, Kat whispers to her mother.

                         KAT
               Thanks for the solidarity, but next
               time? A little less information.

Kat follows Jeffrey toward the lake.

INT. BOATHOUSE - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE

Amy is now sitting across from Nick at the kitchen table.

Nick is shell-shocked.

                         NICK
               Does Kat know?

Amy doesnt even bother shaking her head.

                         AMY
               It was such a long time ago.

                         NICK
               Still--

                         AMY
               If Ed ever found out....

                         NICK
               Or Kat....

                         AMY
               And she wonders why I swim to the
               bottom of a Lemondrop every time I
               see her.

Nick pushes back from the table. Hes at a loss for words.

EXT. LAKE

Jeffrey speaks to Kat with disarming sincerity. Kat tries to
keep her guard up, but despite herself, shes listening.

                         JEFFREY
               You were so good to me. I swear I
               never meant to hurt you. We were
               together what, five years?

                         KAT
               Seven if you count the on-and-off
               years. Which I do.

                         JEFFREY
               Right. Seven.
                    (realizing)
               Christ, thats a long time, isnt
               it?

                         KAT
               Not for a dog.

                         JEFFREY
               Well, we had a lot of good years,
               but then...

Jeffrey fumbles.

                         KAT
               Is this supposed to be an apology?

                         JEFFREY
               Its not supposed to be anything,
               Kat. Its just my rather feeble
               attempt to.... Oh, I dont know.
                    (beat)
               You see, I thought I could deny my
               feelings--

Something catches Kats eye: Nick exiting the boathouse.

Even from this distance, she knows that something is wrong.

                         JEFFREY (CONTD)
               Youre not even listening.

                         KAT
               When we were together I was too
               here, now Im not here enough.

FOLLOW KAT, as she walks away from Jeffrey through a stand of
trees and meets Nick.

In the background, Jeffrey watches, confused, then walks
away. Kat reaches out and touches Nicks arm, tentatively.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Are you okay?

Kats tenderness finds its way into Nick. It takes him a
moment to recover.

                         NICK
               Yeah. You?

                         KAT
               Yeah.

They look at each other a moment.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Lets go.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Nick and Kat walk back to the main house. Side by side, they
cut through a picturesque glen. Nick shoots Kat an anxious
glance, deciding whether to reveal what he knows.

Kat catches him and smiles back, sweetly. Nick takes her
hand and kisses it, surprising her. His eyes turn back
toward the house but he doesnt let go of her hand.

INT. BATHROOM - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - NIGHT

Kat is getting ready. She's up on her tiptoes, doing her
make-up in the mirror. The radio is blaring Air Supply. Kat
sings along, passionately, embarrassingly.

Kat was clearly lying about not liking the cheesy greatest
hits. She knows every word. Somehow, she seems different,
freer. She's singing like she means it.

EXT. BALCONY - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE

Nick and Victor, sipping cocktails, stand on a back balcony
overlooking the party preparations. In the backyard below,
Bunny zips around, hissing orders at the STAFF.

                         BUNNY
               You, with the hair and all the
               bright ideas. Paper lantern plus
               open flame equals no-no.

                         VICTOR
               That woman is insane. God damn if
               I dont love her.

Nick wants to come clean but cant find the courage. He
chooses his words carefully.

                         NICK
               Kat does this thing. She stands on
               her tiptoes when shes looking in
               the mirror. You ever notice that?

Victor smiles, he knows what Nicks talking about.

                         VICTOR
               I remember the day I met Kat. It
               was in New York. Id been dating
               Bunny for a few months, and she
               finally trusted me enough to
               introduce me to her kid. So Im
               over at her place and in walks this
               little monster that wont stop
               talking.
                    (remembering)
               She hands me a walkie-talkie made
               out of an orange juice can and
               drags me over to her fort. The
               fort was this lop-sided mess of
               blankets and the walkie-talkie
               almost took my ear off, but she was
               having the time of her life.
                    (shaking his head)
               That was it. I was a goner.

A wave of nostalgia passes over him.

                         VICTOR (CONTD)
               That was the day I became a dad. And
               from that moment on, I just knew.
               Id give that little girl everything
               she ever needed, Id love her
               unconditionally, and I wouldnt let
               her out of the house until she was
               thirty.

Nick laughs.

                         VICTOR (CONTD)
               You think its going to get easier
               when they get older. That youre
               going to worry about them less. Or
               trust the world more. But thats
               just not how it goes.

They stand in silence a moment.

                         NICK
               Im not sure if this is going to
               make sense to you, Sir, but Id
               like to ask permission to date your
               daughter.

Victor gives Nick an intense but unreadable look.

                         VICTOR (CONTD)
               The ladies are fond of you, Nick.
               I can see that. I also see that
               whatever else you are, youre a
               helluva good guy.
                    (beat)
               She paid a real price dating
               Jeffrey. This will be different,
               wont it?

Nicks not sure what Victor knows. He wants to assure him,
to make promises. Instead, he says nothing. Victor and Nick
look at each other, a silent understanding between them.

EXT. GARDEN - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - LATER

The rehearsal dinner is underway. Strung with paper
lanterns, the yard looks enchanted. The usual suspects are
packed around a candle-lit table, absorbed in lively
conversation. Jeffrey, brooding, doesnt engage, just drinks
heavily.

At the center of it all, Nick is quietly relishing being a
part of this family dinner. Kat and Nick make eye contact.

Theyve finally caught up with the couple they were
pretending to be at the beginning of the weekend.

Bunnys voice cuts through the din like a knife--

                         BUNNY
               I blame Tony Pee-Pants!

                         KAT
               Oh, no.
                    (to Nick)
               She tells this story at every major
               holiday.

                         BUNNY
               Why should this be any different?
                    (taking Nicks arm)
               Besides, I have to initiate Nick
               into the family.

                    (to Nick)

I blame Tony for why my two girls
cant seem to get along.

Kat and Amy moan, here we go.

                         BUNNY (CONTD)
               Oh, dont deny it. You barely
               tolerate each other.

                         TJ
               Its true. All you have in common
               is that you both secretly want to
               be me.
                    (raising her glass)
               Cheers.

                         KAT
                    (to Nick)
               She blames Tony Pee-Pants
               Pinterello for everything. The
               fall of the British Empire, the
               Cold War, the internet.

                         BUNNY
               It was just after we moved here.
               My little girls got in a fight over
               Tony Pee-Pants and they havent
               made up since.

Amy rolls her eyes, saves them all from Bunny by telling the
story herself.

                         AMY
               Apparently, Kat and I were
               inseparable.

                         BUNNY
               If Kat ate a banana, Amy threw it
               up.

                         TJ
               If Amy threw it up, Kat ate it.

Lydia is vaguely disgusted. She pulls a face. Bunny waves a
hand in front of her eyes. This story always kills her.

                         KAT
               We were eating and puking together
               in harmony until one day, Tony
               walked me home from school. He was
               my first boyfriend.
                    (pointedly)
               I was fourteen.

                         AMY
               So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring
               Kat. He wanted to play with me.

                         KAT
               You practically bribed him with
               your erector set.

                         NICK
                    (aside, to Kat)
               Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a
               an erector set?

                         KAT
               I didnt say he was worth it.

They share a private smile.

                         AMY
               Whatever. The point is, Tony ended
               up with a chair in his face.

                         BUNNY
                    (in her defense)
               It was plastic. And child-sized.
               But there were some stitches
               involved.

                         TJ
               Like fifteen.

                         KAT
               Dad made me go over and apologize
               the next day.

                         BUNNY
               Im an American and in America,
               people sue. So to prevent a
               lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I
               dont bake.

                         KAT
               So Dad rang the bell and when Tony
               Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw
               the tart at him and popped his
               stitches.

Victor laughs, remembering. Bunny hits him on the arm.

                         VICTOR
               Sorry.

He chuckles again.

                         VICTOR (CONTD)
               You should have seen his face--
                    (he makes a surprised
                    face)
               Then, boom. Right in the kisser.

                         BUNNY
                    (shaking her head)
               What happened to my little angels?

Amy and Kat both ignore their mother, whos misting up.

                         NICK
               And thats when he peed in his
               pants? After the tart?

                         KAT
               He bled a bunch, but no, there was
               no peeing.

                         NICK
               So whats with the nickname?

They all think about that.

                         BUNNY
               I have absolutely no idea.

Everyone laughs.

EXT. GARDEN - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - LATER

Many of the guests have gone. Empty bottles of wine litter
the table. Only the immediate family, TJ, Nick and Jeffrey
remain. Jeffreys still drinking heavily and Kats not at
the table.

INT. WINE CELLAR - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE

Kat pulls a bottle of wine off the top shelf just as someone
comes up behind her. Kat feels a hand on her back, spins
around and drops the bottle. Jeffrey reaches out and grabs
it before it drops. She looks at his somber face, takes the
bottle, and sets it back on the shelf.

                         KAT
               Okay, lets do this. Whats the
               big confession?

EXT. GARDEN - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - SAME

Nick looks for Kat. Concern crosses his face as he notices
that Jeffreys gone, too. Nick picks up a couple of empty
wine bottles off the table.

INT. KITCHEN - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

Nick drops the bottles into a recycling bin then looks over
at the basement door.

INT. WINE CELLAR - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - SAME

Nick stands at the top of the cellar stairs. Hes
eavesdropping, partially concealed by the half-open door.

                         JEFFREY (O.S.)
               Well, in a way, you were right.
               The prob was, you were in love. I
               wanted to be. But I wasnt.

INTERCUT WITH JEFFREY AND KAT:

                         JEFFREY (CONTD)
               If Id have confessed, you would
               have forgiven me. But the truth
               is, I didnt want to be forgiven.
               I sort of just needed it to end.

Kat processes Jeffreys words, tries to be open.

                         JEFFREY (CONTD)
               Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea
               this would be so difficult.

                         KAT
               Relax. Take a breath and just say
               it. Its no big deal. I promise.

                         JEFFREY
               Brilliant.

                         KAT
               Well, it was a big deal. As late
               as...yesterday. Or this morning.
                    (beat)
               But not anymore.

Nick smiles.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               And you were right -- it is why I
               brought Nick with me...because I
               wanted to drive you insane. To
               torture you slowly, for the entire
               weekend. But then something
               happened. I started to fall for
               him. And now, and I hope this
               doesnt hurt your feelings, now Im
               sick of you and me, of our story.

Nick, almost giddy with happiness, moves away from the door,
then back towards it again. Finally, he closes it quietly
and leaves.

Downstairs, Kat takes Jeffreys hand.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Its the past. Its nothing but
               ghosts. So just get it off your
               chest, then lets go back upstairs
               and eat some tiramisu.

                         JEFFREY
               I slept with your sister.

Silence.

                         KAT
               Im sorry?

                         JEFFREY
               I shagged Amy. Two years ago.
               Thats why I ended it. And then,
               after you left, sod it, we kept at
               it like rabbits until we both
               realized it was absolutely mad.
               And, you know, morally wrong. Then
               there was that one other time. And
               that was it.

Kat stares at him, blood pounding in her ears.

                         JEFFREY (CONTD)
               Last Christmas when Ed proposed, I
               realized...Im in love with her. I
               cant lose her.

She feels like shes trapped in a horror movie. Shes got to
get out of here. In a daze, she turns around and heads
toward the stairs.

                         JEFFREY (CONTD)
               What? Good lord, say something.

You said I should tell you the
truth.

Kat stops dead, her jaw stiffens. When she turns and looks
at him, her face is filled with loathing.

                         KAT
               I wasted two years grieving this?

Kat laughs. It is so close to tears, that the sound catches
in her throat. She shakes her head, wearily, and
mechanically walks up the stairs.

EXT. GARDEN - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE

Kat emerges like a sleepwalker. She looks for Nick, doesnt
find him anywhere. She drifts toward the table. Jeffrey
appears in the doorway behind her.

TJ is the first to look up. She sees Kats face, sees
Jeffrey, and knows what happened. TJ goes to Kat.

                         TJ
               Oh, no. He told you.

                         KAT
               You knew?

                         TJ
               Im so sorry.

Kat shakes her head and looks past TJ to Amy. Amy meets her
sisters gaze and instantly gets it. Desperate to keep this
from Ed, she heads Kat off.

                         AMY
               Please dont say anything.

Kat looks at Amy like theyve never met. Amys eyes are
wild, silently pleading.

                         AMY (CONTD)
               Please.

Kat has never felt more alone. She looks everywhere for
Nick.

He finally emerges from the house and comes to Kats rescue,
folding her in his arms. Kat holds onto him for dear life.

Then--

                         AMY
                    (to Nick)
               I cant believe you told her!

Kat pulls away from Nick, confused. As she stumbles
backwards, all she sees is Nicks face. All she hears is
Amys voice, miles away.

                         AMY (O.S.)
               You said your job was discretion.
               You couldnt wait until you got
               back to New York?

Bunny and Victor watch, confused, as Kat runs out. Nick runs
after her as Ed approaches Jeffrey.

                         ED
               Whats going on?

Jeffrey looks straight at his best friend.

                         JEFFREY
               Nothing.

                         ED
                    (skeptical)
               Doesnt look like nothing.

Jeffrey puts his arm around Ed.

                         JEFFREY
               Now is not the time to catch on.
                    (re: Eds empty glass)
               It is, however, time for another
               round.

EXT. FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE

Kat staggers down the moonlit lane. Shes barely staving off
a breakdown. Nick runs up behind her.

                         NICK
               Kat!

Kat charges forward, blindly, as Nick follows.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Come on! Dont be--

Kats anger swells, she spins around.

                         KAT
               What?! I cant believe I trusted
               you! How could you not tell me!?

Nick sees the pain in Kats face. Its pain for Jeffrey, for
the past.

                         NICK
                    (angrily)
               Jesus, Kat. What did you want me
               to say? That your sister slept
               with your fiancé? That everybody
               knew and no one respected you
               enough to tell you?

Nick is not used to being angry. He grows uneasy, hedges--

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Besides, you hired me for my
               discretion.

                         KAT
               Youve always got that to hide
               behind, dont you? Its just
               business!

                         NICK
               Yeah! For all I know, come Monday
               morning, well go back to the real
               world and...and youll be hiring me
               for your best friend!

Kats face fills with hurt.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               I mean, come on. Did you actually
               think wed be boyfriend and
               girlfriend?

This stops Kat a moment, then--

                         KAT
               You let me make a fool of myself!
               You lied to me! I dont know why
               that surprises me because lying is
               what you do. Its your job. Its
               who you are. How would you even
               know if something were real?

                         NICK
               Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a
               good one. Youre lying to me,
               youre lying to your family, and
               youre lying to yourself. But
               youre going to stand there and
               point a finger at me? The man you
               hired to pretend to be your
               boyfriend?

Silence. Each wants the other to fight for it. But neither
does. Kat gives up.

                         KAT
               Youre right. I was so desperate
               to make everyone believe I was
               happy that I spent six grand on a
               lie. And after all that? The only
               one who ended up falling for it was
               me.

                         NICK
               Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were
               running out of steam on the whole
               Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be
               able to hold onto this just long
               enough to ruin your next
               relationship.

Nicks had enough. He turns and walks away, leaving Kat
stunned.

EXT. FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - LATER

The party is over, the house lights low. Moonlight washes
over Nick as he carries his packed suitcase to his car. Ed
comes out of the house, jogs up to Nick.

                         NICK
               Ill just check into a hotel.

                         ED
               Dont be ridiculous. Its late and
               the place is empty. Just take my
               car.

Ed hands him a set of keys.

                         ED (CONTD)
               I dont know whats going on with
               you two, but Im sure itll work
               out. You couldnt be more perfect
               for her if she picked you out of a
               catalogue.

Nick smiles, wearily.

                         NICK
               Thanks, man.

Nick tosses his bag in back and gets in the car.

INT. SITTING ROOM - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - SAME

Kat stands at the window, her eyes puffy. She watches as
Nick drives away, then she turns around.

Her mom and dad wait in the darkened living room. Kat tries
to be strong, but then she goes to her father, burying
herself in his arms. Bunny hides a pang of disappointment as
she gently touches Kats head.

INT. KATS ROOM - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - LATER

Kat straightens up her room. A KNOCK on the door and Amy
walks in.

                         AMY
               Hey.

                         KAT
               Hey.

Kat keeps cleaning up.

                         AMY
               I just wanted to say thank you.
               For not outing me in front of Ed.
               I want to tell him. Just not on
               the night before our wedding. With
               these kind of things, timing is
               everything.

Kat turns on her sister, shes smiling.

                         KAT
               Youre right. You should really
               time it right so when he hears that
               you repeatedly screwed his best
               friend, he doesnt feel like the
               world is collapsing around him and
               theres no escape because you
               tricked him into marrying you.

Amy wasnt ready for Kats intensity, she backs towards the
door.

                         AMY
               You know what? Im not having this
               conversation right now.

                         KAT
               Sure, disappear. Weve been
               walking away our whole lives.

Amy turns around and faces Kat, willing to hear anything.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Im not even going to discuss the
               fact that you screwed my fiancé
               because youve always been a
               spoiled, amoral, little princess.

Amy looks horrified but Kats not backing down.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               But I put up with all of it because
               I really believed that deep down,
               you loved me and you were a good
               person. I really thought you
               deserved someone like Ed. God I
               envied you guys. Somehow, he made
               your selfish bullshit seem okay.
               Almost endearing.

Amy looks at Kat with tears in her eyes.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               And now I know. You didnt deserve
               any of it. You were just lucky.

Kat looks at her sister, sadly.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Dont worry, Amy. Your wedding
               will be perfect. Tomorrow, Ill
               smile and say all the right things
               and youll deal with Ed when youre
               ready. But right now, tonight, I
               cant pretend its okay.

Amy, stricken, exits. As she leaves, her shoulders start to
shake. She is crying. Kats reflex is to go to her, but she
stops herself. Its too soon to forgive. She walks over and
closes the door.

INT. BOATHOUSE - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - SAME

Nick stands, alone in the darkened boathouse, speaking on his
cell phone.

                         NICK
               And thats the first flight out?

He writes something down on a piece of paper.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               All right, thank you.

He hangs up and sits down on the edge of the bed. He looks
at the floor. At nothing.

INT. KATS ROOM - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE

Kat lies in bed. She stares at the ceiling. At nothing.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. KATS ROOM - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - MORNING

Kats eyes flutter open. Shes not refreshed and she doesnt
feel better. The only thing thats changed is that its
morning. Kat looks up at the ceiling.

                         KAT (O.S.)
               Im okay.

CU ON KATS FACE, STARING INTO CAMERA. SHE SEES NOTHING.

INT. HAIR DRESSER - DAY

Kats make-up is flawless and her hair is perfect but her
eyes are clouded with pain and sleeplessness.

                         BUNNY (O.S.)
               I dont believe you.

Bunny sits next to Kat in a barbers chair.

                         KAT
               No, Im fine, really. Nothing a
               bottle of Jack and a straight razor
               cant fix.

Kats trying to be light, but her eyes are a dead giveaway.

Kat draws in a long breath, trying to summon some semblance
of joy.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Anyway, it doesnt matter. Todays
               Amys day.

She braves a glance at her mothers face. Bunnys not
buying.

EXT. CAR PARK - HAIR DRESSER

Kat stands in the car park behind the salon, furtively
sucking on a cigarette as she pulls off an old nicotine
patch. Choking, she throws down the cigarette as the salon
door opens and Bunny steps out.

                         BUNNY
               Whats going on with you two?

                         KAT
               I was pretty hard on her last
               night.
                    (welling up)
               And now shes getting married.

                         BUNNY
               Theres a reason I always tell that
               Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.

                         KAT
               Trust me. This is bigger than Tony
               Pee-Pants.

                         BUNNY
                    (pressing on)
               Before Tony, you and your sister
               were best friends. I couldnt
               split you up. If your sister ate
               the spinach, you ate the spinach.
               If you threw up--.

                         KAT
               Mom, please.

                         BUNNY (CONTD)
               Anyway, when that boy came over, it
               was the first time you ever did
               anything without her.
                    (beat)
               And Amy wasnt just jealous...she
               was sad and lonely. She missed
               you.

                         KAT
               She did?

                         BUNNY
               So she flirted with Tony, and you
               got mad and sent him away. Who did
               that leave?
                    (beat)
               You and Amy. Reunited.

Kat stands, stunned, as Bunny brushes her hand against Kats
cheek.

                         BUNNY (CONTD)
               I wish I had known it would go by
               so fast.

Kat watches, full of emotion, as Bunny leaves with tears in
her eyes.

INT. CHURCH

A series of images as Wedding preparations transform the
austere church. A carpet is unrolled down the aisle. A
bouquet is affixed to a pew. Programs are laid out.

                                                      CUT TO:

A HAND ZIPPING UP A SUITCASE.

INT. BOATHOUSE - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE

Bag in hand, Nick locks up the boathouse and sets the keys on
top of the door frame.

EXT. FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE

Limos wait outside both Kats house and the house next door.

Bunny fusses with Amys dress as they walk toward the car.

Victor and Kat follow, arm in arm.

ANGLE ON VICTOR AND KAT. Victor looks at Kat, who is trying
to be brave. Its almost working.

INT. ANNEX - CHURCH

Amy nervously fusses with her dress when Kat walks in. Kat
stops when she sees her sister, glowing in a beam of dusty
light. It takes Kats breath away.

                         KAT
               Wow. You look beautiful.

                         AMY
               Yeah. Most important day of my
               life. Whatever. Listen, I chose
               you to be my Maid of Honor for a
               lot of reasons: I love you, youre
               my favorite, and only, half-sister,
               blah blah blah. But the main
               reason I picked you is because
               youve been so miserable for the
               past few years, I knew you wouldnt
               outshine me.
                    (beat)
               But here it is, my big day. My big
               day. And something doesnt feel
               right. Maybe it was that pep talk
               you gave me last night, I dont
               know, but your misery just isnt
               working for me anymore.

Amy tries to keep up her tough attitude but when she levels
her gaze at Kat, her eyes cloud with a regret deeper than we
thought her capable of.

                         AMY (CONTD)
               It was a horrible thing I did to
               you. Im really sorry.

Amy takes her sisters hand. Then lets it drop.

                         AMY (CONTD)
               I know you hate when I get what I
               want. But right now, all I want is
               for you to be happy.

ON KAT as this sinks in.

EXT. CHURCH

Kat pushes open the heavy church doors. Organ music floods
out as Kat surreptitiously looks up and down the street.

Victor appears behind her. Kat looks at her dad and forces a
smile. Victor knows shes upset.

                         VICTOR
               So whyd you let him go?

                         KAT
               Its complicated, Dad.

                         VICTOR
                    (ironically)
               Oh, well, then. It probably wont
               work out.

Victor stops and faces her, his voice full of meaning.

                         VICTOR (CONTD)
               I read a fascinating article in the
               New Yorker once and this guy said:
               Every woman has the exact love
               life she wants. You know what? I
               agree. And I refuse to believe
               that this is what you want.

Kat is overwhelmed but Victor continues.

                         VICTOR (CONTD)
               Ever since you were a little kid,
               youve been trying to please other
               people. And in return for your
               services, all theyve done is
               disappoint you.
                    (beat)
               So tell me, is this the guy for
               you?

Kat thinks about this.

                         KAT
               Yeah.

                         VICTOR
               Then for once in your life, do
               something for yourself.

Kat looks at him gratefully and makes a silent decision.

INT. CAR [DRIVING]

Kat speeds down the road in her parents car. The empty boat
trailer clatters behind her.

INT. CHURCH

Amy watches through a crack in the door as the GUESTS take
their seats.

INT. ANNEX - CHURCH

Amy paces nervously. Ed knocks and enters, covering his eyes
so he doesnt see her dress.

                         ED
               Your mother said youd like a quick
               word.

Amy takes Eds hands away from his eyes. From the look on
her face, Ed knows something is wrong.

INT. WOODS

Kat races through the woods, trying to keep her dress from
catching on the branches that whip at her on all sides.

INT. CHURCH

The Guests are all seated now, and the organ has begun its
mood music. In the atrium just outside the church, the
entire wedding party, minus Amy and Ed, is gathered, waiting.

EXT. BOATHOUSE - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE

Kat bursts into the clearing, her hair tousled, her dress
nightmarish. She tries to catch her breath as she looks up
to the porch of the boathouse. This is supposed to be the
part where she sees Nick and they live happily ever after.

INT. BOATHOUSE - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE

Kat desperately searches the rooms of the boathouse. By the
time she gets to the kitchen, she knows its going to be
empty. She opens the door, anyway.

Nicks gone. On the kitchen table, a brown envelope. Kat
picks it up. Written on the front: KAT. She turns it over
to open it. On the back it reads: ITS ALL THERE, TRUST
ME. Kat laughs at how well Nick knows her. Her eyes fill
with love.

INT./EXT. CAR [DRIVING]

Inside the car, Nicks face is stoic as he drives, his carryon
on the seat next to him.

INT. ANNEX - CHURCH

Amy faces Ed, her eyes red and puffy.

                         AMY
               I was too scared to tell you. I
               thought youd never speak to me
               again. Im so sorry.

Ed is reeling, he just stares at Amy, saying nothing. Amys
finally doing her penance. The silence is killing her.

                         AMY (CONTD)
               Say something. Please.

                         ED
               I knew you were still seeing
               someone else when we finally got
               together. I never in a million
               years would have dreamt it was
               Jeffrey.

Ed shakes his head, trying to understand.

                         ED (CONTD)
               Does Kat know?

                         AMY
               Jeffrey told her last night.

                         ED
               Last night?

Ed winces, remembering, then lets out a growl.

                         ED (CONTD)
               That worthless bastard!

Ed staggers towards the door.

INT. CHURCH

Ed slams the door on his way out of the annex. He charges up
the aisle, past the pews full of guests.

Guests MURMUR in surprise. Ed picks up speed. He's like a
heat-seeking missile that's found its mark:

JEFFREY, stands at the back, chatting up a DUMPY BRIDESMAID.

He turns just in time to see Ed running up the aisle. TJ
spots Ed, too.

Jeffreys seen this movie before - he knows hes about to
get his ass kicked.

Jeffrey drops everything and starts running. At that moment,
TJ grabs a FLOWER GIRL and uses the little girl to trip
Jeffrey. He falls, scrambles back up and keeps running.

EXT. STREET

Kat trudges up the church steps, her head down. Just then,
the door bursts open and Jeffrey flies out of the church and
races down the street. Moments later, Ed explodes from the
church and takes off after Jeffrey.

Kat watches them run down the street, confused, then goes
inside.

INT./EXT. CAR [DRIVING]

Nicks staring straight ahead when something

STREAKS PAST HIS WINDOW.

Nick thinks hes seeing things, looks in the rear-view mirror
to investigate. Just then, ANOTHER FORM STREAKS PAST.

Nick looks out the back window and sees Ed chasing Jeffrey
down the street. Nick shakes his head, but keeps driving.

This family is not his problem anymore.

Nick wills his eyes to stay on the road, but then he cant
help it. He looks into the rear-view mirror again.

Almost despite himself, Nick throws the car into a U-turn.

He catches up and pulls alongside Ed, whos still chasing
Jeffrey.

                         NICK
               Hey.

Ed looks over at Nick, but keeps running, his tuxedo
flailing. Nick keeps pace.

                         ED
                    (winded)
               I look like a total wanker, dont
               I?

                         NICK
               Yeah, kind of.

Ed keeps running.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Only way to beat that guy is to
               take yourself out of the game.

Ed finally stops running. Wheezing, he bends over to catch
his breath. Nick pulls over.

INT. ANNEX - CHURCH

Back inside, Amy nervously awaits her fate. Kat enters. She
wants to hug Amy, but offers her a tissue instead. Amy takes
it gratefully.

INT./EXT. CAR  LATER

Nick and Ed pull up to the church. Nick turns off the car.

Neither one of them gets out.

                         ED
               You heading to the train station?

                         NICK
               I figured you could pick up your
               car tomorrow.

                         ED
               Yeah.

They sit in silence, the church looming in front of them.

                         ED (CONTD)
               I felt sorry for you last night. I
               was sitting there like some smug
               arse thinking how lucky I am.

Eds clearly struggling. Nick lets him talk.

                         ED (CONTD)
               I forgave her when I thought it was
               just some bloke. Bugger it. Why
               Jeffrey?
                    (beat)
               Ive had her up on a pedestal ever
               since...since the day I put her up
               there. Its going to take a long
               time for me to get over this.

Nick tries to find the right words of encouragement.

Finally, he takes his best shot.

                         NICK
               Think about it this way: you get
               to spend the rest of your life
               having make-up sex.

Ed thinks on this a moment. Then he turns to Nick.

                         ED
               Listen, mate, are you coming to
               this wedding or not?

EXT. CHURCH

Kat pushes open the heavy doors to take one last look. She
steps outside and the door closes, revealing--

NICK, now dressed in his tux. He smiles at her.

                         NICK
               Hi.

                         KAT
               Hi.

They take each other in.

                         NICK
               When we were fighting last night,
               it hit me. No one had ever cared
               about me as much as you cared about
               Jeffrey. Thats why I was so
               angry. Im sorry I took it out on
               you -- I didnt mean to hurt you.
                    (beat)
               And then, I was going to get out of
               here and leave you alone, but
               halfway to the station, I realized--

From inside, the WEDDING MARCH begins to play. Nick takes
her face in his hands.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Id rather fight with you than make
               love to anyone else.

Kat is speechless. Nick leans down and kisses her like hes
going to keep on kissing her forever. But then, he breaks
away.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               I should go.

                         KAT
               What?! No, no. You cant--

                         NICK
               I have to.
                    (he smiles)
               Im the best man.

INT. HALLWAY - CHURCH

Nick and Kat stand in a dark doorway, facing the closed door.

They share a secret smile in the dark.

Just then, the USHER opens the door and Nick leads Kat down
the aisle. As they walk, they exchange sidelong glances.

Both are as nervous and excited as school kids.

Behind them, Victor and Amy beam as they await their turn.

Nick leans over and whispers in her ear.

INT. CHURCH  LATER

In the background, Amy and Ed stand at the altar. They hold
hands tightly, grateful to have lost and found each other.

Nick and Kat peek across at each other. They both smile.

                         KAT (O.S.)
               Today is a day for love and for
               beauty. But most of all, it's a
               day for truth.

INT. TENT - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - AFTERNOON

Kat speaks into a microphone, trying to deliver her speech.

All around her, she sees faces: Mom, Dad, Amy, Ed, TJ. Kat
looks down at a crumpled scrap of paper.

                         KAT
               Ive been working on this speech
               since these two got engaged. It
               was supposed to be touching and
               funny.

Kat looks at Nick. He doesnt have to do anything. He just
is support.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               I thought Id come back to England
               and have an epiphany. Id see Amy
               and the perfect thing would pop
               into my head and it would
               encapsulate how and why I love my
               sister. But I came home and
               everything was a mess and the truth
               and beauty line was all I could
               come up with.
                    (beat)
               And I think I stole that from the
               back of an in-flight magazine.

The GUESTS laugh. Kat looks at her mom.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               A wonderful woman once said about
               Amy: Its not that I love her
               more, its that she lets me love
               her.

Kat raises her glass in a toast.

                         KAT (CONTD)
                    (to Ed and Amy)
               It can be the scariest thing in the
               world to let someone love you and
               to know how to love them back.
               Take good care of each other. I
               love you both.

Everyone clinks glasses. A few people sniffle or kiss their
dates. Kat and Amy hold each others gaze. Nearby, Bunny
watches her little girls with tears in her eyes.

INT. TENT - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - DUSK

The STAFF has already started packing up. Eds Father
whispers something to the BANDLEADER and pulls his wife out
on the dance floor. He spins her around as Ma Vie en Rose

begins to play. She smiles, happily, as they dance.

Ed tries to keep a very drunk Amy away from the present
table. Slouching on the piano, TJ makes out with her date,
Woody, the bartender.

The CAMERA FINDS Kat and Nick on the dance floor.

                         NICK
               Nice speech. I thought it was
               touching... and funny.

                         KAT
               Thank you.

Nick gracefully spins Kat around; they really do dance
beautifully together.

                         KAT (CONTD)
               Since Ive generously agreed to go
               out with you, I think its only
               fair that you tell me how you got
               into the business?

Kat smiles mischievously. Nick pulls her close. Hes
finally going to tell her.

                         NICK
               You know why I never tell the real
               story of how I got into this?

Kat shakes her head, "no." Nick swings her around in an
elaborate dip and kisses her on the neck.

                         NICK (CONTD)
               Because its boring.
                    (Kat laughs)
               Now if you want to hear a good
               story, let me tell you the one
               about how I got out of it.

Kat and Nick smile at each other as their dancing grows more
effortless. In the background, Ed tugs a half-opened present
out of Amys hands and puts it back on the table. She jumps
up on his back and he happily carts her off to the loo.

                                                      CUT TO:

A HAND COUNTING MONEY IN THE BROWN ENVELOPE.

EXT. BOATHOUSE - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE - SAME

A WORKER finishes counting the money, closes the envelope,
and tucks it in his pocket.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK as he walks over to TWO OTHER WORKERS,
who are scraping paint off a hoisted-up JACK SHIP.

As the first star appears in the night sky, the music swells
and we slowly make out the sounds of the greatest make-up sex
of all time, echoing in the distance.

FADE TO BLACK.
