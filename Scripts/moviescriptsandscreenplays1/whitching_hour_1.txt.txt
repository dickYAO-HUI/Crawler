						The Witching Hour 

					Screenplay by ANNE RICE



FADE IN:

EXT.  A SCOTTISH MOOR - NIGHT - 1670 A.D.

Far off, a massive stone castle looms.  Trees silhouetted an
the horizon against the star-dotted, qreen-purple sky. The branches of one tree seem to reach 
for the stars...

TRACKING IN - the 'tree' is A HOODED FIGURE: SUZANNE - 20, golden hair spilling from her hood, 
dazzling green eyes. Nestled in the folds of her cloak is DEBORAH - 5, scarlet curls, green 
eyes glowing.  She peeks up at the bizarre sky.

				DEBORAH (a thick Scottish accent)
		Mum - I'm so scared.  Look at the color...

				SUZANNE (a thick Scottish accent) 
			(entranced. soothing)
		Deborah, be still.  And listen...
			(a beat. in a chant...) 
		Wind, you are a thousand eyes - but never seen.  
		A thousand caresses - but never touched.  A 
		thousand voices - but never a word.  Always with me, 
		never .......

				DEBORAH
			(fearful)
		Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -

				SUZANNE
		Wind - I love you with that which is endless 
		within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - 
		your voice...

A WIND gathers force, The grass sways.  Leaves twirl.

				SUZANNE
		Send me your soul. Come to me NOW!

The ferocious WIND HOWLS.  Trees bend.  The sky darkens.. SUZANNE'S hood is whipped of her 
head. A dagger of LIGHTNING cuts the sky open.  Then - a sound, like a HOWL of birth.

				A VOICE
			(melodic. wondrous) 
		Suzanne, the door is open!  Call me! Bring 
		me to you with a name!

				SUZANNE
			(ecstatic. shouting above the ROAR) 
		For the wind that lashes the trees that brings 
		you to your lover... You are --- Lasher.  LASHER!!

THUNDER rocks her to the ground.  Rain pours down.

				VOICE
		I am through, my love!  I have come!
			(a beat. joyful)
		Lasher..

SUZANNE thrusts her arms out   as if to embrace the wind. DEBORAH peeks out from her mother's 
cloak.  She looks at the ground - wide-eyed - and reaches out.

ECU - DEBORAH'S CLENCHED FIST
The tiny fist opens - a NUGE EMERALD glistens in her palm.

FADE TO BLACK FADE UP TO

DAY.  ECU - THE CURVED RUNNER OF A ROCKING CHAIR

Rocking on a wooden floor.  A large horned beetle skitters INTO FRAME - antenna flicking.  
Above it, the chair's runner reaches its highest point - descends --- and just misses it.

					WOMAN'S VOICE (OC)
				(a southern accent. cool) 
			Do you see the lillies, Deedee...? Big as soup ladles.

TILT UP to a pale hand on the chair-arm. inside a faded pink sleeve - and UP to

ECU - A FACE,  SKOCKING IN ITS MELANCHOLY VISAGE
A WOMAN - 50, a gaunt, shattered beauty.  Not a flicker in her green eyes.  Her hair is stringy
- in need of a wash.

ANGLE - THE PORCH OF A LARGE GOTHIC MANSION
CARLOTTA MAYFAIR - 80, cane in hand, rocks DIEDRE MAYFAIR on the porch.  Her white hair is 
pulled back severely. Skin tight on her skull.  Green eyes keen and focused.

The house was magnificent - once:	Tall columns.Stained glass.  But it is a dying house.  
Rotted wood. Peeling paint.  You can almost hear it wheeze...

ANGLE - THE GADEN BEYOND THE PORCH
Thick.  Lush.  Huge flowers flourish.  A flagstone walk leads to a swimming pool filled with 
brackish water and lily pads.  A wrought-iron fence encircles the grounds. on the other side, 
the street seems like another world.

BACK TO CARLOTTA AND DIEDRE ON THE PORCH CARLOTTA takes a syringe from a bag and injects 
DIEDRE, who shows no reaction.  CARLOTTA feels her pulse...

					CARLOTTA
			We numb the body and the mind...but we haven't found 
			a needle yat that can prick your soul.  That belongs to him, 
			doesn't it, my beautitul Deedee...?

A BREEZE suddenly rises.  The trees and long grass stir. CARLOTTA smiles privately - and 
surveys the garden. Something there, for a moment, behind the waving branches...?

BEYOND THE WROT-IRON FENCE
A MAN - 60, white suit, fedora and an ivory walking stick - comes down the sidewalk.  He tips 
his hat to the women, and walks on.  CARLOTTA watches him go.

					CARLOTTA
				(dry. caustic) 
			Well, well, Deedee.  Both your admirers have paid a call.

CARLOTTA looks down at the huge beetle -- and crushes it with her shoe.  The BREEZE dies.  The 
trees come to rest.  But DIEDRE'S hair still flutters, as if stroked by a lovinq hand.

INT.  ECU - A PAIR OF HANDS REST ATOP AN IVORY WALKING STICK

The stick's top is carved into a pair of angel's wings. The left hand wears an ivory ring - 
with a gold T set in it.

					MAN'S VOICE  (OC)
				(an English accent. calm. sonorous)
			Diedre was silent - still - as always....

TILT UP to AARON LIGHTNER (the white-suited Man who strolled past the Mayfair mansion).

					AARON
			..but there is no question about it she is dying.

WIDE OF SCENE - A MAGNIFICENT SITTING ROOM

AARON stands at a mahogany table, where a dozen MEN and Women -	ages 25 to 60, elegantly 
dressed - sit and exchange sober locks at his pronouncement.  They all wear the same ring.

					AARON
				(taps his chest lightly) 
			Her vibrations were unmistakable.  I felt them quite clearly.  
				(sighs)  
			Strange to think after thirty years...I shall walk by the porch 
			and find the chair empty.

					WOMAN AT THE TABLE
			What of the child, Aaron...?

					AARON
			The child's life will take its inevitable turn.  (pause)  we 
			will watch and wait... and soon - our waiting will be over

INT.  CLOSE-UP - A PAIR OF WHITE DOORS
In bold letters  EMEAGENCY ONLY - KEEP CLEAR
The doors fly open - PARAMEDICS barrel through, pushing a gurney with a bleeding WOMAN.  We 
TRACK behind it A WOMAN suddenly races INTO FRAME, into the gurney's path. The gurney veers off
- but we fallow the WOMAN. 

ROWAN MAYFAIR
- 30, surgical garb and gloves, golden hair. piercing green eyes, stunning, focused.  She 
enters:

AN EMERGENCY ROOM
where two NURSES and a young DOCTOR flank a gurney that holds a BOY - 7, unconscious.  ROWAN is
pure, efficient motion - in coumand.  As she nears the Boy -

					ROWAN
			Let's have it.  Fast.

					DOCTOR
			Parents say he - uh - fell -

					ROWAN
			Anybody got a BP yet...?
				
					NURSE # 1
			Seventy over ninety.

					ROWAN
			Pupils...?

					NURSE # 1
			Unequal.

					DOCTOR
			- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -

					ROWAN
			FAST.

					DOCTOR
				(a bit rattled)
			uh - then he - be just -

					ROWAN
				(hovering over the boy. Stating a fact)
			He just went out like & light-

The DOCTCR nods meekly-  ROWAN raises the BOY'S eyelids.

					ROWAN
			Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - 
			right now.

					DOCTOR
			I'll tell OR we're bringing -

					ROWAN
			He's herniating!  Forget OR.  He's dead batore he's oft the elevator 
			Get me a trephine tray -
				(Nurses shift into motion)
			Anesthesia - stat!  We need him intubated and blow down!

An anesthesia mask goes on the BOY.  His head is shaved and iodined.  A NURSE sets a tray. 
beside ROWAN. she picks up a small drill.  All ayes settle on her. She starts to drill a hole 
in the BOY'S sku1l. Deeper.  Deeper.  And suddenly - blood spurts...

					ROWAN
			Get me a bolt...

A srnall pressure gauge is handed to her. She screws it into the BOY'S skull.  Takes a reading.

					ROWAN
			Dress it.	Get him to ICU...

As action goes on all around her, she steps back - and seems to take a breath for the first time 
since she entered.

					ROWAN
				(softly. to no one in particular) 
			He'll be okay...

INT. A HOSPITAL SCRUB ROOM. MINUTES LATER

ROWAN washes at a sink.  She looks up to her retlection in the mirror.  A strange look - hard 
to decipher. NURSE  # 1 enters, untying her bloody smock.  She grins.

					NURSE # 1
			So, doctcr - what do you see.. 
				(Rown' gives her a crocked grin)
			I see somebody spending nineteen hours a day in this hole.  
				(pause) 
			This isn't even your shift   is it...?

					ROWAN
				(drying her bands. deadpan) 
			If 'd been home, I would've missed out on using the drill.

					NURSE # 1
			Take up woodworking.

ROWAR flashes a wry grin.

					NURSE
				(warm - but serious)
			You just can't bear to lose one - can you...?  you just won't 
			1et them die.

					ROWAN'
				(stares. smiles warmly) 
			No - I guess I won't.

INT.  POV' - THROUGH AN UNFINISHED WINDOW FRAME.  NIGHT 

A view of the San Francisco skyline.  FALL BACK to REVEAL

MICHAEL CURRY
- 40, denim shirt  baggy corduroys, melancholy wisp of a smile.  Gettle eyes staring into the 
night.  A drag on his cigarette.  And he rubs the cleft of his chin with the tip of his thumb - 
a life-long unconscious habit.

He is in the top floor of a renovation.  The room is almost finished, carved moldings, 
high-angled ceiling, random-peggad floors and huge windows.  A stunning work of design.

					MAN'S VOICE
			Right on schedule, Mikey.  Finished -

					MICHAEL
				(an intentionally overdone Tony Bennett)
			'I left my heart --- in Ran Sanfriscio...'

					MAN'S VOICE (OC)
				(louder)
			- in three weeks, tops, like it or not.
					
					MICHAEL
				(grins. louder - without turning)
			'And the light's always onnnnn in Massachuaetts...'

WIDE OF SCENE
STU - 35, overalls, short, squat, dusty - stands at a table draped with blueprints - beer in 
hand. grinning.

					STU
			Ve-ry funny.  But lilk. it or not -

					MlCHAEL
				(hollerinq now)
			'There is - a house - in New Orleans -

STU'S grin widens.  He gives up and joins in:

					MICHAEL AND STU
				(screaming)
			'THEY CALLLLLLLLL THE RISING SUN....!'

They break up in laughter, out of breath.  STU joins MICHAEL at the window.  they stare out at 
the city.

					STU
			sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You 
			always do.

					MICHAEL
				(shrugs. looks round the room)
			I just - hate it when they're - finished.

STU searches MICHAEL'S fact.  His grin slowly dissolves. 

					STU
			well - Donna made dinner tonight. so I gotta go.  
				(pause)  
			Wanna come..? 
				(MICHAEL shakes his head NO)
			Gotta date...?
				(MICHAEL shakes his head NO) 
			Ever gonna have another date...?

MICHAEL eyes him with an affectionate scowl. This is old territory.  STU shrugs and gives up.

					STU
			See ya Monday then.

STU winks - and leaves.  MICHAEL turns back to the skyline - staring - and sighs. His thumb 
rubbing his cleft.

EXT. THE PACIFIC OCEAN. DAY

A sailboat drifts lazily on the flat water - its sails limp in the windless sky.  San Francisco 
looms in the BG.

ANGEL - 0N THE SAILBOAT'S DECK
ROWAN - in sweater and shorts - looks at the sky, searching for wind, and frowns.  She strips 
down to a bikini, stretches out on the deck and points her face to the sun...

EXT.  THE SAN FRANSISCO COAST - A JETTY. LATER THAT DAY

MICHAEL sits out on the rocks, sketching a house on a pad.  the WIND picks up, the surrounding 
waters turn choppy.  He draws his collar up.  A seagull lands near him.  MICHAEL starts 
sketching the gull.

					MICHAEL
			'The soaring larks lift up aloft with them the sky that to our 
			shoulders was heavy.   (grins)  YOU like Rilke...?

The bird starts preening.  A wave smacks against the rocks spraying MICHAEL.  He looks around 
at the sea and frowns. The WIND tugs at him.  Another wave sprays him.  He rises.

					MICHAEL
			Dame weatherman said -

The gull SCREECHES - and suddenly takes off  - coming right at him.  MICHAEL ducks out of the 
way, slips on the slippery surface - and falls.  His head strikes the rocks. A wave pounds the 
jetty and sweeps him into the sea.

MICHAEL
falling in the water.  Losing ccnsciousness.  Being swept out to tea.  His eyes closing.  he's 
going under -  Sinking..

BENEATH THE SEA
MICHAEL floats downward.  A stream at bubbles squirts from his mouth   then they stop.  MOVE IN 
to his peaceful face. IN TIGHTER - into his closed eyes - and through them...

POV - SPEEDING THROUGH A BLACK NIGHT SKY WITH A ZILLION STARS
A fierce ROARING.  Hair-pin ttrrns around stars - the cosmic Daytona 500.  Racing toward a huge, 
white-hot star... SMASHING through into - SILENCE.   Freefalling through the richest, thickest 
GREEN imaginable.

Then, seeping out off the GREEN, PHANTOMS -
shapeless - but the GREENESS is giving them form: SUZANNE with the emerald round her neck - and 
DEBORAH - a woman now, with the scarlet curls - and OTHERS - drifting, saturated, gleaming.  
Whispering, entreating:

					SUZANNE
			Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back

					DEBORAH
			The door, Michael.  find the key...

					SUZANNE
			Help us.  Do what you can.

ANGLE - MIHAEL. MOTIONLESS IN THE GREEN
suspended above a vast BLACKNESS.  phantoms all around him.  And MICAEL starts floating down 
toward it...

					SUZANNE
			Michael - NO!  Go Back

EXT.  ROWAN'A. SAILBOAT IN THE OCEAN

ROWAN is asleep on the deck.  The sea is choppy. A sudden gust fills the mainsail.  It swings 
across the deck.  CRACK!  ROWAN wakes and rises. delighted.

					ROWAN
			Alright!  A little speed.

she starts pulling in the mainsail - stops and squints- Something is out there, in the waves-  
She dives into the sea   bobbing up to take a look every few strokes...

Now, she's reaching out --- grabbing MICHAEL's lifeless body. Her arm slings round him - now 
she's backstroking. one-armed.

They reach the boat-  she grabs the rope ladder - and with remarkable strength - pulls him up.  
They sprawl on the deck

She rips his shirt open - pressing her ear to his chest. Cursing, she starts mouth-to-mouth.  
Nothing-  switching to CPR - pressing down on his chest - rhythmically. forcefully-

					ROWAN
			one - two - three - four - five-..

To fifteen.  Nothing-  she grabs his face - and slaps him.

					ROWAN
			Breathe, goddamnit- 
				(slaps him again)
			BREATHE!

She starts on his chest again - her pumping is violent now.

					ROWAN
			You're not - (pump) - gonna - (pump)
			- DIE - (pump) - you sonuvabitch

nothing-  Shee slumps back-  Gasping.  fury rising-  suddenly, she rises on her knees - raises 
a fist - and brings it down - striking his chest with all her might-  And MICHAEL's body jerks 
eerily.  water spurts from his south. A rasping cough erupts from him.  And his eyes open.

					MICHAEL
				(hacking- mumbling)
			They - they wanted me to come back...

And his eyes close.  Out cold.  She nods, exhausted - and strokes the matted hair from the gash 
on his forehead- then - cocking her head. starinq intently at him - the manner of her gesture 
changes - her fingers slide down his cheek --- almost a caress...



EXT.  ROWAN'S SAILBOAT AT SEA.  LATER

ROWAN stands motionless at the railing, a blanket wrapped round her - watching MICHAEL, on a 
stretcher, being taken below on the Coast Guard cruiser alongside her boat.  It speeds off.  
ROWAN watches until she can't see it anymore-

INT.  A HOSPITAL - THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

ATTENDANTS lift MICHAEL from a gurney onto a bed-  Two NURSES hustle about as a DOCTOR   50, 
silver-haired - looks on

					DOCTOR
			He had a major M.I. two years ago. Get an EKG and see if 
			this did anything to his heart-

MICHAEL'S clothes are cut away - and - he opens his eyes. One NURSE raises his arms while 
another slides a blanket onto him.  The DOCTOR leans to MICHAEL with warm concern--

					DOCTOR
			Michael - it's Geoffrey-

MICHAEL with a weak nod of         					DOCTOR                                                              
recognition  The blanket 					
now in place, a NURSE                              you just made the Guinness
lowers MICHAEL's arms                         book of records, friend - under miracles.

- and MICHAEL's hands come to rest on the blanket...

MICHAEL'S POV
The DOCTOR'S face disappears in a blure of WHITE. Then, with a ROAR. The FRAME FILLS with

INT. A LAUNDRAY ROOM [AS IF MICHAEL WHRE THERE]

Washing machines and dryers whirring  Three. BLACK WOMAM in hospita1 greens. folding blankets 
and laughing- - and then, instantaneously -

BACK TO SCENE - THE  DOCTOR STILL LEANING OVER MICHAEL

MICHAEL - freaked -                                              DOCTOR
raises his hands- -                                     ...close to an hour. Mike.

...and MICHAEL grasps the bed's handrails tightly. Again -  the room explodes inWhite

INT.  MICHAEL'S POV - THE ROOM [AS IF MICHAEL WHERE THERE]

A diffirent DOCTOR - defibrilator pads in both hands - is in GEOFFREY's place.  He lunges To 
CAMERA -

					DOCTOR
			Clear!!

THE POV SWIVELS to REVEAL a YOUNG WOMAN in the bed. The Doctor shocks her --- her liveless 
body jerks.

					DOCTOR
			Give me the atropeen!

A NURSE gjves him a huge hypodermic - and the DOCTOR plunges it into the Woman's heart...
Suddenly -

BACK TO SCENE
MICHAEL lets go at the handrail - as if shocked - and clasps his hands together.  He locks 
round the room, saucer-eyed. GEOFFREY eyes him carefully as he gives him an injection.

					MICHAEL
			What the HELL IS GOING...?!

					DOCTCR (GEOFFREY)
				(soothing)
			You where - in the water - a long time.

					MICHAEL
			No!  Geoffrey, I'm seeing...seeing... There was a - a dead 
			woman - she was -

					GEOFFREY
			The shot's kicking in.  Sleep now.

HE takes MICHAEL'S hands in his... Suddenly - a FLASH of WHITE -

INT-  A DOCTOR'S office  [AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE]

A WOMAN sits on an examination table, her smock down around her waist.  GEOFFREY puts a 
stethoscope on her breast and listens-  She qrins, draws her to him - they kiss And then, with 
a ROAR -

BACK TO SCENE
GEOFFREY, hands behind his back, stands at the bedside as MICHAEL, groggy from the injection. 
Starts to go under.

					MICHAEL
				(slurred. losing consciousness)
			I - I didn't think You - You fooled around with your patients,
			Geoffrey...

GEOFFREY cocks his head - stunned - as MICHAEL's  eyes close.

DISSOLVE TO

A COMPLETELY  WHITE FRAME
Then --- the whiteness swings on an axis TOWARD CAMERA--- a refrigeretor has been opened - 
revealing an interior filled with beer.  A gloved hand reaches in and grabs one.

WIDE OF SCENE - A KITCHEN - bar
MICHAEL closes the fridge.  A Wreck in a bathrobe - dark circle. ander his eyes, unshaven  and 
snug, leather gloves on his hands.  The garbage can overflows with beer cans. The phone RINGS.  
MICHAEL tries to bend back the cans, pop-top - but tbe gloves make it tough.  Me smiles grimly. 
Takes a knife, price the pop-top back,  and take. a long swig.

Wobbly, he shuffles cut on bare feet-  Down a HALL. Through a LIVING ROOM.  Everywhere, 
stunning excecution of design.  OC, the phone stops ringing.  He enters

AN EXQUISITELY DESINGED BEDROOM
There is clutter evetywhere: newspapers, magazines, books, beer cans.  MICHAEL plops on the 
dishevelled bed.  Glances at a magazine.  A story title reads:

LIFE AFTER DEATH EXPERIENCES:
AN ANALYTIC APPROACH

Other magazines and books deal with paranormal events, ESP, hands-on healing.  Across the room, 
a TV shows the end of an A T & T coamercial-  A voice warmly delivers the tagline: 'REACH OUT 
AND TOUCH SOMEONE.'  MICHAEL grins sardonically -

					MICHAEL
			Fuck you.

OC, the doorbell rings

					MICHAEL
			No more freak shows!  LEAVE ME ALONE!
	
					STU'S VOICE (OUTSIDE)
			Mike - it's me!  Let me in!

MICHAEL rises - walks to the window - and leans out.  STU stands below - at the front door - 
looking up-

					MICHAEL
			Go home, Stu (pause) I'll call you.

					STU
			Bullshit!  Let me in!  (pause) Mikey - there are people who can 
			help figure this ont.

					MICHAEL
			On which planet...?

					STU
			You can't just -

					MICHAEL					
			Go away, GODDAMNIT!

He slams the window down and heads tack to the bad.

INT. MICHAEL'S BEDROOM. A WEEK LATER - DUSK

MICHAEL sits before the TV-VCR, stacked with cassettes.  On screen, Peter Lorre - wild-eyed, 
fingers glowing radioactive and deadly - stalks a victim.  OC, the HOWL of a fire engine. 
MICHAEL cocks his head  and with a dreamy look, he stands.

INT. AN ATTIC. MINUTES LATER

MICHAEL,  gloved and wobbly, digs through dusty boxes.  His face softens - and he pulls out an 
old. singed Fireman's helmet with the insignia N.0. 17.  He lays it down - hesitates - pulls 
his gloves off reaches out with his hands --- and grabes the helmet...

A SEARING FLASH OF WHITE AND A ROAR

INT.  A FIERY, FLAMING BUILDINGG [AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE]

A FIREMAN - his he1met labelled N.O. 17 - races to an open window vith a GIRL in his arms.  
Down in the street - other FIREMEN, buffeted by a strong wind. look up, holding a satety net.  
The FIRMAN tosses the child down to safety.  Suddenly - the window is blown in, shattering.  
The FIREMAN falls to the floor - cut and dazed.  Above hirn - the flames dance - and then 
everything comes down on top of him-

BACK TO MICHAEL IN THE ATTIC
as he is jolted to the floor, one hand grasping the helmet.

EXT -  A TREE-LINED STREET [ AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE]

A battalion of FIREMWN at attention as PALLBEARERS carry a coffin.  Seated at a reviewing stand, 
draped with a black cloth that reads NEW ORLEANS FIRE DEPARTMENT is a WOMAN - 30, siIently 
weeping, dressed in widow's black - and

A SMALL BOY (STRONGLY RESEMBLING MICHAEL)
- 8, in a black suit - holding a singed fireman's helmet with an N.O. 17 insignia.  He watches 
the coffin pass, fascinated.

THE BOYS POV
A tall, wavy-haired MAN in ninteent-century garb walks solemnly beside the coffin.  The 
Pallbearers don't seem to notice.  He gives the Boy a melancholy smile.

THE BOY
Pokes his Mother and points to the man.  But she just pats his hand solemnly.  She doesn't see 
what he sees...

BACK TO MICHAEL ON THE ATTIC FLOOR
as he drops the helmet - and weeps

INT. A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL WARD.  DAY

Filled with KIDS.  Bandages, casts. eye patches.  Playing, reading, watching TV.  ROWAN strolls 
in. smiles at the scene - and approaches the BOY she saved -  his head bandaged, he snaps 
together plastic Lego pieces  creating a race car.

					ROWAN
			So - how fast does it go...?'

					BOY
				(looking up smiles) 
			Reallll fast.  Seven hundred miles an hour...  Mmmmm...  
			A minute

					ROWAN
			Wow! That's almost as fast as my car.

The BOY squints at her-  figuring out if she's kidding-

ANGEL - MICHAEL STANDING IN THE DOORWAY 
He's watching ROWAN.  He is hollow-eyed. gaunt - but clean- shaven  in clean clothes.  ROWAN is 
unaware at his presence.

					ROWAN
				(crouches beside the BOY.  quite serious) 
			That's if I turn on the retro-burners.
				(pause)  
			Of course, I only do that if r'm being chased.
				(the BOY'S eyes pop  he's hooked) 
			Never been caught yet.

She offers her palm - and he  slaps her five.

					ROWAN
			How's your head, Terry--?  Feel anything - like a balloon 
			in there...?

He shakes his head NO.  She affectionately rubs his cheek  then rises and beads toward the door. 
MICHAEL puts his gloved hands behind his back.  And - their alec meet.  Almost palpable 
electricity.  A long beat.

					MICHAEL
			Dr. --- Mayfair...?

She nods - but her face betrays her shock at his appearance.

					ROWAN
			Mr. Curry- - -

She otters her hand.  He hesitates	brings a gloved hand from behind his back - and they shake 
hands. She watches him as he stares at the BOY.

					MICHAEL
			They like you ------- kids.

					ROWAN
				(smiles)
			I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.
				(a beat. soberly)
			I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  
				(pause)
			Why don't we go to my office...

She gestures toward the hall.  He nods hesitantly - and they walk OUT OF FRAME.

INT. ROWAN'S OFFICE. MINUTES LATER

Shelves lined with texts on children's diseases and prenatal, postnatal, and infant genetics.  
MICHAEL stands perusing the books.  ROWAN sits at her desk.

					ROWAN
			I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.

					MICHAEL
				(turns to her- scowls)
			'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  
				(a grim smile) 
			people come right to the house.  They have a husband 
			or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring 
			a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them 
			where they are..

Looks her straight in the eye.  A wave of current flows.

					MICHAEL
			I don't remember you at all-  
				(pause)
			You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?

					ROWAN
				(her warm smile) 
			I'm glad you're around to say it.

					MICHAEL
				(dark)
			My jury's still out on that,

					ROWAN
				(turns almost sharp) 
			Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you -
			death is not the preferable alternative.
				(softening. a grin)
			I'm in the life business - remember..?

H musters a weak smile.   Tugs at his gloves.  She rises.

					ROWAN
				(Warm. soothing)
			Let's see what we can find out-

EXT. A BOAT DOCK. DAY - AN HOUR LATER


ROWAN and MICHAEL walk down toward her boat. She glances at his gloves.

					ROWAN
			Do they keep everything 'out' ...?

					MICHAEL
			As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps 
			pouring into my head-  (stark)  It won't go away God - if I 
			could just understand it.

They step onto the boat's deck.  ROWAN walks to the spot where she revived him, and kneels.

					ROWAN
			You had no pulse-..  You were gone.

MICHAEL - tightly-wound - kneels beside her. Squeezes his eyes shut-  A deep sigh.

					ROWAN
			Don't be afraid, Michael.

Her tone - and the use at his name - opens his eyes.  An electritied sock between them.  He 
peels his gloves off steels himself, flattens his palms on the deck - and waits...

					ROWAN
			What do you see...?

					MICHAEL
				(his face is a blank)
			Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-

EXT. AN OUTDOOR DECK.  DAY - LATER

MICHAEL stands staring down at the dock and ROWAN'S boat-  The ocean beyond shimmers.  He turns 
and walks through open glass doors, inside to

A KITCHEN-LlVING ROOM AREA
Rustic, unadorned.   Half-walled by the glass doors.  MICHAEL sits at a choppinq-block island, 
and scares at his gloved hands-  ROWAN pours him a scotch and sits across from him.

					ROWAN
			Just one.  The bar's closed.

					MICHAEL
				(gulps down the drink)
			 The one time I want it to work...

					ROWAN
			You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts 
			in out-of-body -

					MICHAEL
				(bristles)
			You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...?  
			My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved 
			brain - and nobody -
	
					ROWAN
			No. I'm not.
				(a beat- enigmatic)
	 		Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about 
			some things.

MICHAEL  nods in surprise.  He tries to pull a cigarette from his pack,  his gloved fingers 
fumbling.  ROWAN reaches out and stills his hand with hers.  She takes out a cigarette, puts it 
in his lips - and lights it.  Their eyes lock.

					ROWAN
			Touch me.			
				(MICHAEL'S brow creases)
			My hands were all over you. Maybe something will come from 
			me.
				(soft. soothing)
			Touch me Michael-

She holds her hands out to him.  He hesitate- staring at her offering.  He strips off his gloves 
- reaching for her hands - and takes them in his...

A FLASH OF WHITE MELTS TO

EXT.  ON THE DECK OF THE BOAT

as ROWAN slams her fist into MICHAEL'S chest - and he jolts to life.  she caresses his cheek in 
unmistakable longing.

THE IMAGE IS SUCKED THROUGH A HOLE IN ITSELF TO 

INT -  ROWAN'S KITCHENN [AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE]

where a MAN - 50, in a bathrobe - lies twitching on tfle floor, eyes glazing into death-  ROWAN 
is crouched beside him, weeping, fists clenched, mumbling Graham...?

					ROWAN'S VOICE (OC)
			OWWWWWWW....!

SUDDENLY BACK TO ROWAN'S KITCHEN
as ROWAN - with a yelp - wrenches her hands free or MICHAEL'S vise girp.  He tumbles backwards 
onto the floor.  ROWAN races round to him and kneels - cradling his head geritly

					MICHAEL
				(eyes opening- weakly)
			My gloves...

She grabs them, and slips them on his hands.   Her lush hair is tussled by a stadden BREEZE that 
blows in from the deck.

					MICHAEL
				(softly. awestruck)
			I saw it.  On the boat,  I was - dead. (pause)  you brought 
			me back...

Enongh electricity to light a city. He takes her hands gently in his.. -

					MICHAEL
			...with these.

The BREEZE sends some papers into the air.  ROWAN bends to him.  Their lips meet in a soft brush 
or a kiss - and then the gates open.  Lips searching-  hands tearing at clothes.  Limbs 
entwining.  A whirlwind of flesh finds a rhythm. Two pounding; themselves into one-  Rough, 
on-the-edge-

					ROWAN
			Harder...

					MICHAEL
			Rowan...

					ROWAN
			HARDER!

					MICHAEL
			Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!

					ROWAN
			Yessssss...

INT. ROWAN's LIVING ROOM. LATER

ROWAN AND MICHAEL lying entwined, naked, before the in the firepalce in the LIVING ROOM-  They 
watch the.flames...

					MICHAEL
			you're very --- different.

					ROWAN
			I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to 
			life and then seduce you.

she rises on an elbow - with that enigmatic. look.

					ROWAN
			What else did you see- Michael...?

					MICHAEL
				(a curious grin)
			What're you - a mindreader...?
				(a beat. turns solemn) 
			Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?

ROWAN'S brow knits - stunned.  Not what she expected.

					ROWAN
				(stiff. softly) 
			My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  
				(pause) 
			He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer.  
			Last year.

					MICHAEL
			You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.  (pause)  
			There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...

she puts her head back down on his chest.  A long beat.

					ROWAN
			It's unbelievable that you can do that.

					MICHAEL
				(a beat. turns dark)
			It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of 
			myself. (pause)  Like I'm fading away-

ROWAN' slides up face to face.  Her eyes filled with warmth

					ROWAN
			You're here, Michael.  All of you.

She leans in and kisses him deeply.  And they start again.

EXT. CLOSE-UP - MICHAEL'S FACE FLOATING UNDERWATER

- the water stretching it eerily.  PULL BACK to reveal 

MICHAEL LYING ON HIS STOMACH ON THE DOCK - DAYTIME
his head out over the edge, staring at his reflection

					MICHAEL
			I've always loved them.  (pause) New Orleans has these great 
			old houses.  When I was a kid, I'd look at them, thinking  - 
			'somebody dreamed them up, put something where there was nothing...'
			it amazed me.

He turns to ROWAN, who suns herself on her back on the dock.

					MICHAEL
			My mother and I used to take long walks and make up 
			stories about the houses and the people who lived inside. 
				(pause)
			The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house-  
			Like that.

					ROWAN
			And whose houses do you design...?

					MICHAEL
			Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The 
			Eyes In His Hands...

					ROWAN
				(a beat. watching him)
			You still feel that crazy...?

He passes.  Then smiles and shakes his head. 

					MICHAEL
			No. Not vith you.

A long beat.

					ROWAN
			I was born, in New Orleans, too-

					MICHAEL
			Really...?  Your family there...?

					ROWAN
			Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died 
			in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she 
			brought me here... the day after I was born.

MICHAEL'S brow creases-  He reaches out and strokes her ankle - but she sits up. pulling her 
legs away from him. Staring out to sea silently.  He stares at her back.

					MICHAEL
			Too much... too fast...?

					ROWAN
			Mm-hmm.   (pause)  Scared-  I feel a little like the moth 
			and the flame.

					MICHAEL (a beat. softly)
			So do I.

	

She hesitates - turns round to him.  And - she stretches her ankle out to him - and he grins 
and runs a finger across it.

INT.  A DOCTOR'S OFFICE.   A WEEK LATER

Geoffrey sits at his desk, phone to his ear.

					GEOFFREY (INTO THE PHONE)
			...always concerned about his heart - so the fact he isn't 
			drinking is great.

					ROWAN (INTO THE PHONE)
			I'll keep you up to date Geoffrey.  Goodbye.

PULL OUT to reveal ROWAN, naked, stradaling MICHAIL on his back in bed in Rowan's BEDROOM, 
naked except tor his gloves.  He looks better - color in his face  the circies gone-  She hangs 
up the phone and leans over him-
		
					ROWAN
			He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.

					MICHAEL
			He fools around with his patients too.

He points at his gloved hand and wiggles his eyebrows slyly.

					ROWAN
			you touched him --- and saw him...?
			What was he doinging.  Kinky...?

					MICHAEL
			It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic 
			skin flick to perk up our sex life...?

She leans to hit, hair cascading into his face reaches behind her - finds him - and puts him 
inside her.

					ROWAN
				(velvety)
			It would appear that's not the case...

INT.  ROWAN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT

MICHAEL and ROWAN sit on the floor playing SCRABBLE.  She taps the board impatiently as he 
stares at her letters.  He eyes her tapping finger, and looks up at her.

					ROWAN
			You come back from the dead and you can't make one 
			dumb word...?

He makes a face at her-  And looks back down at his letters, his thumb in his cleft.  she cocks 
her head and watches him.

					ROWAN
			You look very deep when you do that.
				(he stops doing it)
			It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit 
			and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.

					MICHAEL
			Ms. yin, and Mr. yang
				(suddenly inspirea)
			Aha!

He places some letters on the board.  She watches and recites the letters one by one, befuddled.

					ROWAN
			Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it 
			in a sentence.

					MICHAEL
			Okay.  (a southern drawl)   y'all make sure and come back now, 
			reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.

She breaks out laughing.  He takes a pencil - leans to the score-pad.  She lunges for the 
pencil

					ROWAN
			Hey - no fair!  That's not a word!

They go rolling on the ground, laughing, wrestling...

INT. ROWAN'S SAILBOAT. DAY

Moving swiftly across the ocean.  MICHAEL sits - gloved hands on the rudder - watching ROWAN 
pull in the mainsail.

					MICHAEL
			Why don't you let at do that...?

					ROWAN
			Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.

					MICHAEL
			Doctor's orders- - -?

					ROWAN
			Captain's orders.

She ties off the lanyard and sits beside him.  Staring out at the scene-  A dreamy, contented 
look.

					ROWAN
			
			Perfect.

					MICHAEL
				(watching her. a beat)
			You sure are.

His tone turns her head to him.  Her smile dissolves. 

					ROWAN
			Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.

					MICHAEL
			All I meant was -

					ROWAN
			You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
	
She stares at him-  sighs  and shaking her head -

					ROWAN
			Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -

					MICHAEL
				(his grin blooms)
			Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how 
			good this is...?

					ROWAN
				(refusing to smile back)
			I'm serious.  You don't -
 
					MICHAEL
				(not letting it go)
			Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - 
			and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...? (pause)  you hate 
			kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those 
			mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -

					ROWAN
				(simmering)
			Stop it.
					
					MICHAEL
				(his grin dissolves)
			You stop it. (pause) you're loving, and gentel..  You're 
			the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling 
			me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause 
			it won't work.

Their gazes lock-  And --- ROWAN'S eyes suddenly fill with tears-  MICHAEL'S face creases with 
concern. He reactres for her - but she rises-  Starts pacing.

					MICHAEL
			Ro --- what is it...?

A long beat.  She finally turns to him -

					ROWAN
			What you 'saw' --- me in the kitchen - with Grahm - when he 
			was dying...?
				(MICHAEL nods)
			My anger wasn't frustration Michael. (pause)  It was hatred.
				(MICHAEL winces, stunned)
			He tried to molest me   while his wife lay half-dead in the 
			hospital!   (pause) Ellie's love was the one thing that connected 
			me to the world.  Sha was all I ever had.
				(chilling)
			At that moment, I hated Graham with a fury you could never imagine...
			pause)... and that's when he had his stroke.
				(a long beat. softly)
			I wanted him to die.  (pause) Howqs that for 'perfect' ...?

A tear slides down her cheek-  The mainsail SNAPS loudly as it fills with WIND.  Her tears come 
full-force.  sobbing, she lunges into his arms.  Se holds her tightly.  A long beat.

					ROWAN
				(pained. ashamed)
			I'm a doctor, Michael, and I wanted him to die.

DISSOLVE TO

INT.  MICHAEL'S HOUSE. DAY

ROWAN wanders wide-eyed, stunned by its beauty.  She enters the bedroom, where MICHAEL stands, 
staring at the mess.

					MICHAEL
			Seems more like a year than a month.

					ROWAN
			Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...
				(goes to him)
			The things you created...

He nods slowly - and shrugs.  She takes his hands in hers.

					ROWAN
			I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological
			Institute  In L.A., remember...?
				(MICHAEL nods)
			He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.

					MICHAEL
				(deadpan)
			God knows, I'm intriguing.

					ROWAN
				(stern)
			Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of 
			your life...?

					MICHAEL
				(stares at his gloves. a lonq beat)

					ROWAN
			You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the 
			next day
				(her warm smile blooms)
			I think I can last that long without you.

He slowly nods.  Searching each other's eyes.  Then a crooked smile curls at ROWAN'S lips.  She 
shakes her head.

					ROWAN
			We're quite a pair, you and I.

					MICHAEL
				(matching her grin)
			Mad. for each other.

INE.  A BEDROOM.  LATE NIGHT

Moonlight on a dusty floor.  DIEDRE lies motionless in an old brass bed - her open eyes welling 
with tears.  Her wrists and ankles in leather restraints.  The window curtains flutter.

CLOSE-UP - DIEDRE'S FACE IN THE MOONLIGHT
as a tear rolls down her cheek - then	 changes direction - moving across her cheek, and 
disappears - as if someone had brushed it away.  A haunting smile blooms - her eyes close...

INT. AN OPERATING ROOM

ROWAN works feverishly on an OUT OF FRAME patient. Thirteen FIGURES - faces hidden by surgical 
masks - encircle the operating table - watching silently.  ROWAN throws her hands up in despair,
her confidence failing.

					ROWAN
			I - I can't do it!

The others urge her on - imploring, encouraging her.

					ROWAN
				(pointing OUT OF FRAM.  frantic)
			But look!  LOOK!  How can I do it...?

ROWAN SHOOTS UP IN HER BED AT NIGHT
jolted awake by the rain whipping at her windows.  The clock says 3 A.M.  The rain is like a 
WHISPER.  Every nerve-end at attention.  She reaches under the bed and brings up a bat.  Heart 
pounding.  Stepping into the hall, reaching

THE DARKENED LIVING ROOM
The WIND MOANS.  The rain flows thickly down the glass walls, giving the sky and ocean beyond a 
weird, melted look.

					ROWAN
				(tense - but brave)
			It somebody's here ---

She whirls round.  There - on the deck, is A MAN - wavy hair, achingly handseme, Victorian 
clothes - THE MAN AT THE FUNERAL PROCESSION IN MICHAEL'S VISION.  His hands rest on the glass.
The rain seems to go through him.  ROWAN raises the bat -

					ROWAN
			I'll take your goddamn head off.'

she dashes to the glass doors - yanks them open and steps out.  But the deck is empty.  
Drenched. she reaches out - and touches the glass where the man's hands had been-  She snatches
her hand away quickly - and stares at her fingertips. incredulous.

INT. ROWAN'S KITCHEN. PRE-DAWN

The storm is over.  ROWAN sips from a wine glass, staring at her fingertips.  she rubs them 
together, deep in thought. The phone RINGS once - and the answering machine kicks on

					ROWAN'S VOICE (ON THE MESSAGE)
			you've reached 555-2lO1.

ROWAN comes out of her fog - stands - and heads toward the phone.  The caller clears its voice.

					A WOMAN'S VOICE (ON THE PHONE MACHINE)
				(a southern accent. hesitant)
			Ellie...?  Ellie - are you there...? Dammit.  (pause) 555 - 2 - 1 - 0 - 1 
			(pause)  Ellie --- this is Carlotta.

ROWAN stops - cocks her head.  Who...?

					CARLOTTA (ON THE PHONE MACHINE)
				(a sigh. cool  measured)
			E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.  (pause)  Obviously, 
			there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -

					ROWAN
				(snatching up the phone)
			Hello...?  Who is this...?

					CARLOTTA (ON THE PHONE)
				(beat. cool)
			Who is this...?

					ROWAN
			Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?

					CARLOTTA (ON THE PHONE)
				(a long beat. cool)
			I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.

					ROWAN'
			Ellie Mayfair is --- dead.

					CARLOTTA (ON THE PHONE)
			Dead...?  (pause)  Why was I not notified of Ellie's death...?!

					ROWAN
			I beg your par---

					CARLOTTA (ON THE PHONE) 
				(brusk. In command)
			When did she die...? 

					ROWAN
				(getting angry)
			Who is this...?

					CARLOTTA (ON THE PONE)
				(a long beat. very cool)
			This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.

ROWAN stares at the phone, dumbfounded.  My aunt...?
			
					ROWAN
			I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, 
			for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -

					CARLOTTA (ON THE PHONE)
				(like a cold blade)
			Diedre Mayfair was your mother.

The sky falls on ROWAN  she reels.  A long beat.

					ROWAN
				(hushed)
			My...mother...?

					CARLOTTA  (ON THE PHONE)
				(cold. no sympathy)
			Yes.  (pause)  Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney 
			contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -

					ROWAN
				(reeling)
			But my mother...  Ellie said she died -

					CARLOTTA (ON THE PHONE)
				(curt. annoyed)
			I under5tand.  All the same 

					ROWAN
			-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...?  
			ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -

					CARLOTTA (OM THE PHONE)
			I had you sent away.

					ROWAN
				(astonished anger)
			Who the hel1 -

					CARLOTTA (ON THE PHONE)
			It was quite warranted by the - situation.  (pause)  I realize this 
			is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not 
			as if you've suffered some great -

					ROWAN
				(anger exploding) 
			What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!

					CARLOTTA (ON THE PHONE)
			A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to 
			rest before the funeral.  (pause)   Have your lawyer -

					ROWAN
			When is the funeral...?  (SILENCE) I am coming to my mother's 
			funeral!!

					CARLOTTA (ON THE PHONE)
				(out of control - for a moment) 
			Out of the question   (pause)   Rowan, coming here will not change 
			the -

					ROWAN
			I'm coming down there!!  And it you put my mother in the ground 
			betore I arrive, you'll wish you'd never seen my face!  IS THAT 
			UNDERSTOOD...?!

ROWAN is revving.  shaking.  A long beat.

					CARLOTTA (ON THE PHONE)
				(weary. resigned)
			Lenigan's Mortuary.  St. Charles and Carondolet.  One o'clock.  
			(long pause) You should not do this Rowan.

A CLICK on the line.. A dial tone drones...  Rowan slowly hangs up.  Trembling.  Her world 
spinning off its axis.

INT. ROWAN'S BEDROOM. DAWN

ROWAN'S shoving clothes into a suitcase, grabs the phone and pushes re-dial.  RING.  CLICK.  A 
RECORDED voice comes on...

INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM.  SAME TIME
					
MICHAEL lies in bed sleeping.                                    A VOICE RECORDING

Rown tosses the phone on the                                   seven P.M. if you are -
bed - and continues packing...

INT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT TERMINAL.  EARLY THAT MORNING

ROWAN at a payphone, phone to her ear, tapping her finger nervously.  An airline ticket in her 
other hand-  RING- RING

					MICHAEL (ON' THE LINE)
			Hello...?

					ROWAN
			Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -

					MICHAEL (ON THE LINE)
			Rowan...?

					ROWAN
			Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain.  
			God, Michael...

					MICHAEL (ON THE LINE!)
				(alarmed)
			What's wrong..?

Over the P.A. system - "Last boarding call for flight 6-0-4 to New Orleans..."  ROWAN winces

					ROWAN
			Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -

					MICHAEL (ON THE LINE)
				(alarm rising)
			What about you coming down here...?

A long beat.  ROWAN makes up her mind.

					ROWAN
			Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the 
			Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.

					MICHAEL (0N THE LINE) 
			Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?

					ROWAN
			Goodbye, Michael.  (long pause) I love you.

She hangs up.  And dashes toward the gate with her ticket.  

INT.  AN AIRLINER ABOVE THE CLOUDS. LATER THAT MORNING

ROWAN alone in her row, asleep. MOVING IN TIGHT, the sounds of the plane fade...  Her tongue 
darts across her lips sensually.  A soft, silky moan.  Her body moves - shifting. accommodating.
Her breath catches.  Her head arches back.

					ROWAN'S VOICE [IN HER HEAD]
			Harder...

					MAN'S VOICE [IN HER HEAD]
			                    (it is not MICHAEL'S voice)
			Rowan...

					ROWAN'S VOICE [IN HER HEAD]
			Harder...

					MAN'S VOICE [IN HER HEAD]
			Like this...  LIKE THIS...?

					ROWAN'S VOICE [IN HER HEAD]
			Yessss...

					MAN'S VOICE [IN HER HEAD]
			Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...

She shudders - coming in her sleep.   Her eyes open hazily...  She straightens up - and winces.
Her face creases.  Huh...?  She feels herself between her legs.  Her eyebrows arch...

INT.  A FUNERAL HOME.  THAT AFTERNOON

Sunlight spilling through high, ornate windows.  A hundred people - drinking, smiling.  The air
is thick with familial intimacy.  Floral arrangements have taken the place over.  SNAKING 
SLOWLY THROUGH CROWD. We hear.

					WOMAN #1
			God-Only-knows what went on in her head...

					MAN #1
			Been in back yet...?  Lonigan did quite a job.  Best she's looked since the 
  			baby.  (pause)  Sixty-three...?

					WOMAN #1
			Sixty-one...  I remember, cause Julien was still alive.

The camera clears the crowd and HOLDS on

ROWAN IN THE MAIN ENTRANCE
- suitcase in hand. bewilderment clouding her face.  A MAN - 45, black suit, somber - 
approaches her. BEATRICE MAYFAIR - 40, a lush figure in a satin dress - turns and stares.

					MAN
			Good afternoon.  I'm Jerry Lonigan.
			May I ask who -

					BEATRICE
				(sudden realization) 
			Oh my god...  Is it...?  Mother of Christ - she's here...

Heads turn.  Voices fall silent.
BEATRICE - eyes welling up - steps to ROWAN.

					BEATRICE
			You are, aren't you...?  You're Rowan!

She hugs a startled ROWAN.  In the crowd, SILENCE shifts to an astonished MURMUR.  "Deedee's 
little girl...?"  "It must be.  Those are Mayfair eyes"  "Does Carl know...?"
	
					BEATRICE
			Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I -
			we - we grew up together.

					ROWAN
				(fuzzy)
			I want to see my mother.

					MAN (JERRY LONIGAN)
				 (a beat. almost defensive)
			We - uh - we did what we could.  The skin was... I mean - Diedre had 
			really ---

					BEATRICE
			Be quiet, Jerry.
				(takes ROWAN by the arm)
			come with me, darling.
		
She leads ROWAN away.  Curious eyes watch.  Hands reach out. "Welcome home, cousin" "She's with
her maker, sweetheart"  ROWAN clutches BEATRICE'S hand.  "we're glad you'r here..."

					BEATRICE
			You hold on tight as you want.

They near a doorway.  A smaller room is visibe. Soft voices inside.  Shadows move on the walls.
And -CARLOTTA steps IMTO VIEW - cane in hand, whizzened and stiff - but peerless.  ROWAN 
freezes.  She knows this woman no mistake about it.  Their eyes locked on each other.

					CARLOTTA
				(a cold frost of a smile)
			You came.  (a long pause)  I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.

					ROWAN
				(glacial)
			I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?

					CARLOTTA
				(a hint of a grin)
			In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?

CARLOTTA looks for a flinch or a wound, but there is none - ROWAN is steel.  CARLOTTA turns to
the doorway.

					CARLOTTA
			Hush up, now. all of you. Deedee's little girl is here.  All the way from 
			San Francisco.  Give her some peace with her mother.  Go on.  Get a 
			bourbon up in the front there.  I said MOVE.

People come out of the room, eyeing ROWAN

					CARLOTTA
			Bea - let go of the girl's hand.

BEATRICE glares - but steps aside.  ROWAN comes forward and halts at the doorway.  She can see 
the edge of the gleaming coffin.  A deep breath, and she walks into

THE ROOM
She is alone.  Slow steps toward the coffin.  ROWAN halts.  Standing above the coffin...  
Looking down...

Diedre lies in a bed at flowers.  Folded hands on a pale blue gown.  ROWAN'S hand hesitates, 
lightly touchs the gown - and then drops to her side.  She stares, expressionless.

INT. A BACKSEAT OF A TAXI.  SAME TIME

New Orleans' Garden tistrict passes by outside the window.  Splendid, old houses of pink and 
lavender.  And now - the MAYFAIR MANSION, in all its tragic glory comes INTO FRAME.

					MICHAEL  (OC)
			Pull over!

ANGLE - MICHAEL IN THE BACKSEAT OF THE TAXI 
He leans to the window and stares at the house, seized with melancholy.  The CABBIE pulls over.

					MICHAEL
			They - they let it. die.
				(the saddest of smiles)
			God, I loved this house.  Used to walk by, rattle a stick across tbe 
			fence...

MICHAEL opens the door and steps out.

					CABBIE
			Meter's running, mister.

MICHAEL WALKS TO THE GATE
Runs his finger across it and grins.  On the other side, blood-red camellia blossoms lie in the 
grass. He kneels, reaches in and gathers up a few.  The rest skirt away in a sudden BREEZE.  He 
rises  - and comes face to face with 'The Man' - standing on the other side of the fence - 
smiling faintly in his Victorian clothes.

MICHAEL drops like a stone  A hand grasps his shoulder.  He YELPS - turns to see Aaron Lightner
kneeling beside him - then everything goes BLACK.

INT.  A STRETCH LIMOUSINE.  LATER THAT AFTERNOON

ROWAN stares out from the back seat at the Garden District. Beside her is BEATRICE  then RYAN 
MAYRAIR - 50, elegant, thin. cool afflluence.  Facing ROWAN is GIFFORD MAYFAIR - 65, corpulent,
a face veined from years of bourbon.

					BEATRICE
			Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows 
			where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.

					GIFFORD
				(a gruff chuckle) 
			In certain cases, hell is the operative word.

					BEATRICE
			Giff - shuttup.  (pause)  you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... 
			A lost little girl in a world too full at things

SILENCE.  Sad glances are exchanged by the relatives.

					RYAN
				(kind. measured)
			Rowan - we're glad you're with us now.  Carlotta has always done what's 
			best for the family.  We don't always understand, but she's the anchor. 
			Anchors are hard and blunt by nature -

					GIFFORD
			- and they hurt like hell if they fall on you.

					BEATRICE
			Gif-ford

ROWAN still stares out the window.  A long beat.

					ROWAN
			I've been lied to my whole life.

Throats clear.  Bodies shift in seats.

INT. A BEDROOM. SAME TIME

MICHAEL sleeps in a mahogany bed.  Eyes opening, squinting.  He sits up.  His suitcase on an 
antique bench - clothes on a valet - a robe at the foot of the bed. He gets up - wobbly - puts 
on the robe and wanders into

A BEAUTIFUL MAOGANY AND MARBLE PARLOR
where the white-suited AARON LIGHTNER sits on a lush leather sofa, staring benignly, ivory 
walking stick at his side.

					AARON
			How do you feel, Michael...?

MICHAEL is still unsteady, off-balance - about everything.

					AARON
			I'm Aaron Lightner - and this is the Talamasca Retreat  in New Orleans.

MICHAEL squints at him.  AARON grins.

					AARON
			Tal - a - mas - ca.  From the French.

MICHAEL wobbles - and AARON rises and gently steadies him.  So benevolent.  patient.

					MICHAEL
			It was you - on the sidewalk...

suddenly, MICHAEL'S eyes widen - remembering something.

					MICHAEL
			Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--

					AARON
				(calm. even)
			Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.
				(MICHAEL squints at him - stunned)
			At the cemetery by now, I would guess.

Suspicion darkens MICHAEL'S face.

					MICHAEL
			How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?

					AARON
			With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.

					MICHAEL
				(scowls)
			Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.

					ARRON
			Lies, Michael.  Desperate decptions. (sighs)  Rowan has stepped 
			into a world that's waited centuries for her.

					MICHAEL
			You know what, mister...?  You're nuts.  And I'm getting out of here.

He starts back unsteadily toward the bedroom...

					ARRON
			We know about the visions, Michael...

MICHAEL freezes.  And slowly turns round. ARRON nods wisely.

					AARON
			there is great danger...

MICHAEL stares - dumbfounded, shaken, searching AARON'S eyes.  such clear benevolence...

					AARON
			I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few 
			hours.

					MICHAEL
			You sound certifiable. Yon know that.

					ARRON
				(his wise smile)
			Should I think you certifiable if you told me that hours ago, you saw 
			a phantom materialize before your eyes...
				(BULLSEYE.  MICHAEL'S jaw drops)
			I've seen him too, Michael.

MICHAEL blanches.  Haunted thoughts racing in his memory.

					MICHAEL
			I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.

					AARON
				(nodding)
			Come.  There is a lot to read

EXT.  A CEMETERY.  SAME TIME  - AFTERNOON 

ROWAN AND CARLOTTA STAND SIDE BY SIDE
at the front of the mourners before an enormous flower-laden crypt with twelve vaults.  carved
into the top of the crypt is MAYFAIR - and NEVER DIE.

Four MEN slide the coffin inside the one open vault. A BREEZE kicks up, sending flowers into
the air. one lands between CARLOTTA and ROWAN.  The old woman bends stiffly and picks the huge
flower up.  She smells it  and a private smile blooms.  The crowd begins to drift apart.

					ROWAN
				(simmering anger. whispers)
			She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her.
			Who gave you that right...?!

					CARLOTTA
				(a narrow smile) 
			A Mayfair it ever I saw one.

					ROWAN
			I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from 
			every -

					CARLOTTA
			I'm tired.  I need to rest.

					ROWAN
			There are things I have to know!

CARLOTTA nods slowly - turns - and starts away.

					CARLOTTA
			Come to the house tonight.

She tosses away the flower.  The BREEZE swirls it across the ground - and it come. to rest at 
ROWAN'S feet.

INT.  A ROOM.  THAT NIGHT

A rounded gallery.  Windowless.  An antique desk and two chairs.  On the walls - twelve, large,
old portraits. MICHAEL and ARRON enter the room.  AARON gestures...

					ARRON
			All copies. but most are by the original artists.  Suzanne was the 
			first.

MICHAEL looks up at the portrait of SUZANNE MAYFAIR, golden hair spilling from her hood. the 
pendant round her neck...

					SUZANNE [IN MICHAEL'S HEAD]
			Go back, Michael... do what you can...

He whirls to anotner portrait - DEBORAH, with the scarlet curls and pendant.  MICHAEL's hands 
going to his ears.

					DEBORAH [IN MICHAEL'S HEAD]
			Help us, Michael...  The door...

He's swirling in a circle.  Voices crowding in...  And --- ARRONN suddenly grabs MICHAEL'S face
tightly in his hands.

					AARON
			You've seen them...?  when you drowned...?

MICHAEL nods frantically.  AARON gently takes MICHAEL'S hands from his ears.

					AARON
			Gone...?

MICHAEL nods.  AARON leads him to the chair.  MICHAEL sits, dazed.  On the desk art three, 
thick, leather-bound volumes.

					AARON
			A nexus, Michael.  Rowan - the visions - and the Man...  Lasher.
				(suddenly stern)
			I must know this now: Do you love Rowan...?

MICHAEL nods.  AARON nods, satisfied.  A beat.

					AARON
			The Talamasca is a world-wide... ahhh - organization 
			- but we do not  - (grins)- 'publicize.'  (pause)  We 
			observe and record... the extraordinary.  Since the
			Knights Templar...for eight hundred years 
				(points at the book)
			A history of the Mayfairs.  Eyewitness accounts.  The 
			original handwritten documents.  From 1683 till now.  
			(pause) I am the eighth observer of the family.

ECU - ONE OF THE LEATHER COVERED MAYFAIR HISTORY VOLUMES It reads:

THE MAYFAIR HISTORY - VOLUME ONE
BY
PETYR VAN ABEL

					AARON (OC)
			Petyr Van Abel was the son of Jan van Abel - a brilliant 
			pioneer of genetics.

WIDE OF SCENE

					AARON
			But Petyr was a troubled soul, with paranormal gifts.  He 
			renounced science, wandered for years, and met Suzanne of 
			Mayfair in Scotland.  They fell in love, but she would not 
			 marry.  Petyr went to France - and soon joined the Talamasca.

MICHAEL stares at the book, his mind stretching at the seams.

					MICAEL
			You - you want me to read all this...?

					AARON
			No.  (pause)  If you trust me - if you can be strong -- I want you 
			to touch it.

Like a sucker-punch.

EXT.  THE MAYlAIR MANSION.  MIDNIGHT

ROWAN stands at the wrought-iron gate.  She walks to the door - raises a hand and - CREAK - the
door opens  There is CARLOTTA, cane in hand.  Inside, a few candles set shadows dancing.  A 
large white CAT strolls up to ROWAN and rubs against her leg.  CARLOTTA looks up to the sky -

					CARLOTTA
			A moon, but no stars. (grins)  Clever.

And she walks back into the house.  ROWAN steps inside following CARLOTTA down a long hall.  Up
ahead, a door is opening.  ROWAN catching up - and stepping through - onto

A PATIO THAT WRAPS AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE
Two chairs.  A table with an oil lamp, where CARLOTTA sits, the cat in her lap.  ROWAN sits.  
CREAK.  Everything so old. CARLOTTA lights the lamp.  It makes her face an amber skull.

					CARLOTTA
			The house is yours.

					ROWAN
				(surprised. simmering)
			I don't want the -

					CARLOTTA
			Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest 
			holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds 
			over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all.  
			All yours now.

					ROWAN
				(disbelieving)
			Eighty million doll --- ?

					CARLOTTA
			And this - if you decide to take the rest.

She puts a velvet jewelry box on the table.  ROWAN opens it.  The emerald pendant catches the 
lamplight. ROWAN's eyes rise from the stone and study CARLOTTA closely. A long beat.  Then the 
old woman grins - and shakes her head.

					CARLOTTA
			No, my dear.  older than that.  I'm eighty-six - next month.

ROWAN recoils from her - stunned.  Her thoughts were read.

					CARLOTTA
			That's right   Everything you think, Rowan.  Simply a matter of 
			will and practice (pause)  You'll learn.

ROWAN shifts in her chair.  CREAK.  spooked.

					ROWAN
			Why was I taken from my mother...?! And why have I been deceived...?

CARLOTTA raises, herself on her cans.  And takes up the lamp. 

					CARLOTTA
			Come.

WIDE OF SCENE - THE TALAMASCA GALLERY
ARRON sits beside MICHAEL at the desk.  He places a syringe next to the open manuscript.

					AARON
			In case it becomes too powerful.  (pause) I'll be right beside

MICHAEL turns a page.  Removes his gloves - rubs his hands.

A FEROCIOUS ROAR - AND A FLASH OF BLINDING WHITE TURNS TO

INT. A DUNGEON.  MORNING - 1683  [AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE]

PETYR VAN ABEL - 35, scar1et hair, grey coat and large black hat - stands in a hall as a HOODED
FIGURE unlocks a door. PETYR steps in.  The door shuts.  He squints in the darkness.

					WOMAN'S VOICE 
			You'll have no confession from me! Leave - (laughs)  - or I'll 
			turn your teeth into mushrooms!

					PETYR
			Suzanne - it is Petyr.

Chains rattle and suddenly, SUZANNE - ragged, fettered in chains - is before him.  They embrace
passionately.

					SUZANNE
			Oh my love...  My	sweet loving Petyr.
			
					PETYR
			I should never have left you.  Never.

					SUZANNE
			But you are here now.  All the years apart are washed away.

They sink into a deep, long kiss.  He holds her at arm's length.  His face grave and pained.

					PETYR
			What have you done, Suzanne...?  They say -

					SUZANNE
				(her defiance returns)
			No!  NOT what they say!  (pause) The Baron was beyond medicine.  
			My - prayer was to save him, not kill

					PETYR
			Prayer...? Who did you pray to, my love...?

A smile washes over her.  She caresses his cheek.

					SUZANNE
			They are already piling the sticks. There is no time.  (pause)
			But Petyr - you must know this now.  I have a daughter...  We 
			have a daughter.

PETYR freezes with astonishment.  She smiles sadly.

					PETYR
			My God, Suzanne...  where - where is - 

She silences him with a gentle finqer to his lips.  Ssshhh...

					SUZANNE
			Across the sea in St. Domingue. Free from the grasp of fearful men.

The CLINK of a key in the lock.  She clutches PETYR to her.

					SUZANNE
			It is good to have the one you 1ove with you - when it is time to die. 
			(pause)  It will be a special day.

The door opens. Light pours in and BURNS EVERYTHING TO WHITE.
		
INT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION.  LATE NIGHT

ROWAN follows CARLOTTA down a HALL, the walls hung with portraits like those in the Ta1amasca
gallery.  CARLOTTA points at a WOMAN - 40, a blood-red gown. wearing the pendant - standing 
before a pristine version of the mansion.

					CARLOTTA
			Marquerite.  Your great-grandmother.  Something of a practitioner 
			herself, Rowan.

She points at another portrait: DEBORAH - 20, fiery red hair. a bare-shouldered blouse and 
pants, with the pendant, holding a riding crop - stands before a large house in the tropics.

					CARLOTTA
			Deborah, Suzanne's daughter.  She started the family fortune.  Her 
			plantation covered half ot Haiti.

Her crooked finger stabs at another portrait: a MAN - handsome, black-eyed, in elegant long 
coat and ruffled shirt.

					CARLOTTA				
			Julien.  Your great grandfather.  Clever, charming Julien...  
			we had our moments he and I...  You are forever in his debt.

ROWAN glances at Julien.  Lamplight dances on him.  Did his smile curl - the black eyes 
wink...?  Her breath catches.

					CARLOTTA
			What is it...?
				
					ROWAN
				(spooked. edgy)
			The lamplight.  That's all.

They reach a winding staircase at the hall's end. A gust of WIND blows the lamp out.  DARKNESS.

					CARLOTTA
			You can see well in the dark, Rowan.

					ROWAN
				(stiff. simmering)
			Better than most, I suppose.

					CARLOTTA
			Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-

A match light - and it burns out the FRAME to a HOT WHITE...

INT. AN INN.  DAY

THE IMAGE SHATTERS INTO

EXT. A SEVENTEENTH CENTURY TOWN SQUARE.   MORNING
Encircled by shops.  A stake at the center, sticks piled at its base.  A torch burns in a 
stanchion.  A church spire towers above it all.  PETYR is among the large CROWD watching two 
columns of PRIESTS near the stake. Between them is SUZANNE - in a white robe, holding a large 
candle.  The procession halts.  She scans the crowd and finds PETYR.  She smiles at him.  Then 
- her face turns fierce.

					SUZANNE
			I never did any of you harm! I am UNJUSTLY CONDEMNED!
			I have no love for Satan!

The crowd jeers.  "Burn her!"  "Witch!" "Send her ashes to Hell!"  She hurls the candle down.

					SUZANNE
			Witch, is it...?!  (growls) Come now, Lasher!  COME!

A RUMBLING, like thunder, fills the air-  A WIND begins to swirl.  The sky darkens.  Curses 
from the crowd, as they raise arms and cloaks against the swirling dust.

					SUZANNE
			My beautiful Lasher - strike down those who would come to 
			see me die!

The WIND howls.  Shutters break free.  windows shatter.  And from the rooftops, tiles - a storm
of them - shower down on the terror-stricken CROWD. The town is being ripped apart - and at the
eye of the storm. SUZANNE watches, eyes burning.

PANIC.  people rush madly, arms over heads, trampling those who've fallen. Cries in the WIND.
Blood puddles the ground. Shops burn.  Bodies piled at every doorway.  Armageddon.

PETYR stands in the center of the chaos, near a frantic PRIEST.

					PRIEST
			Where is she...?! FIND HER!

					SUZANNE (OC)
			Petyr!

SUZANNE IS HIGH UP ON THE CHURCH PARAPET 
She leaps off - flying down, robe rippling in the stort and crashes down atop the Priest.  
PETYR - tears flowing - kneels at her broken body - and gently takes her hand in his.

					A MAN'S VOICE (UNSEEN)
				(powerfull. booming)
			Petyr Van Abel...!

PETYR looks up - and races away - just as the looming church tower sways - and comes crashing
down...

INT.  DIEDRE'S ROOM.  LATE NIGHT

CARLOTTA and ROWAN appear in the doorway.

					CARLOTTA
			This was her room.

ROWAN cocks her head and sniffs.  She gags...

					ROWAN
			My god...

She approaches the brass bed - its leather restraints hanging loose, its grimy, stained 
mattress is bare.

					ROWAN
			You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.

					CARLOTTA
			She didn't feel them

					ROWAN
				(through gritted teeth)
			You're a monster.

CARLOTTA is at a window, pointing to the patio below.

					CARLOTTA
			Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the 
			stones. Head split open like a melon.

					ROWAN
			Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!

					CARLOTTA
				(turns and looks ROWAN over)
			You have the Mayfair eyes.  (pause) Tell me, Rowan --- 
			what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?

Their eyes 1ock.  The lamp's flame dances in the BREEZE.

					CARLOTTA
				(knowing. chilling) 
			He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.

					ROWAN
				(really spooked now. a beat)
			'He'...?

					CALOTTA
				(reading her mind) 
			And on the plane - he touched you!

					ROWAN
				(stunned. off-balance)
			Shut up!

					CARLOTTA
			Lasher touched you and you loved it.

					ROWAN
			It wes a dream...!

					CARLOTTA
			Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - 
			and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!

					ROWAN
			Stop it!

					CARLOTTA
			Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.

					ROWAN
			ENOUGH!!!

ROWAN slams the wall.  Her fury rises.  Trembling.  CARLOTTA suddenly flinches.  A hand to her 
forehead.  A deep breath.

					CARLOTTA
			Ahhh...  You are strong.

ROWAN starts for the door.  CARLOTTA shuffles after her.

					CARLOTTA
			Save your anger for him!  Let it keep you strong - 
			as I have   I've fought his all my life...  used my 
			power and anger to turn him away!  (pause) Diedre 
			was not so strong.  That is why I kept your mother a 
			morphined, mindless shadow.

ROWAN freezes at the door - and turns back to CARLOTTA.

					CARLOTTA
			And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones -
			even as she had him inside her...

					ROWAN
			You're mad!  Your mind is sick!

					CARLOTTA
			...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster.  
			To kill the legacy!  (pause)  you are the sum of his desires -

					ROWAN
				(a hateful hiss) 
			You - are - a - murderer.

					CARLOTTA
				(a beat. a chilling grin)
			But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.
				(ROWAN stands frozen)
			Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?

BULLSEYE.  ROWAN steps back in horror.  The curtains flutter.  ROWAN backing up, unsteady, down
the hall.  Furious. Haunted.  CARLOTTA advancing  something falls OC.  CRASH!

					ROWAN
			No!  You're wrong!  you're wrong!

She has backed up to the staircase.  She trips aver the cat YOWL - and grabs the bannister.  
CARLOTTA comes face to face.

					CARLOTTA
			Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you 
			could do...?

					ROWAN
				(erupting. out of control)
			I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -

CARLOTTA suddenly winces-  Eyes squeezing shut in pain.

					ROWAN
			- twisted -
				(a jagged moan from CARLOTTA)
			- vicious !  You vile, old -

CARLOTTA'S hands fly to her head.  Her cane topples and RAT-TA-TAT'S down the staircase.  She 
wobbles - equilibrium going...  ROWAN comes out of her blind fury and grabs her.

					ROWAN
			Oh my god...  I - I ---  (pause) Are you alright...?
				(shakes CARLOTTA)
			Carlotta...?  Carlotta!!

And CARLOTTA - wounded, stunned - slowly opens her eyes.

					CARLOTTA
			You're more dangerous than I knew... You're strength will make 
			him more than he has ever been.
				(cold. piercing)
			I should have killed you.

ROWAN, releases her - pierced, rocked by the words. And she races down the stairs into darkness

					CARLOTTA
			I SHOULD HAVE KILLED YOU WHEN YOU WHERE BORN!!!

WHACK!  The door to Diedre's room SLAMS shut.  CARLOTTA whirls round toward it.  The WIND 
MOANS.

ON THE FIRST FLOOR LANDING - AT TNE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS 
ROWAN freezes in her tracks at the sounds.

BACK ON THE SECOND FLOOR
A gust of WIND whips at CARLOTTA'S dress.  She grabs the bannister for support.  A piercing 
WHISTLE in the WIND. CARLOTTA winces.  Grabs her head.  The cat MEOWS.

					CARLOTTA
			So it's now- when I'm weakened.. (pause)  you wretched obscenity...

Blood trickles from her nose and mouth.  An inner cataclysm jolts her - her grip slips - she 
topples down the stairs...

ON THE FIRST FLOOR LANDING - THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS
ROWAN is frozen.  KATUNK-KATUNK-KATUNK... -  out of the DARK, CARLOTTA tumbles down the stairs 
to ROWAN'S feet.

ROWAN stares wide-eyed  - then quickly kneels beside CARLOTTA, grabbing her limp wrist, 
checking for a pulse. She puts her ear to CARLOTTA's chest...  she's dead.  ROWAN stares in 
horror --- then something shifts in her face. Something unknowable suddenly known.  Suddenly 
believed.

					ROWAN
			You're here.

SILENCE.  She walks slowly down the hall past the portraits.  Stopping with her back to a huge 
mirror in an ornate frame.

					ROWAN
			I know you're here.  (pause)  You killed her, didn't you...  (pause)
			Come out, you bastard!

Behind her, in the mirror - a foggy phantasm drifts across the glass - and is gone.  ROWAN 
looks down.  At her feet is the emerald pendant.  She picks it up.  OC, down the hall - the 
TINKLE-TINKLE-TINKLE of glass. ROWAN walks into

THE LIVING ROOM
Dust and decay.  Cracked leather chairs.  A chadelier of a hundred cut-glass pieces.  Does it 
sway slightly...?

					ROWAN
			What did she call you --- Lasher...?

She whirls round. There in the corner -
the shimering, transparent specter - handsom, angular.  Rowan is stunned - but still.  They eye
each other.

					ROWAN
			What are you...?

The specter flickers - and disappears.  Sfle dashes to where it was...  And then --- hands are 
clutching; her from behind.  She SHRIEKS --- she is twisted round --- and she looks into 
MICHAEL'S face - and violently clings to him.

					MICHAEL
			What is it...?! Tell me!

She tries to find words.  suddenly - her head swivels from here to there - looking round the
room...

					ROWAN
			There's something - someone --- here.

He stiffens - and glances round the room

					MICHAEL
			Where's Carlotta...?

ROWAN shivers - and slowly, she points to the hall. He takes her hand.  she's like a mule. 
holding her ground.  He has to pull her with him, out into

THE DARK HALL
and down to the foot of the stairs. There lies CARLOTTA.  MICHAEL stares drop-jawed.

					MICHAEL
			Jesus christ...
				(a beat)
			was it --- a man...?

					ROWAN
				(stunned)
			But how did - how could you ---

From the DARK at the top of the stairs - FFFTT-FFFTT-FFFTT. They freeze, and peer into the 
BLACKNESS. FFFTT-FFFTT...  MICHAEL picks up CARLOTTA's cane.  names it high. It's coming down 
the steps...  closer...  And -  something LEAPS out at that trot the DARK...

					ROWAN
			Michael...!

MICHAEL swings lethally - and the cat soars past him - YEEOWWLLL! - and scampers away. They 
both exhale with spent fear - and look at each other.

					ROWAN
				(a long beat)
			You know...?
	
					MICHAEL
				(a slow nod)
			I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.

A long beat.  ROWAN is starting to tremble. She looks down at CARLOTTA'S crumpled body.

					ROWAN
			She - she said I - I was a ---

					MICHAEL
			- a witch.

ROWAN looks back up at hit --- and nods.

INT. THE  MAYFAIR MANSION PORCH.  AN HOUR LATER.

ROWAN sits hollow-eyed in the rocking chair.  MICHAEL stands behind her, his gloved  hands on
her shoulders.

					ROWAN
				(quiet astonishment)
			A whole town...?

Me nods gravely.  He starts to pace, desperate for legic.

					MICHAEL
			It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -

					ROWAN
			Michael - I saw him!  Twice!
				(a long beat. very softly)
			Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.

					MICHAEL
			Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with 
			their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.

					ROWAN
				(an eyebrow arches)
			Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with 
			hands that can see...?
				(that silences him. a beat)
			God, Michael --- what am I...?

A CORONER comes out the front door with GIFFORD.  PARAMEDICA carry a body bag out toward an 
ambulance.  GIFFORD walks to ROWAN and MICHAEL.  They watch the ambulance pull away.

					GIFFORD
				(sighs. somber)
			Likely a stroke.  (pause)  we all got used to 
			thinking she'd live forever.  (pause)  Well - 
			she made it clear   No ceremony, just cremation. 
			pause)  Diedre. . now Carl...  (pause) You get some 
			sleep now.  Both of you.

He kisses ROWAN - and he walks off toward a Cadillac at the curb.  A long beat.  MICHAEL takes 
ROWAN by the hand.

					MICHAEL
			C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---

					ROWAN
				(jabs a finger at the house)
			He's in there!
				(whirls to the garden) 
			Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, 
			goddamnit...?!

MICHAEL grabs her firmly - and shakes her.

					MICHAEL
			Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch!   
			It's 1992, Rowan!

					ROWAN
				(her shoulders sag)
			But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?

He hesitates - and takes her by the hand. TRACK with them as they go down the walk and -  HOLD
on the swinging gate as they walk OUT OF FRAME.  TRACK back along the walk, up the steps, to 
the motionless rocking chair, where the cat has curled up.  The chair starts to rock.  
RRMMFF-SQUEAK-RRMMMFF...

INT. THE OPERATING ROOM IN ROWAN'S DREAM

ROWAN works feverishly on an OUT OF FRAME patient. The MASKED FIGURES watch silently.  ROWAN 
throws her hands up in despair, her confidence failing.

					ROWAN
			I - I can't do it!

The FIGURES urge her on - imploring, encouraging her.

					ROWAN
				(pointing OUT OF FRAME  frantic) 
			But look!  LOOK!  How can I do it...?

OC - a muffled CRY.  TILT DOWN SLOWLY - the edge of the operating table comes INTO FRAME - and
on it, a tiny hand...

ROWAN IS A HOTEL ROOM
writhing in a bed.  It is MORNING.  She screams -

					ROWAN
			LOOK!

MICHAEL lunges INTO FRAME. grabbing her, shaking her.  She shoots up  wide-eyed, sweaty, 
haunted...

					ROWAN
			I had it again.  I can't save it - I don't know what to do...

INT.  THE TALAMASCA GALLERY

ROWAN sits at the desk, the Talamasca manuscript opened to the last page.  MICHAEL stands 
staring at Julien's portrait.  ARRON refills ROWAN'S coffee cup - and nods...

					AARON
			Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to 
			me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.

					ROWAN
			Then what is he...?

					AARON
			A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes 
			our definition of existence.

					MICHAEL
			A what...?

					AARON
			A spirit.  Perhaps evil...  (to ROWAN) ...and he has come to you- 
			with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.

Both Men stare at her.

					ROWAN
			Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren 
			chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic 
			whim!  I am in charge of my life -
				(a long heat. resolved. firm)
			- and I want to stay.
				(MICHAEL does a double-take)
			Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael.  
			All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless.  
			I should have been here.

					MICHAEL
				(coming to her) 	
			Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last 
			night!
		        
					ROWAN
			I am! (a sad grin)  And so are you. (pause) You 
			thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. 
			pause)  Michael, if you don't want -

He silences her with a finger on her lips.  A long beat.

					ROWAN
			Do you love me, Michael...?

					MICHAEL
			Yes.  I love you.  Very much.

					ROWAN
			I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - 
			with you.

A long beat.  MICHAEL glances at AARON. AARON shrugs.

					AARON
			Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind.  
			He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography 
			seems irrelevant now.

					ROWAN
			Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could 
			work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the 
			horror.  And Lasher with it!

MICHAEL eyes her.  Thinking.  Intrigued in spite of his fear.

					MICHAEL
			It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.

					ROWAN
				(a sly grin)
			I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.

A long beat.  They look at each other with loving eyes.

INT. ROWAN AND MICHAEL'S HOTEL ROOM. LATE NIGHT.

MICHAEL and ROWAN' lie still in each other's arms.  A beat.

					MICHAEL
			What about your work back home...?

					ROWAN
			They need doctors in New Orleans too. (pause)  Michael - think what 
			I could do with the money!

MICHAEL frowns begrudgingly.  He rises, walks to the window and lights a cigarette.  staring at
the night. she watches him.  He sends a stream of smoke out the window.  Finally:

					MICHAEL
			You really felt him - inside you...?

She comes up behind him.  Her hands slip round his waist.

					ROWAN
			It was like a dream.  It wasn't real.

					MICHAErL
			But it wasn't a dream.  And he is real.

She takes his face in her hands - and shakes her head.

					ROWAN
			This is real.

And she kisses him deeply.

DISSOLVE TO

EXT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION GARDEN.  A WEEK LATER - DAY

STU - hands on hips, a suitcase at his feet - and MICHAEL in overalls and gloves - look up at 
the decayed Mansion.

					STU,
			Didn't I see this thing in psycho...?

					MICHAEL
			Just call me Norman.

					STU
			Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this 
			one being finished for a lonnnnng time.
				(MICHAEL grins)
			How are the hands...?

					MICHAEL
			The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn 
			to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.

BZZZZ. Something flying round their heads.  STU, swats at it.

					MICHAEL
			'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father 
			ever teach you that...?

					STU
				(swats again)
			That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  
			(pause) so - where is she...?

MICHAEL jabs a thumb toward the house.

					STU
				(an old Jewish Man accent)
			You found a nice doctor.  Tank Gott. She makes a nice 
			living, Mikey...?

And out the front door comes ROWAN - jeans and t-shirt, hair tied back.  STU starts, 
beauty-stunned, wide-eyed.

					STU
			Wow...

					MICHAEL
				(blase)
			If you like that type.

					ROWAN
				(sticks her hand out with a smile)
			Rowan Mayfair.

					STU
			Sut McKinley. (strightfaced) Marry me.

					ROWAN
				(her smile widens)
			I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?

					STU
				(a deflated frown)
			You really love this guy...?

					ROWAN
				(links her arm in MICHAEL'S) 
			He's got great hands.

					STU
			Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.

					ROWAN
				(appraises STU)
			I like him.  He can stay.

STU, smiles, and bows.  MICHAEL hands him a sheet of paper.

					MICHAEL
			These are the best guys around. Double up on the carpenters.  
			(to ROWAN) Let us examine the patient, Doctor.

STU grins - and ROWAN and MICHAEL head for the house. 

INT. THE MANSION - A HALLWAY. DAY

ROWAN watches as MICHAEL snaps off a rotted floor plank. He looks over the exposed joists with 
expert eyes.

INT. THE MANSION - A BATHROOM. DAY

MICHAEL inspects the studs behind a cracked plaster wall. ROWAN leans in and blows hard.  
Plaster-dust flies into MICHAEL'S face.  He lunges for her and she scoots away.

INT. THE SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY. DAY

MICHAEL and ROWAN, mucked up and dusty, walk along.

ANGEL - A TRACKING POV
from behind them - coming up swiftly --- BZZZZ-PTIT-BZZZZ-PTIT - and zipping past them and HOLD
on a DOORWAY as they arrive there. It is Diedre's room.  SILENCE.  MICHAEL sticks his head in.

					MICHAEL
			This is her room...?

They walk inside.  We've not seen it in the light.  Frayed dolls on a shelf.  A bowl of 
tarnished jacks.  A doll house.

					ROWAN
				(melancholy smile)
			The closest I'll ever get to her...

She turns to an antique toy chest, raises the cover.  CREAK. 

					ROWAN
			Oh Michael, look!

He reaches down and lifts out a marionette by the wooden slats.  It dangles on its strings.  He
flicks his hand - the marionette does a jig.  ROWAN'S eyes have welled with tears.

					ROWAN
			I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.

					MICHAEL
				(watches her. a beat) 
			Let's see.

Her face creases in contusion - then widens in understanding-.
					
					ROWAN
			You sure...?

					MICHAEL
				(nods with a smile)
			It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?

She melts with love.  MICHAEL tugs the glove off his free hand with his teeth, reaches out - 
and grasps the marionette. A FLASK OF WRITE...INTO

INT. DIEDRE'S ROOM [AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE] 
Forty years of decay have vanished.  DIEDRE  - 7, in pink jumpers - on the floor on her knees. 
She holds the marionette suspended by its slats.

					MICHAEL'S VOICE
			She's - she' beautiful Ro. (pause)  Can you hear me...? (pause)	she's 
			six, maybe seven. An ear to ear grin.  Ro, she's so -

The marionette starts to dance wildly - but DIEDRE'S hands are motionless.  The marionette 
dances by itself.  Suddunly - LASHER is leaning over her shoulder.  He puffs his cheeks -
and blows.  The marionette does a jig.  DIEDRE giggles...

					LASHER
				(a loving whisper)
			I love you.. .

He kisses her softly.  Then - LASHER looks up, straight ro CAMERA (to MICHAEL) - and smiles...

BACK TO MICHAEL AND ROWAN
as MICHAEL drops the marionette.  ROWAN darkens with concern.

					MICHAEL
				(musters a smile)
			I'm okay.  (pause)  Could you hear me...?

ROWAN nods slowly - trying to read him.  He takes her hands.

					MICHAEL
			She was the happiest mop-top you've ever seen.  With a wonderfnl smile.

She hugs him tightly - and doesn't see his smile disappear.

EXT. THE MAYFAIR MASION. A FEW DAYS LATER	

The house is changing.  WORKMEN everywhere.  Scaffolding rises to the roof.  The sweet 
cacophony of construction.

INT. THE MANSION - THE MAIN HALL.  THE SAME TIME

ROWAN opens the front door.  In marches BEATRICE with a basket.  GIFFORD follows with a 
brightly-wrapped package.

					BEATRICE
			Make way for the welcome wagon, darling. We're here to raise some hell.

She starts unpacking the basket:  Bourbon, soda-water, crabs, lobsters, plates and utensils.  
ROWAN watches with a smile.

					BEATRICE
			I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're 
			shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.

					ROWAN
				(straight-faced)
			He made that quite clear, yes.

					BEATRICE
			Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?

GIFFORD grunts, and offers the package to ROWAN She goes at the wrapping. Opens the box - and 
peeks inside.  Her smile widens.  She pulls out a gold saw, screwdriver and hammer.

					BEATRICE
			Aren't they gauche...?  (pause) Those steel things are so - common.

					ROWAN
				(deadpan)
			Nothing worse than a common tool.

MICHAEL comes down the stairs - covered with grime.

					MICHAEL
			There he is!

MICHAEL sees the group -   and gets a good looking-over as he arrives.

					ROWAN
			Everyone - this is Michael curry.

					MICHAEL
			Hello..

					ROWAN
			Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---

					BEATRICE
				(taking MICHAEL by the arm)
			Never mind them - you handsome, dirty man.
				(starts leading him off)
			I'm going to tell you my darkeet secrets.  then - if you can still speak - 
			you can tell me yours.

MICHAEL looks over his shoulder at ROWAN with a grin as he is led away.

EXT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION - THE PORCH. LATER THAT AFTERNOON

GIFFORD sits rocking while MICHAEL shoots a bourbon with soda and gives it to him.  BEATRICE
and ROWAN stroll in the garden in the BG.  WORKERS move IN and OUT OF FRAME.  GIFFORD takes a 
long slug of his drink.

					GIFFORD
			The Mayfair women have always ruled the roost.  The men pour the 
			bourbon - but the women buy it   (grins)  No one seems to comp1ain 
			though.


					MICHAEL
			I don't drink.

					GIFFORD
			Wc all have our faults.

ROWAN AND BEATRICE STROLLING IN THE GARDEN

					BEATRICE
			Deedee came home middle of freshman year --- pregnant.  well --- they 
			sent for the father - your father... some assistant professor...but he 
			died in a car wreck on the way - near Nashville...
				(glances at ROWAN'S shock)
			You didn't know...?

ROWAN somberly shakes her head NO.

					BEATRICE
			Carl was set on an abortion - but Julien wouldn't hear of it.  (smiles)
			Quite a man, your great grandfather.  He truly adored Deedee.  Truly.
				(a beat)
			Day you were born. Carl announced Ellie was taking you away.  
			Julien had a fit. But Carl won. (sighs)  Life just swallowed Deedee 
			up after that.

ROWAN stands silent.  BEATRICE links her arm in ROWAN'S.

					BEATAICE
			Listen, darling - I figure you hear it all now, shed your tears, then you 
			pour yourself a big drink of this life - and bottoms up.

She smiles warmly.  They Look toward the porch and the men.

					BEATRICE
			You two sees like a perfect fit. (pause)  Only two mounths...?

					ROWAN
			Mm-hmm.  (pause)  Seems & lot longer.

					BEATRICE
			In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the 
			dance - but fortune picks your partner.'  (pause) Darling, I'd say you're 
			on a roll.

EXT. NEW ORLEANS - THE FRENCH QUARTER. EVENING

MICHAEL and ROWAN stroll down a cobblestoned street, past old terraced buildings.  Musics melt
together as they go into

THE PLAZA DE ARMS
A large manicured park.  A statue - Andrew Jackson on a rearing-horse - stares down at them.
MICHAEL seems far away.

					ROWAN
			You're thinking about him.

					MICHAEL
			I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.

					ROWAN
			He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a
			crack in it.  He can't find a way in.

					MICHAEL
			Maybe he's just - waiting...

					ROWAN
			If we married, we'd shut him out forever.

Their eyes lock.  Then MICHAEL sits on the grass and stares at the statue.  ROWAN kneels beside
him.

					MICHAEL
			Ro, how long have we known each other.

					ROWAN
			I don't think of us that way - ever.

					MICHAEL
				(grins. a beat)
			Either do I.  (pause)  I love you, Ro.  You know that.  
			You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. (pause
			You gave me back my life.

					ROWAN
			Than letts get rnarried, Michael.
				(a beat. grins wickedly)
			I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.

MICHAEL gives her an "Is that so...?" look.  He pushes her down in the grass, holding her down
by the wrists.

					MICHAEL
			NO, I won't marry you.  (grins) Well, go on --- do your stuff.

She grins - and peers at him with one eye closed.

					ROWAN
			come clo-o-o-o-o-ser...

MICHAEL leans all the way down to her.  she whispers in his ear.  His eyebrows go up --- and 
up...

					MICHAEL
			You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?

					ROWAN
				(a wicked, sexy grin)
			No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.

Their smiles bloom and they sink into a lonnnng, deeeep kiss.

INT. MAYFAIR AND MAYFAIR LAW FIRM - A CONFERENCE ROOM.  DAY

ROWAN, RYAN and GIFFORD, sit around the table, smiling

					ROWAN
			Soon.  We haven't decided.  A tew weeks...?

					GIFFORD
			Wonderful! (chuckles)  New Orleans air.  It makes folks want to mate.

					RYAN
			We'd better get to work on the papers.

					ROWAN
			Papers...?

					RYAN
			Standard for a Mayfair marriage.
				(ROWAN frowns)
			Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair 
			assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from 
			the other party... Michael  that is it's in the 
			will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.  (pause)  
			of course, future earnings from your practice will not 
			fall into -

					ROWAN	
				(taking command)
			I've decided not to open a practice here (pause) I 
			want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic 
			disorder.

RYAN and GIFFORD glance at each other.  Interesting...

					RYAN
			That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into 
			that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies.  
			we could -

					ROWAN
			No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - 
			exclusively. (pause) The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.
				(RYAN turns a little green)
			I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately 
			- while we draw up plans for new construction.

					RYAN
				(a beat. slowly leans forward) 
			That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.

					ROWAN
			I plan on liquidating almost evetything.

Knock RYAN over with a feather.  GIFFORD chuckles walks to a sideboard and pours himself a 
drink.

					ROWAN
			We'll put something aside for me and Michael - in both our names. 
			(pause) The rest goes to the clinic.

RYAN stares balefully.  GIFFORD raises his glass.

					GIFFORD
			A toast:	To the birth of a marriage - 
				(glances with a grin at RYAN)
			- and the death of tradition.

EXT. THE NEW ORLEANS WATERFRONT.  DAY

AARON and MICHAEL stroll past a saxophonist on the pier. A riverboat cruises down the muddy 
mississippi.

					ARRON
			When I was six, r visited my mother in a hospital ward -  and the 
			beating of hearts almost knocked me over. I could feel the 
			mechanisms of life, Michael - and it terrified me.   (pause) The 
			Talamasca  taught me how to find my center.  That's the first thing 
			we learn --- all of us with gifts.

They turn now into

JACKSON SQUARE
Artists doing portraits, fortune tellers, clowns, jugglers.  Soft jazz comes from behind 
shadowed, filigreed balconies.

					AARON
			It's about fear, Michael.  Fear is the loss of an anchor.  You must find 
			your place amongst everything.  Then the fear will leave - and then 
			you can decide what gets in - and what doesn't.

					MICHAEL
			No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?

					AARON
			There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  
			(pause) what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors 
			your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?

					MICHAEL
				(a beat)
			Rowan.
			
					AARON
			Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define 
			you. (pause)  Take off your gloves, Michael.

AARON stops at an old, iron hitching post with a horse's head at the top, embedded in the 
sidewalk. MICHAEL hesitates - and takes his gloves off.

					AARON
			Now - do you want to let anything in...? 
				(a beat. MICHAEL shakes his head)
			Then don't. (pause)  Touch it. Michael.

MICHAEL takes a deep breath - stretches his hand out and touches the post.  A long beat.  He 
sighs in relief.  They look at each other - and AARON nods warmly.

INT. THE MANSION - MICHAEL AND ROWAN'S ROOM.  NIGHT

ROWAN - in a robe - sits on the bed, brushinq her hair. MICHAEL - in pajamas - watches, and 
lights a cigatatte.

					ROWAN
			Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.

					MICHAEL
			Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking.
			one crutch at a time, Doctor.

She scowls.  He stubs out the cigarette - takes the brush and starts brushing her hair.

					MICHAEL
			You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.

					ROWAN
			And I thought I was the mindreader.


					MICHAEL
				(grins. a beat)
			I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -
				(she whirls round) 
			- and it was okay.

					ROWAN
			That's GREAT!

					MICHAEL
				(the wistful grin)
			Guess so.  (pause)  I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... 
			down there (pause)   There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They 
			said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing 
			it that way, y'know...?

He scratches at his cleft.  She grins lovingly...

					ROWAN
			Why do I love when you do that. - -?

She pushes his gloved hana away - and rubs his cleft atfectionately with her finger.  She 
grins.

					ROWAN
			Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or 
			their courage or their beneficence -

					MICHAEL
			Their what...?

					ROWAN
			So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?

She gives him a kiss.

					MICHAEL
			Wanna snack...?

					ROWAN
			A little wine...?

And he leaves.  ROWAN smiles to herself - and starts brushing her hair.  She picks up a hand
mirror to see the results... LASHER'S face locks back at her, just over her sholder. She jumps
a mile - whirls round...  There is no one there. She slowly looks back to the mirror - there is
his reflection again, with his melancholy smile.  Her face hardens.

					LASHER
			I am with you.  (pause)  You yearn to know me - so I am with you.
			you call me --- and I love you all the more for that.
				(gentle. poignant)
			I know how the desert flower feels when it drinks of the rain.

ROWAN is motionless, entranced by his words, by the music of his voice.  Translucent hands seep
out of the mirror and frame her face. caressing her.

					LASHER
			You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?

					ROWAN
			Lie...?

					LASHER
			There are things you will not tell him.

She raises an eyebrow.  He strokes her.  Her eyes close in sensual contentment.  Spectral 
fingers caress a breast...

					ROWAN
			Michael is healing.  If I hide things from him - it's because love him.

LASHER takes this in.  Does he smile...?

					LASHER
			Then you will lie to him about me - won't you...?

ROWAN'S eyes snap open - narrowed in anger.  Heating up from within.  Focused on the mirror. 
Suddenly the glass SHATTERS - piece falling to the floor.

					LASHER'S VOICE
			You grow stronger...

And a spectral image of MICHAEL rises in slivers from the scattered chards - 1ike a shredded, 
willowy phantom.

					LASHER'S VOICE (IN MICHAEL'S FORM)
			Can he make you feel as I do...?

MICHAEL COMES THROUGH THE DOORWAY
with a sandwich and a glass of wine.  And LASHER is gone.

					MICHAEL
				(chewing. bad French accent)
			A chardonnay, mademoiselle - pleasantly mild, but pretentious.

ROWAN stares at him - between two worlds.  He sees the shattered glass - and comes to her.  Her
hand is bleeding.

					MICHAEL
			Hey - you're bleeding.

					ROWAN
				(fuzzy. hollow) 
			Dropped it.

MICHAEL grabs a tissue - and starts to wrap her hand.

INT. THE MANSION.   A ROOM.  THE NEXT MORNING

MICHAEL - in wedding attire - tries to do his tie with gloved fingers. STU pushes MICHAEL'S 
hands away and starts tying it.

					STU
			You okay...?

					MICHAEL
			Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.   (pause)  Got the rings...?

					STU,
			what rings...?

MICHAEL shoots him a look - just to make sure he's kidding.

					MICHAEL
			Get out of here.  I'm gonna have my final cigarette.  I promised 
			Ro I'd quit.

STU pats him affectionately on the cheek --- and leaves.

MICHAEL lights up a smoke  closes his eyes - takes a deep drag - and exhales.  The thick smoke
floats in the air... and it coats LASHER'S translucent form - making him visible. standing 
inches in front of MICHAEL.  LASHER blows gently at the smoke - and it floats back toward 
MICHAEL'S face...

MICHAEL opens his eyes --- LASHER is gone.  MICHAEL puts on his coat - and walks out...

INT. THE MANSION - ROWAN AND MICHAEL'S ROOM.  SAME TIME

ROWAN stands in her wedding gown.  BEATRICE - in a gold dress - adjusts ROWAN'S cleavage to a 
more daring angle.

					BEATRICE
			Always give the crovd a taste, darling.
				(reaches to the jewelry box)
			Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -

					ROWAN
				(suddenly cold)
			I don't want it.

BEATRICE opens the box and takes out the emerald pendant.

					BEATRICE
				(mimicking RYAN'S somber tone)
			'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an 
			her wedding day.'
				(deadpan)
			We should all have to suffer such burdens.

					ROWAN
			Then you wear it.

					BEATRICE
			C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.

And she fastens it round ROWAN'S neck.  The jewel gleams.  ROWAN scowls at herself in the 
mirror...  KNOCK-KNOCK. BAETRICE turns to the door with a frown.

					BEATRICE
			Nobody's supposed to see the -

					AARON (OC)
			May I - come in...?

AARON opens the door and steps inside.  His smile blooms.

					AARON
			The most beautiful Mayfair of all. (pause}  They're almost ready.

BEATRICE turns to ROWAN - and her eyes well up.

					BEATRICE
			God bless this day, darling.

She gives ROWAN a hug and leaves. AARON takes ROWAN'S hands in his.

					AARON
			Thank you for this honor, my dear.

					ROWAN
				(a warm smile)
			You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting
			you give one af us away.

					AARON
			I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.

Her smile broadens - and her cheeks redden.

					AARON
			Ah, the perfect touch.  A blushing bride.

And she kisses him on the cheek.

EXT. THE MAYIAIR GARDEN. LATER THAT MORNING

It has been done up to extravagant perfection. The guests are seated - RYAN, GIFFORD and dozens
of others.  MICHAEL and ROWAN stand before a MINISTER.  STU, and BEATRICE are just off to the
side. A STRING QUARTET is beneath a banana tree   A ring glistens on ROWAN's finger.  she 
slides a ring on MICHAEL'S finger.

					ROWAN
			I do.

					MINISTER
			Then - in the eyes of God and his creations, you are husband 	
			and wife.

The lovers embrace in a kiss.  The MUSIC starts. ROWAN hurls a bouquet - then whirls to MICHAEL
and embraces him...so neither see the WIND catch the flowers - and take them far up into the 
sky...

EXT. THE MAYFAIR GROUNDS - LATE MORNING

A gaggle of Mayfairs in their party best.  Kids dart between grownups' legs.  Backs are 
slapped.  Glasses are drained.

ANOThER CORNER OF THE PORCH
ARRON listens as GIFFORD - drunk - rmbles on between gulps of bourbon.  The cat sits in his 
lap. MICHAEL and ROWAN stand off to the side, listening.

					GIFFORD
			Turn over a rich southern family and you find wackos - right..?  Well, 
			with the Mayfairs, more than one wanted to be a witch.  Yup.  A witch.

A hand smacks the back of GIFFORD'S head.  It's BEATRICE

					BEATRICE
			You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.

					GIFFORD
			I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody 
			did. (chuckles)  They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich"
			- worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 
			'bringing them all back through a door...'

					BEATRICE
			Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!  (pause)  witches!

					GIFFORD
			Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a 
			few of us called her a witch!

LAUGHTER from the CROWD.  ARRON glances at ROWAN and MICHAEL - who listen silent and 
expressionless.

					GIFFORD
			Ever taken a good look at the portraits...?

GIFFORD rises with the cat - and they all follow him inside.

INT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION - THE MAIN HALL.  MOMENTS LATER

GIFFORD, cat in his arms, has led the group to the portraits.

					GIFFORD
			See that...?

In each portrait, a Mayfair stands an the foreground and in the background - at each painting
- sometimes clear, sometimes partially hidden - is a keyhole-shaped door.

					GIFFORD
			Every one of  'em - in front of one of those doors.  See...?  
			They believed it!

The cat suddenly HISSES and dives out of GIFFORD'S arms.

ROWAN
eyes the paintings - and takes MICHAEL'S hand in hers.

					GIFFORD
				(raises his glass) 
			A toast to Rowan and Michael. May they always drink of 
			love and always love to drink!

And he drinks as LAUGHTER fills the hall. 

INT. THE MANSION - THE SECOND FLOOR HALL.  LATER	

GIFFORD walks drunkenly down the empty hall.

FROM BEHIND HIM - A TRACKING SHOT
zooms up and past him - BZZZZZ-KPIT...  And he walks into

DIEDRE'S ROOM
New studs and sheetrock are up-  The cat wanders in.

					GIFFORD
				(strolls, bourbon-mellowed)
			Ahh, Deedee.  Fewer and fewer of us left now, hmm...?  (pause)  what 
			happens to the stories when we're all gone...?

Then - he grins - bends down - and rises with the gold saw.

					GIFFORD
			Two hundred bucks for a saw...

He angles the saw so he can see his reflection... And in the gleaming gold surface, he sees A
HELLISH FACE OF SKULL AND BLOODIED FLESH.  His face.

EXT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION. LATER THAT AFTERNOON

As the guests go home, ROWAN and ARRON lean on the porch railing, watching MICHAEL on the 
sidewalk, putting STU in a cab.  A long beat.  Then, ROWAN grins faintly to herself...

					ROWAN
			Yes - I do trust you.

					ARRON
			Your powers are growing. Rowan. I wasn't even that focused.

She looks at him.  Their eyes lock. Her face sobers at what she senses.

					ROWAN
			I have seen him again.  Last night.

					AARON
			But you've not told Michael.

She shakes her head NO.  MICHAEL comes out the door-

					BEATRICE
			Gifford...?!!  (pause)  You seen my big-mouthed drunk of a brother...? 
			(shrugs)  Probably stumbling home, propositioning the fire hydrants.
				(hugs ROWAN tightly)
			Safe trip, darling.  And don't forget to put on the 'Do Not Disturb' sign.

She grins at AARON - and heads down the walk.

					AARON
			Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three 
			hundred years to have it.  (pause) facing him alone...  I don't like -

					ROWAN
				(adamant)
			Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's. (pause)  Aaron, I've seen the 
			pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore. (Pause)  He's not to 
			know.  Swear to me.

AARON stares back. - and finally nods.  they watch MICHAEL walk along the outside of the
wrought-iron fence to the gate, RAT-TA-TAT-TATING with a stick.

					ROWAN
			Aaron - I really could protect him - if...it I had to.

Watching MICHAEL, AARON reaches out and takes her hand. 

EXT.  BAYOU COUNTRY.  LATER THAT AFTERNOON

A small highway-  The late sun filters through the thick, mossy trees on either side.  Water 
shimers in the BG.  A Mercedes coupe zooms INTO FAME! and speeds away.

INSIDE THE CAR
ROWAN is at the wheel, with MICHAEL beside her.

					MICHAEL
				(starts singing. softly) 
			I'm going back someday, come what may - to Blue Bayou.  where the -

					ROWAN
				(growls out Creedence Clearwater)
			'My pappy said 'Girl. don't let the man git ya - and do what he 
			done to me - caus. he'll git ya!
				(drums the wheel)
			Born on a bayou, Bhorn on a byyyyy-yooooo!'

MICHAEL leans back and appraises her.  Gives her an I'rn impressed nod.  And she turns - and 
gives him a wink.

INT. THE NEWLYWEDS' HOTEL ROOM.  THAT NIGHT
MICHAEL, in silk pajama slacks, and his gloves, sits on the edge ot the bed-  ROWAN stands 
before him in a sheer robe.  Cool, seductive.  She unties the robe's sash, and it slips to the
floor.  The moonlight washes over her body.

					ROWAN
				(soft. but al,ost.a command)
			I'm yours now - completely...  I want your touch.  (pause)  Try, 
			Michael.  Don't let anything else in.

Her face shines with passion and power.  She peels his gloves off - places his hands on her - 
and buries his face against her.  He hesitates, then starts exploring her with his hands.

She pushes him back onto the bed.  A slow, sexual ballet begins - and escalates.  she straddles
him - and mounts him.  Gazing down at him, she slides into a slow, thick rhthym.  Her eyes 
close.  A MOAN slips from her.

					ROWAN
			Yes, Michael.  Harder--.
				(MICHAEL shifts into a faster gear) 
			More...

					LASHER (UNSEEN)
			Like this...?

She stiffens - her eyes pop open.
LASHER - spectral, his nakedness flickering - appears, wrapped round her trorn behind. His face
against her flushed cheek - his body moving. getting her back into her myths

					LASHER
			I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.

					ROWAN
				(between passion and fear)
			Nooo...  NO!  Stop!

MICHAEL pounds at her harder, hearing only passion in her voice: No for YES,  STOP for DON'T 
STOP.  He can't see LASHER

					ROWAN
				(going through the roof)
			God, no!  Oh god....

LASHER strokes her roughly - perfectly...

					LASHER
			Like no other...

					MICHAEL
			Jesus...

					ROWAN
			STOP!

					LASHER
			Always loved you..

The bodies move like a fierce machine.  ROWAN'S climax takes her to speechlessness...  She 
collapses onto MICHAEL. The lovers lie still and silent.  LASHER is gone.

INT. THE HOTEL ROOM. THE NEXT MORNING

MICHAEL and ROWAN in bed, asleep.  He wakes with a sleepy smile and reaches out to her...  she
wakes with a jolt -

					MICHAEL
			Hi.  I'm Michael curry.  your husband...?

ROWAN focuses on him - getting her bearings...  His hand slides under the covers to her body.
She stops him.

					ROWAN
				(almost hard)
			No.  (softens...)  Not - not now.

She pulls the covers up over her.  His grin shows.

					MICHAEL
			When you get married, I thought the sex stopped after the 
			honeymoon...

She rolls away from him.  He shrugs - and gets out of bed.

ROWAN
opens an eye, listening to him leave.  she closes her eyes...

EXT. THE NEWLYWEDS' BAYOU COTTAGE PATIO.  DAY 

ROWAN lies in a lounge chaise, eyes closed.  She looks under the weather.  MICHAEL sits next to
her, sketching - his eyes dart from his pad to ROWAN.  Deft. quick strokes-

					MICHAEL
			You look a little green.

					ROWAN
				(eyes closed. flat)
			Mm-hmmm...

					MICHAEL
			Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.

					ROWAN
			Mm-hmm...

He grins.  Sketching quickly now, finishing.  He holds up it is a goofy caricature of ROWAN: 
gap-toothed, freckled, cross-eyed, with pigtails going out at angles.

					MICHAEL
			So - you like your portrait...?

ROWAN - eyes closed - gives the slightest of nods.  MICHAEL smiles mischievously.

					MICHAEL
			Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore

					ROWAN
			Mm-hmm...

Suddenly - her eyes pop open.  She shoots up -

					ROWAN
			Alligator...?

MICHAEL grins - lies back down - and closes his eyes.

EXT. A BAYOU GAS STATION IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.  NIGHT

The pumps - old with faded paint.  The 'office' - a weathered shack.  on the porch, an OLD MAN 
sits in the shadows with an accordion, playing an eerie tune.  A funky pick-up truck is parked 
off to the side.  The Mercedes pulls in at the pumps.

INSIDE THE CAR
MICHAEL and ROWAN wait for service.  He honks the horn.

					MICHAEL
			Everybody must be out back sacrificing a virgin to the crocodile 
			god.

He gets out and walks toward the OLD MAN with the accordion, who sits with his back to the car.

					MICHAEL
			Excuse me..
				(taps the OLD MAN on the shoulder) 
			I'm trying to find -

The OLD MAN turns round - half his face is a mass of ancient scars -. thick and deep - winding
all the way down his neck.  MICHAEL reflexively rears back  stunned.  the OLD MAN smiles.

					OLD MAN
			Jesus stopped here once - for directions.

And out of the office comes an ATTENDANT - 50, greasy overalls, a friendly grin.

					ATTENDANT
			Gator got him nice, huh mister...?

MICHAEL stares at the OLD MAN.  And then - the ATTENANT sees the Mercedes.  His eyes widen.

					ATTENDANT
			Jesus St. Cracker!  Look at that beauty!

He walks to the car, circling it, admiring it.  He smiles in at ROWAN.  Two MEN - 30's, jeans 
and t-shirts - come out of the office, and stand, arms folded, staring at the car. The 
ATTENDANT leans in a window, eyeing the car's interior.

					MICHAEL
			We on the right road to the Cajun Kitchen...?

The two MEN get into the pick-up truck and drive off.

					ATTENDANT
			See ya later. boys   (to MICHAEL) Y'know, I buy American - every 
			time.  Hell, it's the right thing to do but nobody ever built a car like 
			them Nazis. (pause)  keep going two miles Kitchen's on the left.

MICHAEL gets in the car.  Turns the ignition - and stares over at the OLD MAN, sitting 
motionless. The ATTENDANT pats the car - and the Mercedes pulls away. The OLD MAN starts 
playtng the slow, soft tune again.

EXT.  A SMALL DARK ROAD.  MINUTES LATER

The Mercedes cruises.  Mossy trees shimmer in the headlights.

INSIDE THE CAR
					
					ROWAN
				(grins. a southern twang)
			Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...

					MICHAEL
				(grins. turns to her) 
			Did you see the old man on the ---

					ROWAN
				(straightening up. eye. widening)
			Michael!

MICHAEL locks back to the road.  The pick-up truck is stopptd in the middle of the road.  
MICHAEL jams on the brakes and skids to a stop.  Then - from outside the window - CLICK.  
MICHAEL turns - and stares down the barre1 of a shotgun held in the hands of grinning MAN # 1.

					MAN # 1
			You two lovebirds wanna step outside...?

MAN # 2  appears at ROWAN'S door - and opens it for her.  ROWAN and MICHAEL exchange looks - 
and step out onto the road, on opposite sides of the car.

					MAN # 2
			I'll bet somebody owns a car like that carries a let o'  cash.

					MAN # 1
			Yup.  Lots.

					MICHAEL
				(simmering. deadpan)
			That's smart thinking.  Tell me - which one of you got to use the brain 
			tonight...?

MAN # l's grin evaporates.  He shoves MICHAEL with the gun.

					MAN # 1
			Give me your wallet, asshole!

MICHAEL glares at him.

					ROWAN
			Michael - give him the money!

MICHAEL digs out his wallet and hands it to MAN # 1.

					MAN # 1
			Now wasn't that easy... ?  You should try harder at being a help, 
			Michael.

					MAN # 2
			That's probably what she, says - "Try harder, Michael."  Right. 
			Sammy.

					MAN # 1
				(a lewd chuckle)
			Yeah.  "Harder. Michael.  Harder."

His words make ROWAN'S eyes widen.  MAN # 2 runs his hand across ROWAN'S cheek.  She stiffens.
He hooks his arm round her neck, drawing her face to him roughly.

					MAN # 2
			That what you tell him, hon...?

					MICHAEL
			Get your goddamn hands -

MAN # 1 slams MICHAEL against the car.  MAN # 2 locks ROWAN in a grubby kiss.  She is solid
stone.  Her eyes focused on MAN # 2 like a gunsight.  Suddenly - he breaks off the kiss - and 
releases her.  Staring at her weirdly.

					MAN # 1
				(laughs)
			Shit, Rollie - she give you a shock...?

MAN # 2 steps back from ROWAN, his face twisting up. wincing.  Something is happening...   
ROWAN glares at him like a beacon.

					MAN # 1
				(his smile fades)
			Rollie. . .?  Hey, man...

MAN # 2 goes down on one knee, hands going to his head. MAN # 1 comes over to him - his alarm
growing-.

					MAN # 1
			Hey - what's witb you, man...?

MAN # 2 groans and falls to the ground. writhing in the glare of the car's headlights, a 
trickle of blood at his nose.  MAN # 1 whirls on ROWAN with the shotgun.

					MAN # 1
			What the fuck's going on...?! what'd you do to him, 
			lady...?!

MICHAEL leaps to the hood - takes MAN # 1 down with a flying tackle - grabs the shotgun and
knocks him cold with the butt.  He whirls to ROWAN -

					MICHAEL
			Get in the car!!
				(ROWAN is entranced)
			Rowan!!!

She's in another world.  He shoves her inside - dives in his side - screeches into reverse, 
does a 180 and speeds away.

INSIDE THE CAR
MICHAEL - freaked - driving like a bat out of hell. ROWAN slumps in her seat, slowly coming 
back.

					MICHAEL
				(revving. blown away)
			Jesus fucking Christ!!!  That was you, wasn't it...?!  ROWAN!
				(she is silent. hazy) 
			But it wasn't like Graham - or Carlotta not blind fury.  This time 
			you controlled it, didn't You...?!!!  Didn't you...?! ROWAN...?!!   
			Goddamnit, ANSWER ME!!!

She slowly turns to him - her face white and haggard.

					ROWAN
				(flat. faraway)
			Yes.

He stares at her - silent in the face of her power.

EXT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION.  LATE NIGHT

The Mercedes pulls up and parks.  MICHAEL gets out, dishevelled, scraped up.  ROWN gets out her
side. They stand there.  Staring at the house.  A long beat.  She's reading his mind.

					ROWAN
			No - I didn't kill him.  (pause) Would you rather I'd let 
			them kill us - after they'd raped me...?

					MICHAEL
				(softly)
			No.  (pause)  This is unreal...

					ROWAN
			It's not some fairytale in an old book.  (pause)  Michael - 
			look at me.
				(he looks at her mutely) 
			I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.
				(deeply. poignantly)
			I love you.

					MICHAEL
			I love you too.

A long beat.  They walk to the dark house and enter.  A light comes on.  STU comes sleepily
down the stairs.

					STU
			What are you doing here...?

They walk past him - silent  exhausted - and step into their room and close the door.

INT.  THE OPERATING ROOM IN ROWAN'S DREAM 

ROWAN works feverishly on an OUT or FRAME patient.  The rnasked FIGURES watching silently. 
ROWAN throws her hands up in despair, her confidence failing.

					ROWAN
			I - I can't do it!

The others urge her on - imploring. encouraging her.

					ROWAN
				(pointing OUT OF FRAME. frantic)
			But look!  LOOK!	How can I do it...?

OC - a muffled CRY.  TILT DOWN slowly - the operating table comes INTO FRAME - and lying on it,
A TINY HAND...  PULL OUT slowly to REVEAL more of the body on the table the tiny hand and an 
arm joined to a ---

ROWAN SUDENLY WAKES IN BED BESIDE MICHAEL 
she tosses the sheets back - and stumbles into the BATHROOM.  She closes the door, kneels at 
the toilet --- and vomits.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP TO

EXT.  THE MAYFAIR GROUNDS.  A WEEK LATER - DUSK

Autumn is browning the foliage.  The mansion renovation shows great progress.  The rain pours
down.

INT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION - THE LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Rain streams down the windows.  ROWAN sits reading as MICHAEL kneels at the fireplace in a 
sweater. muttering, striking matches, trying in vain to start a fire.

					MICHAEL
			Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, 
			the wood, my clothes, my skin.

					ROWAN
			That's cause we're below sea level.

					MICHAEL
				(crabby)
			ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.

					ROWAN
			That's not funny.

He sighs - walks to the window and stares out at the rain, his back to the room.

					MICHAEL
				(sings - half to himself)
			'I left my heart in Ran Sanfisco...

ROWAN glances at the fireplace - with an almost mischievous look.  She focuses on the logs - 
her gaze narrows - as if she is trying to see something that isn't there.  She's going inside 
herseif, summoning up something...  And -

A FLAME
suddenly flicks out from the logs.

ROWAN
intensitiet her stare and --- the logs bursts into flame.  She grins to herself - and buries 
her nose in her book.
	
					MICHAEL
			Ro, what do you think about - about spending Thanksgiving back 
			in -

Turning now, he stops - seeing the blaze.  Huh...?  He does a slow turn to ROWAN - eyeing her
suspiciously.

					MICHAEL
			You did that, didn't you...?
	
					ROWAN
				(looks up innocently)
			Talking to me dear...?

He shrugs - and walks before the fire staring into it.  ROWAN watches him.

					MICHAEL
			Remember the first time we made love - and then ---

					ROWAN
				(smiles)
			- we made a fire.

A beat.  Suddenly her smile drops.  She's read his thoughts.

					ROWAN
				(firm. almost defensive)
			That's not true.

MICHAEL whirls round to her, his back to the fire. 

					MICHAEL
			Stop doing that!  If I've something to say, let me say it - out 
			loud.

ROWAN gives hi: a chastened nod.  A beat.

					MICHAEL
			How can you say it isn't true...?  We're not the same.  Not like we 
			used to be.  (sighs)  You're changing - all the time..

She rises - walks to him - and takes his face in her hands. 

					ROWAN
			Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?

					MICHAEL
				(a beat. straightfaced) 
			Your beneficence.
					
					ROWAN
				(grins)
			I'm serious.  (in earnest)  Whatever it was - it's still there 
			inside me, isn't it - change and all...?

MICHAEL hesitates - and nods.  He slowly grins.

					MICHAEL
			Just do me a favor.  Don't start anymore fires - or turn on the
			lights by blinking - or cook with your hands behind your -

And suddenly -

the blaze silently erupts from the fireplace - becoming a demonic, fiery virsion of LASHER - a
mass of jagged, leaping flames - and hovers over them, unseen by MICHAEL.  ROWAN'S eyes bulge 
- and she wraps her arm. tightly - glaring furiously at the flaming specter. LASHER dissolves 
into a thousand flames - and disappears. MICHAEL separates himself fram her - startled.

					MICHAEL					
			What the hall are you -

And she pulls him back to her - and holds him tight.

					ROWAN
				(shaking with emotion) 
			I love you more than anything in the world, Michael.
				(glances at the room) 
			More than anything.

EXT.  THE MAYFAIR MANSION.  DAY - A WEEK LATER
MICHAEL AND STU are high up on ladders fitting and hammering copper flashing along the eaves.
They don't see ROWAN come through the gate and up the walk.

					MICHAEL
				(singing)
			'There is a house in xew Orleans...'

BZZZZZ...

					MICHAEL & STU
			'...they call the Rising Sun...'

					ROWAN
			I thought it was 'whistle while you work.

					STU
				(looks down)
			Is that a crack about our singing...?

					ROWAN
			Is that what you were doing...?


MICHAEL grins - and goes back to hammering.  WHACK! WHACK!

					ROWAN
				(brimming with excitment)
			Michael, I spoke to the geneticist from Stanford, and she -

And - a rung of MICHAELS ladder cracks.  He falls grabbing at air --- and finally grabs on to
a rung hanging suspended --- twisting.  Nobody breathes and he finally gets his footing.

					MICHAEL
			Goddamn sonuvabitch!

Sighs of relief all around.  He climbs down.  BZZZZZ... 

					ROWAN
			You alright...?

					MICHAEL
			A little sore.  Darm...  (to STU) Finish up my section, will ya...?

STU nods - and leans to the spot where Michael was working.

					MICHAEL
				(to ROWAN)
			You were saying...?

ABOVE THEM - STU POUNDS THE FLASHING
WHACK!  something drops free from beneath the eaves - grey, round - like a huge melon with 
ridges - landing in front of him on the gutter.  BZZZZZZZ...  Two, black antennae wiggle out of
a crack in the sphere...

					STU
				(softly - with realization) 
			Oh shit...

The sphere splits open - and dozens and dozens of WASPS swarm out - a black cloud enveloping 
him... He screams - topples tram the ladder - and lands with THUD. ROWAN and MICHAEL rush to 
him.  STU lies motionless...

INT.  A HOSPITAL ROOM.  EVENING - TWO HOURS LATER

ROWAN and MICHAEL sit at STU'S bedside.  STU sleeps - his arm in a cast - his face and hands 
swollen beyond recognition.  MICHAEL shakes his head sadly, steeped in grief.

					MICHAEL
			Is he - is he gonna die...?

					ROWAN
				(her eyes locked on STU) 
			Lock the door.
				(MICHAEL looks at her - confused)
			Lock it

He rises and locks the door. Then turns and watches, silent.

ROWAN is still.  Her eyes narrow into slits of concentration.  The air seems to shimmer around
her.  She leans to STU - to his grotesque swollen lips.  She closes her eyes - and kisses 
him... STU'S deformed face shimmers - the angry flesh lightens... and slowly, it shrinks back
to his normal visage.

ROWAN' opens her eyes - and slowly turns to MICHAEL, who stands flattened against the wall, 
speechless, amazed.  She turns back to STU, grasps his disfigured hand, brings his fingers to 
her lips - and kisses them., one by one...

INT. THE MANSION - A FIRST FLOOR ROOM.  LATER THAT NIGHT

The room is unfinished.  There is a bed and a dresser.  MICHAEL sits on the bed, staring at the
floor.  ROWAN - in a robe - sits beside him.

					ROWAN
			It was an accident.
				(MICHAEL raises a skeptical eyebrow) 
			Michael - there isn't a house in New Orleans this old that doesn't
			have a wasp's nest somewhere.

He stares at her - unconvinced.  She tries for logical -

					ROWAN
			Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?

					MICHAEL
			I don't know.

He lies back and turns off the light. DARKNESS.  She lies beside him, reaches out and finds his
hand.  A long beat.

					MICHAEL
			You changed him, Rowan.  You went right down to each cell - and 
			changed him.

They lie there silently.

INT. THE BEDROOM. LATER THAT NIGHT

MICHAEL sleeps.  ROWAN lies beside him, staring out the window.  A BREEZE whistles.  she rises 
and walks out of the room - down the hallway - out the front door and down into

THE GARDEN
She stares at the sky.  There is a bright moon, but no stars.

					ROWAN
			'A moon, but no stars...'

The trees and bushes sway in the BREEZE.

					ROWAN
			The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you 
			can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by 
			a faulty ladder-..
				(SILENCE)
			Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.

					LASHER (UNSEEN)
			I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.
				(ROWAN whirls around) 
			I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your 
			thoughts - so I could be as we are now.

					ROWAN
			YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!

					LASHER (UNSEEN)
				(curious. sincere) 
			Explain this to me --- violated...?

					ROWAN
			You bastard...

The BREEZE blows stronger.  A huge flower drops at her feet.

					LASHER (UNSEEN)
			I made it for you.

ROWAN bends and picks up the bizarre flower-  Intrigued.

					ROWAN
			Made it...?

					LASHER (UNSEEN)
			It is from love.

					ROWAN
			To love, you must be able to feel.

					LASHER (UNSEEN)
			If you knew how I yearn for that...

And --- there in the moonlight, LASHER materializes. Shimmering.  Transparent.  Spectral.  
Beautiful.  Melancholy.

					LASHER
			If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like
			breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine 
			to feel...

					ROWAN
				(to be reckoned with) 
			It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that.
			Do you understand...?

					LASHER
				(chastened. softly)

			Yes.
				(a long beat)
			My love is as strong as Michael's. How is it there is love in you for
			one - and not for another...?

She is stunned by the depth of his question. He smiles.

					ROWAN
			You're very clever, aren't you...?

					LASHER
			I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.  (pause) what 
			do you think of yourself now, my love...?

She stares at the flower.  Feeling its texture.  Smelling it.

					ROWAN
			How much of it is me - alone and how much is you...?
				(LASHER flickers...)
			Lasher --- what do you want...?

And he DISSOLVES nothing.  She looks at the flower.  It starts to shrivel - and disintegrates
in her fingers.

DISSOLVE TO

EXT.  THE MAYFAIR MANSION. WEEKS LATER - DAY

The house is closer to renovation's end than the beginning.

INT. THE MAYFAIR MANSION - DIEDRE'S ROOM.  SAME TIME

The room is almost done.  MICHAEL stands at the empty window frames. gloveless, with a sketch
pad.  BZZZ-KPIT... he cocks his head - and looks over at the toy chest. He walks to the chest,
opens it. and takes out the marionette.  It dangles from his hand, twirling slowly.

MICHAEL eyes it closely - his face suddenly creasing --- The marionette looks like MICHAEL - 
it's dressed like him and it is wearing gloves.

					LASHER'S VOICE!
			I love the room, Michael.

And - the marionette starts to grow...  MICHAEL drops it in terror - it keeps growing - till it
is life-size, it's body clattering as it jerks about like a huge, wooden puppet-version of 
MICHAEL.

					THE MARIONETTE
			Michael - you've forgotten your gloves. Better off with them on, 
			don't you think...?  (pause)  Here...

And with a monstrous LAUGH, the MARIONETTE pulls off a glove - and his hand comes with it.  
Blood spurts from the wrist... The other glove flies off, with the same result.

MICHAEL stumbles back, flailing at the muck.  The MARIONETTE clatters to the floor in a zillion
sparks of dust.  The disembodied, gloved hands lie twitching.  And -

they mutate.  Bubbling, turning scabrous. Claws sprout from the fingers. They become monstrous
crabs with human eyes scuttling along the floor toward MICHAEL... At his feet now - climbing up
his legs - up his chest MICHAEL swats them to the floor - and stomps on them, again and again 
and again. turning them to pulp...

					ROWAN (CC)
			What're you drawing...?

MICHAEL IS STANDING FROZEN AT THE WINDOW
pad and pencil still in his hand. ROWAN comes INTO FRAME.  He turns - in the ozone.  She looks
at the pad.  He has sketched the marionette, dangling from a disembodied hand.

					ROWAN
			That's really good. 
				(a beat. she sighs)
			I have to go mleet Bea for lunch now.
				(MICAEL is frozen)
			I feel so had for her-  There's still no word on Gifford-  
			she's a wreck.

					MICHAEL
				(soft. fuzzy)
			Give her my best.

Rowan' cocks her head at him - leans and gives a quick kiss and leaves.  He looks down at the 
sketch and stares silently.

EXT. THE FRENCH MARKET.  AFTERNOON

An outdoor bazaar.  An old BLACK MAN, cataracts fogging his eyes, plays guitar while a BLACK 
BOY tap-dances beside him.

ROWAN AND BEATRICE SIT IN AN OPEN PATIO CAFE
BEATRICE has a beer and a huge plate of oysterts. Chewing, she points at the plate.  ROWAN 
shakes her head NO.

					ROWAN
			That food poisoning did a job on me.

					BEATRICE
			I told you not to honeymoon in the Bayou.  (pause)  I remember when 
			Giff ate a bad batch of ---

Her eyes fill with tears.  ROWAN reaches for her hand.

					ROWAN
			I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.

					BEATRICE
			It's over a month.  (sighs)  The police say it happens all the time.

She musters a weak smile.  Her eyes shift to the crowd.

					BEATRICE
			Isn't that your friend...?

ROWAN turns to see AARON - watching the guitarist and dancer. 

					ROWAN 
			Aaron!

He turns - blooms in a smile - strolls over - and bows.

					ARRON
			The Ladies Mayfair.  Good afternoon.

He leans to ROWAN - and they kiss.  Me turns to BEATRICS and kisses her hand.  He sits down - 
and looks ROWAN over.

					AARON
			Are you alright...?  You look pale.

					ROWAN
				(good-naturedly)
			I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the 
			doctor.

But AARON is suddenly very focused, concentrated. Staring at her.  And finally - he smiles.

					AARON
			There are two.

					ROWAN
			Two what...?

					AARON
			Two heartbeats.

					BEATRICE
			Excuse me...?

					ARRON
				(points at ROWAN'S stomach)
			There.

ROWAN looks down at herself.  Her eyes widen in realization. 
	
					ROWAN
			Are you sure...?

AARON nods calmly.  BEATRICE looks from one to the other.

					BEATRICE
			What are you two talking about...?

					AARON
				(his smile widens)
			Rowan - is pregnant.

ROWAN looks up at him and beams.  BEATRICE is stunned.

					BEATRICE
			But how could - how can you possibly --- ?

And she sits back - and stares at them. 

INT. THE MAYFAIR GARDEN.  LATER THAT DAY - DUSK

CLOSE-UP - A BUSH WITH LARGE EMERALD-GREEN FLOWERS
has bloomed.  Extraordinary, exotic, bizarre. OC - joyful LAUGHTER.  PAN TO

MICHAEL
whirling ROWAN round in his arms.  Both of them grinning and laughing.  And he smothers her 
with a deep kiss..

INT.  THE MANSION PORCH.  NIGHT

MICHAEL and ROWAN sit side by side, rocking in their chairs, holding hands, staring at the 
garden.

					MICHAEL
			If it's a boy --- Taylor.

					ROWAN
			A bit much.  (Pause)  Lucas.

					MICHAEL
			Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.  (thinks)  Grayson.

					ROWAN
				(makes a tace)
			Where are you gitting these...?
				(thinking. her face lights)
			Aaron --- if it's a boy.

He grins - and nods.  They lean to each other and kiss.

					MICHAEL
			And if it's a girl --- Diedre.

She blooms in a painful smile.  A tear runs down her cheek.

EXT. THE CEMETERY.  THE NEXT DAY - DUSK

Deserted.  ROWAN, with a bouquet of tulips, walks past shadowed crypts and stops before the 
huge Mayfair crypts the vault marked DIEDRE MAYFAIR - 1943- 1992. The vault's ledge is 
festooned with flowers.  A long beat.

					ROWAN
				(a sad smile. softly)
			I'm going to have a baby.  (pause) Michael wants to name it 
			after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  
			(pause) Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---

					LASHER (OC)
			I bring her flowers too.

ROWAN whirls round. LASHER sits crosslegged on a crypt.  She glances from side to side.

					LASHER
			There is no one here but the dead.

					ROWAN
			Go away!  I don't want you here.

					LASHER
			If that were true, I would not be here.

					ROWAN
			It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.

					LASHER
			From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first 
			knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. 
			and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.
				(a beat. his melancholy smile)
			And you will have a child...

She glares at him --- and slowly nods.

					LASHER
			A girl...?

					ROWAN
				(eyes him. a beat.very cod)
			It's too soon to know.

She turns her back on him and puts her bouquet on the vault's ledge.  She doesn't move.  LASHER
suddenly locks confused.

					LASHER
			You fear me.  Why  when you yearn so to know me...?  (pause)  You 
			want more from me than the pleasure. Much more.

He glides to her.  His spectral face right before hers.

					LASHER
			you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What 
			I can give you.
				(a beat)
			So much more than Michael can.

					ROWAN
				(a powerful smile of strength)
			What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever 
			inderstand.

					LASHER
				(pained. touching) 
			But I could understand. I want to understand!

					ROWAN
			I LOVE him!

					LASHER
				(shimmering. angered)
			Do not tell me that!

					ROWAN
			I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!

LASHER flickers furiously --- and disappears.  ROWAN scans the cemetery...

					ROWAN
			Lasher...?  Lasher...?

SCRRUNNCH...  She turns.  The marble lid or a crypt is slowly sliding off... and clatters to 
the ground. Then, the lid of a coffin comes INTO VIEW as it opens.  And - a discolored skeleton
rises up and climbs out - and walks toward ROWAN.  She watches wide-eyed holding her fear in
check. The skeleton stops before her - raises its arm and bony fingers gently caress ROWAN 
whitened cheek...

					LASHER'S VOICE (WITHIN THS SKELESTON)
				(tender - but menacing) 
			Michael will look like this one day... (pause)... but not I.

ROWAN'S face suddenly twists in anger.  She grabs the skeleton by the ribcage - and slams it 
against the MAYFAIR crypt   It breaks into pieces and crumples to the ground.

INT.  THE MAYFAIR MANSION LIVING SLOOM

Almost finished.  A magnificent design.  MICHAEL, AARON and STU lift champagne glasses for a 
toast.

					MICHAEL
			To the next Mayfair: Diedre - or --- Aaron.

AARON'S face creases in affection.  Stunned.  Deeply moved. They drink.  STU examines the empty
champagne bottle-

					STU
			Anymore of this...?

MICHAEL nods - and heads out the room.

					STU
				(calling after him. casual)
			I - uh - I assume either one's middle name is gonna be Stu...

MICHAEL WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY PAST THE PORTRAITS.
Passing the mirror, he stops - and cocks his head.  The glass is turning GREEN.  He raises a
finger and touches the glass. His finger punctures the GREENNESS - and sinks in  up to his
knuckle.  Re hesitates - and slowIy, draws his finger out..

THE GREENNESS POURS OUT into the hall. knocking him down. The hall is filling up, the GREENNESS
rising.  MICHAEL struggles as it rises above his head - above the portraits and the witches 
come out into the GREEN - surrounding him

					DEBORAH
			Michael...  Do what you can.

					SUZANNE
			Michael...  Help us...  The door!

					AARON (OC)
			Michael...  Michael...  look at me!

MICHAEL IS ON THE FLOOR IN THE HALL
AARON is kneeling, grasping him by the shoulders.

					AARON
			Focus, Michael 

MICHAEL hones in on AARON - and points at the portraits.

					MICHAEL
			It was them.

AARON nods soberly - and helps him to his feet.

					MICHAEL
			Don't tell Rowan about this.

					AARON
			Michael, Rowan should -

					MICHAEL					
			NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the 
			clinic.. she is not to hear about this.  (pause) don't you think I know 
			she spends half her lite worrying about me... 	
				(a beat. cools off) 
			Listening to my heart, aren't you...?
				(AARON nods)
			The Timex still ticking...?

AARON gives a somber grin - and they walk down the hall. 

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP TO

INT. THE CLINIC.  WEEK LATER - LATE NIGHT

Microscopes, centrifuges, test tube racks, cubicles and refrigerators fill a large, dark, 
deserted room.  PAN TO

ROWAN AND LASHER STANDING AT A CORNER LAB TABLE 
A single candle flickers.  She holds a closed, long-stemted rose in her hand.  LASHER'S 
transparent hand reaches out and melts into bars.  ROWAN shivers from the union.

					LASHER
				(hypnotic)
			Imagine The sun. (pause) It is morning.  It rises.  The light wrashes 
			over you.  It warms you.

ROWAN looks out the window.  She's going far away.  Outside the room.  Past the dark night 
outside.

					LASHER
			Now, Rowan.  Give me the sun.

She almost trembles with concentration.  And then --- the rose opens - the petals spreading 
wide...

INT. ROWAN AND MICHAEL'S BEDROOM.  SAME TIME

the WIND gusts outside the darkened windows.  MICHAEL lies in bed, DAVID COPPERFIELD in his
hands   Tapping the book. Uneasy.  Distracted. He glances at the nighttable clock - 12:45 and 
scowls.  He opens the book to the first page.

					MICHAEL
			'It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times...'

A bitter grin darkens his face.  He rises and walks into the bathroom.  He strips off his 
pajamas and turns on the shower.

INT. THE CLINIC LAB.  SAME TIME

ROWAN holds the rose in one hand and lights it with a match.  It ignites.  She drops it on a 
counter and watches it burn - darkening and shriveling to a curled black ash.

					LASHER (UNSEEN)
			Now, my love --- see it as It was.

Her eyes never leave the burnt remains - but brighten in concentration.  Deep, shining tunnels.

					LASHER (UNSEEN)
			See the memory of life!

Her body tingles with a remarkable force - and the black.ned petals start to uncurl - and 
brighten to a pink - then a vibrant, rich red.  Alive again. ROWAN shivers - her body goes limp
and she smiles.
	
					LASHER (UNSEEN)
				(delighted)
			You see...?  You see...?!!
				(a beat. softly)
			Rowan think what the child might do...

INT. THE MANSION - THE BATHROOM.  SAME TIME

MICHAEL - naked, freshly showered, his face lathered with shaving cream.  The antique mirror on
the wall is completely fogged from the hot, steamy running water in the sink He begins to rub
the mirror clear... His eyes widen - as rub by rub, he reveals -

A monstrous tableau in the mirrorr:  A deep, hellish landscape of nightsarish creatures - 
part-human, part-grotesqueri. - tortured. screaming silently. They turn and see him and start 
flying toward him at impossible speed...

MICHAEL squeezes his eyes shut.

					MICHAEL
				(like a litany)
			I - AM - STANDING - IN - THE - BATHROOM!!!

He opens his eyes.  The mirror reflects only his lathered face and the bathroom.  A deep sigh.  
A long beat. He picks up a razor - and starts at his cheekbone. As the razor descends, shaving
the lather off -

there is nothing beneath the rather in tb. mirror.  No cheek - just BLACKNESS.  He stares in
shock.  Another stroke removes more lather, revealing more of the VOID.  He is mesmerized - and
can't stop-  shaving faster until all the lather is gone - and the upper half of his face 
floats above a blackt hole in the mirror.  And suddenly -

- the grotesqueries are trying to squeeze through the black hole with ear-splitting HOWLS - 
hands and arms and talons pulling and ripping at each other, fighting to be the first to 
escape...

MICHAEL grabs the mirror off the wall and hurls it to the floor, shattering it.  SILENCE.  He 
steadies himself, catching his breath.  Then he hesitantly brings a hand up and feels his jaw,
his cheeks and lip.  A deep breath. He turns off the water - and walks out of the room.

EXT. THE MAYFAIR GROUNDS. THE FOLLOWING MORNING

Two WORKMEN are inside the dry, scrubbed swimming pool on ladders. applying a new coat of blue
sealant to the sides.

MICHAEL AND STU ON THE SIDE PORCH
sipping coffee.  MICHAEI has a distracted frown...

					STU
			...Donna's gonna meet me in Key West, so I'll leave here a week 
			before Christmas and be back on the fourth.  Okay...?

MICHAEL gives a distracted nod.  STU eyes him carefully

					STU
			What's wrong, Mike...?

MICHAEL shakes his head dismissively.

					STU
			C'mon - you haven't been able to lie to me since you asked Martha Rutledge 
			out behind my back in tenth grade.

MICHAEL sighs deeply.  Lips pursed.  Wanting to speak.

					MICHAEL
			I'm getting --- left behind.

					STU
			Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?

					MICHAEL
			Yes. (pause)  Partly.  It's - it's -
				(a beat)
			Stu - do you believe in ---

STU'S eyes shift to something behind MICHAEL - his expressiofl quizzical.  MICHAEL cocks his 
head at STU - and turns...

ROWAN STANDS IN THE PORCH ENTRANCE BEHIND THEM
Stock still.  Pale.  Drawn.  She's been listening.

					STU
			Hi there.  Want coffee...?

ROWAN and MICHAEL'S eyes meet.  Then --- OC - CRASH! ROWAN and MICHAEL'S eyes are locked.  
STU - turns to the sound.

ANGLE - THE SWIMMING POOL
where a WORKER - up on a ladder - stares down, frowning at the can of sealant that has fallen.
- its thick, blue-green contents spreading out on the bottom of the pool...

BACK TO THE PORCH

					STU
			What now...?

He walks toward the pool, leaving ROWAN and MICHAEL alone.

					MICHAEL
				(simmering anger) 
			When aid you get home last night...?

					ROWAN
			What were you talking about...?

					MICHAEL
			Yyou look terrible.  You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn 
			clinic.  (pause)  Even pregnant women who aren't doctors know that You 
			can't -

					STU (OC)
			Mike!  Better c'mere!

He stares at her - hurt, angry, baffled - and walks off. 

EXT. DOWN IN THE POOL - MOMENTS LATER

MICHAEL, STU, and the WORKERS watch as the puddle of spilled blue sealant on the pool floor 
begins to shrink...  Huh...?

					MICHAEL
			It cracked the bottom.  Stuff's seeping down through a crack.

Almost all the sealant is gone - revealing cracks where the can hit.  MICHAEL taps the cracks
with his foot - and STU grabs him as part of the pool caves in, leaving a hole.

MICHAEL lowers a ladder inte the hole.  It hits bottom.

					STU
			Careful...

MICHAEL descends OUT OF VIEW.  STU glances up and there is ROWAN - staring down at him, 
expressionless.

					MICHAEL (OC)
			Somebody built a kind ot room down here.

INT. BENEATH THE POOL.  SAME TIME

MICHAEL stands in a dark, dank enclosure of ancient timbers - three toot square, six feet high.
He turns - and trips over something.

BACK UP TOP AT THE HOLE IN THE POOL - MOMENTS LATER

					MICHAEL (OC)
			Hey - gimme a hand!

MICHAEL appears, struggling with an old, slimy,  wooden crate.  STU grabs an end and slides it
onto the poo1.

INT. THE MANSION - A STORAGE ROOM.  MINUTES LATER

ROWAN and MICHAEL - crowbar in hand - stand over the crate.

					MICHAEL
			Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.

					ROWAN
			Go ahead.

He looks at her, searching her face.

					MICHAEL
			Something's wrong with you.

					ROWAN
				(flaring)			
			Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - 
			and so do you.


She grabs the crowbar - and pries the lid loose.  She yanks the lid off - and they rear back. 
coughing, choking...

					MICHAEL
			Jesus Christ!

They slowly come back, leaning in for a look at the contents: A dozen, old, thick masan jars 
with air-tight wax seals.

ROWAN takes them out and sets them on the floor.  They are filled with greenish. viscous fluid.
It's hard to see inside - a 100  years of sediment has been stirred up.  But things are 
settling it the jars.  Things are becoming visable...

					ROWAN
			Michael --- look.


The jars are fil1ed with HEADS - skulls covered with slimy flesh.  Jellyish, rheumy eyes.  Hair
drifting 1ike seaweed. ROWAN and MICHAEL stare.  A long beat.

					ROWAN
			Marguerite...

MICHAEL looks at her - uncomprehending.

					ROWAN
			Marguerite!  Carlotta said - "Margutrite was something of a 
			practitioner herself." She meant - like a doctor --- Like ---

Suddenly - MICHAEL violently twists the top off a jar HISSSS...  They both gag at the fumes...

					ROWAN
			Michael --- no!

He plunges his bare hand into the muck and pulls out a head.  His fingers sink into the skin. A
SEARING FLASH OF WHITE - INTO

INT.  A ROOM IN THE MANSION [AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE]

MARGUERITE and JULIEN stand over a MAN'S corpse, lying on a table.  LASHER hovers expectantly.
MARGUERITE takes a crude surgical tool, servers the head, and holds it up by the hair. LASHER 
is brightening, swirling round and round the head...

					MARGUERITE
			Now, my love - Now!

LASHER dives into the head - like a vapor sucked inside. The lifeless eyes suddenly glimmer - 
and come to life

					LASHER'S VOICE (FROM BEHIND THE EYES)
			I am  here, Marguerite!  I can see!

But the eyes start to flicker and dim, like a dying light...

					LASHER'S VOICE
				(a plaintive cry)
			No...NO	pleeeeease...  I am going...	slipping...  The feeling... Oh, 
			the feeling!  NOOOO!

And now, there is only death in the eyes again.

BACK TO ROWAN AND MICHAEL
MICHAEL drops the head. It breaks like a rotten melon.  He is horror-stricken, wiping his hands
frantically on his shirt...

					MICHAEL
			He went into the dead!  Saw with their eyes - used them...

ROWAN - terrified - reaches for him - but he pushes her away. Me grabs at the jars, inspecting
them, one after another...

					MICHAEL
			This one!

Through the glass, a head stares out at him - its state far superior to the others:  the hair
brown and wavy, the face grotesquely beautiful.  He opens the jar - and pulls it out.  ANOTHER
FLASH OF WHITE Inro

INT.  DIEDRE'S ROOM [AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE]

A naked MALE CORPSE lies on the brass bed - mottled, lifeless yet alive, pulsing with LASHER'S
spirit  MARGUERITE stands naked at the bedside.  JULIEN stands beside her in elegant attire -
with a look of twistad fascination and anticipation.

The CORPSE beckons to MARGUERITE.  She climbs on the bed and mounts it.  The grey hands move
with clumsy effort, pawing at her.  She begins to move in a steady rhythm.

					LASHER VOICE (WITHIN THE CORPSE) 
			Marguerit. - I can feel you...

					JULIEN
				(leaning in. face ablaze)
			Faster, Marguerite!  Faster!  FASTER!

MARGUERITE speeds up - but soon. the CORPSE'S hands slip to the bed, lifeless.  Tears fill 
MARGUERITE'S eyes. JULIEN smashes the bedpost in anger and storms away.

BACK TO ROWAN AND MICHAEL
MICHAEL still holds the skull, eye to eye.

					MICHAEL
			Jesus - he tried to fuck her and Julien - Julien was there -
			like, like an overseer...

ROWAN suddenly grabs the head - and huris it to tbe floor. Glass and flesh and bone smash 
against the floorboards...

INT.  THE TALMASCA GARDEN.  LATER THAT DAY - DUSK

ROWAN and MICHAEL watch AARON as he paces - his face a study in concentraticn.  He finally 
turns to MICHAEL.

					AARON
			What have the witches always asked of you...?

					MICHAEL
			"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."

					AARON
			Yes - and you have.
				(turns to ROWAN)
			Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches 
			sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to 
			save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no
			 one else could...

He grabs MICHAEL by the wrists and raises them high.

					AARON
			With his hands!

					ROWAN
			But why would they do that...?

AARON leans and smells a rose.  Thinking.  A long beat.

					AARON
			To warn you.

ROWAN'S face creases in confusion.  AARON turns to MICHAEL -

					AARON
			You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches 
			brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?
				(MICHAEL nods emphatically) 
			They're reaching out to you, Rowan!

					ROWAN
			But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired 
			with him.

					AARON
			Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...?  
			They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside 
			herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely 
			they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers 
			grasp...  (pause) Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they 
			embraced in life...?!

MICHAEL and ROWAN turn to each other.  AARON is pacing again.

					AARON
				(excited)
			It feels right.  (pause)  There is a continuum, Rowan.  You're part
			of them.
				(halts. a long beat) 
			They want you to stop Lasher.

The concept sends them all deep into SILENCE.

FADE TO BLACK 

FADE UP TO

INT.  ECU - ONE OF THE ANCIENT HEADS

foating in its jar.  Calipers dip into the jar.  PULL OUT to 

ROWAN IN A WINDOWLESS ROOM AT THE RESEARCH CLINIC
as she extracts a chunk of flesh.  She prepares a slide specimen, placing it under a large
microscope.  She depotits a specimen in a centrifuge and turns it on.  WHIRRRR... she programs
the computer - and co1umns of figures and symbols start filling the monitor.  She eyes the 
Screen and - LASHER'S spectral face appears within the glass.

					LASHER
			And now - do you know...?

ROWAN'S face hardens.  She stares back defiantly.

					ROWAN
			I know that you're evil.

					LASHER
				(poignant)
			I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do... (sighs) ...but 
			Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...

					ROWAN
			And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!

					LASHER
				(his melancholy smile) 
			No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.
				(a long beat)
			I want you to --- chang me.

ROWAN falls silent - caught off-balance.

					LASHER
			I have kept this from you, until now. You had to learn the 
			magnificence of your powers first.  You had to see for yourself 
			what you are capable of.
				(a beat)
			Think. Rowan - think of the rose - and the fire - and Stu.  (pause) 
			You gave Michael life again - you give life to the ehild within you...
				(a teat)
			Give me life!  Make me flesh!

She's stunned.  He wafts out of the screen - floating round her like a sheath.  She backs away
from him.  He follows...

					ROWAN
			It's impossible.  You want me to - to make you into something you're 
			not!  You - you have no substance - you have no cells, no structure...

He circles round her.  An unearthly courting dance.  She is swaying, being swept up...

					LASHER
			I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...
				(sighs)
			Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so 
			sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a
			.promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?
				(a forlorn moan)
			I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She 
			called to me!

					ROWAN
			But have I...?  Ever...?!

LASHER is everywhere - all around her - caressing her...

				                  LASHER
			Not with your voice, no...but you do not need a voice for me.  
			Only the beat of your heart.  That is your voice to me ---

She is up against the wall nov, enveloped by him.

					LASHER
			--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first 
			beat.

					ROWAN
				(swooning)
			I love Michael...

					LASHER
				(seductive. tinged with menace)
			Then help me--- for his sake...

His sexual perfection has her floating, eyes drooping.  He kisses her deeply...

					ROWAN
			You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..

					LASHER
			Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...

					ROWAN
			Only you...

					LASHER
			Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...

Brightening, he fuses with her - two entities becoming one...  And she surrenders to him...

INT. ROWAN'S LAB.  HOURS LATER

ROWAN lies on the floor.  Her eyes open.  She rises groggily, and drops into her chair.  Cocks
her head, her senses keen.

					ROWAN
			Lasher...?
				(SILENCE)
			Lasher!  Come to me!

SILENCE.  She smiles cunningly - and nods, understanding.

					ROWAN
				(thinking out loud)
			You can't.  You use yourself up in the passion. (pause)	
			You need time.

She starts rapidly typing at the computer. The screen shows -

hypothesis: to examine secondary growth activity 
cells induced by unknown catalyst -
and resultingly, deduce nature of catalyst
and it's reanimative authority

The computer shuttles.  ROWAN types - 

posit: if hypothesis is successful,
what is probabiliy data will disclose
specific procedure for destruction of catalyst?

The computers shuttles.  Then, appearing on the screen - 

							75 %

She shows a faint smile of tritamph.  She sits back - puts her hands on her round stomach - 
looks down and smiles warmly.

					ROWAN
			Maybe Aaron is right.  Maybe they are trying to help.  Can you feel 
			them...?
				(her face hardens with resolution) 
			I swear to you - you will never know him.  When you come into the 
			world, he will be gone.  This is my promise to you.

She rises - flicks switches on some hi-tech machines, turns back to the keyboard - and types -
begin hypothesis

DISSOLVE TO

EXT.  THE MAYFAIR MANSION MORNING

The mansion is almost new. The trees are turning fall colors.  Leaves are falling.  PAN TO

THE GARDEN
where the emerald bush is blooming again - small, crimson buds sprouting from the center at the
bright green flowers.

MICHAEL AND STU ON THE SIDEWALK
Standing beside a taxi.  STU rubs his hands together.

					STU
			A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, 
			sweet decadance.

					MICHAEL
				(very low-keyed)
			Just don't fall off any ladders.

A long, silent look between them.

					STU
				(soothing)
			Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - 
			hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?

ROWAN
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself.
Cool.  Aloof.

					ROWAN
			I almost missed you.  You have a great time - and a merry 
			Christmas.

She leans in and gives STU a big htag and a kiss.

					STU
			You too.

MICHAEL' S mood makes everything awkward.  Everyone sneaking glances.  STU finally wraps 
MICHAEL up in a hug.

					STU
			You two be good to each other.

And he gets into the taxi.  ROWAN and MICHAEL watch silently till it goes OUT OF VIEW.  ROWAN
turns round and stares at the house.

					ROWAN
			God, Michael - it's so beautiful. It'll be weird without anybody tromping 
			around in there, huh...?

She turns to MICHAEL.  He nods faintly.  They stare across the gulf between them.  Trying to 
link up.  He scratches his cleft with his thumb.  She grins and steps to him.  Her arms going 
round him.

					ROWAN
				(softly)
			Hi.

					MICHAEL
				(a faint smile)
			Hi.  (pause)  You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see 
			a movie...?

					ROWAN
				(hesitant. softly)
			I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -

					MICHAEL
				(stiffening. curt)
			Gotcha.

He steps back - and heads fcr the Mercedes.  ROWAN winces.

					ROWAN
			Michael -

And she watches him get in the car and speed away. 

EXT.  DOWNTOWN NEW ORLEANS.  LATER THAT MORNING

MICHAEL with a sad grin, looking in a department store window at an incongruous Christmaas 
display - Santa Claus in his sleigh, saxophone in hand riding down a replica of bBurbon Street.

INT. ROWAN'S LAB.  SAME TIME

ROWAN stares frowning at a monitor full of symbols. She sits back, weary.  closes her eyes  
Rubs them.

					LASHER (UNSEEN)
			Go on. Rowan.  Go on.

					ROWAN
				(smacks the desk)
			Leave me alone!

LASHER flickers into sight.  she turns and hurls a notebook at him.  It goes through him and
hits the wall.

					LASHER
			What is wrong...?

					ROWAN
			Wrong...?  Science is not magic.

					LASHER
				(a beat. sottly)
			I do not understand...

					ROWAN
			You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!

					LASHER
			There was no thought.  There was no act.  (pause)  That is not 
			what I am.

					ROWAN
			I don't know what you are!!!

					LASHER
				(passionate)
			That is what you must discover.  (pause) see what I am, my love.  
			With all your power - see me, and know what I am.

He approaches.  She brace herself - holding her ground - not backing off.

					LASHER
			Do not be atraid. Fear is not for you...

She straightens, tightening some psychic grip. She holds her hands out and frames his head. His
face comes to hers - meets it - then merges with hers - And they start to rise - joined as they
are - floating up...

ROWAN'S  POV - A TRILLION FLECKS OF COLORED LIGHT
Dense, dazzling.  The POV moves deeper - the density lessens...fewer particles, frenzied, 
darting in a greenish haze...  Deeper - terrifying speed now - zooming, plummeting toward 
nothingness. OBLIVION -a piercing SCREAM- 

ROWAN - SUSPENDED IN THE AIR WITH LASHER
SCREAMS - lurches free of him, and falls to the floor, dazed.  LASHER swoops down to her, 
enfolding her gently.

					LASHER
			Don't stop!

She weakly waves him off - gulping for breath...

					ROWAN
			No!

					LASHER
				(intense. urgent) 
			Tell me what I am, Rowan.

She gazes at him painfully, shakes her head vehemently.

					LASHER
			Rowan...  Rowan!

She covers her face with her hands and turns away from him. LASHER'S face darkens with anger - 
and jealousy.

					LASHER
				(cool anger)
			You are thinking of him...

And she suddenly rises - and storms out of the room.

EXT. THE MANSION.  DAY - AN HOUR LATER

ROWAN comes quickly through the gate.  She walks inside the house and down the main hall.

					ROWAS
			Michael...?  Michael...?!

Passing the LIVING ROOM entrance, something out at the corner of her eye stops her.  She 
turns...

ROWAN'S POV - THE LIVING ROOM
where a magnificent Christmas tree rises to the ceiling, covered with globes and stars and 
tinsel so the whole room seems to shine.

ROWAN
walks slowly toward it - overwhelmed, tears filling her eyes

					MICHAEL (OC)
			Nice, huh...?

She turns and sees MICHAEL and rushes into his arms.

INT.  MICHAEL AND ROWAN'S ROOM.  LATER THAT DAY

They lie in bed, in each other's arms.  Private Thoughts, A long beat.  MICHAEL lets out a deep
sigh.

					MICHAEL
			You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know 
			how to get to.

					ROWAN
			It's not true.  You have to believe me.

MICHAE is preparing his thoughts...making his mind up.

					MICHAEL
			I want us to leave.  This isn't home, Rowan.  I could tear the house 
			down and start from scratch - and it still wouldn't be home.  I want 
			to go back to San Francisco - I want our child born somewhere that's 
			free of death. That's all there is here!  It's in the ground and the glass 
			and the steel and the ground. (pause) I want to  leave. If Lasher follows, 
			So be it.  Let him face us in a place where we belong!

MICHAEL waits.  And - ROWAN looks away from him.

					ROWAN
				(her voice is sad, but hard)
			I can't.

					MICHAEL
			That's not good enough.  Why not...?!

					ROWAN
				(suddenly erupting)
			I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!

That does it.  He's had it.  He rips the covers off and stands.  Grabs his pants and starts
pulling them on.

					MICHAEL
			I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me
			inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!

					ROWAN
				(melting to urgency)
			Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.

					MICHAEL
				(bitter. sarcastic)
			Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?

					ROWAN
			Stop it!

					MICHAEL
			How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?

					ROWAN
				(flaring)
			You bastard!

He whirls round and grabs her violently by the shoulders.

					MICHAEL
			You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!
				(shakes her violently)
			Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!

					ROWAN
				(torn up)
			Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -

					MICHAEL
			No.

They stare at each other - miles apart.  A long beat.

					MICHAEL
			When you're ready to let me back into your heart, I'l1 come 
			back to you.

He hustles his shirt and shoes on and storms out. ROWAN watches him go as tears stream down her
face....  She runs out after him - down the stairs...

					ROWAN
			MICHAEL!!

The front door slams shut.  Her face narrows in anger - fury rising as she turns and stares at
the Christmas tree.  POP!   One of the shiny globes explodes.  POP!  Another goes.  POP!

LASHER appears, hovering above the tree, smiling.  The angel at the top of tree flies off and
smashes against the wall.

					LASHER
			You are magnificent, my love.

As ROWAN stands, entranced in her powers. LASHER swirls round the tree.  The ornaments sway in
the maelstrom - tinsel and globes and trinkets flying off, srashing everywhere.  Bits of glass
fill the air like colored snow...  LASHER encircle. ROWAN.  She swoons to the floor - and he
joins with her...

DISSOLVE TO

INT. NEW ORLEANS AIRPORT TERMINAL.  AFTERNOON

MICHAEL and AARON sit in a LOUNGE.  MICHAEL looks drawn and weary.  He taket a swig from a 
drink and grimaces.

					MICHAEL
			on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life. 
			 (bitter) well - I'm already out of her life.

					AARON
			Nothing was ever more false.

					MICHAEL
				(leaning in. almost desperate)
			Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....

AARON starts solemnly - and finally shakes his head.

					AARON
			I only know she loves you - desperately.

MICHAEL fingers his glass.  A self-loathing grin shows.

					MICHAEL
			I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in 
			that house. (pause)  you'll check on her - every day...?

					AARON
			Every day (grins) twice. 

					MICHAIL
				(a beat)
			Aaron - do you believe in God...?

					ARRON
				(his benevolent smile)
			I believe we all come from the same force...  Even Lasher.

He reaches out  and covers MICHAEL's hand with his own.

					ARRON
			Be we11, Michael.  Be strong.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT TERMINAL.  NIGHT

MICCHAEL wasks out into the fog. He gets in a taxi and tells the DRIVER -

					MICHAEL
			On the hill.  2712 Fairmont.

EXT. THE MAYFAIR ESTATE.  SAME TIME

AARON comes through the grate.  Up to the door.  KNOCK-KNOCK.  Knocks again.  SILENCE.  He 
walks along the porch, peering in the windows.  He heads back down the walk.

The emerald bush's crimson buds have bloomed into huge flowers,  He teaches to pick one - and
is pricked by a thorn. blood trickles from his finger.  He heads toward the gate.

INT. SAN FRANCISCO - MICHAEL'S HOUSE.  NIGHT

Everything covered with sheets.  MICHAEL wanders a half-empty scotch bottle in his hand, 
singing softly...

					MICHAEL
			I left my heart in ---

He stops - his face creasing - gears turrning in his head...

INT. MICHAEL'S ATTIC.  A MINUTE LATER

MICHAEL digging in boxes.  He finds what he wants - and yanks his tather's singed fireman's
helmet in both hands...  THE SEARING WHITE-HOT FLASH - AND

INT.  A FIERY, FLAMING BUILDING [AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE]

MICHAEL'S FATHER tosses the GIRL to the safety net.  Suddenly - the window is blown in, 
shattering. MICHAEL'S FATHER falls to the floor.  Above him the flames dance - then everything 
comes down on him...

MICHAEL'S POV swerves up to the rafters.  There is LASHER, hovering in the flames, in command, 
undulating in the deadly heat,  LASHER glances TO CAMERA (to MICHAEL) - and smiles...

MICHAEL
drops the helmet - as if burned - and races out.

INT. MICHAEL'S BEDROOM.  A MINUTE LATER

MICHAEL stands with the phone to his ear - revving like a madman - listening to the RING on the
other end of the line.

					MICHAEL
			Pick up the fucking phone, Ro!

INT. THE MANSION - THE LIVING ROOM.  SAME TIME - NIGHT

ROWAN, out cold on the floor.  The phone is RINGING.  Her eyes open. She struggles to her feet.
Stubling into the hall - toward the phone.  And - BZZZ-KPIT-KPIT.  She freezes.  
BZZZ-KPIT-KPIT.  Upstairs...?  She turns to the stairs - hesitates - and starts up...

INT. THE TALAMASCA HEADQUARTERS.  SAME TIME - NIGHT

A WOMAN stands with a phone.  AARON comes INTO FRME and takes it from her.

					ARRON (INTO THE PHONE)
			Michael...?

INTERCUT between AARON and MICHAEL in his bedroom, at a fever-pitch, figuring it out as he 
rambles...

					MICHAEL
			Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!

					AARON
			What are you talk---

					MICHAEL
			He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!

BACK TO ROWAN IN THE MANSION
on the second floor, outside Diedre's room.  BZZZ-KPIT... rt's in there.   She walks inside.  
BZZZ-KPIT....

BACK TO MICHAEL AND AARON ON THE PHONE

					MICHAEL
			Carlotta was too strong for Lasher. She got Rowan away from him - 
			to San Francisco... but that took her away from me, too!  (pause)  
			Aaron - Lasher killed my father!  That's what got me and mother out 
			of New Orleans - and back to Rowan - so we would meet!
				(chilled to the bone) 
			Aaron   his power. . .  His control...

					AARON
				(equally chilled)
			Rowan...

					MICHAEL
			You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight 
			back!

BACK TO ROWAN IN DIEDRE'S ROOM
staring at a sheetrock wall - all senses primed.  BZZZ-KPIT. suddenly, she SMASHES her fist 
through - and starts tearing the wall away.  Ripping the last chunk away - and there sits

GIFFORD - decapitated, drenched in blood.  In his lap is the gold saw, like a platter - and 
resting on it is his head.  The cat licks at the mouth, wide open in a scream.

INT. A CAB ON A HIGHWAY.  SAME TIME - LATE NIGHT

AARON speeds down the road.  LASHER suddenly appears beside him, grinning faintly.  AARON 
glances at him. stunned...

					LASHER
			Petyr van Abel would have been proud of your devotion, Aaron....
			your compassion. And I am grateful for them.

ARRON looks back to the road, trying to shut out the specter.

					LASHER
			The Talamasca's histories made Rowan's nature clear to her in a way 
			I never could... and I am thanktul for that.

AARON'S face sinks in realization of a centuries-old folly.

					AARON
			That is our purpose in all this...?

					LASHER
			Since the begxnning   (sighs)  We have been together a long time, 
			you and I. And now it ends...

The car suddenly swerves violently.  AARON fights for control.  As they skid and sverve down 
the road.

					LASHER
			Rowan fights her feelings for me, but her passion - her power - 
			they conspire against her love.  And I grow stronger. -

Finally - AARON wrestles back control of the car.

					AARON
				(triumphant)
			But there are still limits to your powers, aren't there...?  Some of
			us are without desire - and we exhaust you --- don't we...?

The car enters a tunnel.  Suddenly - up ahead - A BRICK WALL COMPLETELY FILLS THE TUNNEL.

AARON stiffens - floors the gas - and zooms through the wall.  It dissolves as he passes 
through.  The car exits the tunnel.  ARRON glances over at LAHER  - and AARON grins...  And -

- the steering goes.  AARON twists the wheel - but the car won't respond - and he's headinq 
toward a steep embankmen....

					AARON
			I'rn right in the middle of the road! There's nothing wrong with 
			the car!

					LASHER
			Yes...?  Let us wait and see...

The car swerves off the road.  The cliffside looms...

					AARON
			I'm not afraid, Lasher...

AARON stares - unflinching - as the car barrels over the cliff, soaring down. down...  The 
ground racing up at him...

					AARON
			I am not AFRAID!

The car plows into the ground - and suddenly - AARON is staring at the highways center-line as
he speeds along.

					LASHER
			You are strong, Aaron... 
				(an evil smile) 
			...but others are not so strong.

And he vanishes.  AARON'S face creases in confusion.  Huh...?  A school bus is coming up toward
them in the other direction, on the other side of the road.  AARON'S face whitens...

					AARON
			Lasher, where are you...?  Lasher...?!  LASHER!

					LASHER (UNSEEN)
			If not for yourself  then fear for the children...

AARON can see the bus clearly now.  Packed with children.  And he can see the sudden, 
uncomprehending look of terror on the DRIVER'S face. - as he inexplicably loses control of the
bus.  It suddenly skids - and swerves out of  lane - heading straight for a head-on with AARON.

AARON hesitates - uncertain - wavering - seconds to impact - and --- he swerves out of the bus
path at the last moment -- sacrificing himself - flying off the cliff...

INT. THE MANSION - SAME TIME - LATE NIGHT

ROWAN stumbles out of Diedre's room, down the stairs, freaked, looking over her shoulder.  And 
- she freeses. seeing something that isn't there.  Her face twists

BACK TO THE CLIFFSIDE - SAME TIME
AARON'S car tumbles down through the air, hits bottom - and EXPLODES in a fireball.

BACK TO ROWAN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS
as she is sent reeling to the floor.  Dazed, fighting a blackout. - sliding down into her 
dream...

THE OPERATING ROOM IN ROWAN'S DREAM
ROWAN works feverishly on the OUT OF FRAME patient. THE MASKED FIGURES watch silently.

					ROWAN
			I - I can't do it!

The others urge her on - imploring, encouraging her-

					ROWAN
				(pointing OUT OF FRAME. frantic)
			But look!  LOOK!   How can I do it...?

OC - a muffled CRY.
TILT DOWN SLOWLY - the edge of the operating table comes INTO FRAME - and lying on it, a tiny
hand... PULL OUT to REVEAL ALL for the first time... It is a truly bizarre entity: the torso of
a man - with the head, arms and  legs, toes and lingers of a tiny newborn.

					MASKED FIGURE
			Go on!  Help him!

					MASKED FIGURE
			Help us!

					ROWAN
			HOW...?!

A FIGURE removes its mask - it is MARGUERITE.  She takes a scalpel and cuts the entity from 
navel to callarbone, then folds back the skin --- within the chest cavity, the emerald pendant
is where a heart should be. ROWAN SCREAMS. All but one of the FIGURES take off their masks:  
they are the twelve MAYFAIR WITCHES - and JULIEN.

					JULIEN
			Help him!  You were made for this?

					ROWAN
			I can't do it!   How can I do it...?!

					SUZANNE
			Stop doubting your power!!

Then - the remaining MASKED FIGURE speaks:

					MASKED FIGURE
			No!  Don't listen to your words, Rowan.  Listen to the feeling 
			behind your words.  Listen to your heart.

He removes his mask.  it is ARRON.

					AARON
			It is not your power that you doubt. When you say - "I can't do 
			it" - you are saying - "I MUST NOT DO IT!" You are saying "I WILL 
			NOT DO IT!"
				(his warm, kind smile)
			This is what your heart tells you.

ROWAN ON THE FLOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
coming groggily out of the dream.  She rises unsteadily.  And LASHER stands before her.  Her 
face hardens.  He starts toward her.  ROWAN stands her ground - sensing danger.

					ROWAN
			STOP!'

Lasher halts - shimmering.  Staring deep into one another.

					ROWAN
			Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.  (pause) you killed 
			him, didn't you...?

					LASHER
				(a beat)
			It was an accident.  (smiles) Gifford, too.

She trembles.  Her tears come. But - she steels herself.  A long beat.

					ROWAN
			The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...?
			Tell me, Lasher.  Now!

					LASHER
				(his smile flashes)
			They want to come back.  (pause)  We have a pact - of mutual desire 
			and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved 
			you all together - from the start.  (pause) I brought Petyr Van Abel to 
			Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect 
			start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father 
			to daughter...

ROWAN shudders.  Turning ghostly pale.

					ROWAN
			Oh god...

					LASHER
			Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather 
			- and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought 
			carlotta for your life.

ROWAN is shaken - backing up in horror.

					LASHER
			The Mayfair pact. Rowan: when I am flesh - I will unlock the 
			door - and the witches will come through. 
				(soaring)
			You are the key to the door for the witches - and for me! You are 
			the thirteenth witch.

Laslirn glows brighter...

					LASHER
			I will be --- perfect.  (pause) That is why I chose Michael...

ROWAN blanches.  Thrown for a loop.  LASHER smiles.

					LASHER
			The boy who would turn his dreams into reality.  The exquisite 
			imagination! So aesthetic, so vulnerable...  The boy so special, 
			he could see me!  (pause) And I knew he was the one --- for us.
				(he smilas)
			You thought it love at first sight...? (shakes his head)  I chose him 
			for you. (pause)  The union is human perfection.

She doesn't quite get it.  she's revving, furious, confused.

					LASHER
			I created you to create me --- and you have...

And now ROWAN sees it all.  stumbling back, terrified...

					LASHER
			It's growing inside you...  Waiting to change... Waiting for me.

And ROWAN turns - and runs... A door SLAMS shut as she races toward it.

					LASHER (UNSEEN)
			Did you think you could trick me, my  love...?

She whirls round - LASHER floats before her - glowing like never before - a bright, pulsating
emerald green.

					LASHER
			You thought I could not see into your soul...?  I made your soul!

ROWAN back up against the wall.  LASHER spreads out - huge, dark, roiling.  Towering above her.
the clock begins to chime.  MIDNIGHT.  GONG-GONG-GONG...

					LASHER
			It is Christmas Eve, my love  The witching hour is at hand, 
			when Christ was born into the world - when the Word was 
			finally made Flesh --- and I would be born too.  I am done 
			with waiting!

He gathers force, funnelling in on himself, whirling like a tornado - and streams toward her
like a jet of green vapor -

					ROWAN
			NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!

--- and the whirlwind jets up between her legs  --- into her --- and disappears.  She HOWLS in
unearthly pain - and falls to the floor.  Her water breaks - blood seeping now from between her
legs -

					ROWAN
				(absolutely, totally, completely freaked)
			 Oh god - oh my god - no, godddd, NO!!!

She SHRIEKS as a vicious contraction jolts her to her very being.  And --- something is coming
out of her...

Out it slides --- the ENTITY FROM HER DREAM.  On its back - bloody, shining - a man-sized head,
its infant arms and fingers and legs and feet groping and and moving and --- elongating and
growing with each breath, as it cries the CRY from ROWAN'S dream...  ROWAN slumps into 
oblivion...

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP TO

EXT. THE MANSION.  EARLY THE NEXT MORNING - CHRISTMAS DAY

TRACKING with MIHAEL
as he barrels through the gate and bursts inside the house.

					MICHAEL
			ROWAN!!  ROWAN!!

Racing down the hall, he freezes - staring into the LIVING ROOM.  Everything topsy-turvy.  A 
carpet of broken, colored glass and pine needles covers the floor.  He races toward the stairs
and skids to stop - a thick pool of blood on the floor there. MICHAEL races back down the 
hall...

					MICHAEL
			ROWAN!!!!!!			

EXT. THE MANSION GARDEN.  MOMENTS LATER

MICHAEL races INTO FRAME - and stops - staring at a tall FIGURE - clad only in pants - its back
to him.

THER FIGURE
slowly turns round.  it is a man - delicate yet muscular but the skin, the expression, the 
texture ot him is brand-new, newborn.  And his face is a perfect mix of ROWAN and MICHAEL.  In
his hand, he holds one at the newly-bloomed emerald-and-crimson flowers.  He smiles...

					THE MAN
			I made these.

It is LASHER'S voice.  He holds the flower to his nose and inhales deeply-  His brand-new face
lights with the most sensual of discoveries.

					LASHER THE MAN
			Ahhh...	It is incredible, is it not...?
				(holds the flower out to MICHAEL)
			Here.  For you, Father.

And MICHAEL knows.  He HOWLS and stampedes toward LASHER, who waits with a delighted 
expresslon. MICHAEL barrels into him - they go sprawling to the ground.  MICHAEL pummeling him,
tearing at him, lost to murder and vengeance.

					MICHAEL
			You fucking bastard!  You killed my child!!!

But LASHER is laughing --- rejoicing in the sensations, the pain, the movement, the flesh...

					LASHER THE MAN
			But I am your child!  I AM YOUR SON!

					MICHAEL
			Where is Rowan...?!  Where is she...?!!

					LASHER THE MAN
			And this is pain...?  Father you cannot hurt me.  No one can.

And LASHER rises, lifting MICHAEL up like a toy - dangling him in the air.

					LASHER THE MAN
			I am ALIVE Father!

And he flings MICHAEL across the garden.  LASHER smiles, and heads for MICHAEL ungainly on his
new legs.

ROWAN COMES CARWLING OUT OF THE HOUSE
- weakened, haggard, bloodied, pale.

					ROWAN
			Michael...

LASHER - standing over MICHAEL - turns toward the sound - and MICHAEL tries to crawl away.

					LASHER THE MAN
				(grinning)
			You want Michael...?

LASHER struts to MICHAEL and picks him up by the collar.

					LASHER THE MAN
			Here!  Here he is!

MICHAEL hangs still in LASHER'S grip, like the marionette. LASHER jostles him, shakes him with
a smile.

					LASHES THE MAN
			You could use some strings, I think..

ROWAN is trying to crawl, but she's so weak.

					ROWAN
			Put - him - down!  His - his heart...

					LASHER THE MAN
			How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?

He punches MICHAEL brutally in the chest.  And then strikes him again.  MICHAEL HOWLS - 
breathless, eyes bulging-  LASHER starts parading around the garden holding MICHAEL in the air
like a broken marionette..

					LASHER THE MAN
				(mad. possessed. overdosing on life) 
			Look at me, Mother!  Am I not a wonder...?!  Something new under the 
			sun!  The world has never seen the likes of me!

					MICHAEL
				(a barely audible HISS) 
			A monster among men...

					LASHER
				(suddenly expressionless. cold)
			Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is 
			gone.

					ROWAN
			No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!

LASHER strikes a deadly blow to MICHAEL'S chest.  MICHAEL seems to cave in..   And LASHER hurls
MICHAEL into the pool.

MICHAEL SINKS LIKE A STONE BENEATH THE WATER
Sinking into death for the second and last time.  And - the WITCHES seep out in the water  
surrounding him.

					MICHAEL
			Let go, Michael.  It is done - and he is beautiful!  Perfect.

					DEBORAH
			We can go through now.  Lasher will open the door and 
			bring us back-  (pause) Goodbye, Michael. Let go now.  
			Let go... 

The phantoms fade away.  Michael sinks to the bottom. DEAD.

BACK AT POOLSIDE
LASHER stands, beaming and proud, staring into the water.  ROWAN drags herself to the pool -
and stares down in horror.

					ROWAN
			Oh god nooooooooo....

She tries to slide into the pool - but LASHER picks her up gently end deposits her on the 
grass.

					LASHER THE MAN
			Mother - you must rest.  You're still bleeding.  Rest. please...

The WIND suddenly picks up.  The trees sway.  And then - the witches' VOICES swirl around
LASHER and ROWAN

					SUZANNE (UNSEEN)
			Lasher - bring us through!

					DEBORAH (UNSEEN)
			Now, lasher - it is our time.

The VOICES beseech him, coax him, plead...  And LASHER smiles up at the sky --- a widening, 
cunning, wicked smile...

					LASHER THE MAN
			Your time...?  Oh, my foolish ones - but you are wrong!  rt is my time
			MINE!  I am unto myself - one of a kind!  (pause)  And I have Rowan! 
			Who else do I need...?

					SUZANNE (UNSEEN)
				(anger in her voice. and panic)
			The pact Lasher!  The pact!  We have waited. Now it is our time!

					LASHER THE MAN
				(a harsh laugh)
			I have no time for your time!  Be gone!

					DEBORAH (UNSEEN)
				(desperate)
			Lasher - please...!  Save us!  Bring us through!

					LASHER THE MAN
				(suddenly vicious)
			BE GONE! - or I will send you where there are no worlds at all!
			GO!

The WIND dies.  SILENCE.  He turns and sees ROWAN dragging herself toward the pool.  He strides
over and drags her away.
	
					ROWAN
				(tries to shake free of him) 
			Let me go...  Michaelllllll...

					LASHER THE MAN
			ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is 
			gone!

					ROWAN
				(venomous. spitting it out) 
			I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -

					LASHER THE MAN
				(stunned. sincerely wounded)
			'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?

She twists out of his grasp and sprawls on the ground.  Glaring up at him.  And then -

The WIND comes up again.  Whipping the leaves around. Gathering force.  LASHER looks to the 
sky,  perplexed, surprised.  His newborn eyes wide and curious...

					SUZANNE (UNSEEN)
			Rowan - he has cheated us all?  (pause)  You are the thirteenth.  
			Use your anger.  Use the power!  USE US!

ROWAN slowly rises, as if pulled up.  The sky darkens. The WIND swirls.  LASHER watches like a
child, turning round and round - and stares now into his mother's eyes.

					LASHER THE MAN
				(soft)
			Mother...

ROWAN glares it him.  Her body seems to harden.  Her eyes flare.  LIGHTNING FLASHES - and a
hard rain pours down.  LASHER'S expression changes.  Doubt...?  Fear...?

					LASHER THE MAN
				(sott. heartrending)
			I am your flesh... These are your eyes...

But she is steel.  More than steel.  She is an energy the earth has not known before...  And he
sees it in her fact.  His melancholy smile comes.

					LASHER THE MAN 
				(tender. loving)
			I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.

					ROWAN
				(eerily soft)
			I know.  (pause)  you are my son -

LASHER almost melts at her words.  He reaches out to her -

					ROWAN
				(turning cold as death)
			- and may god forgive me.

He freezes - arms outstretched, mouth agape.  She looks to the sky.

					ROWAN
				(imperious)
			Now!  NOW!!!

The WIND is whipped into a frenzy...  A branch is torn from a tree - and crashes into LASHER. 
He stumbles.  Thorned bushes are ripped from the ground and tear at his flesh.  His blood 
runs...

In the sky, a doten whirling funnels appear descending like avenging WINDS.  LASHER watches - 
his face darkening.  ROWAN'S arms rise pointing majestically like a conductor directing a 
terrible symphony of destruction. The tunnels follow her movements, whirling and gliding... And
terror rains down on LASHER

TREES, FLAGSTONE, ROCKS, THE WROGHT-IRON FENCE - EVERYTHING IS BEING UPROOTED, TORN APART - AND
SENT WHIRLING, SLASHING, AND CRASHING DOWN ON LASHER. He falls to the ground.

					LASHER THE MAN
			MOTHER   MY FLESH!!!  DO NOT DO THIS!

ROWAN is ominous - eyes riveted on him.  She points to the house - and it starts to come apart.
SHINGLES, TIMBERS, WINDOWS... TEARING LOOSE, FLYING THROUGH THEl AIR -  SHOWERING DOWN ON  
LASHER --- RIPPING HIM APART.


					LASHER THE MAN
			The pain...  my beautiful flesh!

Flesh tearing off bones! bones pulled from sockets.  His very being coming apart, 
disintegrating.  His cries begin to fade in the cacophony.  ROWAN' S eyes never leave him.   
Her arms swing round and she points at what remains at her son...  The funnels descend on 
LASHER in a frenzy. Everything is obscured by the cloud of dust ard matter... Than - a final, 
fading SHRIEK come. - and than --- SILENCE..

ROWAN's hands drop to her side...  She seems to lessen... to settle back into herself.  The 
funnels fade... the dust settles... and where LASHER  lay - NOTHING... The garden is gone.  The
mansion is gone.  Total destruction.

ROWAN comes out of her trance.
She races to the pool and dives in and resurfaces with MICHAEL'S lifeless body.  She drags him
up onto the ground - and frantically tries to revive him over and over again.

Finally - she SMASHES his chest as she did long ago - but MICHAEL lies still.  She drops upon
him, exhausted - weeping, inconsolable... Then -- she looks up to the sky - fury and tears in
her eyes.

					ROWAN
			You betrayed him!  All of you!  Look!  LOOK AT HIM!!!  He 
			believed there was goodnese in you - and you BETRAYED 
			him!

She stands, seething - like a volcano about to erupt.  Thinking.  Focusing.  Something is 
coming together inside her...  she is remarkable.  She reaches to the sky  -

					ROWAN
			I AM THE  THIRTEENTH!  I AM THE KEY!   COME THROUGH 
			THE DOOR!  ALL OF YOU - COME - THROUGH - THE - DOOR!

And the fabric of the sky tears... An ererald haze shows beyond it... Arid the PHANTOM-WITCHES
come soaring through the gash in the world - speeding toward their mistress...

					ROWAN
			All of us are one - from  the beginning to now!  So I command you -
			come into me!  Mlake THIRTEEN ONE!

AND THE WITCHES SWOOP DOWN - AND DIVE INTO ROWAN - FILL HER - BECOME HER.  SHE BRIMS WITH 
POWER.  ALMOST A CELESTIAL GLOW.

She kneels beside MICHAEL, takes his hands and presses them against her heart.  Her tears 
cascade down her cheeks...

					ROWAN
			Come back to me, Michael.  Please, Michael --- come back.  I love you 
			I LOVE YOU, MICHAEL!  Oh, God - COME BACK TO ME!

She leans down and kissea him - deeply, deep as their love - long, long, long...

And ---
MICHAEL opens his eyes.  Rasping, coughing, shaking with the new life Rowna has given him...
ROWAN, on her knees, lifts him up and cradles his head in her chest...

					MICHAEL
				(barely a whisper)
			Lasher...  Where --- where is ---

					ROWAN
				(loving. soothing) 
			It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.

SLOW ZOOM INTO ROWAN'S FACE

					ROWAN
			Everything's gone, Michael.  Everything except for us.  (pause) 
			But we're here.   Together.  You and I...

HOLD ON ECU OF ROWAN

She smiles strangely, and --- HER FACE FLICKERS....  AND THEN, FROM SOME NEW INNER CURRENT, HER
FACE STROBES B1ZARRELY WITH THE FACES OF TWELVE OTHERS WHO CAME LONG BEFORE HER...

					ROWAN
				(very very softly)
			Just you and...

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
