Battlestar Galactaca

FADE IN
ON A STARFIELD
A myriad glowing jewels of light...and a stillness that is both friend
and enemy...
Suddenly, a full-throated burst of a single chord played by a symphony
orchestra as we see superimposed over the starfield, the words:
GALACTICA
Saga of a Star World
Then as the lettering drifts off into space, the chord begins to
diminish until it is only sustained by the ethereal high pitched
strains of a muted string section and a voice speaks to us against
the ever present stars...
ADAMA'S VOICE
Thousands of years ago, colonies were established throughout the
universe by a mother race from the far reaches of space...This race
of people was known as humanoid...human beings...An unsubjugatable,
resourceful people who loved freedom, adventure... even conflict...
Now, in the seventh millennium of time, a solemn and dramatic event
is taking place...A peace envoy, representing the twelve known
colonies of man, moves through space in hopes of bringing to a close
a thousand year war tat has seen the humans embattled by an alliance
of beings...bent on their destruction...The mission of the colonial
fleet would bring the star world a new beginning...or...
AGAINST THE STARFIELD
superimpose the words:
THE END
A SLEEK FIGHTER PLANE
blasts onto the screen
ON THE SMILING FACE OF ZAC
A bright, enthusiastic , young (23) fighter pilot closeted in the
super modern, form-fitting cockpit of his sleek ship...the finest
fighting craft in the Colonial Fleet...
ZAC
Two targets on my scanner...just above the old moon, Cimtar.
INSIDE A SECOND SHIP ON ANOTHER FACE
older (30)... a hint of cynicism as he glances at his scanner.
SKYLER
Probably a Cylon patrol...
ZAC
Awful long way from home...Where's their base ship...
SKYLER
No base ship...Long range reconnaissance craft... Strange, I'm not
picking up anything but static beyond those guys...
INSERT
Two blips on the front side of a steady field of static
interference...
ZAC
Me too...I thought it was my scanner...
SKYLER
Could be a storm...The fleet will be coming right through it... We'd
better go have a look...Kick in the turbos...
INSIDE ZAC'S SHIP
ZAC
Skyler...the standing orders on conserving fuel specifically forbid
use of turbos, except under battle conditions...
SKYLER
Kid...You're on the front lines now...anything goes...
SKYLER
pushes three buttons and shoves his foot to the floor. The resulting
blast drives him back against the seat.
SKYLER'S FIGHTER
bursts ahead, rolling over and out across the sky.
SOMEPLACE IN THE SKY AMONGST THE STARS
ON A FLEET OF WARSHIPS
Five flying battlestars...As we draw closer, the scale and enormity
of the machines becomes increasingly impressive...
CLOSER
raking along the bridge level of one ship until we come to a name
emblazoned on the side of the graceful machine..
ATLANTIA
INSIDE A DINING CHAMBER
one half of which looks out on the most spectacular sight ever
witnessed by man...the universe...a giant starfield in all its
majesty...In the center of the room is a long table at which the
center of attention is a bearded man whose face glows with the
warmth and wisdom of the ages. He raises a silver chalice and the
twelve gentlemen around him, clad in Roman-like toga and tunic tops
over tighter fitting pants and boots, come to rapt attention...
OLD MAN
Gentlemen...I know you are all anxious to return to your ships before
our rendezvous with the Cylons, but I think it appropriate to toast
the most significant event in the history of man...I'd like to raise
my chalice to you...
We study the study, dignified faces of twelve men, flanking the old
man...six to a side...their features betraying substantive
differences...They are red, black, yellow, white...indeed, every
variation...
PRESIDENT
Not merely the quorum of the twelve, representing the twelve colonies
of man, but my friends...and the greatest leaders ever assembled...As
we approach the seventh millennium of time, the human race will at
last know peace...Thanks to you...
As the are about to salute, each with his own chalice, another voice
is heard...
BALTAR
Inappropriate...
Faces swing Baltar's way...startled by his impudence...
BALTAR
I say we lift our cups to he, who has for the first time, brought the
dissident races of mankind together to speak as one before the
Alliance...To President Adar and to peace...
Even the humble attempt at quelling the voices cannot deny these men
their measure of gratitude...the cups are raised and the Old Man
joins in...
PRESIDENT
To peace...at long last...
POINT OF VIEW FROM A COLONIAL FIGHTER PLANE COCKPIT
of a large space vehicle looming up ahead, floating above a layer of
clouds...
SKYLER'S VOICE
What is it...
ZAC
pulling back on the throttle, slowing...He puts the vehicle on the
scanner and punches up a combination...
ZAC
Tell ya' in a flash...
ON ZAC'S SCANNER
On one side of the screen, we see the Cylon space vehicle. On the
other side of the screen, we see a series of airship profile
silhouettes racing by. Finally, an image stops. It is a match. A
great deal of printing appears below the silhouettes in an
unfamiliar text.
ZAC
Warbook says a Cylon tanker. Scanner reads it empty.
SKYLER
What's an empty tanker doing out here?
ZAC
And where's the other ship?
SKYLER
Screened off by this one. Wonder what they're hiding?
ZAC
I don't know, but it's awfully close to that storm.
SKYLER
We came to look...
ZAC
Be careful, Skyler. I have a funny feeling about this...
SKYLER
You're not old enough to have funny feelings! Besides while we're
stuck out on patrol, Starbuck's pulled a couple of those Geminis'
into a card game. I want to get back before he cleans them out.
SKYLER'S SHIP
begins to peel off to sweep around the freighter...
ON ANOTHER BATTLESTAR IN THE FLEET
its name... "Galactica"
INSIDE A PILOTS' READY ROOM
A Spartan, standby area for fighter pilots. Camera moves past a young
man in flight clothes, sleeping...another reading...and as we come to
the end of the room, a group stand behind one side of a circular card
table, forming a gallery for a handsome young man called Starbuck,
who eyes his round playing cards with wily skill.
STARBUCK
(with feigned ease)
Just to keep the game instructive, and because you're new to it, I'll
only wager...
Starbuck pushes half of his square cubits of gold in front of him.
The two men look, then whisper. A confident smile passes amongst the
gallery.
GEMON
Despite the humbleness of this hand...for the honor of our home
colony, Gemini, we must challenge you.
The young man pushes forth a measure of golden cubits, equal to the
pot. The gallery tenses.
GEMON
And for the glory of our colony, another equal measure.
Gemon pushes out another pile, in effect, doubling the stakes. The
gallery holds its collective breath. Starbuck feigns continued ease.
STARBUCK
Well, in the name of our home planet, Caprica, and for her
everlasting glory, I'll measure your increase and double it.
The gallery gulps as Starbuck pushes in his remaining cubits and
turns to them.
STARBUCK
(sotto voice)
Come on, come on, guys, up with the rest of it...
BOOMER
Could we speak with you for a moment. In private?
(To the Geminis)
Only be a flash, fellas...
Boomer, a trim-looking black man; Jolly, a hefty hunk of a guy, and
Greenbean, a stringbean of a flyer next to him, face the now-standing
Starbuck and speak to him through clenched teeth and heated whispers.
BOOMER
Are you crazy...?
STARBUCK
(sotto voice)
Weren't you listening? This is for the glory of Caprica. Doesn't that
mean anything to you?
The gallery stares at Starbuck blankly.
STARBUCK
Look, have I ever steered you guys wrong?
The gallery continues to stare blankly.
STARBUCK
(sotto voice)
All right...look at it this way. We'll double our money! They're
trying to buy the pot.
JOLLY
(sotto voice)
You told us these Geminis didn't understand the game.
BOOMER
(sotto)
They caught on fast. Now, come on, or we lose everything we've got in
that game.
Reluctantly, the gallery comes up with an additional measure of gold
cubits. Starbuck pushes them out onto the table and turns his cards
over.
BOOMER
Beat that.
The Gemmon smiles and places his cards on the table. Boomer and the
gallery stare at the cards, stricken as the Gemon rakes in the golden
cubits.
IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DINING ROOM
The men have adjourned their meeting and now cluster in twos and
threes, chatting amicably.
THE PRESIDENT
grips the arm and hand of Baltar.
PRESIDENT
This armistice conference would not have been possible without your
tireless work, Baltar. You have secured for yourself a place in the
history books.
Baltar smiles humbly.
BALTAR
That the Cylons chose me as their liaison to the quorum of the twelve
was an act of providence, not skill.
The old man notices Commander Adama standing alone at the huge window
to space. The Commander is a strong man with sharp features and
penetrating eyes...still a softness in his bearing.
ON THE COMMANDER
looking out, a troubled look on his face, as the President moves up
behind him
PRESIDENT
I see the party isn't a huge success with all my children.
ADAMA
It's what awaits us out there that troubles me.
PRESIDENT
Surely, you don't cling to your suspicions about the Cylons. They
asked for this armistice. They want peace.
ADAMA
Forgive me, Mr. President, but they hate humans with every fiber of
their existence. We love freedom. We love independence. To feel, to
question. To rebel against oppression. It's an alien way of existing
they will never accept.
PRESIDENT
But they have. Through Baltar, they have sued for peace.
ADAMA
swings a sober look back to the President
ADAMA
Yes. Of course, you're right.
POINT OF VIEW
A tanker in space. Moving around it, we see a second tanker appear
just above the cloud layer.
SKYLER'S FIGHTER
sweeps around and slows
SKYLER
There's the other ship tucked in nice and neat. Now what is she, and
what's she doing?
Skyler punches the buttons.
HIS SCANNER
refusing to read the ship. Figures and symbols appear in a hopeless
jumble.
SKYLER
I can't read anything inside. She's jamming us.
ZAC
Warbook says she's a freighter.
SKYLER
My foot. If she's jamming us, she's hiding something. I'm going around
her.
ZAC
(alarmed)
That'll put you smack in the storm. If it's asteroids, it'll rip us
apart.
SKYLER
Not us, kid. You stay put. I don't want it said that I taught my kid
brother bad habits on his first patrol.
SKYLER
swings his ship over and head directly into the cloud cover.
ZAC'S VOICE
The jamming is knocking out my scanner. Where are you, Skyler?
SKYLER SCANS THE HORIZON
obscured by clouds racing past him.
SKYLER
Nothing but a harmless cloud cover. Not heavy at all. I don't see why
they'd send up all that electronic...
Skyler looks down. His face freezes. His eyes widen in disbelief...
ZAC'S VOICE
Skyler? What's going on?
SKYLER'S POINT OF VIEW
He has flown into the middle of a Cylon staging area. Wall to wall
warships as far as the eye can see. We push in close to one of the
ships...
INSIDE THE CYLON ATTACK FIGHTER
a triad of Cylon Centurians. Two helmeted pilots sit side-by-side, a
third between them, slightly higher and back. Their helmets are
tubular shaped with a narrow aperture where one might have expected
eyes. In their stead, a fine beam of light sweeps back and forth, an
ominous, ever-aware presence. The Cylon swings a look o.s. He
points...
ZAC'S SHIP
with the Cylon ships in pursuit.
ON THE LEAD CYLON FIGHTER
racing ahead, firing
ON SKYLER
SKYLER
They're jamming our transmission, kid. We've got to get back. It's an
ambush, and they've got enough fire power to destroy the entire fleet.
ON THE FLEET
as a small shuttlecraft approaches the Galactica from the rear.
POINT OF VIEW
of the Galactica from the shuttlecraft to establish two large carrier
deck areas tucked into pods on either side of the immense ship. We
are dipping down and to the left to land in the left side of the
vessel.
ON COMMANDER ADAMA
seated beside a beautiful young woman wearing military clothes, who
makes preparations to land the shuttle vehicle. She suddenly reacts
to something in her headset.
ATHENA
Something's wrong.
ADAMA
What is it?
ATHENA
I don't know. They just put the ship on alert.
CLOSER POINT OF VIEW
of the landing deck with large, strobing lights arrowing the way in
and affording a final stopping point on the deck's surface within the
bowels of the battlestar. As we draw closer...closer
EXPLOSIONS ROCK THE STARFIELD
as the colony fighters cream through space under attack from behind
ON ZAC
frightened as he takes a hit
ZAC
Skyler...they knocked out my port engine.
SKYLER
We're not going to make it giving them our backs. How many of 'em can
you make out?
ZAC
Four...
SKYLER
They only sent four after us? That's insulting.
ZAC
I don't know, Skyler. I think they're doing awfully well...
SKYLER
Only because they're behind us. When I count three, hit your reverse
thrusters and maximum breaking flaps. We'll give them a little
surprise. One...two...three...
They hit their reverse thrusters. A roar goes off...
ON THE CYLON FIGHTERS
as they scream past the colony warplanes
INSIDE THE LEAD CYLON CRAFT
the three pilots crane in confusion to figure out what happened. They
look all around the sky.
ON SKYLER
as he narrows his eyes and puts his finger on a fire control button
on his steering column.
SKYLER
Right here, you creepy, crawly creature...
He squeezes the trigger...
POINT OF VIEW - AHEAD
as Skyler's torpedo lasers streak off into the Cylon ship dead ahead,
disintegrating it in a mighty fireball.
ON SKYLER
SKYLER
Yaa Hoooo....
ON ZAC
swinging back and forth, lining up his target. He fires.
THE CYLON SHIP
disintegrates. Ahead of it, the remaining two Cylon fighters divide
and veer off.
ON SKYLER
SKYLER
Not bad for a little brother. You go after the guys on the right.
The two fighters split, swinging off after the two Cylon fighters.
ON THE BRIDGE
Commander Adama enters. Colonel Tigh is watching the scanners
intently.
ADAMA
What is it?
TIGH
Our patrol ran into trouble. We picked up some signals, but they're
being jammed.
ADAMA
What kind of trouble?
TIGH
Can't tell yet. Could be pirates, smugglers, or...
Their eyes meet. The Commander walks to the large observation point
looking out on the starfield.
ADAMA
Get me the President.
IN A READY ROOM - CLOSE ON A CARD HAND
Starbuck sits down at the card table, a small grin appearing on his
face. He pushes a large stack of cubits out into the center of the
table.
STARBUCK
Ok, guys, one hand. Sudden death.
The gentlemen from Gemini consider the odds and push an equal amount
of cubits to the center of the table.
GEMON
Sudden death!!
Starbuck flashes a fiendish, child-like grin and begins to deal the
cards.
ON THE FLIGHT BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
ADAMA
Our patrol is under attack, Mr. President. We're not sure by whom.
The President appears on a monitor. Baltar is beside him.
ADAMA
As a precautionary measure, I'd like to launch intercept fighters...
Baltar leans into the President, whispering to him. The President
nods.
PRESIDENT
Quite right, Baltar. Commander, as a precautionary measure, I insist
upon restraint. If this turns out to be an encounter with some outlaw
traffic, we could jeopardize the entire cause of peace by displaying
fighters when we are so close to our rendezvous.
ADAMA
Mister President, two of my aircraft are under armed attack.
PRESIDENT
By forces unknown. You are not to launch until the situation is more
clear.
ADAMA
Sir, may I at least urge you to bring the fleet to a state of alert?
PRESIDENT
I will consider it. Thank you, Commander.
The screen goes black.
TIGH
He'll consider it? Has he lost his mind?
ADAMA
Colonel...
The Colonel looks quickly around at the hushed bridge, quite
embarrassed at his own outburst.
TIGH
I'm sorry, Commander, it's just that...well...
ADAMA
Yes, Colonel? What is it?
TIGH
The patrol is under the command of Captain Skyler.
ADAMA
Well, if I can't have confidence in my eldest son, who can I depend
on?
TIGH
Zac is with him. His first patrol.
This news weighs heavy on the Commander.
ON ZAC
as he fires and misses a Cylon fighter veering off and falling behind
him. Suddenly, he is the target.
ZAC
Skyler...
ON SKYLER
as he looks off, sees the confrontation off to one side of him
SKYLER
Keep them interested just a little longer...
ON ZAC
as the sky is exploding all around him
ZAC
Believe me, they're interested.
An explosion rocks Zac's plane.
ZAC
There goes another engine...
ON SKYLER
He zeros in on the Cylon plane from the side, swinging his ship to
come at the Cylon's plane on a perpendicular intersecting course.
SKYLER
Steady...steady...just don't look this way, guys...
IN THE CYLON PLANE
as they continue to focus on Zac. Suddenly, the pilot closest to
Skyler's side chances to swing his look out to the right.
POINT OF VIEW - THE CYLON'S
A colony fighter plane is coming right for him
THE CYLON
chatters frantically. The other two pilots turn to look.
ON SKYLER'S PLANE
as he fires torpedo lasers
THE CYLON PLANE
disintegrates
SKYLER
sighs with relief
SKYLER
The day those guys can outfight us without a ten-to-one margin...
ON ZAC
He is looking across the sky
ZAC
Skyler...better look at your scanner.
SKYLER
looks...
THE SCANNER
shows a solid wave of targets coming from somewhere in the distance.
SKYLER
But a thousand-to-one is hardly fair...
ZAC
What does it mean, Skyler?
SKYLER
It means there isn't going to be any peace. There may not be anything
if we don't warn the fleet.
ZAC
You go, Skyler. I'm short two engines. I won't be able to keep up
with you.
SKYLER
I can't leave you, Zac.
ZAC
You have to...and I'll be all right. If I put my foot in that turbo,
I'll make it back ahead of them. Now go on. You've got to warn the 
fleet.
A sober mood descends across Skyler's face.
SKYLER
You can fly with me any time, kid. Good luck.
Skyler punches the buttons and the roar of the turbo thruster
responds.
ZAC
Come on, baby, give me all you can.
He pushes the stick forward and moves off at a much slower speed.
ON THE FLIGHT BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
TIGH
Still nothing from the fighters, sir. Their transmission is being
deliberately jammed. If we don't launch...
ADAMA
We cannot launch when it has been expressly forbidden...
(on everyone's tense look)
This might, however, be an appropriate time to order a test of our
battle stations drill...
The bridge command smiles...
ADAMA
Sound the alert, Colonel!!!
IN THE READY ROOM
On a hand as it is turned over. All one color, all one symbol. A
pyramid.
STARBUCK
You may never see another one, fellas... A perfect pyramid.
ON GEMON
as he turns to his associate in sullen disbelief. Suddenly A CLAXON
blares loudly through the room. A book reader jumps up...a sleeper
wakes up...He slaps it to the top of the remaining deck, scattering
the cards.
GEMON
Unfortunate. We'll have to replay hand at later date. Duty calls.
Gemon whips a battle helmet from the floor and scoops half the pot on
the table into it, takes off, his compadre right behind him.
STARBUCK
Come back here, you little...Somebody stop him...!
But all hands charge for the doors, grabbing helmets and flight kits.
ON THE CATAPULT DECK
A vacuum tube races along the ceiling of a long, narrow chamber in
which countless fighter ships sit side by side in powerful launching
cribs. As the vehicle within the overhead vacuum tube progresses down
the flight line, pilots emerge from chutes leading from the overhead
tube, then race on foot for their individual fighter craft. Ground
teams are already on hand preparing the lethal-looking planes for
immediate launch.
STARBUCK
emerges from his drop and runs to the cockpit of his plane. A member
of the ground crew looks up from where he is hurriedly preparing the
cockpit.
CREWMAN
What's going on?
STARBUCK
Nothing to worry about. Probably some kind of aerial salute for the
President as they sign the armistice.
The crewman kicks a switch and Starbuck's plane beings to whine, the
pitch getting higher and higher.
ON ZAC
racing against time as his ship limps back toward safety
A WALL OF CYLON FIGHTERS
closing the gap. They begin to open fire.
ZAC
reacts to the explosions around him
ON SKYLER
racing in from space
SKYLER'S POINT OF VIEW
The flight deck of the Galactica as his fighter makes its approach
ON THE BRIDGE
TIGH
A single fighter approaching, Commander.
The Commander turns and moves to the scanner board where several
operatives sit watch.
OPERATIVE
Sir, long range scanner picks up large number of craft moving this
way at high speed.
The Commander and Colonel exchange rapid glances and hurry to the
scanner.
ADAMA
Get that pilot up here as soon as he lands. Get the President back on
the codebox.
ON THE PRESIDENT ON THE BRIDGE OF THE ATLANTIA
PRESIDENT
Yes, Commander?
ADAMA
Mister President, a wall of unidentified craft are closing towards
the fleet.
Baltar leans towards the President
BALTAR
Possibly a Cylon welcoming committee.
ADAMA
May I suggest that at the very least, we launch a welcoming committee
of our own?
BALTAR
Mister President, there remain many hostile feelings amongst our
Warriors. The likelihood of an unfortunate incident with all those
pilots in the sky at once...
PRESIDENT
A good point, Baltar. Did you hear that, Commander?
Adama is beside himself.
ADAMA
No, Mister President, I can't possibly have heard correctly. Did
Count Baltar suggest we allow our forces to sit here totally
defenseless?
PRESIDENT
Commander, we are on a peace mission. The first peace man has known
in a thousand years.
ON ZAC
Explosions charge the sky around him. He takes another hit. He
pales...
ZAC
Come on, baby, not much further...
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
ADAMA
Mister President...
He is interrupted by Colonel Tigh with a report.
TIGH
A lone ship is coming under attack from the main force approaching
the fleet.
ADAMA
Did you hear that, Mister President. Your welcoming committee is
firing at our patrol.
PRESIDENT
Firing at our patrol? How do you explain that, Baltar?
He looks around.
PRESIDENT
Baltar! Baltar!
But Baltar has left the bridge.
ZAC'S POINT OF VIEW
The fleet is not far away now. 
ZAC
smiles
ZAC
We made it...
ON THE CYLON FIGHTERS
closing in on Zac, three to one.
POINT OF VIEW TO ZAC
as they line up on him for the kill
ON ZAC
ZAC
Blue flight two...in trouble. Request emergency approach.
ON THE CYLON SHIPS
as they fire
ON ZAC'S SHIP
as it explodes into infinity
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
Athena comes out horrified
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE ATLANTIA
PRESIDENT
What was that?
ON ADAMA ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
as he suffers the implications of the shattered patrol ship
ADAMA
That was my son, Mister President.
ON THE CYLONS
as they streak towards the fleet, opening fire
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
as countless Cylon fighters streak by, firing salvo after salvo.
Commander Adama looks out at the starfield suddenly alive with fires
and destruction, as a large battle wagon explodes beyond the
Galactica.
ADAMA
Launch fighters.
INSIDE THE BOWELS OF THE GALACTICA ON THE LAUNCHING DECK
as claxon blares
ON STARBUCK
as a red light goes on on his dash. He lowers the canopy. The ground
crewman steps back, signaling a control tower high above. As he runs
for cover, there is a hiss of steam and a blast as the ship roars out
of its crib.
ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE GALACTICA
as fighter after fighter begins to launch from the side of the huge
ship, angling diagonally off into space and into the attack.
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
TIGH
Fighters launched, Commander.
ADAMA
Have any of the other ships gotten planes off?
TIGH
No, sir.
ADAMA
Lord help us.
ON THE LANDING DECK OF THE GALACTICA
Skyler is climbing hurriedly out of his ship.
ATHENA
moves to him on the dead run
ATHENA
Skyler, thank heavens you're all right.
She tried to crush into his arms. He is sympathetic, but stoic, and
in a hurry to report.
SKYLER
I've got to go back for Zac. It's an ambush. They jammed our
communicators. You tell Commander Adama there were no base ships.
He'll understand what I'm saying.
ATHENA 
Skyler...
SKYLER
Athena, just listen and tell Adama that it's more than just an attack.
The Cylon base ships are missing. That means they're up to something
diabolical. Now I've got to go back for Zac.
As he turns to charge away
ATHENA
You don't have to go back.
Skyler spins around. His tone is positive, but his expression is
uncertain.
SKYLER
You mean he's all right! One of the other ships picked him up!
Tears begin to roll down Athena's cheek.
ATHENA
No...
Skyler sucks in his breath and stares at Athena emotionlessly, then
turns away as she cries.
SKYLER
I guess I can give my report to Adama himself
He turns to move off
ATHENA
Your report? Is that all you can say? Zac's dead.
Skyler looks back
SKYLER
We'll probably all be dead soon.
Skyler steels himself against the pain, turns and exits up the metal
staircase.
ON THE LANDING DECK 
On Skyler as he enters the bridge of the Galactica. Adama is quick to
move to him and embrace him. Skyler tenses up.
ADAMA
You didn't have any choice.
Skyler pulls away
SKYLER
There were no base ships, only attack craft. Maybe a thousand,
hovering over Cimtar.
The Colonel moves up
TIGH
A thousand? You must be mistaken, Captain. Fighters couldn't function
this far from Cylon without base ships. They don't carry enough fuel.
The Captain looks off thoughtfully
SKYLER
We picked up an empty tanker on our scanner. It's my guess the Cylons
used it to refuel for the attack after flying to that point from
wherever their base ships are.
The Commander ponders that as the Colonel shakes his head skeptically
TIGH
Why operate that far from base ships when it isn't necessary. They
would have been well out of our range at the old moon.
A grim revelations descends across Adama's face
ADAMA
Unless it was more important that the base ships be someplace else.
Get me the President.
We read an ominous, foreboding look in Commander Adama's eyes
ON THE CYLON BASE SHIPS
Three large, circular aircraft hover in the sky above the planet
Caprica
IN THE LARGE CIRCULAR CHAMBER
lighted by very subdued, indirect sources. A door opens on a side and
two large, armored men move in wearing Cylon scanning helmets. They
cross until they come to a pedestal in the center of the chamber.
There, a creature sits with its back to us. The two men stop.
CENTURIAN
By your command.
IMPERIOUS LEADER
Speak.
CENTURIAN
All base ships are now in range to attack the Colonies.
ON THE IMPERIOUS LEADER
A truly inhuman form sitting amidst robes and peering at the two
figures standing at attention through a multiplicity of eyes
IMPERIOUS LEADER
The final annihilation of the life form known as man. Let the attack
begin.
ON A CYLON BASE SHIP
as large doors begin to open along the circular ship's entire
perimeter
ON A CYLON WARSHIP
as it launches from the aperture, and next to it, another and another
A WIDER ANGLE ON THE STARFIELD
to include three of the base ships, each launching her attack ships
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE ATLANTIA
fires raging all around. The President looks on, horrified as Adama
comes on a monitor
ADAMA
Mister President, I request permission to leave the fleet. I've
reason to suspect our home planets may face imminent attack.
The President takes these words like a death blow. He suddenly leans
against a bridge wall.
PRESIDENT
No. Pray you're mistaken. How could I have been so completely wrong.
I've led the entire human race to ruin.
ADAMA
You didn't lead us to this disaster, Mister President. But we were
led.
PRESIDENT
Baltar? No, Commander. I don't believe it. I won't...
With that, an explosion rips the command bridge open, engulfing it in
flame
ON ADAMA
as the monitor reflects the inferno, then goes blank
ADAMA
Mister President! Mister President!
All eyes swing from the monitor to the starfield, where the flagship
can be seen cruising a thousand yards away, its bridge aflame, its
flight deck alive with fires. Suddenly, the entire ship bursts apart,
disintegrating into a thousand torches hurdling through space. For an
instant, there is stunned silence on the bridge of the Galactica,
then as other Cylon ships roar by, firing at the Galactica, Colonel
Tigh moves up.
TIGH
Our long-range scanners have picked up Cylon base ships here, here
and here, putting them well within range of the planets Virgon,
Sagitara, and
Commander Adama, Athena, and Colonel Tigh look on as technicians plot
the course of the Galactica and enemy base ships on a large
translucent starfield map
ADAMA
Yes, Caprica.
The impact hits Athena
ADAMA
Helm, bring us around. We're withdrawing. Colonel, flank speed for
home.
ATHENA
Father, what are you doing?
SKYLER
You can't leave our Warriors!
ADAMA
(reluctantly)
We have to leave them to defend the fleet. Those with enough fuel
left will catch up.
ATHENA
And what about the others?
TIGH
At the very least, let us transmit our intentions. Give them a chance
to conserve what fuel they can.
ADAMA
No. If we have any advantage left, it's surprise.
ATHENA
Father, you're killing them!
ADAMA
Skyler!
Skyler moves to Athena to quell her mounting emotion.
ON STARBUCK
in his ship
STARBUCK
Boomer...
ON BOOMER
BOOMER
I see it.
JOLLY
Where's she going?
GREENBEAN
Hey, you guys, what's going on? The Galactica's pulling out!
ON STARBUCK
STARBUCK
There's got to be a good reason.
GREENBEAN
Sure, it's dangerous around here. Heads up, Boomer, you've got a pair
on your tail.
JOLLY
Pull up, Boomer. I'll try to get him off.
Starbuck looks back at the departing battle wagon, Galactica
STARBUCK
(introspectively)
There's got be a good reason...
ON THE GALACTICA
moving off away from the embattled colonial forces, most of the big
ships in flames
THE BRIDGE OFFICER
calls out from the communications board
BRIDGE OFFICER
Electronic jamming has stopped
SKYLER
They're clearing the air for their electronic guidance systems.
TIGH
That means the attack is under way.
BRIDGE OFFICER
No, sir, we're picking up long-range video satellite signals.
Everything looks perfectly normal at home.
All eyes swing to multiple monitors above the communications board.
ON THE MONITORS
An aerial view of Caprica with its pyramid-oriented architecture...
modern, strong. A beautiful day, as seen from various heights; from a
single downtown area, to a city, to an entire sector of the planet...
BRIDGE OFFICER
We have ordinary broadcast transmission coming up on four
TIGH
Commander, perhaps...perhaps we're in time. Perhaps the Cylon attack
on our fleet was a dissident faction, a small, anti-peace movement
ON MONITOR FOUR
a handsome young woman speaks to a camera from a garden spot, just in
front of an all-glass building set within a shopping mall
LYRA
Just ordinary people going to and from work, behaving not as if this
were the most significant day in all history, but rather as they would
on any other day. So far, details of the armistice meetings going on
at this very moment on the Star Kobol are not coming in as hoped for
because of an unusual electrical storm blocking out all interstellar
communication. However, as soon as available, you will see the first
pictures of what has been described as the most significant event...
A loud explosion from far away thumps through in the background.
People all around Orin suddenly turn and look, pointing, staring,
some beginning to shout.
LYRA
Excuse me, something happened. Perhaps some of you heard it...an
explosion of some kind... People are staring off in that direction.
Let's see if we can...
Lyra begins to move out across the garden, camera going with her...
getting jostled by a growing crowd.
CAMERA POINT OF VIEW
sees a fireball rising from the horizon beyond the city. Suddenly,
there is another...
LYRA
Oh, my God...a tremendous explosion...two of them... Are we getting
it on camera? People are beginning to run in all directions...
ON THE STREET WITH LYRA - LIVE
Suddenly, a Cylon warship streaks across the sky, firing laser
torpedoes. The buildings just beyond Lyra suddenly explode into
fireballs, rocking the street and sending Lyra falling, crashing
into the greenery.
LYRA
Ladies and gentlemen...it's terrible...someone is bombing the city...
BACK ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
Everyone on the bridge stares in shock at the visual and emotional
impact of watching their homeland being destroyed. A bridge officer
moves up with a report
BRIDGE OFFICER
Commander, the long-range scanners are picking up wave after wave of
small ships heading towards all of the inner planets.
Everyone on the bridge stares helplessly.
BACK IN THE MALL
on the surface of Caprice. Lyra reacts to a fighter swinging low over
the city, firing in her direction. She looks all around for cover, is
bumped and pushed, as people scramble in all directions.
LYRA
It's hopeless... People are dying all around me.. I see a small
child...running for his...Look out!
Lyra suddenly throws down her microphone...the camera being hand-held
by an engineer, swings around on her as she streaks towards a small
boy running with his dog from the path of a streaking attack fighter.
Lyra dives, pushing the child out of the path of the laser blast which
continues on up the street, devastating her camera crew. A second wave
of fighters screams by, completing the destruction, sending columns
and pillars of concrete crashing all around...
ON THE RUBBLE
as Lyra attempts to dig her way out, rising up with immediate concern
for the small form concealed beneath her
LYRA
Don't try to move...
The small boy pokes his head up, crying. Lyra comforts him, pulling
him to her
LYRA
Everything's going to be all right...
BOXEY
Muffit. Where's Muffit?
LYRA
Who?
BOXEY
My daggit. My daggit. Where is he?
LYRA
Your daggit? Oh, I'm sure he's fine...
Lyra swings her head around, looking. Suddenly, her eyes fix on
something o.s.
LYRA'S POINT OF VIEW
A pillar lies broken amidst other fallen building material and,
protruding from beneath the debris, a small dog lying motionless, not
breathing.
ON LYRA AND BOXEY
Lyra turns Boxey around, screening him from seeing the animal.
LYRA
I think I saw him run this way. Let's go look.
BOXEY
I want Muffit! Is he all right?
Lyra holds the boy close to her
LYRA
Sure...he's all right...everything is all right...everything is going
to be just fine...
She rocks the young lad in her arms, pondering the hollow lie that
leaves her lips as she looks around the city which was proud and
stately only minutes ago.
BACK ON THE GALACTICA BRIDGE As the high level satellite pictures
display the fire and aftermath of total and utter destruction of a
planet. Commander Adama turns from the monitor in defeat. Athena
appears almost comatose, in a dream state
ATHENA
First Zac, now this. They trusted us to protect them...
Adama attempts to draw her to him. She pulls away.
ATHENA
How could you have let it happen...
As she runs from the bridge, Adama looks to Skyler. He returns a
stoic, emotionless gaze.
SKYLER
You had no choice.
The two men momentarily share a common emotion, void of any
satisfaction.
ON ADAMA AND SKYLER
Suddenly, both men are spared further agony by the excited intrusion
of a voice.
BRIDGE OFFICER
Cylon base ships on long-range scanner...launching to all outer
planets
All eyes swing to the scanners, as pictures burst forth on all
screens, each one displaying fighters sweeping in on bombing runs
TIGH
No hope, Commander...
The Commander sinks with each devastating image from the colonies and
turns to communications, a hint of desperation in his voice.
ADAMA
What about Sagitarias? Perhaps there's still time to save...
BRIDGE OFFICER
Sorry, Commander...the planet is in flames.
The Commander pales, seems almost on the verge of collapse
ADAMA
Prepare my shuttle craft.
The Colonel looks at the Commander, startled
TIGH
Shuttle craft?
ADAMA
I'm going down to the surface of Caprica.
TIGH
Commander, that's out of the question! If the Cylon scanners should
pick you up...
ADAMA
You proceed to rendezvous with the survivors of the fleet.
SKYLER
I'll take you, Father, in my fighter. You're the last surviving member
of the Council. If we run into a Cylon attack ship, at least you'll
have a chance...
TIGH
As the man who'd have to fill your shoes, I insist on that, Commander.
ADAMA
Very well. Make preparations...and should I not return...
The Commander and Colonel extend hands, clasping each others' wrists
as they shake hands.
SKYLER 
You will.
ON THE GALACTICA
as a single fighter roars from its launching crib and off across the
starfield. On its departure, the Galactica banks and heads off to
pursue its mission.
ON THE GALACTICA BRIDGE
STARBUCK'S VOICE
(over intercom)
Red leader one...in trouble...in trouble
Colonel Tigh responds
TIGH
Surviving fighter ships rendezvousing, Commander!
ATHENA
We read you, Red leader. How can we assist you?
ON STARBUCK IN HIS SHIP
Sparks are flying all over the cockpit as a piece of instrument panel
dangles from its mooring. Starbuck struggles to keep the wires apart
and halt the dangerous electrical shorting, while at the same time
maintaining his flight attitude. He looks out the window
POINT OF VIEW - HIS PORTSIDE WING
The short, stubby extension that sweeps out after blast-off and
maintains this attitude through landing, is sweeping out and then back
into the aircraft, intermittently.
STARBUCK
Battle damage. Power control circuits shot away.. Give me a systems
analyst on the line
ON ATHENA
ATHENA
I am on the line, Starbuck. What's your condition?
STARBUCK
This is no time from trainees, Athena. I'm in real trouble
ATHENA
You will be if you keep talking like that. What's your fuel?
STARBUCK
Dry.
ATHENA
All right...run the check with me. Alpha circuit, close and
alternating to left servo circuit
Starbuck reaches into the sparking circuit board dangling from beneath
his instrument panel. He closes off a circuit switch.
STARBUCK
Alpha circuit closed and alternating to left servo circuit. No
response. My throttles are still full open.
ATHENA
Omega "C" circuit, closed and alternating to Servo support circuit.
STARBUCK
Alternating to Servo support circuit...
Starbuck is perspiring now. The throttle does not respond.
STARBUCK
Does not respond...
ATHENA
too, is now beginning to perspire
TIGH
Bring him in full throttle. There's no choice.
STARBUCK
I heard him. Get everyone out of the way. I'm coming in hot...ready
or not...
BRIDGE OFFICER
You're cleared to land...
STARBUCK
Roger. I hope you guys aren't counting off for neatness...
BACK ON THE BRIDGE
BRIDGE OFFICER
He'll be coming in like a missile.
TIGH
Clear the flight deck for an emergency landing.
ON STARBUCK IN HIS SHIP
He starts sweating profusely
POINT OF VIEW -STARBUCK'S
The rapidly approaching flight deck, racing up closer, closer
ON ATHENA
as she charges out of the elevator in time to see a plane coming in.
Suddenly, she is held back.
DECK HAND
Stay back...He could lose it.
ON THE SHIP
as it careens down the flight deck, turning sideways and crabbing
towards the superstructure
ATHENA
breaks from the deck hand's grip and charges off as we hear a long
screech, followed by a resounding crash from o.s.
ON STARBUCK'S SHIP
impaled on the side of a wall as steam and smoke flood the area.
Across the hangar beyond the ship, small emergency vehicles race out
of pockets in the walls and towards the ship.
ATHENA 
is first to reach the ship as Starbuck flips back the canopy and
jumps down the side of the ship. Athena reaches him, throwing her arms around him.
ATHENA
Starbuck, are you all right?
STARBUCK
For a guy who just had a whole fleet shot out from under him, I'm
fine...
The support team comes pulling up.
STARBUCK
Give her a good wash, fellas...
Starbuck streaks towards the elevators
ATHENA
It's been horrible.
STARBUCK
Yeah? You should have seen how we spent our day. We managed to single-
handedly keep the Cylons off your necks while you took off on a little
cruise...
They reach steps and begin to climb
ATHENA
Starbuck, don't you know what's happened?
STARBUCK
Sure, I know what happened. You should see this baby from the air
when she slips off across the sky. Beautiful sight, unless she
happens to be your base ship.
ATHENA
The colonies are gone, Starbuck...all of them.
STARBUCK
What are you talking about? Gone...what'd they do, pack up and sneak
away like the Galactica?
ON THE BRIDGE
as Starbuck storms into the chamber where the mood is subdued and his
entrance goes unnoticed
BRIDGE OFFICER
Ships are coming in on both decks, sir.
The Colonel leaves the map area.
TIGH
What's the count?
BRIDGE OFFICER
Sixty-seven fighters in all, sir. Twenty-five of our own.
TIGH
How many battlestars?
There is a pregnant pause.
BRIDGE OFFICER
None.
TIGH
What???
BRIDGE OFFICER
We're the only surviving battlestar...
TIGH
My God... Make the pilots from the other ships as welcome as you
can...
STARBUCK
Little late for that, Colonel...
All eyes swing to Starbuck moving in with Athena a few steps behind
him.
STARBUCK
It was a toss-up whether those guys would land or send in a belly full
of torpedoes. Unfortunately, no one had any left.
TIGH
What's the meaning of this insubordination?
ATHENA
He doesn't know what happened, Colonel. I don't think any of them
know.
Suddenly, two more pilots are on the flight bridge
STARBUCK
Know what? That the old man turned and ran, leaving a dozen of our
ships to run out of fuel?
Boomer and Jolly come to a stop beside Starbuck.
TIGH
Put the transmissions we monitored back on the scanners, for our young
patriots...
STARBUCK
If this is going to be a lecture on military protocol...
SUDDENLY THE SCANNERS COME TO LIFE
Four at a time, each displaying the attack bombing, the confusion, the
devastation of the colonies
SLOWLY PUSHING IN ON THE PILOTS' FACES
as they are sobered and horrified by what they see
CLOSE ON SKYLER
as he stands on a hill. His fighter ship, a silent sentinel to his
back. The glow of a myriad fires dance on his ashen face.
POINT OF VIEW
The flames from thousands of buildings burn far off in the distance.
SKYLER
turns as he hears what sounds like a mob approaching in the distance
ON A DOZEN TORCHES FAR OFF DOWN THE HILL
heading in the direction of the aircraft...voices shouting excitedly,
desperately
SKYLER
turns and heads off, taking camera towards a family dwelling. Once a
handsome structure laid out in half circles, now carved down the
middle by some unseen evil. One half of the dwelling is charred
remnants
INSIDE THE DWELLING ON ADAMA
He is illuminated across the darkened room by a rectangular candle
with twelve wicks. He stands by a wall covered with photographs of
himself, his two sons and a daughter. We recognize Athena, Skyler and
a second son, Zac. A handsome woman is also pictured with the family
and alone in several beautiful portraits taking her from a girl of
seventeen to fifty years. Tears well up in Adama's eyes as he takes
the oldest photo of his wife in hand
ADAMA
I'm sorry, Ila. I was never there when it mattered. Never.
The tears begin to stream down his cheeks as the memories of a
thousand lost moments and lost opportunities race through his mind.
Suddenly, he turns to see Skyler standing across the room.
ADAMA
I didn't hear you come in. I was just gathering a few remembrances.
You want this likeness of you and Zac?
Skyler snaps back, his mood hardening against the hurt
SKYLER
No...
(beat)
Look, there are crowds coming. They probably saw our ship land...
Adama stiffens
ADAMA
I'll be a few more minutes
Skyler turns to leave, then seems to soften, turning back.
SKYLER
Maybe she wasn't here. Maybe...
The Commander looks at Skyler with finality.
ADAMA
She was here...
Skyler nods and slowly withdraws.
OUTSIDE THE DWELLING - THE CITIZENS WITH TORCHES
have approached to within fifty yards of the sleek fighter ship. Their
voices are pitched and angular as they stride down the gentle incline
towards Skyler, who moves out to meet them, warily gauging their
hostile cries.
SANDELL
Where are they? Where're the rest of your fancy fliers?
LOBE
Where were you, lad, when they were killing everyone in sight? What
were you doing, boy?
As they close the gap to within a few feet of Skyler and seem bent on
taking him apart, a woman's voice calls out
LYRA
Wait!
For a moment, there is hesitation. The mob parts as Lyra steps
forward, holding a small boy by the hand.
LYRA
Let him talk.
She continues on out until she is face-to-face with Skyler.
LYRA
Before they do what they will with you, I'd like to know where you
were. Where were all of you? We waited...we watched and prayed...but
you never came...
Skyler looks down at the small, innocent face looking up from beside
Lyra, a child with dirt and confusion in his innocent eyes.
SKYLER
Most of us are dead.
The crowd breaks into an undertone of awe...
SKYLER
The fleet is all but destroyed.
The crowd breaks into cries of despair and anguish
LYRA
But you are here...where did you come from?
SKYLER
The battlestar Galactica
LYRA
Survived...
SKYLER
Yes...
LYRA
And what of the President and the Council of the Twelve...and the
other colonies. Surely we can fight back. We have the will and at
long last, after hundreds of years, we are united...all twelve
colonies. They cannot possibly defeat our combined strength...
A voice from offstage commands their attention
ADAMA
We became as one too late.
The group is stunned to find so imperious a figure as one of the
Council of the Twelve amongst them.
LYRA
Commander Adama...
LYRA
Miss Lyra.
ADAMA
Then it's true. We are defeated...doomed.
Skyler and the Commander exchange looks. The little boy, Boxey, stares
up at Skyler admiringly
BOXEY
Can I ride in your ship, Mister?
Skyler bends down and picks him up. Skyler looks at the lad, then at
Adama pointedly.
SKYLER
Fighter ships are no place for boys...
LYRA
They're going to have to be if our people are going to survive...
Adama turns and walks off to the edge of the bluff overlooking the
burning cities beyond. Lyra moves up behind him, beside Skyler who
is carrying the young child.
LYRA 
We are going to fight back...we can't simply give up.
The Commander seems deep in thought as he looks out over the ruins.
Then he turns and looks past Lyra and Skyler...past the boy
ADAMA
Yes, we are going to fight back.
A cry of bravado goes up from the torch-bearing mob...cries of
satisfaction, of frustration, of vented anger
ADAMA
But not here...not now...not in the colonies...not even in this star
system. Let the word go forth to every man, woman and child who has
survived this infamy. Tell them to set sail at once in every assorted
vehicle that will carry them...
SKYLER
There isn't time to arrange provision, Father. The Cylons will be
sending landing parties to eradicate the survivors. If we could send
in our remaining fighters...
ADAMA
No. There are too many of them and too few of us. There is a time to
fight, and a time to withdraw...to fight another day.
SKYLER
But there is no way to board the entire population on the Galactica.
And we have no troop carriers, nothing that can make light speed.
ADAMA
We'll use what we do have. Every inner-galactic passenger liner,
freighter, taxi...even inner colony buses...air taxis...anything
that will carry our people into the stars...
LYRA
And when they have gathered in the stars...?
ADAMA
We will lead them...and protect them...until they are strong again...
The group facing the Commander turn, exchanging curious looks. Either
they are in the presence of a madman or a savior...
A PLANET IN FLAMES
with countless assorted vehicles rising from it, leaving it far behind
SUPERIMPOSE THE TITLE
EXODUS
BACK TO ADAMA'S VOICE
ADAMA'S VOICE
And the word went forth to every outpost of human existence...and they
came...The Aeries from Aeriana...
ON ANOTHER DISSIMILAR PLANET
with more ships rising into the stars
ADAMA'S VOICE
The Gemons from the planet Gemini...
ON ANOTHER PLANET
with multiple moons
ADAMA'S VOICE
The Virgos from Virgon...The Scorpios, the Picons...and the
Sagitarians...
ON THE RAG TAG FLEET
assembling among the stars. As they move by camera, we see lettering
of every description, color and text. A bulbous vessel, bearing the
signet, "TRANS-STELLAR SPACE SERVICE"...an immense vehicle with the
lettering "GEMINI FREIGHT"...a small space tram, "TAURON BUS LINES"...
a long-range passenger liner with lettering and initials in a
non-descript, unfamiliar text, dominated by three large symbols on its
tail structure...as far as the eye could perceive, a fleet of vehicles
of every assortment, size and shape...
BACK TO ADAMA'S VOICE
ADAMA'S VOICE
In all, two hundred and twenty ships representing every colony, color
and creed in the star system. The human race might have one more
chance, but it would first have to survive the Alliance...the elements
and the unknown dark and sinister threats that would lie ahead
ON A CYLON BASE SHIP
hovering over Caprica
TWO CYLON WARSHIPS
approach the Cylon mother ship
INSIDE THE INNER CHAMBER
a side door opens and two Cylon warriors cross towards the center
pedestal with a human between them. He is Baltar. One of the two
sentries beside Baltar speaks.
SENTRY
At your command.
LEADER
Welcome, Baltar. You have done well.
Baltar looks as if he is about to attack the Leader...obviously an
unwise move
BALTAR
I have done well...What have you done? What of our bargain? My colony
was to be spared!
LEADER
The bargain was altered.
BALTAR
How can you change one side of a bargain?
LEADER
But there is no other side. You have missed the entire point of the
war.
Baltar's resolve, his anger, is replaced by a creeping concern that
he has erred in his evaluation of the man before him.
BALTAR
I don't know what you mean.
LEADER
I mean, there could be no dominion over the species so long as man
remained a power within the Universe. It was man or the Alliance.
There could be no compromise.
BALTAR
But you have what you want...the threat no longer exists...I delivered
my end of the bargain. My dominion was to be spared.
LEADER
There can be only one dominion...one power... one authority...there
must be no exceptions.
BALTAR
But I have no ambitions against you!
LEADER
Could you think me so foolish as to trust a man who would see his own
race destroyed?
BALTAR
Not destroyed, subjugated...under me.
LEADER
There can be no survivors. So long as one human remains alive, the
Alliance is threatened.
BALTAR
Surely you don't mean me?
LEADER
We thank you for your help, Baltar. Your time is at an end...
The Leader nods and the two ominous sentries on either side of Baltar
lift him from the floor, one on each arm, and begin to take him away.
BALTAR
No...you can't...you still need me...
ON THE LEADER
LEADER
Send the flight leader in.
ON THE DOOR
A sentry enters and stands aside as the flight leader enters. He moves
directly to the center of the room.
FLIGHT LEADER
At your command...
LEADER
Report on the final assault on the human colonies.
FLIGHT LEADER
The ships all report similar circumstances. The initial attack was so
effective, there were no survivors.
LEADER
(incredulously)
No survivors!!! On any of the twelve colonies?
FLIGHT LEADER
That is correct, Imperious Leader.
Slowly push into the Imperious Leader's knowing gaze...
ON THE RAG TAG FLEET
Countless ships of every description scattered across the sky behind
the lone survivor of the Colonial Fleet. We slowly push into the
lead vehicle and see its name
"GALACTICA"
IN A LARGE COUNCIL CHAMBER
Commander Adama stands before a large, seated gathering, the starfield
to his back
ADAMA
Long, long ago...whether thousand or millions of year is
unimportant...our recorded history tells us that we descended from a
mother civilization, a race that set out into the universe to
establish colonies. Those of us here now represent every known
surviving colony, save one. A sister world far out in the universe,
only remembered to us through ancient writings. It is my intention to
seek out that remaining colony, that last outpost of humanity in the
universe. A civilization like our own, to ask their help in
rebuilding...and perhaps, to warn them of an evil Alliance and their
intention to eradicate all mankind.
LIEUTENANT STARBUCK
rises to his feet. All around him are other fighter pilots.
ADAMA
Lieutenant Starbuck, you have a question?
STARBUCK
Yes, sir. If we're talking about the same colony, I remember reading
about it in ancient mythology. I don't think anybody even knows where
it is, and if our own ship is any indication, we barely have enough
fuel to get out of this galaxy.
Starbuck sits as a surge of agreement sweeps through the room.
ADAMA
A very good point. It will be our plan to find a fuel source and
extended provisions before we leave the star system.
Colonel Tigh rises to his feet.
TIGH
Commander, I feel I speak for the vast majority when I say this is
hardly a fleet of sturdy, well-equipped soldiers up to battling the
universe. Most of these people barely got away with their lives.
They're emotionally and physically unprepared for the kind of journey
you propose.
The crowd seems to agree as Skyler is now on his feet, as well.
SKYLER
And less than a third of the ships we're escorting can make light
speed. It could take us generations to find this colony.
ADAMA
And we'll find it because we have no choice. If we stay in this star
system, the Alliance will find us. We'll travel only as fast as our
slowest ship. We'll be only as strong as our weakest brother. We are
the only surviving battlestar, but the combined pilots that survived
ours and the other ships are the best in all the universe. They are
up to the task of protecting each and every one of you.
LYRA
rises to her feet. We recognize her as the newswoman from Caprica.
LYRA
Commander Adama...forgive the void in my education, but star
mythology was never my best subject. This thirteenth colony...
this other world...where is it? What is it called?
Adama takes a long pause as he scans the audience, then turns to the
starfield and gazes at it like a man searching the horizon for a
glimpse of a sail beyond a sea.
ADAMA
I cannot tell you that I know precisely where it is...but it lies
beyond this star system in a galaxy like our own. As for the planet's
name...
Adama looks back to the expectant throng...
ADAMA
It is called Earth.
A long beat as excitement builds through the congregation.
END OF HOUR ONE
HOUR TWO
FADE IN
ON THE GALACTICA
maneuvering ahead of the rag tag fleet
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM
Adama stands before a translucent starmap, addressing a council of
elders
ADAMA
Our course, while indirect and arduous, has successfully brought us
to the outermost reaches of the star system without encountering
Cylon patrols. If we can hold out for another eight or nine centons,
we can reach the planet Carillon.
Adama turns and moves back to face the main body
ADAMA
There, hopefully we can find fuel, water, and prepare fresh stores
of food...
ON ANTON
ANTON
Hopefully? My dear Commander, there is not one amongst us who is not
grateful beyond words for your vision and resourcefulness in saving
us all from certain death. Are we now to throw it all away...
Anton rises
ANTON
As of this moment, we face a crisis no less lethal than the Cylon war
machine. I would rather see my loved ones extinguished in the micron
flash of a Cylon cannon than drift in fuelless vehicles while
starvation, dehydration, and suffocation agonize us one by one.
ADAMA
Anton, it was hardly possible to adequately prepare ourselves for the
journey we've had to undertake. We had to leave. We had no choice.
Anton moves to the map.
ANTON
But we have a choice now. We can stop here on Borallus. We know that
everything we need is here...food, water, fuel...
There are waves of approval throughout the room
ADAMA
And undoubtedly a Cylon task force.
A murmur races through the room
ADAMA
It is the most logical place for us to stop. Precisely why I believe
it would be fatal to do so.
ANTON
Possibly fatal. Is it not surely fatal to continue towards Carillon...
Colonel Tigh rises
TIGH
Commander...the situation has reached crisis levels. Rations have
already been cut by two-thirds. How much more can we conserve?
ADAMA
As much as we have to, to reach Carillon. It is our only hope.
ANTON
The Cylons will be looking even unto those far reaches.
ADAMA
There is a path here, through the Nova of Madagon. Not patrolled, and
a savings of some two centons in reaching Carillon.
A gasp is heard throughout the council as Adama points to a course
through the starfield.
ANTON
Commander, while I may not be a military expert, even I know that the
Cylons avoid patrolling that area by mining it to make passage
impossible.
ADAMA
Not impossible. We will do it. We have no other choice.
ON THE BODY OF ELDERS
Their faces are grim
ON A CYLON BASE SHIP
hanging ominously in the sky
INSIDE THE INNER CHAMBER
two Cylon Centurians enter with Baltar between them. Baltar is a
different man than the one who strode arrogantly before the Imperious
one.
ON THE IMPERIOUS LEADER
CENTURIAN
By your command...
LEADER
The people of Cylon wish to offer you an opportunity to serve, Baltar.
Baltar searches for deception in the Leader's words, but he is too
resigned to death to challenge the unexpected words.
BALTAR
To serve...?
LEADER
It appears that a small band of refugee humans eluded the Alliance...
Baltar seems to stand a little taller
BALTAR
I tried to forewarn you...
The Centurians hurl Baltar to the flood and hold staffs against the
back of his head.
LEADER
I offer you life, and you question my judgment? Dangerous....
BALTAR
raises his head slightly
BALTAR
Kill me...
The Imperious Leader stares at Baltar. The Centurians waiting for a
sign to kill him.
LEADER
Let him rise
The Centurians remove their staffs. Baltar climbs to his feet.
LEADER
I sense a bargain...
BALTAR
We bargained before and it left me a dead man. This time I will have
my reward before I serve you.
LEADER
The entire Alliance serves me. Why do I need you?
BALTAR
Why do you spare me? Because you fear man. You do not understand him.
When your forces had taken and put the entire nation of Tucana into
slavery, man was there to break the chains. When you chose to dominate
the people of Gaelon, man was there to make the Galics strong, to help
them seek their own destiny. The Cylon is content to serve. Man is
born to lead. But I can succeed where you have failed.
LEADER
What is your bargain?
BALTAR
When I find the survivors of the colonies...they are mine.
LEADER
And how to you propose to protect this bargain?
BALTAR
There are those who will follow me...away from your influence...away
from your interests...
LEADER
All the stars interest me...
BALTAR
You can have no reign on tyranny. There is room for all...
LEADER
You appear as a man, but you think like a Cylon.
BALTAR
The better to serve you, while serving myself.
LEADER
You will need Centurians.
BALTAR
Two will be adequate.
LEADER
Only two...??
Baltar looks from the Centurian on his left to the Centurian on his
right
BALTAR
These two...
LEADER
Your arrogance will destroy you.
BALTAR
I would rather die by my own hand, than yours.
LEADER
So be it...they are yours...
Baltar smiles, nods and turns...
BALTAR
Come along, boys...
As Baltar moves off, the Centurians stand stoically awaiting
instructions from the Imperious Leader
LEADER
Go with him...Serve me!!
CENTURIAN
By your order...
They turn and move off as we close into a very troubled Imperious
Leader
ON THE RAG TAG FLEET
sailing through the sky at a slow pace
ON AN ANTIQUATED VEHICLE
pushing in to establish the lettering on its side...
COLONIAL MOVERS
"WE MOVE ANYWHERE"
INSIDE AN ENGINE AREA
Skyler crawls out from an access area beneath some mechanical gear...
is hands and face soiled as his Captain markings on his shoulders are
the only indications of military rank. He turns to a tool kit to put
away some instruments, taking us to an older man...
JENSING
I understand two other ships have already broken down...
SKYLER
And twenty-two have run out of fuel.
Skyler closes his tool his and rises...looking grim
JENSING
It's serious?
Skyler looks at the man whose face bears the emotional scars of too
many recent disasters
SKYLER
Until we stop for materials or find minerals to make our own, I just
can't repair it...and you'll never be able to keep up with the fleet
like it is.
JENSING
But what will we do...?
SKYLER
We'll have to transfer everyone off of this ship to one of the others.
How many people on board?
A beautiful young lady enters
LYRA
Twenty-nine...
Skyler turns and smiles
SKYLER
Well, a celebrity. I would have thought you could have pulled a little
space on one of the plush passenger liners.
LYRA
I have no interest in pulling space. This ship was assigned to me.
JENSING
She's being charitable. We asked her if she'd come with us to see if
she could help us with the little boy.
SKYLER
Little boy?
LYRA
You remember the child found in the bombing? The Jensings lived in the
same module as Boxey's parents who were killed in the first wave...
JENSING
He doesn't sleep and he doesn't eat...even emergency rations. In fact,
Lyra is the only one he'll even talk to.
LYRA
That's about all I can get him to do. He lost a little daggit which
apparently meant everything to him. I thought you might help.
SKYLER
If he won't eat for you, I don't know what I can do.
LYRA
He seemed to spark a little when you picked him up on Caprica. I got
the feeling you were good with children.
SKYLER
(introspectively)
I grew up with a kid brother...
IN A NARROW COMPANIONWAY
off of which countless cubicles have been formed as living quarters in
the hold of this cargo vessel. Skyler looks into the faces and lives
of the refugees occupying the rooms which are open, partially open,
and in a few cases, entirely curtained off with makeshift draperies.
They arrive at a room which is draped shut. There is only a night
light on inside. Skyler looks at Lyra. She gestures inside. Skyler
reaches into his back pocket and withdraws his military cap with its
scrambled eggs and insignia of the Colonial Warriors. He enters...
INSIDE A TINY CUBICLE
Spartan in its furnishings, the night light illuminates the face of a
young boy, who lies staring at the ceiling...wide awake
SKYLER
Excuse me...I hope I'm not interrupting anything...
Boxey's eyes widen
SKYLER
I'm in charge of finding young men to try out as future fighter
pilots. Your name is Boxey, correct?
BOXEY
Uh-huh...
Skyler nods and moves to the bed and crouches beside it
SKYLER
Good. I've been looking all over for you. You should have made contact
with the Commander. You know we're very short on pilots...
BOXEY
I'm too little to be a pilot...
SKYLER
Oh sure, right now, but how long do you think it takes to become a
full Colonial Warrior?
BOXEY
I don't know.
SKYLER
You have to start when you're very small, or you won't get these until
you have gray hair.
Boxey lifts his head to see what Skyler is pointing to on his
shoulders. The young lad's eyes show their first glimmer of interest
as they see Captain's emblems.
SKYLER
You like them?
Then as quickly as the interest appeared, it vanishes and the youth
withdraws to his pillow
BOXEY
I want Muffit...
SKYLER
Well, I don't know. There isn't much room for a daggit in a fighter
plane.
BOXEY
He's gone. He ran away.
SKYLER
Oh? Well, maybe we can find one of Muffit's friends?
BOXEY
There are no daggits...I asked...
Skyler steals a helpless look at Lyra, who looks back, both
appreciatively and sympathetically.
SKYLER
Well, I'll tell you what...
Skyler removes an emblem from his shoulder and places it on Boxey's
night clothes
SKYLER
As Colonial Warrior First Level, you are entitled to the first daggit
that comes along
Skyler rises and starts out of the room, then hesitates at the door
SKYLER
But only on the condition that you get your rest, eat all of your
primaries, and stop chasing girls. Good night, Officer...
Skyler salutes and exits with Lyra. Behind them, Boxey steals a peek
at the emblem on his pajamas. He clutches it in his hand and stares
at the darkened ceiling as we move to see the far off look which
windows the confused world of a six year old boy.
IN THE CORRIDOR
Skyler waits as Lyra moves up to him
LYRA
Thank you. I was right; you are good with kids. You and your brother
must be very close.
Skyler steps away
SKYLER
We were.
LYRA
I'm sorry! The war?
SKYLER
I suppose...
LYRA
Look, if you'd rather not involve yourself...
SKYLER
(interrupting)
Don't be silly. What's a Warrior to do after he's lost the big one...
win a few of the little ones...
LYRA
That's not a little one in their, Captain. You win that one, you've
accomplished something.
ON A LARGE SHIP WITH THREE GIANT PODS
The livery ship. Three large circular compartments, connected by long,
narrow metal corridors. Skyler walks with Starbuck down a corridor.
STARBUCK
I don't think I can help you, Skyler. Other than fixing the landing
servos on this livery machine, the only thing I know about livestock,
which includes daggits, is that they've run out of food to feed them.
Let me show you...
They have entered one of the large circular pods, taking us to a ring
of animals all facing into a central feeding device. The animals are
in pairs, each pair representing a different species. Starbuck leads
Skyler to one of the stalls where we find two unicorns, one lying on
its side.
SKYLER
How long has he been like that?
STARBUCK
He collapsed last night just after I was brought on board. You know
unicorns are very monogamous. His lady's in foal. They think he's
been letting her have his share of the food ration. If we could have
stopped at Borallus...
Skyler storms away
SKYLER
We couldn't stop. The Cylons would have been there...waiting...
STARBUCK
Well, when these animals are gone, they're gone. We'll just have to
accept the fact that generations will grow up without ever having
seen a unicorn... or a tagon...or a...
SKYLER
There wouldn't have been any generations of anything if we'd stopped.
I would have made the same decision as my father.
Starbuck moves after Skyler
STARBUCK
Okay...okay...it's just rough to have to watch them slip away, one at
a time...
SKYLER
I'll tell you what's rough...We've got a little boy in the same
condition. Are you sure no one brought any daggits along someplace in
this whole fleet?
STARBUCK
No. We're both out of luck...I already checked.
SKYLER
Both out of luck! You checked for daggits? Why?
STARBUCK
Daggit racing...
SKYLER
What?
STARBUCK
What's one of the most awful things that can happen to people on a
long voyage?
SKYLER
They die...
STARBUCK
Not that awful. I'm talking about things to do for excitement.
Skyler's interest plunges into disgust
SKYLER
Fifty million Cylons chasing us all over the stars...our ships are
falling apart...there's nothing to eat...and you're worried about
excitement.
STARBUCK
Well, when you put it like that...Anyway, I got the idea before it
began to look like we weren't going to make it at all...
SKYLER
We're going to make it...the animals, too.
STARBUCK
Tell him...
Starbuck and Skyler have arrived at a droid whose front is open,
exposing its workings. There are tools in front of the machine,
suggesting that Starbuck has been working on it.
STARBUCK
How's it going this morning, Zeus?
A slightly effete but benevolent voice responds
ZEUS
Not well... All species receiving inadequate food supplements to
survive the voyage to the planet Carillon...
STARBUCK
You're wrong, Zeus. Commander Adama has just decided to take a chance
through the Nova of Madagon. That'll cut two centons off of the
journey...
ZEUS
The Nova of Madegon is mined by the Alliance. The percentile risk of
successfully traversing the strait makes it statistically impossible.
STARBUCK
Is that right?
ZEUS
Yes, that's right.
STARBUCK
Thank you.
ZEUS
Thank you.
STARBUCK
Thank you.
ZEUS
Thank you
Starbuck shakes his head
STARBUCK
Idiot...
ZEUS
I beg your pardon...
Now it's Skyler's turn to react. His face lights up. He, too, has seen
the light.
SKYLER
Starbuck...that's the answer...You've saved a life...
STARBUCK
What?
SKYLER
Never mind...Thanks...I owe you one...
Skyler turns and hustles out. Starbuck looks after him
STARBUCK
Malnutrition...it's getting to everyone. All right, Zeus, now we have
to reprogram some of your circuits for landing on a planet. Do you 
understand?
ZEUS
Why did you call me an idiot?
STARBUCK
Oh, for crying out loud...
ON A STARFIELD
so bright, it defies the unprotected eye to scan it
ON TWO PILOTS IN THE BRIEFING ROOM
Starbuck and Skyler viewing a monitor
ADAMA
The Nova of Madegon is not a Nova at all, but a starfield so bright
your cockpits will be sealed to prevent blindness. You will navigate
by scanner and sweep everything out of your path with turbolasers.
Any questions?
STARBUCK
Yes, sir. Would this be an appropriate time for me to take my sick
leave?
A small, nervous laugh. Adama smiles the longest and seems to take his
time answering the quip.
ADAMA
It would, but request denied. I didn't arrive at you two to lead us
through without a great deal of anguish. If it will do any good, let
me assure you that should you fail...no one will survive. Therefore, 
you have the advantage of controlling your own fate. The rest of us
must sit in anticipation of your skill...
Skyler rises
SKYLER
Or lack thereof...
IN AN OUTER CORRIDOR
Adama exits a room and is accosted by Athena. Adama does not stop
ATHENA
Father...I can't believe you're doing this! Why couldn't you have
listened to the others. We should have stopped at Borallus. We
wouldn't have to be taking this awful chance with their lives...
Adama stops and looks at Athena.
ADAMA
Whose lives?
ATHENA
Starbuck's and Skyler's.
A knowing look crosses Adama's face
ADAMA
You place Lieutenant Starbuck's name ahead of your brother's.
Curious...
She turns away
ADAMA
And here I'm supposed to be all-knowing
ATHENA
I didn't know myself until I heard he was going. It's all so
hopeless...If they survive this... if any of us survive...What next...
How long before we find Earth?
ADAMA
Perhaps never.
ATHENA
That's what I was thinking, Father. We could grow old waiting. I
mean, we may never have the chance...to...
ADAMA
To get married and have children and a home...
ATHENA
Yes...
ADAMA
Well, I think it's premature for you to be worrying about old age. I,
on the other hand, ought to give a great deal of thought to this
voyage...If it should go on and on...
ATHENA
But you have to lead them. You're all that's left.
ADAMA
No, you're left...and Skyler and Lieutenant Starbuck and Colonel Tigh
and...well, so many more good people. That's why the journey is worth
any sacrifice. There are so many people worth saving... and beginning
again...
Athena hugs her father
ATHENA
I'm sorry if I spoke out of turn before...I've never faced death
before.
ADAMA
You faced senseless killing as you should have... with horror. That's
the difference between humans and the Alliance. We don't waste life,
we only risk it when there is no other choice...as in this case, where
the very survival of the human race may ride on three young men...
ON SKYLER
in his cockpit
SKYLER
Ready...
ON STARBUCK
in his cockpit
STARBUCK
I'm not ready...But let's get it over with anyway...
ADAMA ON THE BRIDGE
ADAMA
Launch...
ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE GALACTICA'S LAUNCHING TUBES
as two ships blast into space
ON THE BRIDGE
TIGH
Nova starfield ahead, sir...
Adama says a silent prayer
ON TWO COLONIAL FIGHTERS
sweeping through space and approaching a bright field of light
INSIDE SKYLER'S COCKPIT
SKYLER
I may not be able to see anything, but it's sure getting hot. You
picking up the field on your scanner?
STARBUCK
STARBUCK
Negative...my scanner's burning up...
SKYLER'S VOICE
I was afraid of that. It's too bright for the scanner...
STARBUCK
And a little too late to turn back, I'd say. What do we do?
SKYLER'S VOICE
Only one thing I can think of...hold positions and blast away...
STARBUCK
What if we miss a mine?
SKYLER'S VOICE
One of us will be the first to know it. Let's go.
ON THE COLONIAL FIGHTERS
as the two sleek ships angle through the brightly-lighted starfield
firing everything they have
ON THE MINEFIELD
as mine after mine detonates
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
a tense crew watches the scanners. Suddenly, a cheer goes up
TIGH
It's working, Commander... They're clearing a path a hundred maxims
wide.
ATHENA
Now that's precision flying! Starbuck really knows what he's doing.
ON STARBUCK
STARBUCK
Are we hitting anything? I can't see a blessed thing.
SKYLER
Be hanged if I know...but it's cooling off...I believe we made it...
STARBUCK
Yaaaahooooooo...
ON A PLANET
suspended in space
ADAMA'S VOICE
The planet Carillon...
IN THE ASSEMBLY ROOM
from which the Planet Carillon is clearly visible through the window
to space
ADAMA
Landing operations will begin at once.
Adama turns to address the gathering of military officers
ADAMA
Our mineral scanners have located what we believe is the approximate
site of the old mining expedition. Captain Skyler will lead a military
sortie to the surface.
SKYLER
Will any civilian personnel be allowed to land?
ADAMA
Only those responsible for the farming operation. We will make
exceptions only for extreme cases, medical or otherwise.
IN A CORRIDOR ABOARD THE MOVING VAN
Lyra moves along with Skyler
LYRA
Still won't eat...doesn't sleep. Commander Adama even granted
permission for him to go down onto Carillon and help care for the
livestock. It would do him a world of good.
SKYLER
I think I have something that'll interest him.
IN A MAINTENANCE LABORATORY
in which we find a row of droids staring at us. WIDEN to see Doctor
Wilker leaving a bench at which a scope is connected to a droid and
sending out pulses which make a hand function up and down. The o.s.
sound of a door opening automatically brings the Doctor around.
SKYLER, LYRA AND BOXEY
enter. Doctor Wilker leaves his bench and walks up to greet them
WILKER
Ah, Captain Skyler. Right on time. We've been expecting you. Is this
the young officer who's been put in charge of the new project?
Skyler swings a look down to Boxey, who is now half-hiding behind him
SKYLER
Well, I haven't had time to fully discuss the project with him. It's
our hope that he'll accept.
Boxey pulls on Skyler's leg. Skyler looks down
BOXEY
(whispered)
I want to go back to my cubicle.
SKYLER
Boxey, this is a military order. We have to at least hear the Doctor
out. Tell us more about the project, Doctor.
WILKER
Well, as you know, we will soon be landing on various alien planets.
It's important that we be safe. Ordinarily, we'd have trained daggits
to stand watch at night when our Warriors are asleep in their
encampments, but we don't have any daggits. So, we had to see what
we could come up with. We'll call the first one, Muffit Two.
Boxey looks up at Skyler
BOXEY
What'd he say?
SKYLER
I didn't really get it all, Doctor. Maybe you'd better show us.
WILKER
Right. Oh, Lanzer...
A young man moves from the back of the lab holding something in his
arms. It is large and friendly-looking. It has curly hair implanted
all over it and as Lanzer puts it down on the ground, it begins to
bark in a high-pitched, friendly tone and move towards Boxey. When it
gets there, it stops. Its tongue comes out; it begins to pant, and
its tail wags frantically from where it protrudes through a hole at
the back of the droid's silver skin.
WILKER
Naturally, the first one will have to be looked after very carefully.
Boxey stares at the small droid incredulously
BOXEY
That's not Muffit. It's not even a real daggit.
WILKER
No, but it can learn to be like a real one. It's very smart. If you
would help us, he'll be even smarter.
Boxey continues to stare at the daggit. The daggit, in turn, continues
to pant
BOXEY
Stop that.
The daggit stops panting and cocks its head quizzically
BOXEY
begins to show the hint of a smile. He turns and takes a step away
from the small droid. The droid stares. Boxey moves a few more feet,
then moves off down the corridor. The daggit rises and follows after
him
DOCTOR WILKER
turns to Lyra and Skyler
WILKER
(sotto)
We used the image of Boxey you gave us to train the droid to respond
to him
ON BOXEY
as he stops at the end of the corridor and turns to look at the
daggit. He opens his arms. The small droid moves forward, sits up on
his hind legs and puts his paws on Boxey's small chest. Boxey turns
his cheek against the small companion and smiles back up the corridor
at Lyra and Skyler and the Doctor. It is love at first sight.
ON SKYLER, LYRA AND WILKER
SKYLER
That's one I owe you, Doc...
He smiles
WILKER
Any time...
As he leaves, Lyra turns to Skyler with a warmth she hasn't felt
since before the holocaust...when the world turned dark.
LYRA
That's one I owe you, Skyler.
SKYLER
Any time...
ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON
Pushing in as we see colonial fighters streaking close over its
surface
STARBUCK
Surface cleared to land...
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
ADAMA
Proceed to land the livery ships
ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON
as he livery ships soar by on their way to the surface
INSIDE THE CYLON BASE SHIP IN THE INNER CHAMBER
on the Imperious Leader
LEADER
It has been seven centons, and not one word of the humans. What have
you to say, Baltar?
Baltar stands before the Leader, confident and illusive
BALTAR
Their doom is imminent.
LEADER
You know where they are...
BALTAR
I know where they will be.
Baltar smiles confidently and turns to leave
LEADER
I have not dismissed you.
Baltar stops...looks back
BALTAR
You want them...Then I must go
LEADER
You know that when you have found them, you will yet have to deal
with me for your arrogance.
BALTAR
Yes...but this time, I will be prepared.
As Baltar turns and exits, we push in on the Imperious Leader, his
hatred for Baltar growing with every centon.
ON STARBUCK, BOOMER, SKYLER AND JOLLY
standing on the surface of Carillon, their fighter ships in the
background. It is not day; it is not night. An odd illumination from
two moons gives the planet a midnight sun effect
BOOMER
I wonder what it's like in the daytime.
SKYLER
This is the daytime...
STARBUCK
Lovely. I can't imagine why it isn't overpopulated.
SKYLER
My scanner reads life forms beyond that hill. Either it's some high-
energy-yielding substance or they left some kind of caretaker
operation behind when they abandoned this place. Starbuck and Boomer,
you take the shuttle and check it out. Jolly, you go to work on the
livery detail with your squadron. I'll use mine to start checking out
this area for signs of the old mine. Everybody sync your chronometers.
I want a check in every four millicentons on the security frequency.
Understood?
Everyone nods and pressed their wrist chronometers which emit random,
out-of-sync tones at odd intervals at first, then come into sync, so
that in effect we hear a pattern of steady, rhythmic pulses.
SKYLER
Let's go.
The men all turn and head off in varying directions. As they do, we
pan and move into one of many formations in the area that look like
the edge of a crater or giant ant hill or...
REVERSE ANGLE
To Starbuck and Boomer moving off, we are looking down the sights of
a strange-looking weapon. Suddenly, a hand moves in and pushes the
barrel down
CLOSE ON TWO SMALL CREATURES
They are insect-like, approximately five feet tall, large, bulbous
eyes and four arms. Seetol turns and nods, taking camera to a third
creature who also carries a weapon with two hands and turns to work
a machine device with a third and fourth hand. A faint whine can be
heard and the three creatures slowly begin to submerge down into the
crater
ON A SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAY
the pod appears in a cell-like opening. The three creatures step off.
One remains at the elevator-like structure; the other two move off
down the passage, which is alive with a pulsating golden light coming
from the cell-like panels
ON ANOTHER CELL-LIKE OPENING
As the two creatures move up a passageway towards it. They arrive and
we pan with them, taking camera to an immense chamber deep beneath the
earth
THE MINE
is a giant, beehive-like structure with countless levels and
honeycomb-like compartments. We ca see workers busily poking at walls
and withdrawing ore, which is, in turn, placed in small vehicles which
other workers are maneuvering throughout the multicorridored structure
INSIDE A CHOSEN CHAMBER
Very plush. A creature sits on a cushioned floor, surrounded by slaves
serving all manners of personal needs, from playing a sitar and a
bee's hum, pruning or manicuring two of the chosen creature's limbs,
and providing some kind of smoking device for occasional puffs...
SEETOL
enters
SEETOL
They have come.
The voice is that of a girl...soft and pleasant. The next voice is
that of the Queen of the hive...deeper, just as soft, but infinitely
more refined
LOTAY
Don't disturb them. It will only stir them up. They'll be perfectly
harmless unless angered or frightened.
Seetol nods, bows, and withdraws as Lotay draws on the strange pipe
ON THE LIVERY SHIP
sitting far in the background as animals are being led into the
foreground
ON SKYLER
as he points out a meadow area bordered on all sides by short, rocky
hills. Jensing looks on with several other farmer.
SKYLER
We'll use nitrogen injection in that area. It looks level enough that
we won't have to bring down soil movers
The ranchers nod and move off as Boomer and Jolly come running up
JOLLY
Captain, we aren't alone on this planet. You'd better come right away.
Skyler gives Jolly a worried look and follows after him
ON GREENBEAN
with his sidearm in hand, his shaking hand extended in front of him
with the weight and fate of his people dispersed on his nervous face.
Skyler and Jolly charge up
GREENBEAN
No doubt about it, Captain. Someone's here besides up. Look at that...
Skyler swings his look over to some rocks. He sees nothing at first,
then looks down and sees a snarling face. It is Muffit Two
SKYLER
All right, Ensign, I'll handle it. Put up your weapon.
Skyler moves forward as Greenbean and Jolly watch warily
SKYLER
Come on, Muffy...here boy.
The robot dog prances out from behind the rocks, his tail wagging.
Skyler bends down and pats the droid on the head
SKYLER
Where's Boxey? Go find Boxey.
The droid takes off towards the livery ships
SKYLER
It's obvious you guys haven't boned up in your manual on dealing with
natives on friendly planets.
Skyler turns and moves off, leaving Greenbean and Jolly in confusion
SOMEPLACE ELSE ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON
The shuttle can be seen resting far in the b.g. as Starbuck climbs
over the rocky crest of a hill and looks down. His face suddenly
reflects an awesome find
STARBUCK
Boomer...
ON BOOMER
climbing up to the crest over jagged rocks
BOOMER
Yeah...yeah...what is it now...
STARBUCK
(stunned)
You aren't going to believe this, Boomer...
Boomer nears the top
BOOMER
Feeling is believing...
STARBUCK
(dazzled)
No, I mean really...
Boomer reaches the crest and looks. His mouth falls open
BOOMER
I don't believe it...
POINT OF VIEW - PARADEESE de FESTIVE' 
Far down a steep, rocky incline within the walls of a canyon, a
carnival of color and lights and spherical glass set amidst greenery
and pools of water, in a narrow valley of cliffs. People and creatures
come and go amidst laughter and song.
BOOMER AND STARBUCK
exchange blank stares
BOOMER
What is it?
Starbuck shakes his head dumbfounded
STARBUCK
I don't know.
Starbuck rises up, drawing his sidearm, and carefully starts down the
steep incline
ACROSS A CLEARING AMIDST THE POOLS OF WATER AND GARDENS
creatures and people move up and down the paths, laughing gaily.
Beyond them, Starbuck and Boomer appear, still completely disoriented
STARBUCK
It sure is pretty...and it sure sounds friendly...
A scream from o.s. They wheel around
A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN
is staring at Starbuck and Boomer
WOMAN
Don't shoot!! What do you want?
Starbuck embarrassingly looks at the weapon in his hand and quickly
puts it away, smiling
STARBUCK
I mean no harm. You're from Taura...
WOMAN
Yes, I'm a Taurus. How'd you know that?
STARBUCK
The dialect...What is this...What are you doing here?
WOMAN
What am I doing here??? What are you doing here??? Why are Colonial
Warriors sneaking around a resort with their weapons drawn? Everything
is perfectly legal.
Starbuck and Boomer exchange looks
WOMAN
Isn't it...?
STARBUCK
Would you mind telling us how you got here?
WOMAN
On the bus.
Another exchange of looks between Starbuck and Boomer
BOOMER
Must've been sniffing plant vapors...
STARBUCK
Would you tell us about this bus?
WOMAN
It was all handled through my travel agent. This place is fabulous...
I just can't believe they can give you all this for so little
money...
(she hurriedly starts to open her purse)
Look, I won over a thousand cubits...
Her purse burgeons with gold
STARBUCK
You won those cubits...here????
WOMAN
In there, sure...Look, they said it was all legal, so if it isn't,
you'd better take on the whole star system because everyone is doing
it. Look, I'm late. Talk about meeting people, they weren't kidding.
We're going on a moonlight cruise. Two moons. How can you go wrong?
She giggles and hurries off. Boomer looks after her
BOOMER
I don't get it. How cut off can they be. She didn't act like she'd
even heard about the war.
STARBUCK
There's something even more peculiar. Why haven't we heard about this
place?
BOOMER
I suppose you know every gambling den in our star system...
Starbuck slowly turns to look at Boomer. Boomer nods.
BOOMER
You're right. If there's a game going on, you know about it.
Starbuck turns and starts moving towards the lavish sphere.
STARBUCK
But this isn't back room cards! This is the biggest splash I've seen
outside of Orion.
Starbuck stops in his tracks and looks at Boomer as if seeing a light
flashing
STARBUCK
Which colony did the mining exploration on this planet?
The light begins to glow for Boomer
BOOMER
Orion...
STARBUCK
Count Baltar's private little empire. It was his engineers that
reported back to the Colonies that mining on this planet was
financially unfeasible
BOOMER
So he sets up a gambling resort. Why? Why put something like this
together and keep it a secret?
STARBUCK
To avoid paying Colonial taxes...his share of the war...
BOOMER
Yeah, but if you don't tell anyone about a place like this, you don't
do any business.
STARBUCK
Does this place look empty?
BOOMER
It just doesn't make any sense...
STARBUCK
It'll make sense when we ask the right questions...
INSIDE THE GIANT SPHERE
a circus of gambling games, attractive females, humanoid and extra-
terrestrial. A lovely, feline-looking cocktail waitress moves up to
Starbuck just inside the entrance. She is dressed very modestly,
revealing little but the shape of four handsome breasts and a furry
tail which removes a soiled glass from a chrome railing as she
extends a tray to Starbuck.
STARBUCK
No...thank you.
She moves off as Boomer moves up, his eyes on the waitress
STARBUCK
Did you see that tail...
BOOMER
Sure did...
A scream goes up from a gaming table nearby. Starbuck and Boomer take
a look. As they do, a cry of joy goes up a few feet away...and another
further across the room...
STARBUCK
The odds must be incredible here. People are winning a fortune...
BOOMER
And they are obviously well fed. Let's get a hold of whoever's in
charge and see about getting some food back to the fleet.
STARBUCK
Hold it...slow down...The last thing these people may want to find is
a Battlestar sitting on their front door...
BOOMER
Then you think this set-up is illegal?
STARBUCK
It wasn't exactly listed in the Colonial Concordance of places to
go...things to do...
Boomer starts looking around a little more nervously
BOOMER
Then they may not be too happy to see us, either.
STARBUCK
I've never been in a crooked gambling den that didn't depend on
military pay vouchers to keep their doors open.
Suddenly, a pit boss is on them
PIT BOSS
Welcome, gentlemen. Is that an emblem of the Colonial Fleet that I
see?
STARBUCK
Yes...it is...
PIT BOSS
I didn't realize they were in the area.
STARBUCK
As a matter of fact, we're kind of here on our own.
PIT BOSS
Little out of the way, aren't you?
BOOMER
Secret mission.
STARBUCK
He likes to be dramatic. Just a reconnaissance flight...see that the
armistice is being observed...
The ensuing moment seems like an eternity to Boomer and Starbuck. Does
the pit boss seem to be grinning at their naive lie, or is he being
genuinely hospitable?
PIT BOSS
How worthy...and how fortunate to have you with us. Consider
yourselves guests of the establishment. Food and drink are on the
house.
The pit boss smiles once again and moves off
BOOMER
Well, how do you feel now, sport? We have the run of the place while
our people are starving to death, and it'll be at least two centons
before we can raise crops.
STARBUCK
What did you expect me to do, ask the guy for twenty thousand quantums
of food for a couple of straggler pilots on a reconnaissance flight?
BOOMER
Maybe we could kinda' confide in him...
STARBUCK
Boomer, until we know who these people are, just keep in mind it'll
only take one informer to have the whole Cylon war machine on its way.
BOOMER
So what do we do? We've got to get fuel and food back to the ships.
STARBUCK
First thing we do is check in with the fleet and tell 'em what we've
found. Meanwhile, I'll try to find out who's behind this place. How
many cubits do you have with you?
BOOMER
Cubits!!! There are people back in our fleet half-starved and you're
going to gamble?
STARBUCK
Boomer, this time it's in the line of duty. We've got to start asking
some questions, but carefully, very carefully. Now go...check in...
BOOMER
All right, but you'd better make this last...that's all there is...
Boomer drops three cubits into Starbuck's hand
ON A HI-LO TABLE
Three people are seated at what might be a space-age blackjack game.
Starbuck heads for an open chair beside a woman, who, but for a few
pounds, might be extremely attractive. The other two at the table are
male, both approaching obesity
STARBUCK
This chair taken...?
The girl eyes Starbuck appraisingly. She likes what she sees.
LORNA
Well!!! The fleet's in...Sit down...
(She checks his shoulders for an insignia; looks impressed)
Lieutenant...you've come to a lucky table.
STARBUCK
That right...?
ON THE GAME
Hi-Lo or 7/11 as it is known throughout the star system, is a game
played with cards or electronic extensions of cards between any number
of players and a dealer.
The object of the game is to draw a hand as close as possible to
either 7 or 11. It is the players' choice, a judgment the player makes
after viewing his first card, or 'up' card...
ON THE SHUTTLE CRAFT
standing ominously still where Boomer and Starbuck left it on a
volcanic rock plateau
ON A ROCK FORMATION
as Ovion faces begin to rise from concealment and move towards the
ship
IN FRONT OF THE PARADEESE de FESTIVE'
Boomer ambles to a position of seclusion near some lush landscaping.
He withdraws a pocket communicator and talks into it in hushed tones
BOOMER
Land probe to Galactica...land probe to Galactica... Come in...
There is no response
BOOMER
Galactica...come in Galactica...
Boomer taps the small hand device and holds it up to his ear. He can
hear static, but no signal
BOOMER
Land probe to Galactica
BACK UP ON THE VOLCANIC ROCK PLATEAU
The Ovion leader raises his hand. A platoon of Ovion soldiers level
their hand weapons on the silent ship. He drops his hand
THE WEAPONS
fire multiple bursts of flame
THE SHUTTLE CRAFT
erupts into a pyre that reaches high into the sky
THE OVIONS
turn and begin to back away
THE SHUTTLE CRAFT
explodes into a fireball which rises high into the night sky
ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON
in another place
THREE OVION FACES
appear at ground level and continue to rise into frame. They stare
off...
POINT OF VIEW
Boxey moving along with Muffit Two behind him. Suddenly, Muffit Two
stops and looks towards camera and growls
THE OVION CREATURES
lower back beneath the ground
BOXEY
moves off towards Skyler. Muffit continues to start at the mound
ON BOXEY
as he moves up to Skyler who is scanning the area with an electronic
probe
BOXEY
How soon before things begin to grow?
SKYLER
Morning. By the end of the day tomorrow, we'll have a whole crop of
fresh food instead of comrations. Won't that taste better?
BOXEY
I'd rather go home. Why'd we have to leave? Why'd those people want
to hurt us?
SKYLER
Oh, because there are and have always been living beings who cannot
accept anything they don't understand...anything different
BOXEY
What do you mean, different?
SKYLER
Just about anything at all...the shape of your eyes, the number of
limbs, the color of the outer layer of your skin...even thoughts and
ideas. They just aren't equipped to deal with difference.
BOXEY
You mean they're stupid.
SKYLER
I guess by our standards. How can it be anything but stupid to kill
what you don't understand?
BOXEY
Why don't we kill them back?
SKYLER
Then we'd be changing what we are...to be like them. It's better for
us to go someplace else.
BOXEY
What if they come after us?
SKYLER
We might have to defend ourselves.
BOXEY
You mean kill them.
SKYLER
Possibly.
BOXEY
Then we'd be like them.
SKYLER
Boxey, you're beginning to see how complicated life is. We don't
believe in war, but the opposite of war isn't necessarily peace. What
we want is freedom...the right to be left alone, but there's always
the chance someone will come along and spoil everything.
BOXEY
So you kill them.
SKYLER
No...you try to establish penalties. Something that makes spoiling
someone else's way of life unrewarding.
BOXEY
You kill them.
SKYLER
Boxey, you have a way of reducing everything to very simple terms. I
don't know...maybe you're right...in the end we're talking about life
and death. Life is precious. No one has the right to tamper with
another's, without the risk of forfeiting their own. I think maybe
we're getting a little deep for a boy your age.
BOXEY
Why? You can die at any age, can't you?
SKYLER
Yes, Boxey, you can...Where's Muffit?
BOXEY
Right here...
Boxey turns to look. Muffit is not to be seen. Then from beyond the
mound, we hear barking
BOXEY
There he is.
SKYLER
Better get him. If he wanders off, he could fall into an old mining
probe and we'd never find him. And be careful...stay in plain view of
the livery ships.
BOXEY
I will.
As Boxey turns and moves off, Greenbean hurries up
ON GREENBEAN
GREENBEAN
Captain, I think we've got problems.
SKYLER
You've found another droid...
GREENBEAN
No...we lost Jolly...
Skyler gives Greenbean an impatient look
SKYLER
How could anybody lose Lieutenant Jolly...there's so much of him, he
almost qualifies as a planet. Let's check it out.
Skyler moves off with Greenbean
ON BOXEY
walking along amidst the mounds, scanning in all directions
BOXEY
Muffy...Muffy...Darn you daggit...Where are you...
Suddenly, a hand appears on Boxey's shoulder. He spins around. He
starts to scream.
ON AN OVION
As one hand reaches out to cove Boxey's mouth while two more hold his
arms to his side.
INSIDE THE OVION CHAMBERS
Boxey is being led down a corridor by two Ovion creatures. He is both
dismayed and frightened by the strange new world he has entered.
Suddenly, he hears barking. He takes off on a dead run.
BOXEY
Muffy!!!
AN OVION SOLDIER
raises his weapon. The other stops him from using it. They start after
Boxey.
ON THE ENTRANCE TO THE CHOSEN CHAMBER
Boxey charges up and through the legs of the Ovion guard as she
attempts to stop him. The guard begins to pursue him.
INSIDE THE CHOSEN CHAMBER
Boxey charges in, sees Muffy standing beside Jolly, barking at the
Chosen Leader. Her name is Lotay. As the Ovion guard is about to grab
Boxey, Lotay raises a hand.
LOTAY
Leave him.
Boxey crouches beside Muffy, holding him close. Muffy licks his face.
Lotay scans the odd assemblage before her -- an obese flyer, a small
child, and a peculiar-looking droid.
LOTAY
A curious group...
(after a thought, a pleasant smile)
But they will do nicely. Take them to a cell and prepare for the
others as quickly as possible.
Jolly edges over, grimly putting an arm around Boxey
IN THE PARADEESE de FESTIVE' CASINO
AT STARBUCK'S TABLE
another cheer goes up as Starbuck rakes in more cubits
STARBUCK
Let 'em ride again.
LORNA
Hey, you're fine. Where've you been all week? Where're you from? No,
let me guess, you're a Capricorn...
STARBUCK
What gave me away?
LORNA
Your tenacity...I mean you get what you want and you're aloof...All
you people from Caprica are alike
(she giggles)
And also your insignia says your unit is from Caprica.
STARBUCK
How'd you find out about this place?
LORNA
A girlfriend at the office told me about three of her roomates coming
here. They had such a good time, they stayed over...wrote us to come.
It was too good a deal to pass up.
STARBUCK
What's a good deal?
LORNA
Five cubits round trip, all meals included for one centon. I don't
know how they do it. The food is so good, I've gained ten pounds, and
my girlfriend...if she doesn't stop eating, they'll never get her
back off the planet.
Starbuck looks around at the capacity crowd
STARBUCK
I guess they make it up on the gambling...
LORNA
Except that I'm ahead fifty cubits.
Starbuck watches as the dealer punches up a card...A cheer from the
table...Lorna giggles.
LORNA
You win again.
Boomer returns with a serious look on his face
BOOMER
(sotto)
We'd better talk.
Starbuck reads Boomer's expression...rises
STARBUCK
Thanks for the company.
LORNA
(invitingly)
Any time...hurry back.
Boomer and Starbuck cross the casino into a lounge area from which
music is pulsating
STARBUCK
Where are we going? I'm finding out all sorts of things, like the fact
that these people are completely cut off rom ews of the outside world.
BOOMER
I'm not surprised. Be careful what you say, we're being watched.
As Starbuck starts to look around
STARBUCK
Who by?
Boomer slaps a hand on Sarbuck's back and grins broadly for effect
BOOMER
Right...Let's have a drink and listen to some music...loud music.
IN THE LOUNGE
A trio of female Tucanas are performing in what can best be described
as a spaced-out Supremes style of music. Tucanas are unusual beings,
in that while they are not totally unattractive in a feline sort of
way, they do have two mouths, which in a woman can be devastating,
unless they happen to be singers...
STARBUCK AND BOOMER
sit into a table combination for two and Starbuck is immediately taken
by the group
BOOMER
They can't try to read our lips in here.
STARBUCK
The place is full of lips. Look, are you sure you aren't imagining
things? This place is all right.
Starbuck places a cubit in a slot on a small pedestal in the middle of
the table. A cup drops down and amber begins to stream into it. He
then places a large stack of cubits in front of him, to Boomer's
amazement.
BOOMER
Where'd you get all those?
STARBUCK
Hi-lo. One thing this place isn't, is crooked. Would you listen to
those girls? They're great.
BOOMER
Forget the girls. Talk to me. What else did you pick up at that table!
Starbuck continues to stare at the girls
STARBUCK
Like what?
BOOMER
Like why they might need to watch us.
STARBUCK
Who?
He follows Boomer's gaze
TWO OVIONS
standing by a dapery partition are looking towards Boomer and
Starbuck. One turns and moves off
STARBUCK AND BOOMER
BOOMER
Ovions.
STARBUCK
Who?
BOOMER
Ovions. They're all over the place. My section got a briefing on them
from Intelligence.
STARBUCK
Where do they come from?
BOOMER
No one seems to kow much about them. They just started showing up on a
few outposts, mostly as migratory workers
STARBUCK
Looks like they're well-equipped for that...
BOOMER
It's their politics that are in doubt.
STARBUCK
I don't see how that's too important any more.
BOOMER
Why not?
STARBUCK
How can we worry about subversion when we don't have a planet left
to subvert? Hey, would you listen to those girls? They're incredible.
ON THE GROUP
The middle lady belts out a song in a fashion not dissimilar to Bette
Midler. The two ladies flanking her belt out 'oo's' and 'ah's,'
singing four-part harmony, with both mouths cranking out decibles of
music while the lead singer only seems to be using one of her two
orifices. The upper mouth is definitely doing all the work, but
effectively...very effectively.
STARBUCK
is mesmerized
STARBUCK
We could make a fortune if we could put those girls on the star
circuit. I mean big money, Boomer.
BOOMER
I don't believe you. Every creature in the universe is out to
exterminate us, and you want to hire a vocal group.
STARBUCK
Have a little vision, will 'ya. The war can't last forever. Someday,
it'll be over and what'll we be...antiquated, burned out fighter
pilots.
THE GIRLS
go for their big finish. The two outside ladies hitting a sustaining
chord only missing one element. We somehow feel it's forthcoming.
THE MIDDLE LADY
soars for a high note with her upper mouth and just as we reach the
final few beats in the melodious piece, we see the lower mouth, silent
for the entire song, open. We know it's coming...and it does...a low
resounding bass note on the final beat of the song that breaks the
glass in Starbuck's hand. The room breaks into tumultuous applause
STARBUCK
is flabbergasted. He rises
STARBUCK
I gotta' talk to them...
Boomer pulls him back down
BOOMER
You aren't going to talk to anybody. We're here on a mission.
STARBUCK
And I'm doing everything I can to find out what's going on. What did
the Commander tell you to do?
BOOMER
I couldn't reach the fleet.
STARBUCK
Why not?
BOOMER
We're in some kind of communication void. Probably the canyon walls.
STARBUCK
Well, hike up to the shuttle and call in
(rising with some consternation)
I'm telling you, we're sitting on top of a gold mine with these girls,
and all you can see is danger behind every rock.
BOOMER
It's a Tylium mine we're suppose to find and... where're you
going...?
STARBUCK
It doesn't matter where I'm going. You're going up to the shuttle to
heck in. And the sooner you do, the sooner we'll be getting food and
suppliess back to our ships. I'm telling you, these are nice people.
You can tell Commander Adama I said so.
As Starbuck moves off towards the casino, Boomer shakes his head
worriedly, then moves off.
OUTSIDE THE CASINO
Boomer exits and starts away. Suddenly, he finds he isn't alone.
Moving to one side of him through the shrubbery is an Ovion. To the
other side, another Ovion. He stops, looks back. Guarding the door
behind him, another Ovion. Boomer suddenly runs towards the rocks, a
laser blast streaks out. Boomer dives for cover. His hand reaches down
to his belt. He pushes an armature. As the Ovions slowly move up to
him and level their weapons on him
BOOMER
Easy fellas...nice bugs...
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
Skyler appears on a monitor
SKYLER
First Sergeant Jolly...then the boy and his droid...
Adama greets the news with every possible defense
ADAMA
The surface is covered with mining probes. They may have both fallen
in some similar crevice.
ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON
Skyler speaks into a scanner
SKYLER
Two disappearances possibu...but now our patrol beyond the ridge is
centons overdue, and we've just picked up the Flight Sergeant's
emergency beacon.
ADAMA
nods, concedint the weight of evidence
ADAMA
All right, Captain Skyler. Dispatch an immediate rescue mission beyond
the ridge.
SKYLER
I'd like to command it myself.
ADAMA
No, you've vital where you are.
SKYLER
Commander, Starbuck and Boomer are the best we have. If they're in
trouble...
ADAMA
Very well. Report in as soon as possible. Galacica out.
Adama signs off and turns to Tigh
ADAMA
I don't like the feel of it. I think it's time for an on-site
inspection. Prepare my shuttle and a squad of your best Warriors.
TIGH
Right away
TWO COLONIAL WARRIORS
streak over the edge of the mountain and across the sky
IN SKYLER'S SHIP
He is scanning the ground...searching
SKYLER
We'll follow the vector heading of the life signs Lieutenant Starbuck
was checking out.
Skyler galnces over to the next ship
ON JOLLY
as he nods his understanding
ON SKYLER
SKYLER
Let's go down on the deck...
ON SKYLER'S SHIP
as he peels off and rakes down closer to the surface, followed
immediately by the other ships, in flights of three.
AT THE LIVERY SHIPS
A cluster of Colonial Warriors are lined up in military formation
ADAMA
We'll divide into teams of two and criss-cross the area from the point
Flight Sergeant Jolly disappeared. We don't have much time, so cover
your quadrants as quickly as possible. All right... disperse...
Suddenly, a woman's frantic voice calls out
LYRA
Commander...
The men step out of formation to depart. Lyra rushes up to Adama
LYRA
Commander, the boy...Boxey...I just heard he's missing. May I join
the search? I've grown very attached to that little waif.
ADAMA
This isn't easy terrain.
LYRA
I've been to places in the star system that make this look like a
stellar lounge.
ADAMA
I'd be honored to have you aboard.
She returns Adama's ingratiating smile
ON SKYLER IN HIS FIGHTING SHIP
as he soars along at tree-top level, scanning the ground
SKYLER
I don't know where Starbuck's shuttle is, but it's sure not on these
coordinates
GREEBEAN
He must've decided to...
Suddenly, Greenbean's mouth flies open
GREENBEAN
Captain!!!
SKYLER
already aware ofwhat Greenbean sees
SKYLER
I see it...
GREENBEAN
What is it?
SKYLER
I haven't got the slightest idea, but that's where Boomer's distress
signal is coming from.
GREENBEAN
What do we do about it?
SKLER
Find a place to land and have a look.
THE TWO FIGHTERS
peel off in search of a landing spot
ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON
Colonial Warrior criss-cross a segment of land which appears as a
slightly angled plane of black, volcanic rock
ON TWO WARRIORS
as they move past camera, we pan back to see the ground open up to
reveal to Ovion warriors moving up out of the ground
IN ANOTHER AREA
Greenbean and another Warrior move past camera. Once again, they are
no more than a few feet away when two more Ovions appear behind them.
ON ADAMA
He stops with Lyra at his side to allow her to catch her breath. A
cold wind chills them
LYRA
Getting very cold...
ADAMA
We won't be able to continue the search much longer. The
temperature's dropping too fast
Lyra looks off to one side
LYRA
That's odd. We seem to be the only ones on the summit.
ADAMA
Must've been moving a little faster than everyone else. I'll admit I'm
worried.
Lyra turns and moves back past a rock formation on this high plateau
LYRA
Commander, you'd better have a look.
Adama turns and moves back around the rock formation
POINT OF VIEW
A long sweeping vista of black volcanic rock anglingdown to a small
meadow where the livery ships stand ominously alone and still
ADAMA
turns back to Lyra
LYRA
They're all gone...we're alone.
ADAMA
quickly drwas his weapon
ADAMA
It's impossible.
LYRA
Commander, I'm frightened. What's going on?
ADAMA
I don't know, but let's...
Adama half turs...his look freezes. Lyra turns and screams
ON TWO OVIONS
their weapons extended towards the two humans
ON SKYLER AND GREENBEAN
as they approach the burned-out remains of two Viper War ships. Both
men have their weapons drawn as they move up cautiously
GREENBEAN
If Boomer and Starbuck were in those birds, sir...
Skyler...looks down at his communicator. It continues to flash.
SKYLER
It would have been destroyed their distress beacon. No...Boomer's
signal is still loud and clear.
GREENBEAN
What do we do?
SKYLER
You stand guard on the ships. We can't afford to lose two more. I'm
going to follow Boomer's beacon. It seems to be coming from down
there. Whatever it is...
Skyler moves with Boomer to look down on the Casino de Festive'
INSIDE THE OVION CHAMBERS
Adama and Lyra are being escorted by guards. As they reach the main
chamber, Adama and Lyra look around in amazement.
LYRA
What is it?
MOVING POIINT OF VIEW
The large main chamber where countless Ovion workers mine Tylium
around the clock
ADAMA
It may be the largest underground Tylium mine in the star system
LYRA
To run our ships...
ADAMA
(ominously)
To run somebody's ships
They arrive at the Chosen Chamber. The guards stand aside. Adama and
Lyra enter
INSIDE THE CHOSEN CHAMBER
Lotay looks up from her perch.
LOTAY
You are Commander Adama?
ON ADAMA AND LYRA
ADAMA
I am...
LOTAY
Welcome to Carillon. You are impressed?
ADAMA
Outraged is more like it. Where are my men and the boy?
As easy smile crosses Lotay's face
LOTAY
Would you care to join them?
ADAMA
You bet I would...and if anything's happened to any one of them,
you'll answer to the Colonies.
The Chosen Leader smiles non-committally and rises. We find that she
is taller than the worker Ovions. She leads the way as the Ovion guard
move in behind Adama and Lyra.
IN A CORRIDOR
LYRA
(sotto)
Did that smile mean she knows the Colonies don't exist?
ADAMA
(sotto)
I don't know...
They arrive at another entry. The Leader stands aside.
LOTAY
Enter...
Adama and Lyra exchange wary looks and pass through the door.
INSIDE THE GUEST CHAMBER
Adama and Lyra stop in their tracks and stare incredulously
POINT OF VIEW -- THE CHAMBER
alive with music and entertainment...four-armed jugglers, dancing
Ovions...and a banquet befitting kings with succulent victuals of
every dimension, proportion and manner
JOLLY
JOLLY
Commander!!!
Everyone turns to look. Boxey jumps down from the knee of an Ovion
workers and runs to Lyra. Jolly moves hurriedly, food in hand...a
drumstick and an odd-looking piece of fruit
JOLLY
It's like nothing we could have dreamed of. They've got plenty of
everything we need, and they want to share it.
LYRA
Sounds like paradise...
Adama gazes around the room warily...a troubled look on his face.
ADAMA
Yes, it does...
LOTAY
We are a communal order from birth. We all work...We all share...
There is no competition, no jealousy, no conflict...only peace and
order.
ADAMA
Perpetual happiness.
LOTAY
Happiness is the goal of an immature order. All pursue it. Few have
it. None can sustain it. The Ovion is content. It is better.
Adama and Lyra exchange cautious looks
LYRA
It seems to work for you.
LOTAY
For millenniums it has been so. Now, join us... Be our guests...be
well fed, well entertained... Be content.
The Ovion Leader smiles that strange, bewildering look that suggests
a private meaning. Adama can't help feeling it's more than a benign
suggestion.
IN THE CASINO ON TWO OVION SECURITY GUARDS
watching Starbuck and looking anything but benign
ON STARBUCK AT THE HI-LO TABLE
A cheer arises from the gallery which by this time is substantial.
They watch with vicarious fear as Starbuck presses his entire
accumulations of cubits out on the wagering table.
ON LORNA
LORNA
What're you going to do with all that money?
STARBUCK
Let it all ride...
A small cheer from Lorna and the two obese gentlemen. As we pan off to
the main door as a figure enters.
SKYLER
looks around incredulously. He hears a resounding cheer...looks...
POINT OF VIEW
A narrow aperture through the gallery reveals the image of a Colonial
Warrior as the center of attention.
THE DEALER
seems to be looking for help. He is perspiring.
DEALER
I will have to see if they will remove the limit.
The dealer signals o.s. as Skyler moves up and stares in utter
disbelief at the pile of golden cubits in front of a cigar-smoking
Starbuck.
SKYLER
Lieutenant, do you mind telling me what you're doing?
Starbuck turns, somewhat startled and embarrassed
STARBUCK
Winning...I mean
(he struggles to his feet, rising awkwardly from his stool)
Sir...
SKYLER
What is this place? What's going on here...
Starbuck turns to Lorna
STARBUCK
Uh, excuse me, dear...Watch my cubits?
Starbuck hustles Skyler a few feet away to talk conspiratorially as
a few yards away, the pit boss gestures in pantomime to the dealer.
STARBUCK
Oh, sir...as near as we can figure, this is a resort. These people
are here from all over the star system.
SKYLER
That doesn't make any sense. This place is a desolate rock.
STARBUCK
Maybe...but everyone's having a great time.
SKYLER
Not everyone.
STARBUCK
Everyone that I've seen.
SKYLER
How long since you talked to Boomer?
STARBUCK
Boomer???
SKYLER
Somebody blew up his ship...yours, too.
STARBUCK
Blew up our ships? Boomer went there to use the long-range
communicator. If someone did something to Boomer...
SKYLER
He never reached the ship. His distress beacon is still working...
that's what bothers me.
STARBUCK
It can't be working. I didn't pick it up.
SKYLER
I'm not picking it up now, either...but my flyover pointed right to
where you're standing.
STARBUCK
Captain...Boomer isn't here...he left.
SKYLER
If he isn't in this building, he's under it.
Skyler and Boomer exchange ominous looks as the pit boss moves up.
PIT BOSS
Sir, as a special courtesy to our Colonial Warrior guests, the limit
has been removed.
Starbuck looks at Skyler questioningly as a cheer of anticipation
rises from the gallery. Skyler nods.
SKYLER
Go ahead, Lucky. Break the bank. I'd like to see what happens when
you try to walk out of here with their money.
Starbuck pales.
STARBUCK
Look...maybe we've learned all we can here...
SKYLER
No...no...you go right ahead. I'll just look around for a bit...
STARBUCK
I'd feel better if you were watching my flank.
SKYLER
You were doing fine before I got here. Good luck.
Skyler moves off, leaving Starbuck alone as Lorna moves to him and
takes his arm and pulls him to the table.
LORNA
Come on, sport. You're going to bring the house down.
STARBUCK
That's what's worrying me.
MOVING THROUGH THE CASINO WITH SKYLER
as he edges past more games of chance as cheers rise from each table.
Finally, Skyler reaches a bank of elevators. He notices a large group
of rather obese people being escorted by Ovions into an elevator.
Skyler moves up to join the group. An Ovion's hand bars the way.
OVION
You have a voucher? 
SKYLER
I just wanted to browse. Where does this go?
OVION
It is the chamber of the Living End. You must have a voucher.
SKYLER
I hope it's a reducing salon. Looks like some of these boys have been
having too good a time. Can I look around?
OVION
When you have a voucher. It comes at the end of your two week stay.
The people have all entered the elevator car, and the Ovion who has
been speaking with Skyler now steps back into the car himself.
SKYLER
Two week stay...Look, I don't plan on sticking...
The door whisks closed in Skyler's face and whisks downward, out of
sight. He finishes the statement to himself..."self"... and turns to
head back through more cheering guests taking curious and troubled
note of what he is seeing. Suddenly, he turns and heads towards the
front doors at an easy gait. As he closes to them, he is aware that
Ovion Guards are following his progress.
AT THE FRONT DOORS
Skyler pauses as he is about to start outside. Quickly, he looks back
into the room.
POINT OF VIEW
One of the Ovions who has been tracking him has a transceiver in his
hand and is talking into it. Finding himself caught by Skyler's gaze,
he lowers the transceiver.
SKYLER
swings his look back out the door.
POINT OF VIEW TO THE VEGETATION OUTSIDE
Two shadows ducking back behind some shrubbery.
SKYLER
turns and moves back across the casino towards Starbuck.
AT STARBUCK'S TABLE
a cheer from the gallery as Starbuck's winnings mount. The game now
watched closely by a pit boss and several guards, who begin to press
in more closely. Skyler eyes them behind Starbuck warily. Lorna leans
in, pawing Starbuck admiringly.
LORNA
You are the luckiest man I've ever...
Suddenly, she stops in mid-sentence, her jaw hanging open as she sees
Skyler slowly raising his sidearm from its holster to bring it
directly to bear on the dealer's chest. A gasp from the crowd.
STARBUCK
What are you doing?
SKYLER
I'm going to see if I can put a hole through him.
The dealer's eyes flare wide with alarm. In an instant, the head
security guard is at Starbuck's side.
HEAD SECURITY GUARD
Sir...you'll have to...
As he starts to draw his weapon, he finds Starbuck's sidearm quickly
in his side. Starbuck quickly moves an arm around the Ovion's head,
turning him towards the other security guards moving up, transforming
him into a shield.
STARBUCK
Let's keep our hands out where we can see 'em, fellas. All of them.
Now, you mind telling me what we're doing, sir!
THE APPROACHING SECURITY GUARDS
stop in place and refrain from any movement towards their weapons
SKYLER
unflinching...his weapon leveled at the dealer
HEAD SECURITY GUARD
If I may ask...what seems to be your complaint?
SKYLER
This man is cheating my friend.
STARBUCK
What???
An incredulous remble moves through the gallery. Skyler is beginning
to lose their support. Obviously, he's a military psychopath.
HEAD SECURITY GUARD
But he is winning.
SKYLER
No. He appears to be winning. The dealer is cheating.
STARBUCK
Ah, look, Skyler...Captain...I'm pretty good, you know...
HEAD SECURITY GUARD
Sir, if you doubt his good fortune, I suggest he pick up his cubits
and leave.
STARBUCK
Sounds like a real good idea, Skyler! Why don't we just be on our
way...
SKYLER
Not until somebody explains why he was letting him win.
HEAD SECURITY GUARD
Nothing could be more absurd...
STARBUCK
Does sound a bit odd. Look, maybe these fellas'd be willing to help
us get to our ship if we just give back the winnings and forget the
whole thing!
SKYLER
They don't mind winners, Starbuck. There isn't a loser in the house.
They see to that.
HEAD SECURITY GUARD
A human weakness...momentous judgements on miniscule perspectives...
As the people begin to grumble at Skyler's destroying heir party
OBESE MAN #1
Look, fella, why don't you tell your friend to go back to his ship
and sleep it off, huh?
LORNA
Right. You have something against people having a litle fun...winning
a little money?
STARBUCK
Captain, come on. You're going to have everyone at our throats.
SKYLER
Just ask yourselves, have you seen a loser here? Doesn't that strike
all of you as odd?
OBESE MAN #2
What is it, boy? You worried about the taxes on our winnings? That
why you're here, boy? You a tax collector?
OBESE MAN #1
You come to close this place down, fella?
The room is turning angry. Skyler raises his weapon.
SKYLER
He was letting you win.
LORNA
Why?
SKYLER
Maybe to keep you here, or content. I don't know.
OBESE MAN #1
Put your weapon away, son, or I'm going to take it away from you.
The man moves off his chair towards Skyler
STARBUCK
Captain, with all due respect...
Skyler realizes the contrantation's quickly going to get out of hand.
He starts to back away, his weapon in front of him.
OBESE MAN #1
Maybe you can explain what you're doing here, boy. You come for a
vacation, or for trouble?
The people continue to move towards Starbuck and Skyler, the security
guards amongst them, waiting for an opportuity. Starbuck and Skyler
find themselves with the front doors cut off from them by the guards.
SKYLER
There's trouble, all right. The war with the Alliance is over. We
lost.
OBESE MAN #2
Lost! You poor fool. You've been on patrol too long. There's been an
armistice. Didn't you hear?
The crowd begins to laugh at Skyler
OBESE MAN #1
Course they didn't tell 'im. Have to keep morale up. If they don't
have a war, they don't have jobs.
The laugh turns to jeers. The noise becomes deafening. Skyler edges
towards the elevator.
STARBUCK
The front doors are that way...
SKYLER
So is their reception party. We've got to make a run for it,
Starbuck.
STARBUCK
The minute we do, the Ovions'll start shooting.
SKYLER
The old duck and roll...
STARBUCK
Right...
Starbuck quickly scans the area. He looks up...
POINT OF VIEW
an ornate chandelier high in the ceiling in front of the elevators.
STARBUCK
shifts the barrel of his sidearm upward and in one deft movement,
sends a laser blast streaming from the ceiling and turns and ducks
for an open elevator with Skyler right behind him.
ON THE CEILING
as the ornate chandelier is blasted out of its moorings and starts
for the floor
THE CROWD
starts forward, then jumps back as the fixture crashes in front of
the doorway, sending a pillar of debris and electrical shorting...
END OF HOUR TWO
HOUR THREE
FADE IN
ON ELEVATOR DOORS IN A SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE
They open, emitting a covey of Ovions who run from the car and stand
looking off down two intersecting corridors which range off into
complete blackness. The Ovions raise their sidearms and fire
resounding laser blasts off into the black abyss. Quickly, aother team
of Ovions move up in two land vehicles. Two Ovions climb on one
vehicle, two more on the other, and the machines whine off in opposite
directions.
Momentarily, all is still. We pan back to the elevator car and find
two pairs of legs descending from the top of the car.
SKYLER AND STARBUCK
drop to the floor and ease cautiously out into the passageway.
STARBUCK
On reconsidering...I believe there may be something to your suspicions
about this place. Let's move. One of these tunnels must lead out of
here.
SKYLER
They also lead to those fellas who were firing full charges at what
they hoped was us. That isn't nice, Starbuck.
STARBUCK
I don't see how we have any choice, unless you're suggesting we go
back the way we came in. You wouldn't suggest that, would you?
O.S. a whine can be heard. Both men turn and look.
STARBUCK
I'm not real crazy about the sound of that...
SKYLER
I'm not, either.
POINT OF VIEW
an eerie light approaching from down the dark passageway
SKYLER AND STARBUCK
reach in unison...turn and scamper for the elevator car...raise their
hands over their heads, jump, and pull themselves up out of sight.
Panning back, we find a tram pullung up to a stop beside the elevator.
From the front of the tram, three Ovions exit and move into the
elevator car.
FROM UP ABOVE THE CAR
we find Skyler and Starbuck watching helplessly as the Ovions,
conversing in high-pitched chatter. The car stops. They exit and move
into the Casino, leaving Starbuck and Skyler trapped.
STARBUCK
This isn't turning out to be as much fun as I'd hoped. Now what?
SKYLER
Now we wait.
STARBUCK
What for?
SKYLER
For someone to take us back down
STARBUCK
I'm not too crazy about that idea, either. At least up here there are
people we could talk to.
SKYLER
These people are no better off than we are. You saw that shuttle down
there. I figure it just came back from taking a load of these people
someplace.
STARBUCK
Where?
SKYLER
That's a good question. I've got a hunch the answer is the reason for
this place's existence.
ON THE GALACTICA
hovering amongst the fleet above the planet Carillon. A space shuttle
approaches from the rear.
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
Colonel Tigh receives a courier, reads the information, and looks up,
troubled.
TIGH
I'm leaving the bridge. I'll be with Commander Adama if I'm needed.
ON COMMANDER ADAMA IN HIS QUARTERS
He sits at a desk dictating into a device
ADAMA
The Ovion people have extended to the survivors of the colonies every
measure of goodness and support we might have hoped for. It is now
possible to foresee the entire fleet able to resume our voage within
a centon.
CLOSE ON AN AUTOMATIC WRITING DEVICE
A small, tube-like extension which focuses a small measure of light
on a roll of paper. As the light moves by, lettering is placed
silently and nearly on the paper. There is a knock at the door.
ADAMA
Come in.
Colonel Tigh enters. Adama glances at him,
ADAMA
Nothing can be that bad. We've found supplies, adequate to carry our
people far out of this star system. We couldn't have fallen on
better fortune.
TIGH
No, sir. In fact, things are too good.
Adama gives Tigh a curious look.
ADAMA
Too good?
TIGH
Most of our people are still on comrations. As tasty as I'd like to
say they are, they just don't measure up to thestories coming back
from the surface of Carillon. There's a lot of talk going around...
ADAMA
What kind of talk?
TIGH
That you're exceedig your authority by keeping people in the ships
instead of allowing them some time on the planet.
Adama rises in a state of shock.
ADAMA
Exceeding my authority! This is a voyage of survival. We could be
under attack at any time. The crews on Carillon are down there
to work, not party.
TIGH
Sir, all of our people have been through a debilitating shock. I'm
sure some of them are getting a little of it our of their systems.
ADAMA
Just what is it you're telling me? I dispatched two of our elite
squadrons to harvest food and obtain fuel for our survival. Now what's
going on down there?
Tigh says nothing, but his expression sends the Commander toward the
door.
ADAMA
Prepare my shuttle 
ON THE FLIGHT DECK
Adama exits an elevator and heads towards his shuttle. As he does, he
sees a group of twelve men disembarking a second craft. They form a
grim barrier as he moves up to them, sensing an uneasy confrontation.
ADAMA
Anton...Seth...and Seppy. So good to see you all.
ANTON
You appear to be leaving.
Adama will need more than a smile. He knows this is not going to go
well.
ADAMA
I have to go down to the surface of Carillon.
ANTON
(caustically)
Of course! We understand!
ADAMA
I'm not sure that you do.
ANTON
Adama, we want to discuss an orderly 
rotation of all our people down to Carillon.
ADAMA
I don't think that's wise.
SETH
The Quorum does.
ANTON
Adama, we took the liberty of holding a council to elect new
leadership.
ADAMA
I see. And what was the outcome?
SETH
Each of us here has been elected to represent out respective colonies.
We are the new Quorum of the Twelve.
ADAMA
And have we a new President?
ANTON
Why, of course, Adama. You.
The men applaud and backslap Adama with nervous affection.
ADAMA
Thank you. It will be my pleasure to serve you. However, I cannot
permit...
LOBE
Adama, you have run a ship as big as a sun center. Some of our people
are cramped up in cubicles no bigger than a cubit.
ANTON
And it may be a long time between stops.
LOBE
It's only fair our people share in the fruits of Carillon.
ADAMA
Anton, surely you understand that we are still at war. An Alliance
has dedicated itself to our extinction. You must recognize a need for
extraordinary measures. I cannot allow our people down on Carillon
before inspecting the conditions and its possible risks.
ANTON
Of course. We all understand that, so why don't we accompany you and
see for ourselves, shall we?
Enthusiastically, they all start for the shuttle ship as Adama's
expression turns grim.
IN A DARK TUNNEL
Ovions approach on a surface craft and enter the elevator pod
STARBUCK
We could have been far away from here by now.
SKYLER
They've got scanners and vehicles. They didn't expect us to stay
around.
STARBUCK
Because they were under the impression we were intelligent beings.
No offense...
SKYLER
As always, I'll involve your youth to save your aresford. This is the
last place they'll be looking for us.
Starbuck gestures to a long, tram-like vehicle parked in the tunnel
STARBUCK
Why not take that vehicle?
SKYLER
Because it looks like it moves slowly and makes a lot of noise.
STARBUCK
I'd still feel better than sitting here, waiting... for what!
SKYLER
For that vehicle to move?
STARBUCK
Where?
SKYLER
Where I think we want to go!
STARBUCK
Skyler, sir...would you mind sharing a few pieces of the magic puzzle.
I mean, I've seen...
SKYLER
Well, I think I know how someone can run a casino that gives away
money.
STARBUCK
What is it?
SKYLER
I'm not sure you want to hear it.
STARBUCK
Try me.
SKYLER
Suppose there's a very rich mine on this planet.
STARBUCK
Yeah...
SKYLER
I mean, it's rich if you have somebody to mine it.
STARBUCK
Which they don't.
SKYLER
What if they do? What if those Ovions are bringing in people from all
over the star system to visit this wonderful casino resort where you
can't lose... except in the end.
STARBUCK
Ahhh, Skyler, that's ugly.
SKYLER
Yes, it is...if they wind up as slave labor down in a Tylium mine.
STARBUCK
That's a long shot. Some of those people were so fat, they couldn't
touch their shoes, let alone mine Tylium. That's hard work.
SKYLER
Doesn't take long to work off weight in a Tylium mine.
STARBUCK
You know something?
SKYLER
What?
STARBUCK
I felt better about those Ovions when I didn't understand them.
SKYLER
The next load of people they move out in that thing, probably in the
morning...we're going to climb on and find out if I'm right.
STARBUCK
Uh...uh...on the chance that you are right, whichever way that thing
goes, I go the other way.
SKYLER
I could order you to go with me.
STARBUCK
Are you ordering me?
SKYLER
No. It's liable to be a one-way trip.
STARBUCK
Right.
SKYLER
Helping to save humanity is going to have to be a personal decision,
Starbuck. Goodnight.
Skyler tucks his head down on top of the elevator and closes his eyes.
Starbuck watches him for a long beat, then looks off with a totally
disgusted look on his face.
STARBUCK
Ahhhhhh Feljurcreb!!!
IN THE OVION BANQUET ROOMS
continued merriment, laughter, food and drink. Only Boxey is moving
about, looking worried.
BOXEY
Muffy...Muffy
He can't seem to find the droid. He wanders towards the door where an
Ovion guard stands watch. The guard is talking to a second guard in
the corridor. He doesn't notice Boxey move off down the corridor.
ON THE LARGE MINE
The cavernous room from which the mining operation can be observed.
LOTAY
...the largest Tylium mine in all the star system...
Panning off, we find the Quorum of the Twelve being guided on a tour
ANTON
It's a testimony to communal order...
LOTAY
Thank you
IN THE OVION LEADER'S PRIVATE CHAMBER
They enter to find a large feast prepared for them on floor mats and
pillows in the center of the room. On one side, gentle music is
emitted from two stringed instruments in contrast to the rousing
melodies indigenous to the more public dining area.
ANTON
This is too much to expect.
LOTAY
We have plenty. As many of your people who desire it are invited to
be our guests.
Anton turns to Adama
ANTON
Can you in good conscience deny our people such an invitation?
ADAMA
Well, perhaps a very carefully organized small rotation.
SETH
But I thought time was our greatest consideration. The more we bring
here at once, the sooner we can be on our way.
Adama turns to the Leader
ADAMA
May I ask how our request for Tylium is being received?
LOTAY
We have already prepared the first shipment for you, have we not?
ADAMA
Yes, we boarded it. However, I understand there is to be a delay in
obtaining any more.
LOTAY
Unfortunately, we were not prepared for your request. Only two
centons ago, we dispatched almost all that was on hand. What we gave
you this day was what we were able to mine yesterday. We are
industrious, Commander, but we are also small.
Lotay smiles ingratiatingly.
ANTON
I think we press our luck, Commander. Let us not be rude in the face
of such hospitality.
LOTAY
Please begin. Be our guests. Be well fed, well entertained. Be
content.
As the Ovion leader is about to step away, Adama brings her to a stop.
ADAMA
You aren't joining us?
LOTAY
(a vague smile crosses her face)
No...I am afraid not.
She simlply moves off. On her exit...
ANTON
Well, I don't think there can be any doubt as to our decision. It
will take time to obtain the Tylium. We will give every person an
opportunity to share in our bounty down here on Carillon.
IN A CORRIDOR
Lotay moves briskly along, escorted by four Ovion guards. They reach
a chamber. Lotay stops, looks up and down the corridor, and enters
alone.
ON THE BACK OF AN EMPEROR'S CHAIR
Lotay moves forward until she has come to a point just in front of
the chair. She bows her head.
LOTAY
By your command...
ON THE THRONE
Baltar sits draped across the chair, a smug smile on his face. On
either side of him are the two Cylon Centurians.
BALTAR
I see you're entertaining these days.
LOTAY
The Colonials have only allowed a few of their Warriors to land.
BALTAR
I knew your hospitality would be impossible to refuse. After all the
experience you've had dining with humans...
Baltar cannon resist laughing at his private joke.
BALTAR
And what of Commander Adama
LOTAY
A brief visit. He is with the fleet now.
BALTAR
I want him here! When he is in our grasp, we have won!
ON BOXEY EXITING A DARK STAIRCASE INTO A FORBIDDEN CHAMBER
filled with Ovion workers slaving in a mine shaft, lighted by eerie,
subdued, pulsating light. Here the mood is not one of showcase
industry, but rather of endless, mindless obedience to a cruel
taskmaster. The Ovions dig at the walls with small utensils, some of
them turning to steal glances at the small waif of a lad walking up
their forbidden ocrridor. A high-pitched, insect-like chanting
reverberates throughout the sub chambers. Suddenly, a high-pitched
whine.
AN OVION WORKER
falls from a pinnacle, crashing to the ground not far from Boxey. Two
sentry Ovions move efficiently up and remove the fallen worker,
dragging the hapless form of to a pit where it is hurled out of sight.
Having completed their task, one of the two sentries turns its
attention to Boxey. The first sentry exchanges high-frequency
communication with the second and the pair start towards Boxey.
BOXEY
isn't so young that he cannon sense imminent danger. He turns and
runs. The Ovions continue towards him as Boxzey turns off ito another
corridor.
SOMEPLACE ELSE IN THE DEPTHS OF THE CHAMBERS -- ON MUFFY
prancing along a deep, foreboding, dark corridor. Suddenly, a moaning
sound brings him to a stop. He cocks his head to listen. The moaning
continues. An anthem to human suffering. Muffy prances up a corridor
darker than the one he was in.
ON MUFFY AS HE STOPS AND LOOKS
his ears and hairs suddenly stand on end
A YELLOWISH WINDOW
octangular in shape as it seals off an insect-like cell. Pressed
against the plastic-like window, countless humans, intermingled with
other interstellar beings, crammed, jammed, wedged together into a
butcher's shop display case of living flesh. An obese human sees Muffy
and claws at the window with desperation...tracking sweeps of blood
where his fingers have cruelly yielded to the abrasive sealing glass.
BOXEY'S VOICE
Muffy...Muffy...Where are you?
Muffy turns and barks, taking us to Boxey standing at the end of the
corridor. He sees Muffy and runs to him, bending down to cuddle him
close. Suddenly, he is aware of the strange moaning. His little face
looks up from the furry droid in his arms and freezes in disbelief.
He lets out an involuntary cry and jumps up and turns to run. He
moves no more than a few feet when he collides into
TWO OVION SENTRIES
who look down on Boxey and Muffy with cruel, cold, programmed intent
ON COLONEL TIGH AND ATHENA ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
TIGH
But we can't shuttle everyone to the surface of Carillon...the fuel
and the pilots...
ATHENA
(adding her voice)
There'll be no one left to stand alert.
COMMANDER ADAMA
paces away from Athena and Tigh. He looks out the vast window to space
with the ships of the fleet scattered across the sky above Carillon.
ADAMA
Have we heard from Captain Skyler yet?
TIGH
No, sir. He's been out of contact a full centon.
ADAMA
Does something feel very wrong to you, Colonel, of am I just
hopelessly paranoid?
TIGH
I once read a book on tactical survival in an alien world. It said a
little paranoia was good for you.
Adama nods, heading out.
ADAMA
I'm familiar with that book. I wrote it. Prepare my shuttle. I'm
returning to the surface.
TIGH
Commander, about your book.
ADAMA
Yes. I've prepared a set of orders to cover that contingency. In
them, you will find my instructions for what to do to save the 
Galactica and her fold, should the unhappy need arise.
Adama withdraws an envelope from his tunic and passes it to Tigh, who
examines it carefully.
TIGH
You can't be serious.
ADAMA
Deadly serious.
The two men exchange grim looks born of years of service together in
the face of a ruthless enemy.
ON TOP OF THE ELEVATOR WITHIN THE CASINO CORRIDOR
Starbuck lies facing up into the darkness, his eyes open
STARBUCK
Skyler...
SKYLER
Mmmm...
STARBUCK
You awake?
SKYLER
Yeah...
STARBUCK
You hear something?
SKYLER
No...
STARBUCK
Sounded like a door opening above.
SKYLER
Must be almost morning by now. Could be another one of their health
tours.
STARBUCK
You really intend to see where they go?
SKYLER
Uh-huh.
STARBUCK
Just like your father...
Skyler seems to care about the conversation for the first time. His
eyes shift over to the form sharing the claustrophobic space beside
him.
STARBUCK
No offense meant. I guess I have a reputation for taking things kind
of loose and easy. Doesn't mean I don't appreciate it whem someone
sticks his neck out for me. You, I mean...
SKYLER
(embarrassed)
I thought we were talking about my father.
STARBUCK
I was...in a way...I mean...we wouldn't have survived if he hadn't
done what he did...and what you did...what you had to do. That took
a lot of courage, too.
SKYLER
This isn't courage, Starbuck; it's reflex. You know you're a complete
Warrior when you find you can leave your own brother behind to die...
STARBUCK
To save how many more brothers? You can't feel responsible.
SKYLER
Starbuck, you're a naive young boy. Let me tell you what I feel...
what's really bothering me. It's how long it's taking me to feel
anything at all. Only now, two centons after he's gone, do I begin
to ache..to start to hurt...to want to cry. That's how programmed
I've become. So which one of us is the lesser living creature? The
one that's gone on or the one who is left behind and feels nothing?
Starbuck finds he's opened up a floodgate he isn't equipped to handle
STARBUCK
I don't know...
SKYLER
Now you sound like a leader. I don't know, either.
Suddenly, the elevator begins to move downwards. Both men freeze with
cautious anxiety as the car stops.
POINT OF VIEW
The shuttle vehicle begins loading passengers in front of the
elevator. They are all large, almost obeses creatures, some human,
some not, but all in a condition to necessitate waddling aboard the
bus.
STARBUCK
(sotto)
Maybe it's going home time!
SKYLER
Uh-uh. I'm willing to bet it's the great big payoff to the free trip
to Carillon. Oh, I forgot. You won't be around to see who wins.
STARBUCK
Well, now, if you want to make a wager out of it...I mean, a real
man's wager...
Starbuck looks at Skyler with growing significance
SKYLER
It could be the most important bet you've made, Starbuck. It could
save a lot of people or it could cost you big...
Starbuck looks at Skyler with affection
STARBUCK
It won't be the first time I rode everything I had on a long shot.
SKYLER
Thanks...
ON THE TOUR TRAM
as it moves out
ON STARBUCK AND SKYLER
as they drop off he top of the elevator onto the tram
INSIDE THE OVION CHAMBERS
The largest chamber. A tour is in progress, festive in mood, Seetol,
the Ovion guard, pointing out the wonderful ways of their world.
Amongst the gallery, Lyra and Athena.
SEETOL
...star system's largest Tylium mine, with a per annum capacity equal
to the needs of the entire galaxy.
ATHENA
(sotto)
I wonder why it is, then, thay they've only managed to ship us one
token load?
LYRA
I've noticed another curious thing...
(louder)
May I ask a question?
The group stops and turns to Lyra, as Seetol displays a public
relations smile.
SEETOL
You are our guests. Of course.
LYRA
I am fasciated by the order of your society and I cannot help but be
impressed by your industry...your complete dedication...I mean, one
gets the feeling that these people work until they simply drop...
SEETOL
We know no other way...
LYRA
Well, what of family institutions? I somehow sense that something is
missing.
SEETOL
We are very complete.
LYRA
What about males?
SEETOL
Males?
LYRA
Well, I don't mean to pry, but this is a female culture. Surely, there
must be males someplace. Perhaps you keep them at home, where they 
belong...
A laugh from a group dominated by males.
SEETOL
We don't keep them at all.
LYRA
I beg your pardon?
SEETOL
You are correct. Males have their place until they have served their
purpose, and then they have no place in our society.
As the implications become clearer, Lyra is torn between lividity and
a gulp
LYRA
Well, there certainly are value systems in your order worth looking
into...
Another small, nervous laugh and Seetol leads the group on. Lyra and
Athena quickly lean their heads together as they move on.
ATHENA
She didn't mean what it sounded like...
LYRA
Remind me not to ask any more questions until we're out of here.
Suddenly, there is a commotion coming towards the tour group.
FOUR OVION GUARDS
are running up the corridon in pursuit. What they are pursuing is not
clear at first, as the countless Ovion workers begin chattering their
high-pitched network of communications which drowns out an equally
high-pitched series of cries. Suddenly, it is clear
ANOTHER ANGLE
to reveal a small, barking droid racing along the corridor,
desperately trying to avoid its pursuers
LYRA
is the first to recognize the situation
LYRA
Muffy...
Muffy quickly stops in its tracks...looks...runs to Lyra and begins a
frantic barking
LYRA
Muffy...it's me. Now what are you doing? Stop that.
The Ovion guards rush up and begin to reach for Muffy, but he quickly
takes asylum between Lyra's legs and the wall.
LYRA
It's all right...he's just a droid...I'll take care of him
The Ovion begins to push Lyra out of the way
LYRA
Now stop that. I told you to leave him alone. What are you doing?
Seetol quickly moves up and communicates to the lead guard in high-
pitched chatterig. Seetol turns a frozen smile to Lyra
SEETOL
You will have to allow them to take the droid.
LYRA
I will not. He belongs to a little boy.
The significance of this strike her. She turns to Seetol.
LYRA
The little boy...have they seen him?
SEETOL
No...
LYRA
How do you know? You haven't asked them.
(She turns to the guard)
A small child...he's always with the droid. Did you see him?
The guard turns quickly to Seetol...says nothing
SEETOL
They did see a child. It might be better if you went with them,
rather than delay the tour.
ATHENA
I'll go with her.
SEETOL
If you wish. The rest of the group must follow me.
Seetol leads them off. As they depart, a sense of emptiness befalls
Athena and Lyra
LYRA
Maybe you should stay with them. I don't like the feel of this.
ATHENA
At least I'm a trained Warrior.
LYRA
A little outnumbered, don't you think?
ATHENA
Well, we're only goig to look for a small child. Let's not let our
imaginations run wild.
LYRA
Exactly. Well, gentlemen, after you...
The Ovion guards gesture for them to lead off in another direction,
exchanging quick personal looks. They start to lead, Muffy running
along beside them.
ON THE TOUR TRAM
racing along its course
ON ITS ROOF
Starbuck and Skyler hanging on
SKYLER
You all right?
STARBUCK
Beat walking back...maybe.
SKYLER
One thing's bothering me.
STARBUCK
Now you tell me. What is it?
SKYLER
You notice those people getting on this thing...
STARBUCK
How could I help it? They must average three hundred pounds.
SKYLER
Something that girl said. They're all putting on inordinate weight.
If you're importing people for slave labor, why bother letting them
get fat? It's a waste of food.
STARBUCK
And why let 'em win money? It's a waste of time.
A heave look crosses Starbuck's face
SKYLER
Starbuck...
STARBUCK
Yeah...?
SKYLER
Skip it...it's too ugly...
On Starbuck's worried face as the vehicle rolls off through the canyon
towards its curious destination
AN OVION CORRIDOR
Athena and Lyra are being escorted up to a cell block. They begin to
hear the eerie, dsiquieting moaning
ATHENA
What's that awful sound?
LYRA
I wouldn't ask, if I were you.
Suddenly, Lyra turns and stops dead in her tracks, startled beyond
belief. Athena screams...
POINT OF VIEW
The cell containing a crush of living beings packed together. Muffy
beings to bark. The Ovions shove the two ladies ahead and past the
cell window as we hear a small voice barely discernable
BOXEY
Muffy...
They have reached another cell. Boxey stands at the window. The room
is obviously identical to the one adjacent to it, save for Boxey. An
aperture in the wall beside the window is opened. Muffy charges in
and jumps up on Boxey.
SEETOL
Inside...
LYRA
Look...I have no intention...
She does not finish the sentence. She is hurled into the aperture and
catapulted into the glass room through some kind of vacuum device in
the aperture. Athena begins to scream. It is lost in a hiss of steam
as she is pushed into the aperture.
SEETOL
nods for the Ovion guards to close the aperture. As the nearest guard
is about to do so, Muffy turns his head, looks, and streaks through
the opening, out of the cell, between the legs of the guard, and up
the corridor
SEETOL
(a high-pitched, frantic demand)
The guards streak up the corridor in pursuit of Muffy
IN ANOTHER OVION CHAMBER
the tram has come to a stop inside a large, dark area. A row of Ovion
guards, well-armed and moving in a most businesslike fashion, move up
to form a rank just ooutside of the tram. A device is attached to the
door of the tram, opening it with a hiss. The first of several hefty
passengers step out into the room, gazing around in wonder and some
consternation.
SEETOL
Please move quickly.
Seetol gestures towards a moving ramp which disappears into a cell-
like entrance.
OBESE MAN #1
Look, fella, up 'til now, this has been a pretty nice trip, but that
bus was as hot as anything I've ever been in...
SEETOL
Please move along...
OBESE MAN #2
No, now you just hold on. We don't intend...
Suddenly, two Ovion guards shove the two men onto the ramp, sending
them flying unceremoniously into a heap. Behind them, the other Ovions
pick up the signal and abandon all decorum and pretense, shoving the
next people along with the barrels of their weapons. The women
immediately begin to scream, as they find themselves hurled into the
loading mechanism which carries the frightened, scrambling visitors
through the wall towards the unknown...
ON THE TOP OF THE TRAM
Skyler and Starbuck stare in amazement at the spectacle
SKYLER
(sotto)
The party's over...
STARBUCK
We gotta' do something...
SKYLER
There's an army of them...we've gotta' keep from getting caught...
Skyler begins to edge back away from the side of the bus used for
unloading. He peers over the edge...
POINT OF VIEW
Two Ovion guards...preoccupied
CLOSER ON THE GUARDS
chuckling in high-pitched frequencies over the way the living cargo
is being unloaded. To their backs, Starbuck and Skyler slide off of
the roof, down the side of the tram, and slip stealthily vack into
the darkened recesses of the chamber.
ON MUFFY
racing through the corridor with Ovio guards chasing him
ON THE MAIN MINING CHAMBER
as Starbuck and Skyler step out of the shadows of a tributary corridor
and gaze around the immense digging in amazement
STARBUCK
It's huge...
SKYLER
And this is just one level. You notice something else...?
STARBUCK
Ovions are doing the mining.
SKYLER
Right...
STARBUCK
Which means...?
SKYLER
It's awful, Starbuck. That casino is a feedlot.
Starbuck contemplates what Skyler is saying
STARBUCK
Come on...
SKYLER
They're a race of cannibals. They're drawing in creatures from all
over the star system, fattening them up with indulgences, then...
STARBUCK
I thought I'd run into just about everything... Now what do we do?
We've got to tell the fleet about this place.
SKYLER
(onimously)
They know about it. Look.
ACROSS THE MINE
a group of tourists from the fleet are being escorted
GUIDE
...largest Tylium mine in the star system...
STARBUCK
What are they doing here?
SKYLER
Whatever it is, it look voluntary. Come on...
Skyler steps out ito the light of the corridor and starts towards the
tour
STARBUCK
Where are you going now? They're going to see...
Seetol and two Ovion guards round the corner, almost colliding with
Skyler and Starbuck. The guards raise their weapons.
SKYLER
Excuse us...we just got separated from our group.
Skyler gracefully oushes the muzzle of the closest guard's weapon out
of the way as he points after the tour just about to move out of the
main room
STARBUCK
(to Seetol)
We'd better hurry along or there's no telling where we'll end up...
Skyler and Starbuck nerve their way past the Ovions who stare after
them, not quite sure what to make of the situation. As Skyler and
Starbuck rapidly approach the distant tour, their story beings to make
visibile sense, and Seetol turns from the tour and continues on her
way with the guards on either side of her.
ON THE TOUR
As Skyler and Starbuck catch up, stealing a look back over their
shoulders. As the tour moves into an elevator...
JENSING
Where'd you boys come from? You've missed most of the tour.
STARBUCK
We've seen quite a lot, actually.
IN THE ELEVATOR
JENSING
You're lucky you didn't miss the next stop. We're guests of honor at
a banquet
Skyler and Starbuck exchange knowing looks
INSIDE THE EMPEROR'S ROOM
Lotay kneels before Baltar, who is flanked by the two Centurians
LOTAY
A mere token force remains in the fleet of ships above Carillon, and
Commander Adama is now our guest.
BALTAR
Where?
LOTAY
Where he will not be disturbed.
BALTAR
Excellent, Lotay. As to the Warriors, until we've disarmed them, I
want as many of them relegated to a single chamber as possible.
A Centurian steps forward.
CENTURIAN
By your command, Baltar. It is time to call in the Cylon war machine.
Baltar thinks about it
BALTAR
Yes, you are right...but only on my terms.
CENTURIAN
And what are your terms?
BALTAR
An arangement I have worked out very carefully
ON A CYLON HOME BASE
somewhere in deep space
INSIDE THE IMPERIOUS LEADER'S INNER CHAMBER
a Centurian enters the large oom and crosses to the throne
CENTURIAN
By your command...
IMPERIOUS LEADER
Speak...
CENTURIAN
Baltar sends a demand for the Base Star stationed at Quasar 47 for
immediate assault on the Human Fleet.
IMPERIOUS LEADER
I will send him ten Base Stars.
CENTURIAN
He will accept only one.
IMPERIOUS LEADER
Indeed...and what is this bargain that I must accept...?
IN THE BANQUET ROOM
The tour arrives with Starbuck and Skyler. Music and a general air of
decadence, dissipation, the order of the day
STARBUCK
Would you look at this...they're having a party...
Skyler moves to Anton, who appears to be slightly drunk. He laughs
robustly, a golden goblet in one hand, a large fowl leg in the other
SKYLER
Count Anton...what's happened? Why are all these people here? Carillon
was supposed to be a work stop.
ANTON
Ah, Commander Adama's elite corps. Of course you boys wanted all this
to yourselves. Well, I'm afraid this is a democracy...
SKYLER
It's going to be a debacle if you don't get these people out of here.
An Ovion servant seems to be taking an inordinate amount of time
refilling the wine glasses around Anton. Skyler turns from him,
placing an arm around Aton to lead him off.
ANTON
Lieutenant, in case you hadn't heard, you are draping yourself all
over a member of the Quorum of the Twelve
SKYLER
Unless you want the shortest term in history, we'd better talk.
ANTON
I don't like your tone.
STARBUCK
You aren't going to like what we're going to tell you, either...
Anton studies Starbuck's deliberate and penetrating gaze. He cannot
dismiss this most celebrated young Warrior.
ANTON
Lieutenant Starbuck, I've never been particularly fond of your bravado
escapades. This had better be important.
They move off together. In their wake, the Ovion servant moves quickly
off to speak to a guard at the door. The guard immediately departs.
IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM
ANTON
Now, then...what's this all about?
SKYLER
Starbuck and I just returned from a patrol. What we've seen convinces
us that the Ovions will never allow a single human to leave here
alive.
ANTON
You're not serious. What possible motive could they have for wanting
us all dead? I suppose you're going to tell me they're part of the
Cylon Alliance.
SKYLER
Worse...
ON SKYLER AND STARBUCK FROM ACROSS THE ROOM
As Skyler's lips blurt out the rest of the story, we can see Anton
pale as the details are revealed
IN THE EMPEROR'S ROOM
Seetol confronts Baltar
BALTAR
Who are these two Warriors who are causing the disturbance? Describe
them to me.
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
BRIDGE OFFICER
The livery ships have returned to the fleet, sir, and we've all but
completed boarding the food stores.
TIGH
Very good. What about Tylium?
BRIDGE OFFICER
Nothing. The Ovions are definitely stalling us on that.
TIGH
It's as if they wanted to keep us here as long as possible. Did you
see Commander Adama?
BRIDGE OFFICER
No, sir. I didn't realize he'd gone down to the surface.
TIGH
That's odd...
VOICE
Sir, long-range scanners are picking up a large number of ships
entering our vectors.
TIGH
How long will it take them to reach our coordinates?
VOICE
They're traveling very fast...no more than a milliton.
TIGH
Recall all personnel from the surface. Connect me with Commander
Adama.
IN AN OVION CORRIDOR
Skyler moves hurriedly along with a large party from the banquet. As
they appraoch another chamber, another group exits with Starbuck, and
from across the corridor, a thrid group exits. The entire cluster
moves increasingly faster up the corridor
SKYLER
Don't panic, people. Starbuck, hold them back. They're going to get
hurt.
But there is no containing them as they begin to hurry towards the
elevators, pushing and shoving.
ANTON
Please, please, ladies and gentlemen. If we just keep together and
don't push...
But Anton is pushed down, submerged into a gaggle of humanity
crushing towards the elevator.
SKYLER
to Starbuck caught up in the traffic
SKYLER
It's no use, Starbuck. Let 'em go. Let's round up all our pilots.
CLOSE ON LOTAY IN THE EMPEROR'S ROOM
LOTAY
We have monitored the Colonial frequencies. The Warriors are being
recalled.
BALTAR
Then they know. Seal the chambers at once. No one is to leave.
LOTAY
turns and exits hurriedly
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
Close on a scanner read-out, revealing he silhouette of a Cylon
fighter
BRIDGE OFFICER
Scanner reads approaching ships as Cylon Class C. Three-man
fighter/bombers designated
TIGH
Range...
BRIDGE OFFICER
Less than a micron
Tigh pounds his fist in frustration
TIGH
Why haven't we heard anything from Adama?
Tigh looks troubled
IN THE OVION CHAMBERS
people run in all directions. Screaming as laser shots blast the
walls all around them
ON STARBUCK
firing at the Ovion guards
ON THE GUARDS
as several plummet off the walkways into the mineshaft in the center
of the large room
STARBUCK
surrounded by people at the elevators
STARBUCK
Come on, come on...let's move...
PILOT
It's no use...the elevators aren't working.
A fighter pilot runs up beside Starbuck
PILOT #2
Starbuck, I found most of the guys from Red Squadron
STARBUCK
Well, where are they?
PILOT #2
Sealed in a chamber and they've cut off the power to the doors
Suddenly, a single cell, high up in a corridor comes to life,
revealing an image of Baltar. The image is repeated in countless
cells down the corridor and the voice seems to reverberate from
throughout the entire complex
BALTAR
People of the Colonies...throw down your weapons...
BALTAR
in his Emperor's room, addressing a scanner
BALTAR
I offer you salvation. Surrender or perish. Your Commander has made
his choice...
Adama strains against the shackles that imprison him.
ADAMA
Baltar...you dare to live...to walk amongst men...
BALTAR
My dear Adama, provincial to the end. I offer your people life. You
have but a few microns to decide. Even I couldn't call off the Cylon
destroyers -- once they reach your people huddled in those helpless,
miserable ships.
ADAMA
What trahery have you in store for your race this time?
BALTAR
My dear man, treachery is a matter of perspective. It is the Cylons
who wish us dead, not I.
ADAMA
How long have you been supporting their war machine by selling them
Tylium?
BALTAR
If not from me, then some other source. They would not be denied.
ADAMA
Are you so much a fool that you believe you can trust them?
BALTAR
I am prepared to continue to offer them Tylium from the planet
Carillon in return for your lives. If they reject my offer, I will
destroy the planet. Not difficult, considering it's largely composed
of the most combustable material known to man. 
ADAMA
You expect me to accept slavery for our people...
BALTAR
You are not alone amongst my prisoners. Your daughter...
Baltar looks off as Athena and Boxey are escorted by two Cylon
guards. Athena runs from them into his arms
ATHENA
Father...
Adama's hopes sink in response to the omnipoent threat
BALTAR
You must make the choice. Life...or death for her and the boy...and
for your people. You haven't much time. If you have ot chosen to live
by the time the Cylons reach you, I will let you die. All of you.
ON THE CYLON WARRIORS
as they streak ever closer
ON STARBUCK AND SKYLER
at one end of the tunnel barriers leading out, countless Colonials,
men and women, surrounding the pair, pressing to escape
STARBUCK
Stay back...
Starbuck raises his sidearm, directing it towards the door
SKYLER
Back, everyone...
Starbuck fires. Sheets of fire streak for the door, erupting in
explosive direct hits. Skyler runs forward and tries the door to no
avail. It remains impenetrable
SKYLER
It's no good...
Cries of anguish and dispair engulf the desperate humans as they
realize they are hopelessly trapped.
ON ADAMA
ADAMA
All right...we'll surrender
ATHENA
Father...no...
Adama directs a lethal tone at Athena
ADAMA
We have no choice
(he turns to Baltar)
What do you want me to do?
BALTAR
Communicate with your fleet to send the remaining Warriors to the
surface.
ADAMA
Very well...
ATHENA
No, Father...I can't let you do it...
ADAMA
Athena, your mother's life, and Zac's...and how many millions more
already crush me with their unholy weight. I cannot accept
responsibilitiy for one more soul.
(back to Baltar)
I will do as you ask.
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
Adama's image appears on the scanner
ADAMA
Dispatch the last of our Warriors to the surface, Colonel...
Tigh looks at Adama in dismay
TIGH
But, Commander, that will leave us without any defenses whatsoever.
ADAMA
Colonel, it is only for a matter of microns. We will rotate Blue and
Green Squadrons back upon their arrival.
TIGH
But I really...
ADAMA
Colonel, that is an order. Adama out.
ON ADAMA IN THE CYLON CHAMBER
Athena cannout believe her ears. She breaks into tears.
BALTAR
breaks into a smile
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
Tigh paces uneasily away from the Bridge Officer who looks after him
with anxious anticipation. Tigh opens an envelope and reads its
contents.
BRIDGE OFFICER
At least the men will appreciate a chance to get in on the party
down there...
TIGH
There ins't going to be any party, Ensign. Tell the squadrons to
prepare for full battle attack.
BRIDGE OFFICER
But the Commander...
TIGH
Was merely giving me the code operative for these sealed orders.
He passes them to the Bridge Officer, who reads them and pales
BRIDGE OFFICER
He can't mean it...
TIGH
He means it. We're to attack his position with everything we have.
ON THE READY ROOM
as the battle claxon sounds. Pilots jump to their feet and scurry out
IN THE LAUNCHING BAYS
as pilots and crewmen scramble for the standing ships
ON THE LAUNCH TUBES
as wave after wave of fighters streak out to their appointed target
ON ADAMA AND BALTAR
as a Centurian enters
CENTURIAN
Prisoners have been freed from their detention cells by two Colonial
Warriors.
Baltar turns quickly
BALTAR
Nothing they brought with them will penetrate the outer locks. We'll
deal with our two heros later. First, we will need all of or forces
on the surface to give our arriving Warriors a surprise reception.
Baltar exits, leavig Adama and Athena alone with the Ovion Guards.
ATHENA
Two heroes...risking their lives to free the prisoners. It has to be
Starbuck and Skyler... and for what? To be sold out? I don't believe
it. I know you too well.
Adama says nothing, his eyes shifting to the watchful Ovions
IN THE TUNNELS
Starbuck and Skyler lead their band of Colonials down a corridor.
Suddenly, they stop as they reach an intersecting corridor and duck
back. Momentarily a group of Ovion soldiers rush by.
SKYLER
Where are they going in such a hurry?
STARBUCK
To look for us...
SKYLER
Uh-uh. I gotta believe they know right where we are.
STARBUCK
What else could it be?
IN THE AIR
a squadron of Cylon Fighters approaching the surface of Carillon
ON GREENBEAN IN HIS COCKPIT
GREENBEAN
Ready attack formatio. Lock and load weaponry.
He pushes a series of buttons in his cockpit
INSERT
Lights turning red on several panels displaying weapon indicators
ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET
waves of Ovions leave the security of their subterranean chambers to
take up positons of ambush in and among the rocky terrain
ON BALTAR
as he enters the cell where Athena and Adama are held captive
BALTAR
Your last defenses now approach out surface like lommons marching to
their own demise. An unfitting end to the great Adama's reputed
military genius.
Adama says nothing as, on the surface...
THE FIRST OF THE WARRIORS TO REACH THE LANDING AREA AND STREAK IN AS
IF TO LAND
but instead, deliver full thruster torpedos
ON THE SURFACE
as it erupts with resounding explosions, sending Ovions flying in all
directions
IN BALTAR'S DETENTION CELL
He spins around in horror as he feels the earth tremble above him
ON THE CEILING
as it dances, its assorted fixtures crashing to the ground
BALTAR
swings his look back to Adama. Unbelieving shock fills his face
BALTAR
How?
ADAMA
I led my people into your hands once...not again...
IN THE CORRIDORS
on a door leading out as it is blown off of its moorigs by the outer
explosions. Starbuck races up.
STARBUCK
Captain...this way...the seals are broken.
ON SKYLER
SKYLER
All right, everyone! Let's go!
ON THE CYLON FIGHTER FORMATION
screaming across space
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
Tigh and an anxious crew watch the scanners
BRIDGE OFFICER
Cylon attack force closing fast...
TIGH
Stand by all defense batteries...Battle stations...
As the claxon goes off
TIGH
How many pilots left on board?
BRIDGE OFFICER
Less than a squadron.
TIGH
They won't last a milliton, but they're all we have.
IN THE READY ROOM
A handful of pilots wait nervously. Their scramble claxon blares.
PILOT #3
Come on...they're kidding. Where is everybody? Why aren't they back?
A second pilot grimly tosses a helmet to the first.
PILOT #4
Looks like we're it, kid.
They exit.
ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON
as Skyler and his men race through the confusion of smoke and flying
debris
ON THE OVIONS
recovering and taking pursuit
ON SKYLER'S PEOPLE
as they streak for the shuttle 
ON GREENBEAN'S SHIP
sweeping across the sky, turning
THE OVIONS
begin firing at Skyler's people
GREENBEAN
smiles as he sweeps around and takes aim
ON GREENBEAN'S SHIP
as it streaks down for the cannon run, all weapons firing
ON THE OVIONS
lost in erupting soil
SKYLER AND HIS MEN
resume their dash, streaking for their ships. One by one, they reach
them.
THE OVIONS
rise up to take pursuit. This time, they are outgunned
SKYLER'S SHIP
faces the Ovions. He fires his cannon from the ship's standing
position
THE OVIONS
haven't got a chance. The firepower overwhelms them.
SKYLER
Let's get out of here.
He punches some combinations. His rocket engines roar to life
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
VOICE
Thirty millitons and counting...Twenty-nine...twenty-eight...
Tigh turns to Adama
BRIDGE OFFICER
I'm afraid there's no hope, COlonel...Six against a hundred...
TIGH
Order them out to engage the Cylons... 
BRIDGE OFFICER
Launch fighters...
ON THE GALACTICA
as her six fighters blast out of their tubes into the sky
ON THE CYLONS
streaking in
INSIDE THE CYLON CRAFT
three Centurians
CENTURIAN
Six Colonial fighters approaching...engage and destroy...
ON SKYLER'S SQUADRON
Lifting up from Carillon
JOLLY
Captain...picking up fighters from the Galactica. They're under
attack.
ON SKYLER
SKYLER
Kick in your turbos, boys, and let's goooooooo......
Skyler punches up the combination...a mighty blast rocks the ship...
ON SKYLER'S SHIP
as it streaks off at flank speed, the other eight ships hard on his
tail
ON A MASS OF SURVIVORS
as they scramble for the access. Lyra moving up.
LYRA
No sign of Commander Adama, Athena, the boy, or Boomer.
STARBUCK
We can't wait. We've got to get these people off the planet.
Suddenly, Lyra reacts
LYRA
Do you hear that?
A small droid dog is barking in the middle of the crush.
STARBUCK
Hear it...I feel it...
Starbuck looks downo to find the small droid pulling on his leg
STARBUCK
What in the...
The small droid releases Starbuck's leg and moves off, stopping to
bark back at Starbuck.
LYRA
It's Muffit. He wants us to follow him.
STARBUCK
We don't have time. Someone has to get those people shuttled out of
here.
LYRA
You go on ahead. I'm going to follow him.
STARBUCK
No --- you're not.
LYRA
Yes, I am. He knows where the boy is. He's programmed to protect him.
Starbuck starts after Muffy.
STARBUCK
All right, I'll follow him. You get these people out of here. This
had better be good, Pal...
ON THE CYLON CENTURIANS
as the Colonial fighers race ahead of them
CENTURIAN
Flight Zebet engage fighters...remaining flights continue on to
destroy the fleet...
ON THE CYLON FIGHTERS
as they break off from the main body and begin firing on the
approaching Colonial fighters
TWO OF THE COLONIAL FIGHTERS
explode into infinity on the first pass. The remaining four streak
off and divide for a second encounter
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
BRIDGE OFFICER
Fifteen microns...ten...nine...
TIGH
Sir, Blue Squadron approaching the fleet.
All eyes swing to the large window to space
BLUE SQUADRON
sweeping up to meet the invading Cylons
SKYLER
Bandits at twelve o'clock, boys. Let's go get 'em...
JOLLY
scanning the horizon. The sky starts to explode with fireballs.
GREENBEAN
My favorite odds...impossible...Yaaahooo...
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
BRIDGE OFFICER
Can they stop them?
TIGH
They can slow them down..until the others get here.
ON THE SURFACE OF CARILLON
people run frantically for the shuttle craft. Pilots, civiliains...
all manner of survivors
IN THE EMPEROR'S ROOM
Baltar stands amidst his two Cylon Centurians, admiring the sounds
of war, and the sights on his long-range scanners.
BALTAR
Adama, you have won the battle, but now you must lose the war.
The Centurian raises his laser pistol, directing it at Adama and
Athena.
IN THE SUB CHAMBERS
Muffy streaks around a corner, pulling away from Starbuck, who
desperately attempts to catch up.
STARBUCK
Would you slow down a little?
ON AN OVION GUARD
moving hurriedly along a corridor. He spots Muffy...takes dead aim,
and fires.
MUFFY
as the shot misses, but scares the little droid into doubling his
speed
STARBUCK
stops and fires at the Ovion. The Ovion explodes, his many arms
flying as the creature spills off the walkway into the deep mine
shaft. Starbuck resumes his chase.
INSIDE THE EMPEROR'S ROOM -- BALTAR
BALTAR
Remove her...and the others...
The two Centurians begin to remove Athena, Boxey and Adama. Suddenly,
the small droid charges into the chamber, barking.
BOXEY
Muffy!!!
BALTAR
Get him...
As the Centurians start for the little droid, the droid wheels around
and races back out the door, Baltar and the Centurians in pursuit.
ON MUFFY
as he races up the corridor
ON BALTAR
as he races out of the chamber, raises a sidearm and fires
ON MUFFY
as the blast ignites under him, sending him flying into the air
STARBUCK
is startled to see what's happened. He races towards Muffy.
ON BALTAR
He takes dead aim
ADAMA
lunges at Baltar, deflecting his shot
ON STARBUCK
as the blast from Baltar's laser destroys the wall beside him.
Starbuck is jolted back into action.
BALTAR
raises his weapon at Adama and is suddenly blasted off his feet. The
two Centurians raise weapons.
ON STARBUCK
as he fires into the Centurians, sending them flying into the pit
ON ATHENA
as she charges into the arms of Starbuck and begins to sob
STARBUCK
It's all right...it's all right...
ON BOXEY
as he runs from the door to the crushed form of Muffy
BOXEY
Muffy...
Starbuck turns to look
BOXEY
Muffy...
As the boy starts to cry, Starbuck pulls him loose
STARBUCK
We have to leave him...
BOXEY
No...
ADAMA
Lieutenant, there are other prisoners up that corridor. We have to
let them out.
STARBUCK
You go on ahead, sir. You're needed on the Galactica. We've got to
go, son. This Tylium mine is on fire. It's like a giant bomb...
BOXEY
I won't leave Muffy.
STARBUCK
All right, tell you what. You take this pretty lady out to safety!
I'll bring Muffy when I'm finished. Deal?
BOXEY
Deal!
Boxey takes Athena's hand and leads her off as Starbuck picks up the
limp form of Muffy.
ADAMA
Don't be long, Starbuck. It's going to blow up.
STARBUCK
I'll be all right.
Starbuck races back up the corridor
ON SKYLER
in his cockpit
SKYLER
Look out on your wing, Jolly.
ON JOLLY
JOLLY
Which one? They're coming in from all over the place.
A blast rocks Jolly's ship
SKYLER
So are we...
He turns and looks
POINT OF VIEW - OF THE GALACTICA
launching countless more ships
THE FLIGHT DECK
as countless pilots streak from the shuttles
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
Tigh is monitoring all the radio traffic - as Adama enters and gives
him a grim look. The two men embrace.
THE BRIDGE OFFICER
suddenly turns, excited
BRIDGE OFFICER
Two more shuttles just reaching the Galactica, sir.
The look of hope from everyone as:
ADAMA
I think the odds are turning in our favor now.
ON A WALL OF FLAME
as Starbuck stops and listens. He hears cries of anguish beyond the
flames. He raises his hands over his face and charges through.
ON THE WINDOWED CELL
containing the mass of people from the Casino de Festive. Boomer's
face is pressed agaisnt the front of the glass. He seems almost
comatose.
STARBUCK
stops dead in his tracks as he sees the sight before him. He stares
in disbelief as Boomer fails to respond. Starbuck moves to the locked
entry beside the window and raises his laser gun, firing a blast into
the lock. The door springs open and people flood out. Starbuck moves
to Boomer's side.
STARBUCK
Boomer...Boomer...
BOOMER
looks up, sees Starbuck's face...and smiles
BOOMER
How much did you win?
Boomer passes out. Starbuck picks him up and puts him over his
shoulder and moves him off in the fireman's carry.
OUTSIDE THE GALACTICA
as more reinforcements scream into the sky
ON A CYLON COCKPIT
as they turn to see a Viper ship. It's the last thing they do see.
ON THE CYLON FIGHTER
as it explodes into smitherines
ON THE GALACTICA FLIGHT DECK
ADAMA
Any word from the last of our people down on Carillon? 
TIGH
Last shuttle just left the surface, sir.
Adama braces himself hopefully.
ADAMA
I hope he made it.
IN THE CATAPULT DECK
as countless pilots scramble to their ships
OUTSIDE THE GALACTICA FLIGHT DECK
as three more ships fire off into space, rolling off into battle
ON SKYLER
firig
ON A CYLON SHIP
blowing up
ON GREENBEAN
firing
ON A CYLON SHIP
BLOWING UP
ON A CYLON CENTURIAN
CENTURIAN
Return to base...return to base...all ships...
But he does not finish the phrase as his ship explodes into a billion
fragments
SKYLER
We've got 'em on the run, boys. Don't let 'em get away this time...
ON THE CYLONS
turning for home
ON THE COLONIAL WARRIORS
taking up pursuit
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
Tigh moves up tp Adama
TIGH
Word from the last shuttle, sir...
(he breaks into a grin)
Lieutenant Starbuck is aboard...
ADAMA
smiles
ADAMA
We're going to make it, Colonel. We're going to make it.
ON THE SHUTTLE
leaving the surface o Carillon...far below
INSIDE THE SHUTTLE
many of the survivors from the casino. At the controls, Starbuck.
With him, Boomer and, oddly enough, panning back to the far corner, a
female singing group with multiple eyes and mouths.
BOOMER
You didn't!!!
STARBUCK
(innocently)
I couldn't very well leave them behind...
Starbuck glances out the window
ON CARILLON
as it explodes into billions of tiny torches which quickly spin off
through space and dissipate into blackness.
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE GALACTICA
TIGH
Commander...
Adama looks out into the starfield, nodding his comprehension...
ADAMA
I saw it.
TIGH
The final end of Count Baltar and his treachery
Adama shakes his head grimly.
ADAMA
No...I'm afraid his treachery will haunt the human race for
millenniums. But out of it, perhaps there will come some good. A
place for us out there in the Universe where we can seek after man's
potential for good, for peace, for love. A place for us with our
brothers and sisters...on a planet called...Earth.
ON THE FLEET
as it moves by and we superimpose the legend:
"THE BEGINNING"
FADE OUT
THE END
