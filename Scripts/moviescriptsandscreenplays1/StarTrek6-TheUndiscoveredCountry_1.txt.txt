     the room fills with bemedaled brass, Kirk's crew among
     them - the only starship complement in the room. They
     can't help looking at each other, questioning. They
     are in uniform.

               anyone seen Spock?

     A door opens and a Starfleet ADC, austere and Impressive
     enters and gavels the meeting to order.

                         ADC
               This briefing is classified. There
               will be no recording devices.
               Ladies and Gentlemen, the Commander in Chief.

     All rise as the Starfleet Commander in Chief enters,
     with a briefcase and pulls materials from it.

                         Commander in Chief
               As you were... I'll make this as
               simple as possible. The Klingon
               Empire has roughly 50 years of life
               left to it.

     All look at each other in disbelief.

                         Commander in Chief
                            (Continuing)
               For full details, I am turning the
               briefing over to our special
               Federation Envoy..

     He makes a sign and another door opens. Spock walks to
     the podium. Kirk and company are astounded.

                         Spock
               Good morning. Two months ago a
               Federation starship monitored an
               explosion on the Klingon moon
               Praxis. We believe it was caused
               by overmining and insufficent
               safety precautions. The moon's
               decimation means an almost eighty
               percent loss of available energy and
               a deadly pollution of their ozone. They
               will have depleted their supply of
23   Continued

               oxygen in less than half a century.
               Due to their enormous military
               budget, the Klingon economy does not
               have the resources with which to
               combat this catastrophe. Last
               month, at the behest of the, uh....
               Vulcan Ambassador, I opened a
               dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of
               the Klingon high council. He proposes
               to commence negotiations at once.

                         Admiral Donald
               Negotiations for what?

                         Spock
               The dismantling of our space
               stations and star bases along the
               Neutral Zone. An end to seventy
               years of unremitting hostility,
               which the Klingons can no longer
               afford.

     Audible mutterings. Pan the crew. Is the war over?

                         Spock
                      (Continuing)
               If the Klingons sue for peace, we
               could accumulate savings in defense
               expenditures, leaving the
               Federation ecomony free to grapple
               with urgent social problems......

                         A Military Man
               Bill, are we talking about
               mothballing the Starfleet?

                         Commander in Chief
               I'm sure our exploration and
               science programs would not be
               affected, but the facts speak for
               themselves, Captain.

                         Admiral Donald
               I must protest. To offer the
               Klingons a safe haven within
               Federation space is suicide. And
               if we dismantle the fleet, we'd be
               defenseless before a Bellicose
               people with a foothold on our
               territory, led by an unprincipled
               tyrant. The opportunity here is to
               embargo trading, force them to run
23   Continued:

               through their own resources faster,
               and bring them to their knees.
               Then we'll be in a far better
               position to dictate terms.

     a vocal minority of the briefing supports this, but not
     all. Kirk simply stares at Spock.

                         Commander in Chief
               Starfleet in under civilian
               control, Admiral. The decision is
               a political, not a military one,
               and it's been made.

                         Kirk
               Sir.....

                         Commander in Chief
               Captain Kirk?

                         Kirk
                    (Eyes Spock briefly)
               Sir, I'm no diplomat, but the
               Klingons have never been
               trustworthy. I'm forced to agree
               with Admiral Donald. This is...
                    (He gropes for tact)
               ....a terrible, a terrifying idea!

     the Admiral whispers to the Commander in Chief

                         Commander in Chief
               Your son was killed by a Klingon,
               wasn't he, Captain?

                         Kirk
               Yes, Sir.

                         Commander in Chief
               I'm sorry, but Commander Spock has
               persuaded the Federation that this
               situation is too promising to
               ignore.

                         Spock
               It is imperative that we act now, to
               support the Gorkon Initiative, lest
               more conservative elements persuade
               his empire that it would be better
               to attempt a military solution and
               die fighting.

                         Commander in Chief
               Captian Kirk, you are to be our
               first olive branch.

                         Kirk
               Me?

                         Spock
               We have volunteered to rendezvous
               with the Klingon ship that's
               bringing Chancellor Gorkon here,
               and escort him safely through
               Federation space.

     Kirk is too startled to speak.

                         Commander in Chief
               As it happens, Kirk, the Chancellor
               specifically requested you and your
               officers.

                         Kirk
               Why, in God's name?

                         Commander in Chief
               There are some Klingons who feel
               the same about a peace treaty as
               yourself, and Admiral Donald.
               They'll think twice about attacking
               the Enterprise under your command.

                         Spock
               I have personally vouched for you
               in theis matter, Captain.

                         Kirk
               You have personally.....

                         Commander in Chief
               You will accord Chancellor Gorkon
               full diplomatic coutesy, Captain
               Kirk.

                         Kirk
                      (Straining)
               Surely, a full Ambassador would be
               better equipped to....

                         Commander in Chief
               If there's no further business, I
               wish you and your crew Godspeed.
               Thank you all.

               I don't know whether to
               congratulate you or not, Jim.

     He moves off before Kirk can reply. The room is
     empty except for Spock, still at the podium and
     Kirk sitting alone in the auditorium. He is
     curious, betrayed and Spock knows it.

               Nixon could have gone to China.

               How could you vouch for me?
               That's.....
                         (words fail him)
               .....arrogant presumption.

                         Spock
               I was asked by my father to open
               negotiations with the Klingon
               high council on behalf of the
               Federation. Under the circumstances,
               I was inclined to agree.

     Kirk stands, and walks out of the room.

     The elevator doors open. An attractive Vulcan
     Lieutenant leaps out of the command chair, whips
     to attention.

               while in space dock?

     The crew, old and young, watch this exchange keenly.

                         Kirk's voice over
               Captain's log, Stardate 8679.259.
               They say you can't teach an old dog
               new tricks, and maybe they're right.
               It seems to me our mission to escort
               the Chancellor of the Klingon High
               Council to a peace summit is
               Problematic at best.

32   Int. Kirks cabin

     Kirk is unpacking his bags as he dictates, hanging up
     his uniforms, his shaving tackle going next to the
     sink, etc.

                         Kirk
                      (Continuing)
               I have never trusted Klingons, and
               never will. I have never been able
               to forgive them for the murder of
               my boy. Spock says this could be
               an historic moment, and I'd like to
               believe him, but how on earth can
               history get past people like me?

     He sets up a photo of David next to his berth.

     A delicate cough.

     Kirk realizes he's not alone. Swivels to face:

     Lieutenat Valeris standing in the bulkhead doorway.

                         Lt. Valeris
               Sorry....

                         Kirk
               Come on, Lieutenat, you could knock!

                         Lt. Valeris
               We're almost at the rendezvous, I
               thought you'd want to know.

                         Kirk
               Right.

     He stands up, and puts on his jacket. She watches.

               I gather you are not enthusiastic
               about the assignment, I don't
               think many on board are.

                         Kirk
               You piloted well out of spacedock,
               Lieutenant.

                         Lt. Valeris
                       (Almost Smiles)
               I always wanted to try that.

                         Kirk
                     (Passing her)
               Only don't try putting words in my
               mouth.

     And leaves her with that!

33   Int. corridor outside Spocks quarters

     In contrast with his spartan personality, the room is a
     voluptuous incense-laden lair, filled with curtains and
     smoke. Spock lights a votive candle, surveys her. He is
     out of uniform.

                         Spock
               You have done will, Lieutenant. As your
               sponsor at the Academy, I have
               followed your career with... great
               satisfaction. And, as a Vulcan...

                         Lt. Valeris
               Sir, I speak to you as a kindred
               intellect. Do you not recognize
               that a turning point has been
               reached in the affairs of the
               Federation?

35   Int. Bridge, U.S.S. Enterprise

     The cruise is proceeding evenly as Kirk arives out of

               Your research laboratory is most
               impressive.....

                         Kirk
               Starfleet's been charting and
               cataloging planetary atmospheres.
               All vessels are equipped with
               chemical-analytic sensors....

               This cannot be easy for you,
               Captain......
                        (off of Kirks look)
                         .....I would feel awkward
               if I had to give you a tour of our
               vessel.

     The man's courtesy makes Kirk feel guilty....

                         Kirk
               Would you care to go topside?

                         Chang

               Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr.
               Chekov....

     A window irises open reveling the stars gliding by.

     A hand pours deep blue Romulan ale into Gorkon's
     crystal goblet. Dinner well underway. Principals from
     both parties are at the table. Stewards keep food and
     drink in motion.

                         Gorkon
               I give you a toast:

                         (off their looks)
               The future.

     All drink Romulan ale, echoing "the undiscovered
     country". The Klingons eat with their fingers,
     scorning utensils.

                         Kerla
               Captain Kirk, I thought Romulan ale
               was illegal.

     It takes Kirk a moment to regain his composure.

                         Kirk
               One of the advantages of being a
               thousand light years from

     All drink. As Romulan ale flows throughout the scene,
     tongues get looser. Gorkon watches.

                         Scotty
               Perhaps we are looking at something

               your work behind the scenes, and
               despite the cordiality at this
               mess, I do not sense an acceptance
               of our people throughout your ship.

               They're naturally wary, ma'am.

               I believe the Captain feels that
               Starfleet's mission has always been
               one of peace.

                         Kirk

               cultures to conform to your

               "Human rights". Even the name is
               racist. The Federation is basically
               a "Homo Sapiens" only club.....

     Spock reacts to this. Chang is amused.

                         Chang
               Present company excepted, to be sure...

                         Uhura

               Don't let them put words in your

               in the engine room of a Starship
               to be accused of gunboat diplomacy!

                         Kerla
               In any case, we know where this is
               leading, the annihilation of our
               culture. Klingons will replace
               those on the lowest rung of the
               Federation employment ladder,
               taking menial jobs and performing
               them for lower pay......

                         Chekov
               That's economics, not racism!

                         Uhura
               But you have to admit it adds up to
               the same thing.

                         McCoy
               Don't be naive, Commander!

                         Uhura

               You don't trust me.

     Kirk can't look at him.

               He says we've fired on them in a
               blatant act of war.

                         Kirk
               We haven't fired....

               Captain, our shields!

               What the hell's going on?

                         Kirk
               I wish I knew. Uhura?

                         Uhura
               It's pretty chaotic over there.
               There's been some weapons fire and
               a lot of shouting....

                         Kirk
               I'm going aboard. Spock, you have
               the conn.

     He heads for the turbolift. Spock blocks him.

                         Spock
               I am responsible for involving you
               in this. I will go.

                         Kirk
                       (Bitter)
               I'M going! You're going to be
               responsible for getting me out of
               this! Meanwhile we're not going to
               be the instigators of a full scale
               war on the eve of universal peace.

                         Spock
               Perhaps you're right.

     And Spock uncharacteristically pats him on the back

                         Spock
               Good luck, Captain.

                         McCoy
               I'm going too. They may need a
               doctor.

                         Kirk
               Uhura, tell them we're coming. And
               tell them we're unarmed.

     They hurry out.

58   Int. Gorkons stateroom, Flagship

     Chang and his assistants are trying to sort things out
     without gravity. Chang shouts efficient orders in
     Klingon as he finds and tries to help Gorkon.....

     Chang keeps himself upright by grabbing a handhold, but
     the stricken are still floating...

     A few more orders from Chang, then the lights flicker,
     then all the bodies and blood slam to the ground as the
     gravitational source is restored. Lighting is normal.

     Kirk and McCoy materialize. They are quickly
     surrounded by armed soldiers. Kirk puts his hands out
     to indicate they are not carrying weapons. They are
     searched as Kerla enters.

                         Kerla
               Have you lost your mind?

                         Kirk
               I give you my word, I don't
               understand what has happened.

                         McCoy
               We're here to help......

                         Kerla
                    (hesitates, furious)
               Follow me.

     He leads them along the corridor

60   Int. flagship corridor

     same path, a scene of destruction, which the hit men
     took, right into

61   Int. Gorkons stateroom, Flagship

     where dead and wounded are being separated.

     Kerla hurries over to Gorkon, askew on the rug, blood
     running everwhere. Azetbur is holding him, now bloody
     herself (she wasn't in the room during the assignation)

                         McCoy
               Chancellor Gorkon!

     He goes to him immediately. Chang rises from next to
     Gorkon.
61   Continued

                         Kirk
               My God, what happened here?

                         Chang
               You feign ignorance?

                         Kirk
               WHAT HAPPENED?

                         Chang
               You crippled our gravitational
               field with a direct torpedo hit,
               and two Starfleet crewmen beamed
               aboard in magnetic boots and did
               this! We have witnesses!

     Kirk has no response, is shocked.

                         McCoy
               Jim!

     McCoy is being held back from Gorkon by two Klingons.

                         Kirk
               He's a DOCTOR!

                         Chang
               How can I trust....

                         McCoy
               Are you carrying a surgeon?

                         Chang
               We were, until you fired your torpedoes!

                         McCoy
               Then let me help!

     Chang hesitates, then signals. McCoy is released.

                         McCoy
               I need some light. Can we get him
               onto the table?

     Klingons lift Gorkon onto his table, someone produces
     light. McCoy whips out his medical scanner. His hands
     are shaking.
                         McCoy
                       (To Kirk)
               Hold him.

     Kirk grabs Gorkons arms.

               Sweet Jesus....! He's lost a lot of
               whatever this stuff is....

                         Kirk
               Can you.....?

                         McCoy
               Jim, I don't even know his anatomy

     McCoy furiously goes over Gorkon with his anabolic
     photoplaser. Shakes his head. Gorkon clutches Kirk.

                         McCoy
               The wounds aren't closing....

                         Kerla
               You're killing him!

     Kirk grabs Chang before he can get to McCoy

                         Kirk
               NO!

                         McCoy
               Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me?
               Chancellor.......?

     No response. McCoy rips open Gorkon's collar....

               Father.....!

               He's gone into some kind of
               arrest.....COME ON, DAMMIT!!

     He tries a medical tricorder.

     Frantically, he whumps Gorkon's chest, as Kirk, et al,
     look as Gorkon feebly opens his eyes, sees kirk....

                         Gorkon
               Are you alright?

     Gorkon freezes, McCoy looks at his scanner. It burns
     bright red. Gorkon is dead. Kirk is in shock, he can't
     believe it.

     Azetbur sits holding Gorkon, dry-eyed. Kirk pulls at
     McCoy

                    (grim triumph)
               Under artickle 184 of Interstellar
               Law, I place you both under arrest.
               You are charged with assassinating
               the Chancellor of the High Council.

                         Kirk
               He just tried to save him!!!!

                       (Klingon)
               Take them away.

     They are handcuffed. Both are in shock.

62   Int. bridge, U.S.S. Enterprise

     Uhura is listening carefully. Scotty has joined Spock
     and the others on the bridge.

                         Uhura
               They've been arrested.

     All eyes go to Spock. We can guess how he feels.

                         Chekov
               Mr. Spock, we've got to do
               something!

     The others crowd in, waiting for orders. Depending on
     him.

                       (finally)
               I assume command of this ship as of
                      (he checks)
               0130 hours. Uhura, send to
               Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely
               what has taken place, and request
               instructions.

                         Uhura
               Yes, Sir.

                         Spock
               What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
               Opening fire won't retrieve the
               Captain, and an armed engagement
               was precisely what he wished to
               avoid.

                         Scotty
               At least we must keep track of
               where they are taken, Sir. I....

                         Spock
               I've already addressed that
               question, Mr. Scott. We'll be able
               to follow the Captain's movements.

                         Lt. Valeris
               How did you....?

                         Spock
               In the meantime, we must endeavor to
               piece together what happened here
               tonight. According to our data
               banks, this ship fired those
               torpedoes.

                         Scotty
               NO WAY!

                         Spock
               Mr. Scott, you forget yourself.
               Please accompany me.

     He starts out.

                         Chekov
               And if we can't piece together what
               happened? What then, Sir?

     Spock turns unhappily.

                         Spock
               Then, Mr. Chekov, it resides in the
               hands of the diplomats.

63   Int. Office of the Federation President - Day


63   Continued

     The Federation President and the Klingon Ambassador.
     With them is the Vulcan Ambassador, Sarek, Spock's
     father, and Nanclus, the Romulan Ambassador.

                         Klingon Ambassador
               The Chancellor of the High Council
               is dead, the result of an
               unprovoked attack while he
               travelled to see YOU under a flag
               of truce on a mission of peace.
               Captain Kirk was legally arrested
               for the crime. May I remind you
               that he, and Doctor McCoy boarded
               Kronos One of their own free will.
               None of these facts are in dispute,
               Mr. President. And as a matter of
               these facts, the Klingon people
               have a right to justice. What I am
               asking now is, does the Federation
               plan to stand in the way of our
               justice? Or do you consider your-
               self and all Federation personnel
               above the law?

     A mumbling is heard thoughout the court at this line.

                         Klingon ambassador
               I am waiting for your answer, Mr.
               President!

     Long pause

                         President
               This President is not above the
               law!

     The Klingon Ambassador bows and takes his leave.
     The President is left with the two Ambassadors

               Mr. President, we cannot allow
               Federation citizens to be abducted!

                         President
               At present, I'm awaiting a full
               report from Enterprise. Pending
               that I am constrained to observe
               Interstellar Law.

     A stand off. Donald nods to another officer.

                         Officer
               We've prepared Operation Retrieve
               based on the rising danger of
               terrorism between the Klingon
               Empire and the Federation. Sir, we
               can go in and rescue the hostages
               and be out in 24 hours with an
               acceptable rate of loss in manpower
               and equipment. We have the technology
               to......

                         President
               Suppose you precipitate a full
               scale war?

                         Officer
               Then, quite frankly, Mr. President,
               we can clean their chronometers.

                         Ambassador Nanclus
               Mr. President, they are vulnerable.
               There'll never be a better time....

     Pause as the president considers.

                         President
               I'd prefer not to be the President
               to push the button if I can avoid

               The longer we wait, the less
               accessible the hostages will be,
               Sir!

                         President
               I'll bear that in mind, Admiral.

                        (continuing)
               I think that's all......Sir!

     The president looks at Admiral Donald on this line

                         Commander in Chief
               Those men have literally saved this
               planet, and you know it!

                         President
               I do know it. And now I'm afraid
               they're going to save it again. By
               standing trial.

     They're dismissed. The President puts his head in his
     hands.....finally looks up at Sarek.

                         President
               Do you know I agree with everything
               they said?

                         Ambassador Sarek
               I'm sorry, Mr. President. And I
               know my son must feel equally
               responsible. It was at my request
               that he persuaded Kirk to undertake
               this mission.

     The President looks at him.

                         President
               I want the crew of the Enterprise in my
               office tomorrow morning.

                         Ambassador Sarek
               They're still in space, Mr.
               President, adjacent to the
               Neutral Zone.

                         President
               Then tell your son to get the hell
               back here before the end of the
               week.

     He swallows some pills.

                         Uhura
               We've been ordered to....

                         Lt. Valeris
               Four hundred years ago, on the
               Planet Earth, workers whose lives
               were threatened by automation, flung
               their wooden shoes, called Sabots,
               into the machines to stop them.
               Hence the word Sabo-tage.

               Excellent. I mean too bad.

                         Lt. Valeris
               I will inform Captain Spock.

     The President is meeting with six civilian advisers.

                         Munitions Businessman
               You have our total support, Mr.
               President. My factories can gear
               up to full weapons production in
               less that a week.

                         President
               Thank you, Henry. Right now, we're
               pursuing diplomatic channels....

                         Munitions Businessman
               Of course. No one wants a war.....

                         Ambassador Sarek
               If I may, Mr. President. the
               important thing is too keep the
               peace process alive. If the new
               Chancellor is so disposed, perhaps
               we can attach a rider, get some
               assurance that these men won't be
               executed. Then, in a year.....


                         Sec'y Voice
               Mr. President, you have the new
               Chancellor of the High Council
               calling.

     They all swing to look at the far wall, which

               Mr. President, I've been named
               Chancellor of the High Council in
               my father's place.

                         President
               Madam Chancellor, you have my
               sincerest condolences on your
               recent loss. I want to assure you
               that this shamefull deed......

                         Azetbur
               Mr. President, let us come to the
               point. You want the conference to
               go forward and so said my father. I
               will attend in one week, after I've
               had the opportunity to master the
               details of his position, on one
               condition: we will not extradite
               the prisoners, and you will not
               attempt to rescue them in a
               military operation. We would
               consider any such attempt, an act
               of war!

                         President
               We look forward to meeting with you
               next week, Madam Cahncellor. I hope
               you will be our guest here on .....

                         Azetbur
               After recent events, you will
               understand I prefer a neutral site.
               And in the interests of security,
               let us keep the location secret.

                         President
               As you wish, Madam Chancellor.

     She clicks off. The President and his advisers are a
     little speechless at her strength and brusqueness.
     More pills.

               We can take whole by force what they
               propose to divide.....!

                         Azetbur (weary)
               You don't seem to grasp our
               situation, General. War is now
               obsolete. As we are in danger of
               becoming.

                         Kerla
               Better to die on our feet, than living
               on our knees...!

               That wasn't what my father wanted!

                         Chang  (bitter)

                         Azetbur (Stony)
               But I want a conviction. You will
               represent the State, General Chang.

     Spock and Scotty hover over the torpedo console,
     looking at numbers and lights. Spock thinks hard.
     Eight bells sound. It is perfectly clear: according to
     the Inventory program, all torpedoes are still aboard!!!

                         Scotty
               It's as I said, Mr. Spock,
               Inventory still registers every
               torpedo!

                         Spock (musing)
               Yet the data banks insist we fired,
               twice. one computer is lying.

                         Scotty
               A computer canna lie, Sir.

                         Spock
               Then we must check the torpedoes,
               Visually!

                         Scotty
               That could take hours!

               Nevertheless.

                         Scotty
               And if they're all in place?

                         Spock

               They don't place the same value on
               life that we do, Mr. Spock. You know
               that, take my word! She didn't shed
               one bloody tear...!

               That's hardly conclusive, Mr.
               Scott, as Klingons have no tear
               ducts.

               Very well. For twenty-four hours
               we'll agree that this conversation
               did not take place!

     The Klingon empire in all its barbaric splendor

     A cavernous stadium arranged in circlular tiers cut from
     jagged stone. A place from a bygone age, of savage and
     awesome beauth. Something between a circus and a
     cathedral.....

     .....turned for the occasion into a gigantic courtroom
     with thousands of spectators, screaming: "Kirk! Kirk!
     Kirk!"

     Many in the audience hold spears with lighted heads.

     Kirk and McCoy in the dock, stand in the bottom at the
     very center of the circle, surrounded by a Klingon
     audience in rising tiers, while hooded Klingon judges
     sit invisible in a darkened dugout. (One judge is an
     albino.)

     Chang wears the prosecutor's mantle.

     In the audience is President Azetbur and her advisers.
     The trial is being broadcast and special cameras
     abound.

     Near Kirk and McCoy sits their young, eager Klingon
     defense attorney. Kirk keeps his cool thoughout,
     though McCoy tends to steam.

     The rules are different. Attorneys are empowered to
     ask their witnesses a question at any time, and to mix
     this up with statements and charges.

     The proceedings begin in subtitled Klingon. Kirk and
     McCoy wear headphones. When they speak, a translator

     converts to Klingon.

     As Chang gets going, we zoom into his mouth and he
     converts to english... the judges gavel is a grotesque
     nailed glove.

                         Chang
               The State will show that Enterprise
               fired on Kronos One without
               provocation, the Chancellor and his
               advisers having been lulled into a
               false sense of security with an
               invitation to a state dinner aboard
               Captain Kirk's vessel at 1930 hours
               that same evening.
               (Turns to Kirk
               Do you deny all this?

     The mob howls "Kirk!", as the Judge gavels.

                         Judge
               The Prisoner will respond.

               Isn't it a fact that you served
               Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in
               the Federation because of its

               Doctor McCoy, what is your current
               medical status?

                         McCoy
               Aside from a touch of arthritis,
               I'd say pretty good.

     Sulu has to smile. Chang is not amused, waits.

               For 27 years I have been Ships
               Surgeon and later Chief Medical
               Officer aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
               In three months, I'm due to stand down.

                         McCoy
               Retire.

                         Chang (soft)
               Ah. I believe you also consumed
               Romulan ale at the officers mess
               on the night in question, Doctor?

               General Chang, come to the point or
               abandon this line of inquiry.

                         Chang
               Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when
               you first examined him?

     President Azetbur flinches at the memory.

                         McCoy
               I didn't have the knowledge of
               Klingon anatomy I needed.

                         Chang
               You say you are due for retirement.
               May I ask: Do your hands shake?

               Overruled.

                         McCoy
               I was nervous.

                         Chang
               You were incompetent! Whether
               deliberately, or as a result of age,
               combined with drink, this court will
               determine.

                         McCoy
               I tried to save him! I was
               desperate to save him! He was the
               last best hope in the universe for
               real peace.

                         Chang
               The Chacellor herself will testify

               And now, we come to the architect of
               this tragic affair, Captain James
               Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you,

               That, either as an instrument of
               Federation policy, or acting on your
               own drunken initiative, you and
               your fellow conspirators, crippled
               Kronos One, and cold-bloodedly
               assassinated the Chancellor of the
               High Council. Then, you and Doctor
               McCoy went aboard to make certain
               the job was complete.

               Objection: Captain Kirk has not
               been identified as the assassin.

               Kirk's personal log.

               I have never trusted Klingons, and

               On the contrary, Captain Kirk's
               views and motives are at the heart
               of this matter. This officers record
               shows the accused to be an insubordinate,
               unprincipled career opportunist, with
               a history of violating the chain of
               command when it suited him.

87   Int. Klingon Courtroom - Day

                         Chang  (continuing)
               Indeed the record will show that
               Captain Kirk was once "Admiral"
               Kirk and that Admiral Kirk was
               broken for taking matters into his
               own hands in defiance of
               regulations and the law. Do you
               deny you were demoted on these
               charges, Captain? DO NOT WAIT FOR
               THE TRANSLATION, ANSWER ME NOW!!!

                         Defense Attorney
               Don't answer - objection!

                         Judge
               Objection overruled. The Prisoner
               will answer the question.

                         Kirk
               I cannot deny it.

                         Chang
               You were demoted.....

                         Kirk
               Yes.

                         Chang
               For insubordination.

                         Kirk
               I have on occasion disobeyed
               orders.
                         Chang
               And were you obeying or disobeying
               orders the night you arranged the
               assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?

               You deny that your men beamed
               aboard Kronos One, and shot the
               Chancellor?

                         Kirk
               I cannot confirm or deny actions
               which I did not witness.

                         Chang
               Captain Kirk, are you aware that
               under Federation law, the Captain
               of a Starship is considered
               responsible for the actions of his

                         Scotty
               They dinna fire on themselves. And
               there were no other ships present.

                         Spock
                  (grasping at straws)
               There was and enormous neutron
               energy surge.

                         Scotty  (insisting)
               Not from us!!

                         Chekov  (square one)
               A neutron surge that big could only
               be produced by another ship.....

                         Uhura
               Kronos One?

                         Spock
               Too far off. Very near us.
               Perhaps....underneath us....!

                         Scotty
               If another ship had been beneath us,
               the Klingons would have seen her!

                         Spock
               Would they?

     Long pause.

                         Lt. Valeris
               Bird of Prey!

                         Chekov
               Cloaked!?

     Spock says nothing.
                         Scotty
               A Bird of Prey canna fire when
               shes cloaked!

                         Spock
               All things being equal, Mr. Scott,
               I would agree. However, "things"
               are not equal, this one can!

                         Scotty
               Then you're talking about a
               dreadful new engine of destruction,
               Mr. Spock!

                         Spock
               I believe I am.

                         Lt. Valeris
               We must inform Starfleet Command....

                         Scotty  (enraged)
               Inform them of what? A new weapon
               that isn't visible? Raving
               lunatics - that's what they'll call
90   Continued

               us! They'll say we're so desperate
               to exonerate the Captain, we'll say
               anything!

                         Spock
               And they would be right. We have no
               evidence - just a theory that
               happens to fit the facts.....

                         Uhura
               Even assuming you're correct, Mr.
               Spock, why would they fire on their
               own President?

                         Spock
               I want this ship searched from bow
               to stern. Lieutenant, you are in
               charge. Start with the transporter
               room, and work your way outwards!

                         Lt. Valeris
               Sir.....

                         Chekov
               I don't understand. If there vas
               a ship underneath us, surely the
               assassins beamed aboard from that
               wessel, not Enterprise.

                         Spock
               You are forgetting something:
                    (off their looks)
               the data banks say we fired. If we
               did, the killers are here. If we
               didn't, whoever altered the data
               banks is on board. Either way, what
               we are searching for is here....
                         Chekov
               What are we searching for, Mr.
               Spock?

                         Spock
               You tell them, Lieutenant.

                         Lt. Valeris (it's elementary)
               Two pairs of gravity boots!

     Spock is well pleased with her.

91   Ext. Rura Penthe Penal Colony - Day

91   Three suns glare down on a huge vista, an ice field,
vfx  the coldest habitable place in the solar system.

     A small moving dark mass as we push in, reveals

     Fifteen prisoners in leg irons and five Klingon guards
     with jackal-mastiffs moving slowly across the frigid
     plain.

     Kirk and McCoy, likewise shackled, are among them.
     Guards and prisoners alike wear ragged furs.

     They reach a lone totem and a guard holds up his hand
     for a halt. He presses and instrument emitting a high-
     pitched whine.

     In response, a huge trap door buried in the snow,
     yawns open. A Klingon guard emerges from steps below,
     and places a box before the gaping door.

     As Kirk and McCoy watch, the commandant of Rura Penthe
     and his jackal mastiff emerge. He mounts the box.

                         Commandant
               This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
               Observe: there is no stockade, no
               guard tower, no electrified
               fence! They are not needed here!
               Only a magnetic shield prevents
               beaming. Your new home awaits....
               underground!

     He blows a mechanical whistle. In response, two guards
     emerge from below with a screaming Klingon convict.

                         Prisoner
               No! Nooooo!

                         Commandant
               Punishment means exile from prison
               to the surface - on the surface,
               nothing can survive.

     The guards dump the screaming convict on the ice -
     without furs. The weather immobilizes him at once -
     his cries become fainter.

                         Commandant
               Below, no one can escape. Work well,
               and you will be treated well. Work
               badly, and you will die.

91   Continued

     He leaves. The box is removed by a guard and proceeds
     him through the huge door, and down the steps.

91A  Long shot

     as the prisoners are herded after him, and the door
     shuts, leaving the frozen vista as it was: snow
     flurries obscure the trap door almost instantly. Only
     the frozen corpse of the convict is left - until it too
     is covered.

91B  Int. Rura Penthe

     Start looking up at the closing trap door, outside we
     can see snow flurries as the panel shuts with a clang.

     Pan down to reveal

     A huge underground labyrinth with an enormous courtyard
     surrounded by prisoners huts open to the center.
     Prisoners wander freely within. The scum of the universe

     Everyone wears furs, leg irons, and is freezing.

     An endless scaffolding above, the guards.

     Many of the prisoners look like they could snap Kirk
     and McCoy in half, with one hand.

     Kirk and McCoy step gingerly around the outside wall,
     watching the yard. A shadow falls across them.

     Their POV: It's a behemoth alien. He speaks in a
     guttural, incomprehensible language.

     The alien picks Kirk up.

               If this is your spot, we'll move
               on.....

     The alien is about to behead Kirk

                         Martia (O.S.)
               He wants your obedience to the
               Brotherhood of Aliens.

                         Kirk

     The alien nods and wanders off.

               Prisoners from outside the Klingon
               Systems. They tend to band together.
               I'm Martia.

     She's a tall, and very good looking female, boots to
     her thighs, exotic furs, tattered but clearly humanoid.

     She's smoking something, offers them a hit.

               This'll help keep you warm. You're
               Kirk and McCoy.

     Kirk takes the hit, offers McCoy....it does warm you!

                         Kirk
               How did you know...?

               We don't get many Presidential
               assassins.

                         Kirk
               We didn't kill Gorkon.

               Of course not.  (looks around)

               Somebody up there wants you out of
               the way.

                         McCoy
               I don't believe we can get more out
               of the way than this!!

               They'll make it look like an
               accident.....

               What are you in for, if you don't mind
               my asking?

                         Martia
               I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty.
               I come from Arc. Smuggling is an
               ancient and respected trade there.

                         Kirk

               sentence?

     Kirk and McCoy didn't know.

92   Int. Galley, U.S.S. Enterprise

     Under Lt. Valeris's watchful eye, crewmen are taking the
     kitchen apart. All sorts of dishes and cutlery litter
     the place. Spock, Scotty and Chekov enter.

                         Spock
               Any progress?

                         Lt. Valeris
               We've got a crew of three hundred
               turning the own quarters inside
               out, but the killers may be among
               them. Surely they've disposed of
               these boots by now. Wouldn't it
               have been logical to leave them on
               Gorkon's ship?

                         Spock
               Even logic must give way to
               physics. Gravity hadn't been
               restored by the time they escaped.
               Without their boots, they would not
               have stayed on the Klingon
               transporter pads.

                         Chekov  (mimes with his finger)
               Why not simply vaporize them?

                         Lt. Valeris
               Like this?

     She whips out her phaser and fires, incinerating a pot.
     Alarms and claxons howl! Chekov covers his ears.

                         Lt. Valeris
               As you know, sir, no one can fire
               an unauthorized phaser aboard a
               starship.

     She switches off the alarm and has another thought:

                         Lt. Valeris
               Suppose when they returned, they
               threw the boots into the garbage?

92   Continued

                         Spock
               I'm having the garbage searched.
               If my surmise is correct, those
               boots will cling to the killers
               necks like Tiberian bats. They
               couldn't make their escape without
               them, nor can they simply throw
               them out a window for all to see.
               No, they're here. Somewhere!

     Uhura comes into the galley, Stepping over pots and
     pans. She is not happy.

                         Uhura
               Did someone shoot off a phaser,
               Mr. Spock?

     He turns.

                         Uhura  (continuing)
               I've pulled out my - ah, wooden shoe
               and Starfleet is screaming for us
               to return to port!

                         Spock
               Mr. Scott, any progress on
               repairing our warp drive?

                         Scotty
               There's nothing wrong with the
               bloody......

     Spock coughs hard.

                         Scotty
               .......Could take weeks, Sir!

                         Spock
               Thank you, Mr. Scott. Were we to
               return to spacedock, the killers
               would surely manage to dispose of
               their incriminating footwear.
                     (turns to Uhura)
               Please report our situtation to
               Starfleet.

                         Lt. Valeris
               A lie?

                         Spock
               An error.

92   Continued

                         Uhura
               I'll tell them someone threw a
               gravity boot into it!

     Angle on Spock

     Reacting. He looks at Lt. Valeris

                         Lt. Valeris
               Right, a gravity boot in the warp
               drive...

     She goes off, shaking her head.

                         Uhura
               You understand that we have lost
               all contact with Captain Kirk....?

                         Spock
               At present, he's surrounded by a
               magnetic shield. If my calculations
               are correct, he should be deep into
               his escape planning by this time.

93   Int. Rura Penthe penal colony.

     Kirk gets hit in the face. It's already bloody. It's
     a prison fight. Kirk and an alien are surrounded by
     prisoners who are sneering and jeering.

     Kirk and McCoy are distinctly grubbier.

     Kirk scrambles to his feet and circles. The alien
     swings a large paw, but Kirk ducks, comes in with an
     uppercut. He connects, but does little damage. They
     circle some more. The alien dives legs first, and
     scissors Kirk, who goes down roughly. Wrestling, Kirk
     slips free.

     McCoy and Martia watch....the leg irons make it
     complicated, they can also wrap around someone's
     neck....

     The alien moves in closely, hits Kirk again. Kirk
     fights back with a kick to the chest, which doubles
     over the alien.

     Then Kirk slams the alien on the neck and he goes down.
     Kirk starts to walk away.

     But a paw reaches out and grabs him by the ankle. Kirk
     looks back and the alien is grinning, drags him in.
93   Continued

     The alien stands, and grips Kirk, chest to back, in a
     giant bear hug. Surely, he will crush the life out of
     Kirk. He lifts Kirk right off of the ground. Kirk,
     almost gone, lifts his legs up high, and swings down
     hard, smashing the alien in the knee. That does it. The
     alien falls to the ground, screaming and holding his
     knee. Kirk staggers away, catching his breath.

                         Martia
               They'll respect him now....

                         McCoy
               That's a comfort!

                         Kirk
               I was lucky that thing had knees.

     They look back. The alien is still on the ground

                         Martia
               That's not his knee!
                    (off Kirk's look)
               Not everybody keeps their genitals
               in the same place, Captain!

                         Kirk
               Anything you want to tell me?

     Before she can answer.

                         Kirk  (Continuing)
               McCoy, why don't you see what you
               can do? Let them know we're not
               holding a grudge.

                         McCoy
               Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?

     McCoy tentatively goes forward, and examines the knee.
     He is without any medical tools of any kind.

     The alien yells, but lets him look. He manipulates the
     leg, then ties a kind of splint with an old rag....

                         Kirk
               There's gotta be a way out of this

     Martia looks at him, moves off.

95   Int. Sulu's cabin, U.S.S. Excelsior.

     Sulu is asleep, awakened by a knock.

                         Sulu
               Come in....?

     His communications officer enters.

                         Officer
               Sorry to wake you, Sir, but
               Starfleet ugently requests any
               data we may have on the whereabouts
               of the Enterprise.

                         Sulu  (groggy)
               What?

                         Officer
               Apparently they're refusing to
               acknowledge a signal to return
               to spacedock, Sir.

                         Sulu
               Signal Starfleet that.......
               we have no idea of the location
               of the Enterprise.

                         Officer  (astonished)
               Sir?

                         Sulu
               You have hearing problems, Mister?

     Kirk and McCoy try to sleep on rude cots in a hut off
     the main courtyard, tattered, exhusted wrecks.

                         McCoy
               Three months till retirement. What
               a way to finish.

                         Kirk  (thinking)
               We're not finished.

                         McCoy

               night......

     Close on Kirk

                         Kirk
               Bones....are you afraid of the
               future?

                         McCoy
               That was the general idea I
               intended to convey.

                         Kirk
               I didn't mean this future.

                         McCoy
               Are we playing multiple choice?

                         Kirk
               Some people ARE afraid of the
               future, of what MIGHT happen.
                       (pauses)
               I was frightened, really
               frightened!

                         McCoy
               I've looked death in the eye a
               thousand times and tried to be
               professional about it. Of course
               it wasn't usually MY death I was
               looking at.
                            (pause)
               What frightened you, specifically?

                         Kirk
               No more neutral zone. I was USED
               to hating Klingons...that's why I
               failed in our assignment. It never
               even occurred to me to take Gorkon
               at his word. Spock was right.

                         McCoy
               Well, don't be too hard on yourself,
               we all felt exactly the same.

                         Kirk  (shakes his head)
               Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse.
               And I'm starting to understand why.

96   Continued

                         McCoy
               Well, if you've got any bright
               ideas, now's the time to.....

                         Kirk
               Time's a problem. You heard the
               Judge: the peace conference is on
               again. Whoever killed Gorkon will
               sandbag the whole thing all over again
               unless we find a way out of here!

     Suddenly, McCoy puts his hand over Kirk's mouth. They
     pretend to sleep. Something crawls towards them in the
     dark. they sweat....Kirk clenches his fists.....

                         Martia (whispers)
               Kirk? It's me, Martia

     Kirk opens his eyes, McCoy plays possum.

                         Martia  (continuing)
               Listen, no one has ever escaped
               from Rura Penthe.

                         Kirk  (ready)
               Except us!

                         Martia
               It is possible.

     He regards her warily

                         Martia  (continuing)
               I know how to get outside the
               shield.

                         Kirk
               Where do we come in?

                         Martia
               Getting outside the shield is easy.
               After that it's up to you to get us
               off the surface before we freeze.
               Can you?

                         Kirk
               Possibly.

                         Martia
               I can't make it alone. You're the
               likeliest candidate to come to this
               hellhole in months.
96   Continued

                         Kirk
               Candidate for what?

     Their whispering has brought them very close. Martia
     is vamping him. She pulls off her fur hood....kisses
     him. He doesn't resist.

     Rolls his eyes.

               Go to "C" lift in the morning for
               mining duty. I'll meet you there.

     She disappears into the shadows. McCoy, who has been
     watching this whole thing, gets up on one elbow.

                         McCoy
               What is it with you, anyway?

                         Kirk
               Still think we're finished?

     The wind howls in an otherwise barren landscape.

99   Int. Transporter room, U.S.S. Enterprise

     Chekov is examinging the platform and environs
     carefully. He comes across spots of violet. He
     scrapes samples into an evidence tube, and seals it,
     then hurries out.

100  Int. Science lab, U.S.S. Enterprise

     Spock studies the sample under a microscope.

               Klingon blood!

                         Chekov
               They must have walked through it when it
               was floating, and tracked it back here.

                         Spock
               This is the first evidence that
               corroborates our theory.

               Now we expand our search to include
               uniforms!

                         Chekov
               All uniforms?

     Spock looks at him.

               The longer we wait, the greater
               danger in which we leave the
               Captain and Doctor McCoy!

101  Montage: the Enterprise is strip-searched. Lockers,

105  observation deck, instrument panels, etc... you name

106  Int. crew quarters

     Suddenly, an excalmation brings her running over.

     A crewman has opened a locker, and now holds up an
     enormous gravity boot. As all watch, he puts the boot
     on the metal locker.....it sticks!

     The Vulcan Lt. looks up at the locker, and sees the
     name: Dax! Poker-faced triumph.

107  Int. Crew quarters.........later

     Spock, Uhura, Chekov, et al, wait with impassive
     faces as crewman Dax enters the area. He is an alien.

                         Spock
               You are crewman Dax?

               Perhaps you know the Romulan epic of
               Cinderella? If the shoe fits, wear it!

     Dax looks confused.

109  Int. Rura Penthe Penal Colony - morning

     Kirk and McCoy, their legs still shackled, walk across
     the huge courtyard and line up behind a dozen brutes,
     everyone flapping arms to keep warm.

     They wait in front of, and then enter the "C" lift.

110  Int. "C" lift

               No you weren't, Doctor

     They look around. No girl. Just a big brute next to
     them. Puls other convicts.

               Get off at the first level and join
               the gang going into the mine.
                         (explains)
               They don't take girls!

     It's him! With her voice! Kirk is thunderstruck. He

               What kind of a creature is this?
               Last night you two were spooning....

113  Inside the mine

     Everyone is issued a drill and a light helmet. As
     beams ricochet about, they start digging dilithium
     crystals out of the rock and putting them into a flatbed
     shuttle. Kirk and McCoy, and the brute do likewise,
     under the watchfull eye of fur-clad Klingon guards.

     An alien next to Kirk sneaks several of the crystals
     into his garment.

113  A guard blasts him with a phaser and he disappears.
VFX
     McCoy openly takes his crystal and places it in the
     tray, making sure the guard sees him!

114  Later - Int. Mine

     Kirk and McCoy are filthy and sweaty. The brute looks
     at them, turns around. The guards are eating with
     their backs turned. Kirk and McCoy look to the brute
     for guidance.

114  Before their eyes, he re-materializes into a ten year
VFX  old girl.

115  CU her skinny legs.

     As Kirk and McCoy watch, she slips out of her leg
     irons. Too bad they can't do likewise.....

                         Martia's voice  (whispers)
               Follow me....

     She puts her drill down and walks silently into the
     depths of the mine. They follow, looking back to make
     sure the guards aren't watching.

     The girl quickly scrambles through a small hole, turns
     and waves them on. They have to get down on their
115  Continued

     stomachs and crawl through. Kirk goes first, turns,
     pulls McCoy. This takes time, especially if your legs
     have chains on them......

116  On the guards

     who finish their lunch, and look around. Notice a
     suspicious space where 3 workers used to be. Wander
     over. Look further into the mine. Find the hole.
     They hurry back, shouting.

117  Int. Mine tunnel - on the trio

     The hole has led to a new tunnel and the girl
     rematerializes into the brute as they crawl. Kirk and
     McCoy, still chained, struggle to keep up.

     They make their way to a large, abandoned opening and
     come out on

118  Ext. the mine, Rura Penthe - Day

     A high ice ledge. By scrambling down the ledge and
     jumping, the brute leads them onto the frigid
     snowfield. The surface environment is killing.

119  Later - Ext. Frozen river - Day

     The trio slip and slide on the ice across a frozen
     river. The ice begins to crack beneath their feet...

     The three climb the farther bank. They are barely
     alive. Shaking....

                         McCoy
               I can't......

     Frantically, Kirk tries to keep McCoys circulation
     going.

     They stagger on.



120A Int. Klingon listening post

     Grimy, underfunded and undermanned. God knows what

                         Kirk
               I've heard of Chameloids, "shape-shifters",
               I thought you were mythical.

               It takes a lot of effort.

                         McCoy
               I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm
               wrong, but do we really have any way
               of knowing if this is the real you?

                         Martia  (smiles at Kirk)
               I thought I would assume a pleasing
               shape.  (beat)  We're outside the

                         Kirk
               If you say so.

     Wham! He slugs Martia on the jaw, she goes down, her
     mouth running green blood.

                         McCoy
               ARE YOU CRAZY?

                         Kirk
               An accident wasn't good enough....

                         Martia's voice
               Good enough for one. Two would
               look suspicious. Killed while
               attempting escape, now that's

128  Int. Officer's mess, U.S.S. Enterprise

     Deserted. Scotty, exhausted, is quietly having a cup
     of coffee and checking off places searched on a table
     map.

     He runs a finger around his collar. It's warm in here.

     Perplexed, he puts his hand over the vent. Nothing
     coming out. Something's blocking it.

     Scotty commences to remove the vent cover. Not easy.

     As he continues his efforts, he is unaware of the two
     crewmen we met the night of the banquet, watching.
     They remain concealed, pull knives....one wants to go
     for scotty. The other holds him back.

     Scotty removes the vent cover and pulls out what's been
     blocking the air circulation: two violet-stained
     Starfleet uniforms, with names on them....

     Excited by his discovery, Scotty looks around, replaces
     the vent cover, and hurries out with the uniforms.

               Isn't it about time you became
               something else?

                         Martia's voice
               I like it here....
     Gripping each other, they roll right into

     A large and terrifying muzzle. A jackal-mastiff on a
     leash.

     Both Kirks spring apart...

     They are surrounded by a dozen fur garbed Klingon
     guards with weapons. Several have leashed jackal-
     mastiffs. And the commandant, who walks forward.

               Is she telling us that Klingons, and
               Federation members are conspiring
               TOGETHER....?

                         Kirk  (to Spock)
               Where is the conference?

     Spock tries again. Shakes his head. Removes his hand.

                         Spock
               She doesn't know.

                         Scotty
               Then we're dead!

                         Spock  (to Lt. Valeris)
               I've been dead before. Uhura,
               raise Excelsior. She ought to
               have the co-ordinates.

                         Kirk
               Why would they give them to us?

                         Spock
               The Commander is an old friend of
               yours!

                         McCoy  (can't resist)
               What was it like - being dead?

     Spock, lost in thought, doesn't answer.

                         Sulu  (O.S.)
               This is Captain Sulu, U.S.S.
               Excelsior.

                         Kirk
               SULU!

                         Sulu
               Standing by, Captain Kirk.

                         Kirk
               You understand that by even talking
               to us, you're violating regulations,
               Captain.



138  Continued

                         Sulu
               I'm sorry, Captain, your message
               is breaking up.

                         Kirk  (under his breath)
               Bless you, Sulu
                         (aloud)
               Where's the peace conference?
               They're going to attempt another
               assasination.

                         Sulu
               The Conference is at Camp Khitomer,
               near the Romulan border. I'm
               sending the exact co-ordinates on a
               coded frequency.

                         Kirk
               I'm afraid we may need more than
               that. There's a Bird of Prey on
               the lookout for us. And she can
               fire while she's cloaked.

                         Sulu
               Surely not!

                         Kirk
               I'm telling you. Hang on.
                    (to Lt. Valeris)
               How many of those things are there?
               Come on, Lieutenant, you want any
               more of your brain drained?

                         Lt. Valeris
               Just one prototype

                         Kirk
               You hear that?

                         Sulu
               I'm getting underway now. But, I'm
               now in Alpha Quadrant. The chances
               of my reaching the conference in
               time are slim.

                         Kirk
               When does this conference start?

                         Sulu
               According to my information, today!


138  Continued

                         Kirk
               Thank you, Captain Sulu

                         Sulu
               Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.

     Sulu hangs up. Finds himself facing his 1st officer

                         First officer
               Sir...! You realize you've just
               committed treason?

     Sulu puts his feet up on the console....

                         Sulu   (serene)
               To be candid, I always hoped that
               if the choice ever came down to
               betraying my country, or betraying
               my friend, I'd have the guts to
               betray my country. Warp nine,
               Mister!

141  Int. Spock's Quarters

     The lights are dim as Kirk knocks. He has shaved,
     showered, and put on a fresh uniform.

                         Kirk
               Spock?

     No answer. Kirk makes to hit the switch.

                         Spock
               I'd prefer it dark.

     Fair enough. Kirk enters.

                         Kirk
               Are you dining on worms?

                         Spock   (finally)
               You were right. It was arrogant
               presumption that got us into this
               situation. You might have died.
141  Continued

                         Kirk
               The night is young. Anyway, it was
               logical.
                       (he must feel his way)
               You know, you're a great one for
               logic. I'm a great one for....
                         (shrugs)
               ...rushing in where angels fear to
               tread. We're both extremists.
               Reality is probably somewhere in
               between us.

     Spock says nothing. Kirk runs a finger over dust.

                         Kirk  (continuing)
               I was blind. I couldn't see past
               the death of my son. I couldn't
               trust.

                         Spock  (sighs)
               I, too was blind. I knew about
               HER - and I did nothing. I trusted
               too much.

                         Kirk
               You couldn't have known she was
               listening the night I dictated that
               entry into my log. You were proud
               of her achievements as a Vulcan....

                         Spock
               I was prejudiced by those achievements.

                         Kirk    (understands)
               Gorkon had to die before I understood
               just how prejudiced I was......

     Spock looks at him for the first time.

                         Spock
               Can we two have grown so old and
               inflexible that we have outlived
               our usefulness?
                         (looks at Kirk)
               Would that constitute as a joke?

                         Kirk
               Someone said the difference between
               comic and cosmic is the letter "S".
               You haven't outlived your usefulness
               to me. And you are not responsible
               just because she is also Vulcan!
141  Continued

                         Spock
               I should have been....

                         Kirk
               Not for the actions of another. No
               one is responsible for any actions
               but his own. Human beings....

                         Spock
               But I am not human. I am only...

                         Kirk
               Spock, you want to know something?

     Spock looks at him. Kirk kneels next to him.

                         Kirk  (continuing)
               Everyone's human. We're too old to
               play games. We're only human.

     He holds out his hand. After hesitating, Spock takes
     it, presses it to his forehead. Hard. Harder.

               Khitomer, how will we defend
               ourselves? I mean, if this new
               Bird of Prey can fire while she
               is invisible.....?

               I do not think anxiety is called for.
                      (off their looks)
               According to my calculations, we
               have another five minutes and
               twenty-two seconds to resolve

               We are gathered here today in high
               hopes, believing that differing
               civilizations of good will can work
               together to overcome intolerance.
               We believe that with understanding,
               and patience, it will be possible to
               resolve what separates us. Let us
               redefine progress to mean that just
               because we can do a thing, it does
               not necessarily follow that we must
               do that thing!

     Applause.

                         Kirk
               Then all we've got is a neutron
               radiation surge...and by the time
               we're close enough to record it,
               we're ashes....

                         Spock
               Captain, perhaps we're going about
               this the wrong way! Our job is to
               get to the conference. Her job will
               be to stop us.

                         Kirk
               Make ourselves a target?

     Spock looks at him.

                         Kirk  (continuing)
               Shields. Battle stations.

                         Chekov  (reads the display)
               Shields up. Battle stations.

     They are bathed in emergency red light. Alarms sound.

                         Kirk
               Mr. Chekov, take us forward,
               thrusters only, one half impulse
               power.....

                         Chekov
               Aye, sir; thrusters.....

     It feels like walking on eggs.

                         Kirk
               Uhura?

                         Uhura
               Nothing, Captain. If they're here,
               they're rigged for silent running.

                         Spock
               If she fires, she has a perfectly
               valid excuse.

               ....Many people speculated about my
               father's motives. There were those
               who said he was an idealist, driven
               by "visionary" notions; others said
               he had no choice, that he was a
               pragmatic technocrat, making the
               best of a devastating situation.
               Great men are seldom good men. the
               truth is, my father was both: a
               pragmatist and an idealist. If
               Praxis had not exploded, then quite
               possibly his idealism would not
               have found expression. Nor would
               mine. We are a proud race. We are
               here because we intend to go on
               being proud....  (grim)

                         Kirk's voice over
               Captian's log, U.S.S. Enterprise,
               Stardate 8769.24. This is the
               final cruise of the Starship
               Enterprise under my command. This
               ship and her history will shortly
               become the care of a new
               generation. To them and their
               posterity we will commit our
               future. They will continue the
               voyages we have begun, and journey
               to all the undiscovered countries,
               boldly going where no man....where
               no one has gone before...

VFX  The signature William Shatner scrawls across the screen,
     still featuring the moving starfield. then Leonard
     Nimoy's, then Deforest Kelley's, James Doohan's, George
     Takei's, Walter Koenig's, Nichelle Nichols'...one by one

     The signatures grow smaller and smaller as the galaxy
     races by, and they disappear into the distance.
