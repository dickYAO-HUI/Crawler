-----------------------------------------------------------------------


	FADE IN:

1	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN

	A large-screen color TV dominates a room sparsely decorated
	with expensive furniture of the twenties.  There are no
	books, magazines, newspapers to be seen.  A man, CHANCE, is
	in bed, sleeping.  His eyes slowly open, and, with no change
	of expression, he sits up and turns on the TV with a remote
	control.  He reaches for a pocketwatch on the bedside table,
	and, as he looks at it, the watch chimes.  He gets out of
	bed, crosses to the closet, his eyes never straying from the
	TV.  Chance puts on a bathrobe and leaves the room.

2	INT. POTTING ROOM - DAWN

	The room is filled with the tools of a gardener.  Chance enters
	and turns on a 1940's black and white TV that sits on a shelf.
	A wheel with colored gels spins in front of the set, giving
	an early form of color television.  He waters a few of the plants
	in the potting room as he watches TV.

3	INT. GARAGE - DAWN

	Chance, with a dust rag and feather duster, cleans off a 1935
	limousine, in perfect condition.

4	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN

	Chance takes off his robe, hangs it in the closet, changes
	channels on the TV, then goes into the bathroom.

5	EXT. GARDEN - MORNING

	A light snow is falling in a garden between a three-story
	brick townhouse and a one-story rear building, guarded on
	either side by a high brick wall.  The door to the rear
	building opens, Chance peeks out, then goes back inside.  A
	moment passes and Chance reappears, this time with an
	umbrella.  Smartly attired in suit and tie, Chance, with an
	eye on the garden, crosses to the townhouse.

6	INT. TOWN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - MORNING

	Chance enters, hangs his umbrella on a door knob, then
	crosses through the hall.  As he goes, we reveal that the
	furniture in the house is covered with sheets.

7	INT. TOWN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MORNING

	A large table, covered with a sheet except for two place-
	settings.  A TV is on the table.  Chance comes into the
	room, sits and turns on the television.  He watches the
	screen for a moment, then turns, as if expecting someone.
	No one appears, so he turns back to the TV.  After a time.
	footsteps are heard and Chance smiles.  LOUISE, an elderly
	Black maid, hurries into the room, visibly distraught.

				CHANCE
		Good morning, Louise.

				LOUISE
			(out of breath)
		He's dead, Chance!  The Old Man's
		dead!

				CHANCE
			(flatly, turns
			back to TV)
		...I see.

				LOUISE
		Must of happened durin' the night,
		I don't know...Lord, he wasn't
		breathin' and as cold as a fish.
		I touched him, just to see, and
		you believe me, Chance - that's
		doin' more than I get paid to
		do...  Then I just cover him
		up, pulled the sheet over his head...


				CHANCE
			(nodding)
		Yes.  I've seen that done.

				LOUISE
		...Then I get the hell out of that
		room and call the doctor and I
		think I woke him probably, he wasn't
		any too alert.  He just said, 'Yeah,
		he's been expectin' it and said he'd
		send somebody over...'  Lord, what a
		mornin'!

				CHANCE
			(watches news,
			flashes of season's
			first snowfall)
		...Yes, Lousie, it's snowing in
		the garden today.  Have you
		looked outside and seen the snow?
		It's very white.

	A beat of silence from Louise, then anger.

				LOUISE
		Gobbledegook!  Dammit, Boy!  Is
		that all you got to say?  More
		gobbledegook?
			(Chance smiles,
			is silent)
		That Old Man's layin' up there
		dead as hell and it just don't
		make any difference to you!

	Lousie takes a long look at Chance, then softens, sits
	next to him.

				LOUISE (Cont'd)
		Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know
		what I was expectin' from you...
		I'm sorry for yellin' like I did...
		No sir, I just don't know what I
		was expectin'...
			(Chance doesn't
			react, watches TV)
		...I 'spose I'd better gather up
		some breakfast for you...

				CHANCE
			(a turn to her)
		Yes, I'm very hungry.

				LOUISE
			(rises, looks upstairs)
		Well, no more stewin' those prunes
		every mornin', that's somethin',
		I guess...
			(she starts out,
			stops by the door)
		...What are you goin' to do now,
		Chance?

				CHANCE
			(gazing at TV)
		I'm going to work in the garden.

	Louise gives Chance another look, then turns to leave.

				LOUISE
			(as she goes)
		...I'll get you some eggs.

	Chance nods in approval, then changes the channel on
	the TV.

8	INT. TOWN HOUSE - SERVANT'S STAIRWAY - MORNING

	An enclosed stairway.  Chance enters, proceeds up the
	stairs.

9	INT. TOWN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING

	Chance comes out of the doorway adjoining the main stair-
	case.  He moves off down the hall.

10	INT. TOWN HOUSE - OLD MAN'S ROOM - MORNING

	The furniture in this room is not covered with sheets -
	but the Old Man is.  There is a knock a the door, then
	Chance enters the room.  He stands by the bed for a moment,
	Then reaches down and pulls the sheet back from the Old
	Man's face.  He touches the man's forehead, briefly, then
	replaces the sheet.  Chance moves to the the TV and turns it
	on.  He sits in an easy chair next to the Old Man's bed
	and watches a movie from the early forties.  Chance puts
	an arm out, rests it on the Old Man's covered body.  He
	becomes absorbed in a scene in which a gentleman tips his
	hat to a lady.  The scene seems to have 'sunk into' his
	mind.

11	EXT. GARDEN - MORNING

	It has stoppped snowing.  Chance, wearing a hat, and a
	gardening apron over his suit, putters in the garden.
	Louise, dressed warmly, comes out of the main house.  Chance
	sees her, tips his hat exactly like the man he saw on
	television.

				LOUISE
		...Well, ain't you the gentleman
		this morning...
			(a pause)
		...I'm gonna go now, Chance...

				CHANCE
			(resumes working)
		Yes.

				LOUISE
		You're gonna need somebody, some
		one's gotta be around for you...
			(he keeps working)
		...You oughta find yourself a
		lady, Chance...
			(she smiles slightly,
			with caring)
		...But I guess it oughta be an
		old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna
		do a young one any good, not with
		that little thing of yours...
			(she reaches out,
			puts a hand on his
			shoulder)
		...You're always gonna be a little
		boy ain't you?
			(he smiles, keeps
			working)
		...Goodbye, Chance...

	Lousie hugs and kisses Chance, then turns to go.

				CHANCE
			(as she goes)
		Goodbye, Louise.

	Louise waves as she enters the townhouse.  Chance tips
	his hat once again as she disappears.

12.	INT. TOWN HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - MORNING

	Louise enters the hallway, picks up a couple of suit-
	cases waiting by the door.  She stops as she sees TWO
	Men carrying a stretcher down the main staircase.  A
	THIRD MAN, a mortician, follows behind.

				LOUISE
		...He used to be a big man...
		'Spose he wasted away to about
		nothin'...
			(a beat - then
			she talks to the
			body of the Old
			Man)
		I guess I'll be goin' off to
		find me some folks, Old Man...
		I'm not batty enough to stay
		around this neighborhood any
		longer...

	The stretcher bearers move to the front door.  Louise
	steps in front of them.

				LOUISE
		Wait up!  I'm goin' out that
		door first.

	Louise takes one more look at the covered body, then
	openes the front door, leaves.

13	EXT. GARDEN - DAY

	Chance's pocketwatch chimes as he looks at it.  He
	removes his gardner's apron as he walks toward the
	townhouse.

14	INT. TOWNHOUSE DINING ROOM.

	Chance enters and sits at his place.  He turns on the TV,
	and watches for a moment, then turns, looks for Louise.
	She does not appear so he resumes watching TV.  He changes
	channels, views a wildly exciting game show.  At a
	peak in the excitement, he again switches channels to news
	coverage of the President of the Unite States greeting
	foreign dignitaries at the White House.  CLOSE SHOTS on
	television reveal that the President uses a two-handed
	handshake when meeting his guests.  Chance grips one hand
	with the other, the scene on TV seeming to have 'sunk into'
	his mind.

15	INT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

	A key is heard in the lock.  The door opens and THOMAS
	FRANKLIN and SALLY HAYES enter.  Franklin, an attorney, is
	in his late thirties, carries a large breifcase.  Hayes is
	younger, attractive, also an attorney.  She totes a brief-
	case, has the look of a modern woman.

				FRANKLIN
			(as they enter)
		He and my father used to ride to-
		gether back in the thirties...
		Fox hunting... Before I was born...

				HAYES
			(looking around)
		Will you give me a tour?

				FRANKLIN
		Gladly...
			(he smiles)
		...The safe is in Mr. Jenning's
		bedroom, that'll be stop number
		one.

	Franklin puts a hand on Hayes' shoulder as they go toward
	the stairway.  Suddenly, they stop, listen to the off-
	stage TV.

16	INT.  TOWNHOUSE DINING ROOM - DAY

	Chance still watches TV as Franklin and Hayes appear in
	the doorway.  They are surprised to see Chance.

				FRANKLIN
		...Why...Hello, we thought we
		heard something...
			(moves to Chance,
			hand outstretched)
		...I'm Thomas Franklin.

	Chance remains seated, takes Franklin's hand warmly in
	both of his like the President did on TV.

				CHANCE
		Hello, Thomas...I'm Chance,
		the gardener.

				FRANKLIN
			(a beat)
		...The gardener?
			(thinks it's a joke,
			laughs)
		...Yes, of course...Mr. Chance,
		this is Ms. Hayes.

	Hayes moves to shake Chance's hand.

				HAYES
		Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to
		meet you.

				CHANCE
			(doesn't rise,
			again shakes with
			both hands)
		Yes.

	Chance turns back to the TV.  Hayes and Franklin ex-
	change looks, there is an uneasy pause.

				FRANKLIN
		We're with Franklin, Jennings
		and Roberts, the law firm handling
		the estate.

				CHANCE
			(a smile, totally
			at ease)
		Yes, Thomas - I understand.

				FRANKLIN
		...Are you waiting for someone?
		An appointment?

				CHANCE
		I'm waiting for my lunch.

				FRANKLIN
		Your lunch?  You have a luncheon
		appointment here?

				CHANCE
		Louise will bring my lunch.

				FRANKLIN
		Louise?... The maid?...
			(a look to Hayes)
		But she should have left earlier
		today...

				CHANCE
			(smiles at Hayes)
		I see...

				FRANKLIN
			(a beat)
		All kidding aside, Mr. Chance,
		may I ask just what you are doing
		here?

				CHANCE
		I live here.

	Franklin stares at Chance as Hayes unzips her briefcase.

17	EXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON

	Chance talks to Franklin as Hayes quickly checks through
	some paperwork.

				CHANCE
		The Old Man himself used to
		visit my garden.  He would
		read and rest here.

				FRANKLIN
		Come now, the deceased...
			(catches himself)
		Mr. Jennings was bedridden for
		at least the last thirty-five
		years, since he fractured his
		spine.

				CHANCE
		Yes, Thomas.  Then he stopped
		visiting my garden.
			(points to a small
			area)
		I planted a lot of tulips right
		there.  I like to watch them
		grow.

				HAYES
			(looking up
			from papers)
		There is no mention of a gardener.
		In fact, according to our inven-
		tories, there hasn't been a man
		employed here since 1933...except
		for a Mr. Joe Saracini, a brick
		mason, who did some repairs to a
		wall.  He was here for two-and-a-
		half days in 1952.

				CHANCE
		Yes, I remember Joe.  He was very
		fat and had short hair and showed
		me pictures from a funny little
		book.

				HAYES
		...Some pictures?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  Of men and women.

				HAYES
		...Oh.

				FRANKLIN
		Just how long have you been
		living here, Mr. Chance?

				CHANCE
		Ever since I can remember, since
		I was a child.  I have always
		worked in the garden.

				HAYES
		...The you really are a
		gardener?

				CHANCE
		Yes.
			(again points off)
		...My roses...

				FRANKLIN
		...We will need some proof of
		your having resided here, Mr.
		Chance.

				CHANCE
		You have me, I am here.  What
		more proof do you need?
			(he starts toward
			rear building, points
			off)
		That's where Joe fixed the wall.

				FRANKLIN
			(starts after Chance)
		Are you related to the deceased,
		Mr. Chance?

				CHANCE
		No.  I don't think so.
			(looks back to garden)
		In the springtime, you will be
		able to see my flowers.

	Chance goes into the garage.  A perplexed Franklin and
	Hayes follow.

18	INT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON

	Chance enters, Franklin and Hayes close behind.

				FRANKLIN
			(looking at limo)
		That's a nice car.  Do you drive
		it, Mr. Chance?

				CHANCE
		I've never been in an automobile.

				HAYES
		You've never been in a car?

				CHANCE
		Oh, no.  I've never been allowed
		outside of the house.

19	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Chance turns on the TV as Hayes and Franklin inspect the
	room.

				CHANCE
		I used to listen to the radio,
		then the Old Man started giving
		me television sets, this one
		has a remote control...I like to watch...
			(motions to bed)
		You see?  This is my bed...
			(to closet)
		...This is my closet...
			(to bathroom)
		...This is my bathroom...

				HAYES
			(goes to closet)
		You have a very handsome ward-
		robe, Mr. Chance.

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I am allowed to go to
		the attic and use the Old Man's
		clothes.  They all fit me very
		well.

				HAYES
		It is amazing how these clothes
		have come back into style.

				FRANKLIN
		Could you show us something with
		your address?  A driver's license,
		a checkbook?  Anything to show
		that you were employed here?

				CHANCE
		I don't have any of those things.

				HAYES
		How about a birth certificate?

				CHANCE
		Oh, no.

				FRANKLIN
		What are your plans now, Mr.
		Chance?

				CHANCE
		My plans are to work in my
		garden.

				HAYES
		How much money did Mr. Jennings
		pay you for your work?

				CHANCE
		Pay me?...Why nothing.  I've
		never needed money.

				FRANKLIN
		Mr. Chance, I would like to know
		what sort of claim you are plan-
		ning to make against the deceased's
		estate.

				CHANCE
		I'm fine, Thomas.  The garden is
		a healthy one.  There is no need
		for a claim.

				FRANKLIN
		I see.  Would you be willing to sign
		a paper to that effect?

				CHANCE
		No, Thomas.  I don't know how to
		sign.

				FRANKLIN
		Come now, Mr. Chance.

				CHANCE
			(smiles)
		I have no claim, Thomas.

				FRANKLIN
		But you won't sign, correct?

				CHANCE
		Yes, correct, thank you.

				FRANKLIN
		Very well, Mr. Chance.  I have
		no alternative but to inform
		you that this house is now
		closed.  If indeed, you have
		resided here, you have no legal
		right to remain.  You will have
		to move out.

				CHANCE
		Move out?  I don't understand,
		Thomas.

				FRANKLIN
		I think you do, Mr. Chance.
		However, I will reiterate.  This
		house is closed and you must
		leave - by, let's say - noon
		tomorrow.
			(he gives Chance
			his business card)
		Call me if you change your mind
		about signing.
			(turns to Hayes)
		C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...

				HAYES
			(stops by the door)
		What about medical records?  Could
		you gives us the name of your
		doctor?  Or your dentist?

				CHANCE
		I have no need for a doctor or
		dentist.  I have never been ill.

				HAYES
			(a smile to Chance)
		I see...Well, good day, Mr. Chance.

				CHANCE
			(returns smile)
		Good day, Sally.

	Chance watches as they leave, then puts Franklin's card
	on a desk without ever looking at it and turns to stare
	at television.

20.	INT. TOWNHOUSE - ATTIC - AFTERNOON

	A large attic filled with the Old Man's possessions of
	the past.  Chance enters, turns on an old black-and white
	TV with a magnifying lens attached to the front.  As it
	plays, he selects a fine leather suitcase from several,
	takes a hand-made suit from a long rack.

21	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

	The TV is on as Chance packs his belongings.  He tries
	to fit in his umbrella, but it is too long for the suitcase.

22	EXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON

	Chance, very nicely dressed, with his suitcase and umbrella,
	stands in the middle of the garden looking around.

23	INT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

	Chance is reluctant to open the front door.  After some
	hesitation, he gathers up his courage, opens it and steps
	outside, closing the door behind him.

24	EXT. FRONT OF TOWNHOUSE - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

	Chance stops short on the steps; the front of the townhouse
	is run down and the yard filled with trash.  He tries
	to return to the safety of inside, but the door is locked.
	Chance stays on the steps for a moment, ponders which way
	to go.  Making a decision, he steps to the sidewalk and
	walks down the street to reveal a decaying ghetto.
	Windows are shattered or boarded up, walls are smeared
	with grafitti.  Chance passes a group of black people
	huddled together in threadbare stuffed furniture on the
	sidewalk, a fire burning between them for warmth.  Chance
	nods politely to the the people; they stare back, no sign of
	friendship in their faces.

25	EXT. GHETTO STREET - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

	Chance walks along a ghetto sidewalk.  He notices some-
	thing, moves across the street toward a gang of eight
	to ten hard-core ghetto youths.

26	EXT. GHETTO STREET - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

	Chance approaches the gang.

				CHANCE
			(friendly)
		...Excuse me, would you please
		tell em where I could find a
		garden to work in?

	They turn to him as one, silent.  After a moment, LOLO, one
	of the gang, speaks.

				LOLO
		What you growin', man?

				CHANCE
		There is much to be done during
		the winter, I must start the
		seeds for the spring, I must
		work the soil...

	The leader of the gang, ABBAZ, moves forward and interrupts.

				ABBAZ
		Bullshit.  Who sent you here,
		boy?  Did that chickenshit
		asshole Raphael send you here,
		boy?

				CHANCE
		No.  Thomas Franklin told me
		that I had to leave the Old
		Man's house, he's dead now,
		you know...

				ABBAZ
		Dead, my ass!  Now get this,
		honkie - you go tell Raphael
		that I ain't takin' no jive
		from no Western Union messenger!
		You tell that asshole, if he got
		somethin' to tell me to get his
		ass down here himself!
			(edges closer
			to Chance)
		You got that boy?

	During this, as Abbaz becomes more hostile, Chance reaches
	into his pocket, takes out his remote control TV changer.
	He points the changer at Abbaz and clicks it three times,
	tries to change the picture.  ABBAZ immediately pulls out
	a switchblade knife, holds it at Chance.

				ABBAZ
		Now, move, honkie!  Before I
		cut your white ass.

	Chance, disappointed that the changer did not work, returns
	it to his pocket.

				CHANCE
		Yes. I understand.  If I see
		Raphael, I will tell him.
			(as he leaves)
		Good day.

	Abbaz, Lolo and the gang watch him go, then begin to buzz
	with excitement:  "Who the fuck died?"  "Why'd he pull that
	changer on us, man?"  "The Old Man died, must be Papa Joe!"
	"He's some weird honkie, man!"

27	EXT. PORNO AREA - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

	A street lined with adult book stores, X-rated movies and
	strip joints.  An elderly Black Woman approaches carrying a
	bag of groceries.  Chance steps in front of the woman, stops
	her.

				CHANCE
		I'm very hungry now.  Would
		you please bring my lunch?

	The woman looks up to Chance, becomes very frightened.
	She turns and half-runs into a sleazy bar for safety.
	Chances watches after her for a moment, then continues
	along.

28	EXT. PARK - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON

	Chance stands looking through a chain-link fence
	watching some teenage boys playing basketball.  He bangs
	on the fence, calls to them.

				CHANCE
		I have seen your game!  I have
		watched Elvin Hayes play it
		many times!  They call him
		'Big E!'

	The boys ignore him, Chance walks away.

29	EXT. - WASHINGTON, D.C. - LATE AFTERNOON

	Chance seems stumped on which way to walk.  He looks one
	way, then the other, turns and looks behind him and sees a
	large statue of Benito Juarez pointing.  Chance smiles and
	goes off in the direction that Benito points.

30	EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - LATE AFTERNOON

	Chance walks down the center meridian of a divided street.
	He seems oblivious to the automobiles passing on either
	side.  In the background can be seen the Capitol Building.

31	EXT. REAR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DUSK

	Chance is across the street from the White House, inspecting
	the branches of a potted tree.  He moves to a POLICEMAN
	standing nearby.

				CHANCE
		Excuse me...
			(points to tree)
		...That tree is very sick.  It
		should be cared for.

	The Policeman looks at the tree, then at Chance, figures a
	man dressed that well must be important.

				POLICEMAN
		Yes sir.  I'll report it right
		away.

				CHANCE
		Yes.  That would be a good
		thing to do.  Good day.

				POLICEMAN
		Good day.

	The Policeman takes out his walkie-talkie as Chance leaves.

32	EXT. BUSINESS DISTRICT - EVENING

	A fashionable area.  Expensive shops, well-kept streets
	and sidewalks.  Chance stands by the display window of a
	TV store, looks in at a dozen or so color TVs, all turned
	on, playing various channels.  A video camera points outward
	and is focused on the sidewalk to allow passersby to see
	themselves live on TV.  Chance is intrigued by his own image.
	He poses, then steps back off the curb, frowns as his like-
	ness disappears from the frame.  Standing between two parked cars,
	Chance takes out his remote control, clicks it at the store.
	Four or five other sets in the window change channels, but
	he does not reappear on the giant screen.  As he does this,
	the car to his left, a large, American-made limousine, backs
	up.  The limo bumps Chance, pins him against the car to his
	right.  Chance cries out in pain, drops his suitcase, his
	umbrella, his changer, and bangs his hand on the trunk of the
	limo.  The chauffer, DAVID, and the liveryman, JEFFREY,
	immediately jump from the car, run back to Chance.

				DAVID
		I'm very sorry, sir... I...

	David and Jeffrey reach out to help, but Chance is wedged
	solidly between the two cars.

				CHANCE
			(in pain)
		...I can't move... My leg...

				DAVID
			(rushes back to limo)
		...My Lord...

				JEFFREY
		This is terrible, sir - I hope
		you're not badly injured...

				CHANCE
		No.  I'm not badly injured.  But
		my leg is very sore.

	David pulls the car forward, freeing Chance.  A few by-
	standers begin to gather as Jeffrey helps Chance to the
	sidewalk.

				JEFFREY
		Can you walk?  It's not broken,
		is it?

				CHANCE
			(leans against limo,
			holds leg)
		I hope not.

				DAVID.
			(returning)
		Perhaps I should call an
		ambulance.

	A BYSTANDER interrupts.

				BYSTANDER
		Somebody ought to call the police!

				CHANCE
			(looks over, smiles)
		There's no need for police, it's
		just my leg.

	During this, the rear door of the limo opens and EVE RAND
	steps out.  Eve is in her mid-thirties, and is rich.
	She is not pleased with this inconvenience

				JEFFREY
		Let's have a look, do you mind?

				CHANCE
		Of course.  I would like to look.

	Chance bends, raises his trouser leg.  A red-bluish swollen
	bruise is forming on his calf.  Eve moves closer, looks at
	the bruise.

				EVE
			(to Chance)
		...Won't you let us do something
		for you?  Your leg should be
		examined, we could take you to a
		hospital.

				CHANCE
			(smiles at Eve)
		There's no need for a hospital.

				EVE
		Why, there certainly is.  You
		must see a doctor, I insist on
		it.  Please, let us take you.

	Eve turns to get back in the limo.  David goes with her
	to hold the door.

				DAVID
		I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Rand,
		I never saw the man.

				EVE
		Oh, I don't think it was anyone's
		fault, David.

				DAVID
		Thank you, ma'am.

	Jeffrey holds the door open but Chance is hesitant about
	getting in the car.

				CHANCE
		I've never ridden in an auto-
		mobile.

				JEFFREY
			(a beat)
		I assure you, sir, David is a
		very careful driver.

				CHANCE
			(looks at the car,
			then decides)
		...Yes.  You can take me.

				JEFFREY
			(as Chance gets in)
		Very good.

	Jeffrey closes the door, goes back to pick up Chance's
	suitcase and umbrella but does not notice the remote
	control.  As Jeffrey puts Chance's bag into the trunk, we
	see the personalized license plate "Rand 1."

33	INT. LIMOUSINE MOVING THROUGH TOWN - EVENING

	Chance and Eve are settled in the back seat.  As they talk,
	Chance is experiencing his first ride in a car.

				EVE
		I hope you're comfortable.

				CHANCE
		Yes, I am.

				EVE
		These situations can be so
		trying - everybody seems to
		make such a todo over a
		simple little accident...
			(eyes Chance)
		...the insurance, police, the
		news and all... Is your leg
		feeling any better?

				CHANCE
		No, it isn't.

				EVE
		I see.

	Chance looks out the window at passing cars.

				CHANCE
		It looks very much like television
		but you can see further.

				EVE
			(not hearing him)
		Say - if you came to our house,
		we could take care of you there.

				CHANCE
		Your house?

				EVE
		Yes.  My husband has been very
		ill.  His doctor and nurses are
		staying with us.  Those hospitals
		can be so impersonal - why, it
		might be hours before you are
		treated...

				CHANCE
		I agree.

				EVE
		Fine, it will save a lot of un-
		necessary fuss and it will be
		so much more pleasant for you...
			(leans forward)
		David, we'll just go on home.
		Jeffrey, would you call and let
		them know?

				JEFFREY
		Yes ma'am.

	Jeffrey closes the glass between them, then dials the
	limo telephone.

	There is a moment of silence.  Eve, a bit uncomfortable,
	presses a button.  The limo's bar moves out, revealing a
	row of decanters and glasses.

				EVE
		Would you care for a drink?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  Thank you.  I am very
		thirsty.

	As Eve pours cognac into a monogrammed crystal glass,
	Chance notices the limo's TV set.

				CHANCE
		I would like to watch television.

				EVE
			(a bit surprised)
		Oh?  Certainly...

	She hands Chance the cognac, turns on the TV.

				EVE
		May I ask your name?

	Chance takes a sip of the cognac, is not accustomed
	to alcohol, coughs.

				CHANCE
			(with a slight cough)
		My name is Chance.

				EVE
		Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?

				CHANCE
		No, I'm a gardener.

				EVE
		Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr.
		Chauncey Gardiner... You're not
		related to Basil and Perdita
		Gardiner are you?

				CHANCE
		No... I'm not related to
		Basil and Perdita.

				EVE
		Oh.  Well, they're just a wonderful
		couple, we've been friends for
		years.  We visit their island quite
		often.

	Chance suddenly starts going through his pockets, searching.

				EVE
		Did you lose something?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I lost my remote control.

				EVE
		Oh...  Well, I'm very sorry...

	Another pause, Chance reaches out, changes channels on TV.

34	EXT. HIGHWAY - WOODED AREA - NIGHT

	The limo approaches, then turns into the entranceway of
	the Rand Estate.  Two guards stand on either side of the
	open gate, salute as the car passes through.

35	INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

	As Eve speaks, Chance is glued to the TV, switches
	channels to the news.

				EVE
		Is there anything special you
		like to watch?

				CHANCE
		I like to watch.  This is fine.

				EVE
		I know it's very mportant to
		stay informed of all the
		latest events, but I find
		there is so much to assimilate
		that it can become quite
		muddling at times...

	Chance nods, changes the channel, watches a Mighty Mouse
	cartoon.  Eve takes it for a small joke and smiles
	patronizingly.

36	EXT. RAND MANSION - NIGHT

	At least three uniformed people, two valets, WILSON and
	PERKINS, and LEWIS, the Doorman, are waiting at the front
	of the Rand Mansion as the limousine arrives.  There is
	a general hubbub as the three of them, along with Jeffrey,
	help Chance into a wheelchair.

37	INT. RAND MANSION - FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT

	As the group comes through the front doors, Wilson is
	wheeling Chance.  A uniformed woman, GRETA, is waiting
	to take Eve's coat.

				EVE
			(to Wilson)
		You take Mr. Gardiner to the
		third floor guest suite.

				EVE
			(to Chance)
		I'll see you after Dr. Allenby
		has a look at your leg.

				CHANCE
		Yes, I think he should examine
		my leg.

	Eve heads off partially revealing a remarkable and large
	place to live in as Wilson wheels Chance into the elevator.

38	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	As the door closes on them, Chance looks to Wilson.

				CHANCE
		...I've never been in one of
		these.

	Wilson thinks that Chance is talking about the wheelchair.

				WILSON
		It's one of Mr. Rand's.  Since
		he's been ill...

				CHANCE
			(looks around elevator)
		Does it have a television?

				WILSON
			(laughs)
		No - but Mr. Rand does have one
		with an electric motor, that way
		he can get around by himself.

				CHANCE
		I see.

	Chance again checks out the elevator.

				CHANCE
		How long do we stay in here?

				WILSON
		How long?  I don't know, see
		what the doctor says...

	The elevator stops on the third floor.

39	INT. RAND MANSION - PALM COURT - NIGHT

	Eve is talking to ROBERT ALLENBY.  He is in his late
	fifties and has been Benjamin Rand's doctor for years.

				EVE
		I pray that I did the right
		thing, Robert.  I didn't want
		to take the risk of any
		publicity, especially with
		Benjamin being so ill.

				ALLENBY
		I'm sure you did, EVE.  But
		let's just hope he's not one
		of those opportunists that try
		and make a fortune out of every
		little bruise.

				EVE
		Well, I'm sure we could make a
		settlement if we had to, but
		I'd rather not - find out what
		you can, I'm going to change.

				ALLENBY
			(as she goes)
		Ben's been asking about you...

				EVE
			(over her shoulder)
		I'll see him soon.

	Allenby watches after her for a beat, then turns, goes
	off in the other direction.

40	INT. GUEST SUITE - NIGHT

	An enormous bedroom, filled with 18th Century antique
	furniture.  Allenby dabs Chance's ass with a piece of
	cotton soaked in alcohol, prior to an injection.  Chance
	stands with his pants to the floor, looks to the tele-
	vision which is not turned on.

				ALLENBY
		This will ease the pain and
		swelling, Mr. Gardiner.

				CHANCE
		I understand.  I've seen it
		done before.

				ALLENBY
		Now, you'll barely feel this.
		It won't hurt at all.

	Allenby administers the injection, Chance reacts from
	the pain.

				CHANCE
		You were wrong, it did hurt.

				ALLENBY
			(a chuckle)
		But not for long...

	As Allenby puts a band-aid on Chance's ass, Chance spots
	a remote control for the TV on the bedside table.  He
	reaches out, picks it up.

				ALLENBY
		It's good that there was no
		apparent damage to the bone.

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I think so, too.

				ALLENBY
		There could be minor hemorr-
		haging, which really isn't
		too serious at the time, but
		can cause secondary problems
		if not looked after.

				CHANCE
			(turns on TV)
		I see.

				ALLENBY
			(a look to the TV,
			then to Chance)
		You can pull your trousers up,
		now.

				CHANCE
		Oh, fine.

				ALLENBY
		Just to take the proper pre-
		cautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd
		recommend we take you down-
		stairs and X-Ray your leg.

	There is no reaction from Chance, Allenby takes a long
	look at him.

				ALLENBY
		...By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I
		would like to ask you something
		straight out.

				CHANCE
			(doesn't understand)
		...Straight out?

				ALLENBY
		Yes.  Are you planning on making
		any sort of claim against the
		Rand's?

				CHANCE
			(after a beat)
		Claim...? ...Oh, claim, that's
		what Thomas asked me.

				ALLENBY
		Thomas?  Who's Thomas?

				CHANCE
		Thomas Franklin, an attorney.

				ALLENBY
		An attorney?

				CHANCE
			(turns to TV)
		Yes.

				ALLENBY
			(suddenly very cold)
		Then you wish to handle this
		matter through your attorneys?

				CHANCE
		There's no need for a claim,
		the garden is a healthy one.

				ALLENBY
			(gives Chance a look)
		Oh, I see...
			(laughs)
		...Well, then...  You caught me
		off guard, I must admit...

				CHANCE
			(changes channels,
			sits on bed)
		Thank you.

				ALLENBY
		Good, keep your weight off
		that leg, Mr. Gardiner.  In
		fact, it would be best if
		you could stay here for a
		day or two, if that would be
		possible.  I can promise you
		the finest in care.

				CHANCE
		Yes, I could stay here.  Does
		this house have a garden?

				ALLENBY
		...Why, yes - many

	Allenby picks up his bag, heads for the door.

				ALLENBY
		I'll send Wilson up to take you
		for X-Rays, Mr. Gardiner.  Feel
		free to use the telphone, and
		please let me know if you have
		any discomfort.

				CHANCE
			(clicking changer)
		Yes, I will.

	Allenby gives him a look, then leaves.  Chance watches an
	old movie of a man lighting a cigar.  The man enjoys the
	cigar, blows out smoke.  The scene seems to 'sink into'
	Chance's mind.

41	INT. EVE'S BEDROOM/SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

	Allenby enters to reveal Eve standing in front of large
	double windows that are wide open.  She is wearing different
	clothes, different hair.

				ALLENBY
		Good God, Eve - you'll freeze.

				EVE
		I wanted some fresh air.
		How is Mr. Gardiner?

				ALLENBY
		A rather large contusion, but
		there isn't any...

				EVE
			(interrupts)
		That's not what I meant, Robert.

				ALLENBY
			(a beat)
		Okay...Well - he seemed to be
		a most reasonable man, I don't
		think he'll cause any trouble.

				EVE
		Thank God for that.

				ALLENBY
		I'd like to keep an eye on him,
		though - I suggested that he
		stay here for a couple of days.

				EVE
		Stay here?  Is that necessary?

				ALLENBY
		Not necessary, but preferable.
		Don't worry, Eve - he might be a
		breath of fresh air...

				EVE
			(a beat)
		...Yes, he is different... He's
		very intense, and internal, don't
		you think?

				ALLENBY
		Perhaps... Actually, I found him
		to have quite a sense of humor.

				EVE
		Good.  It might be pleasant for
		a couple of days....

	Eve is silent for a moment, looks out to the darkness.

				EVE
		I guess I should go see Ben now.
			(turns)
		I'll see you at dinner.

	Eve leaves the room.

44	INT. RAND'S CONVERTED BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Eve enters through heavy glass doors.  BENJAMIN RAND,
	wearing a silk bathrobe, lies on a king-sized bed to one
	side of the room.  Rand perks up as sees Eve crossing
	to him.  He is in his sixties, maintains an inner
	strength and dignity despite the sapping effects of his
	illness.

				RAND
			(with wekness)
		...Eve...

	Eve kisses him, holds his hand.

				EVE
			(with conviction)
		Oh, Ben - I do miss you when
		I'm out... How are you feeling?

				RAND
		Tired... And I'm getting tired
		of being tired.  Other than
		that, I'm doing very well.

				EVE
		I'm so glad... No headaches?

				RAND
		No, it's been a good day - better
		that yours, from what I've been
		told.

				EVE
		You heard?

				RAND
		I may be a shut-in, but I do not
		lack for news.  I'm sorry you had
		to go through all that.

				EVE
		Oh, it wasn't all that bad darling.
		We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner
		turned out to be so reasonable.

				RAND
		Reasonable?  Good, I'd like to meet
		a reasonable man.  Why don't you
		ask this Gardiner to join us for
		dinner?

				EVE
		For dinner?  Are you well enough
		for that?

				RAND
			(smiles)
		Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve -
		if I wait until I feel better,
		will I ever meet the man?
			(Eve is silent)
		Constance!

	CONSTANCE, in a nurse's uniform, appears in a side doorway.

				RAND
		Constance!  I want new blood
		tonight, I'm getting up for
		dinner.

				CONTANCE
		But, Mr. Rand...

				RAND
		Don't argue, tell Robert I
		want new blood!
			(turns to Eve)
		...Ask him to dinner.

	Rand pulls Eve's hand close, kisses it.

				EVE
			(after a beat)
		... I ran into Senator Jansen at
		lunch today and he all but ignored
		me... And it's starting to happen
		a lot lately... since you've been
		sick.

				RAND
		Dammit, there's no excuse for that.
		I'll call him tomorrow.

				EVE
		Thank you, darling.

43	INT. RAND MANSION - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

	The elevator door opens to reveal Wilson with Chance in
	the wheelchair.

				CHANCE
			(as Wilson wheels
			him out)
		...Thats is a very small room.

				WILSON
			(laughs)
		Yes sir, I guess that's true -
		smallest room in the house.

				CHANCE
			(glancing around)
		Yes.  It seems to be.

	Wilson takes this as another joke, chuckles as he wheels
	Chance toward Rand's hospital room.

44	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

	A glass-enclosed room, next to Rand's bedroom, filled with
	the very latest in hospital emergency equipment.  CONSTANCE
	and another nurse, TERESA, stand by as Rand is being given
	a transfusion.  Rand lifts his head as Wilson wheels Chance
	into the room.

				RAND
		Welcome to Rand Memorial
		Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.

				CHANCE
			(looks around room)
		...I see.

	Wilson pushes Chance to the X-Ray machine, where BILLINGS, a
	Black technician helps him onto the table.

				CHANCE
			(inhales deeply)
		I feel very good in here.

				RAND
		That's the oxygen!  When I first
		got sick I had it all glassed in
		so I could have a little extra
		oxygen pumped in, keeps my
		spirits up.

	Chance is now flat on his back as Billings lines up the
	X-Ray camera.

				CHANCE
		You must be very sick.

				RAND
		Aplastic anemia, Mr. Gardiner -
		aplastic anemia.  Failure of the
		bone marrow to produce red blood
		cells... Not a damn thing they
		can do about it.  Oh, they can
		make me comfortable, prolong my
		life with steroid therapy and
		transfusions... But what makes
		my blood boil, what little I
		have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner
		- is that it's generally a young
		person's disease... Here I am,
		getting on in years and about to
		die of a young person's disease...

				CHANCE
			(smiles at Rand)
		I've never seen anything like this
		on television.

				BILLINGS
		Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.

				CONSTANCE
		You too, Mr. Rand, you must stay
		quiet.

				RAND
			(lays his head
			back)
		..You will join us for dinner,
		won't you, Mr. Gardiner?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I am very hungry.

				RAND
		... So am I, my boy - so am I.

	Chance stares at Billings, reacts to him being black.

				CHANCE
		Do you know Raphael?

				BILLINGS
		No sir, I don't believe I do.

				CHANCE
		Oh.  I have a message for him.

				BILLINGS
		Yes, sir.

				CHANCE
		A black man gave me the message.

				BILLINGS
		Well, I still don't believe I
		know the man, Mr. Gardiner.
		Now, please hold still.

45	INT. RAND DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	The dining room is immense, a 75-foot ceiling, huge fire-
	places.  Allenby, Eve, Rand and Chance (both in wheel-
	chairs) sit around the table.  THURMAND, a waiter, and
	MARIANNE, a waitress, enter carrying trays of food.  Eve
	turns to Chance.

				EVE
		I do hope your injury won't
		prevent you from attending to
		business, Mr. Gardiner?

				CHANCE
		No.  It won't do that.

				EVE
		...Would you like us to notify
		anyone for you?

				CHANCE
		No.  The Old Man died and
		Louise left.

				EVE
		Oh.  I'm very sorry.  Well, if
		you have a need for any of our
		facilities, please don't hesi-
		tate to ask.

				RAND
		Do you need a secretary?

				CHANCE
		No, thank you.  My house has
		been closed.

				RAND
		Oh, you mean to say that your
		business was shut down.

				CHANCE
		Yes.  Shut down and locked by
		the attorneys.

				RAND
		What'd I tell you? ...I know
		exactly what you mean.  Today
		the businessman is at the
		mercy of kid-lawyers from the
		SEC.  All they want to do is
		regulate our natural growth!

				ALLENBY
		It's happening to everyone,
		I'm afraid.  The way things
		are going they'll probably
		legislate the Medical Profession,
		as we know it, right out of
		existence.

				CHANCE
		Yes.  Right out of existence.

				RAND
		And it's a damn shame - it's all
		happening too fast...
			(sighs)
		What are your plans now, Mr.
		Gardiner?  Or may I call you
		Chauncey?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  Chauncey is fine.

				RAND
		And I'm Ben.

				ALLENBY
			(smiles to Chance)
		Robert.

				EVE
			(also smiles)
		...Eve.

				RAND
		So tell me, Chauncey, just
		what are your plans?

				CHANCE
		I would like to work in your
		garden.

				EVE
			(laughs)
		Oh, I know exactly what you
		mean.  I sometimes enjoy
		puttering around myself, such
		a pleasant way to forget one's
		troubles.

				RAND
		I never had a feel for it my-
		self... But, Eve - why don't
		you show Chauncey our gardens
		tomorrow...
			(to Chance)
		They're quite lovely.

				EVE
		Well, it'll have to wait until
		I get back from Boston...
		Unfortunately, my morning will
		be taken up by another one of
		those charity events.

				CHANCE
		I am a very good gardener.

				RAND
		Isn't that what a businessman is?
		A gardener?  A person that makes
		flinty soil productive with the
		labor of his own hands, who waters
		it with sweat from his own brow,
		and who creates a place of value for
		his family and community?  Yes, in-
		deed, Chauncey, a productive busi-
		nessman is a laborer in his own
		vineyard.

				CHANCE
		I know exactly what you mean, Ben.
		The garden that I left was such a
		place.  But I don't have that any
		more...
			(points to ceiling)
		...All that's left for me now is
		the room upstairs.

				RAND
		Now, wait a minute, Chauncey - you
		have your health... for
		God's sake don't give up on your-
		self!  You have to fight!
		You can't let those bastards
		keep you down!  I don't want
		to hear any more from you about
		the 'Room Upstairs.'  That's
		where I'm going soon.

	There is a long pause.  Chance looks up, then smiles at
	Rand.

				CHANCE
		It's a very pleasant room, Ben.

				RAND
			(laughs)
		Yes, I'm sure it is.  That's
		what they say, anyway.

	Another period of silence.  The servants bustle around
	the room as Allenby studies Chance.

46	INT. RAND'S POOL ROOM - NIGHT

	Allenby is shooting pool.  Rand is offering Chance a cigar
	from a humidor.

				RAND
		Have one of these, Chauncey - 
		they're Cuban.

				CHANCE
		Thank you, Ben.

	Chance examines the cigar, does not see Rand clip the end
	off his own.

				RAND
		It's one thing Robert
		can't keep me from.  I've
		enjoyed a cigar as long
		as I can remember.

	Rand turns the cigar clipper to Chance.  As Chance tries
	to figure out the clipper, the flame from an ornate lighter
	catches his eye and Chance watches intently as Rand lights
	hiw own cigar.

				RAND
		...You know, Chauncey, there are
		thousands of American businessmen,
		large and small, that share your
		plight.  I've been concerned with
		the situation for some time now.
			(hands lighter
			to Chance)
		...I'd like to offer the decent
		'gardeners' of the community a
		helping hand.  They've been
		harrassed long enough by inflation,
		excessive taxation, unions, all
		sorts of indecencies...

	Allenby watches Chance as he first tries to light the
	lighter, then tries to light the unclipped cigar.

				RAND (cont'd)
		After all, they are our strongest
		defense against the pollutants
		that threaten our basic freedoms
		and the well-being of our middle
		class.  So I've been thinking
		about beginning a financial
		assistance fund... Tell me,
		Chauncey, would you have any
		thoughts on such a program?

				CHANCE
			(puffing, trying
			to light cigar)
		No, Ben.

				RAND
			(a smile)
		Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey?
		Well, I can understand that.  When
		a man loses everything, anger has
		a tendacy to block out reason for
		a time.  Just give it some thought,
		work with the idea, I'm sure you'll
		have plenty to say in a few days.

	Chance puts the unlit cigar in the ashtray, smiles at
	a most curious Allenby.

47	INT. MANSION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Wilson stands behind Chance in the wheelchair.  Chance
	glances slowly around the elevator.  Suddenly, Wilson breaks
	out into laughter.

				WILSON
		...Sorry, sir... I thought
		you were going to come out
		with another one of your
		jests about the elevator...
		Excuse me, sir...

	The elevator stops, the door opens.

48	INT. MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Wilson wheels Chance out of the elevator.

				CHANCE
		...Hmmm...  Elevator.

				WILSON
			(laughs again)
		...Yes sir - elevator!

	Wilson stops laughing as he notices Eve coming toward them.

				EVE
		Chauncey, I wanted to tell you
		how dreadful I feel about your
		leg, but how delighted I am
		that you are staying with us.

				CHANCE
		Thank you, Eve - I like this
		house very much.

				EVE
		...And Ben is just mad about
		you - you've lifted his spirits
		so - it's just... Well, it's
		just a real pleasure, your
		being here...

				CHANCE
		Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen
		that before.

				EVE
		Yes... I know Chauncey.

				CHANCE
		I like Ben very much... He re-
		minds me of the Old Man...

				EVE
		He does...?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  Are you going to leave
		and close the house when he
		dies?

	Eve is not prepared for such a question.

				EVE
		...Why... No, I don't think
		so...

				CHANCE
		That's good.

	Chance smiles at Eve and there is a moment of silence
	before Eve moves away.

				EVE
		...Good night, Chauncey.

				CHANCE
		Good night, Eve.

	Wilson wheels Chance toward the guest room.

49	EXT. FRONT OF RAND MANSION - MORNING

	Chance comes out of the front door, walking with a limp
	for his first view of the Rand grounds.  The attendant,
	Lewis, hurries to Chance.

				LEWIS
		Did you want a car, sir?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I would like a car.

				LEWIS
		Yes, sir.

	Lewis goes to his post, picks up a phone.  As Chance looks
	at the surroundings, Allenby and Wilson, with Chance's
	wheelchair, come out of the house.

				ALLENBY
		Chauncey, there you are.  What
		are you doing on that leg?

				CHANCE
		It's fine today, Robert.

				ALLENBY
		Shame on you, Chauncey - you
		should let me be the judge of
		that.  Please, sit in the chair.

	Wlison pushes a wheelchair to Chance, he sits.

				ALLENBY
			(checks leg)
		I swear, Chauncey, between you
		and Benjamin, I've got my hands
		full...
			(examines Chance's
			calf)
		...Say, that is coming along, the
		swelling has gone down considerably...

	A limousine pulls up to the front of the mansion, waits
	for Chance.

				ALLENBY
			(continues examining)
		...Benjamin has been hounding
		me to allow him to address the
		annual convention of his
		Financial Institute today, but
		obviously, the strain would be
		impossible... How about here,
		Chauncey, any soreness?

				CHANCE
		Hardly any, Robert.

	Lewis, the attendant, interrupts.

				LEWIS
		Your limousine, sir.

				CHANCE
		Oh, thank you.

				ALLENBY
		...Are you going somewhere?

				CHANCE
		No, Robert.

				ALLENBY
			(a beat)
		...Oh... Anyway, the President
		offered to sit in for Ben at
		the convention, quite a nice
		gesture.  He's due here soon,
		I believe.

				CHANCE
		Yes, Robert.  I know about the
		President.

				ALLENBY
			(mildly surprised)
		...Oh?  You've heard?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  Ben called me.  He wants
		me to meet the President.

				ALLENBY
		He does, does he?

				CHANCE
		Yes, Ben asked me to be in his
		room at ten o'clock.

				ALLENBY
		Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.

				CHANCE
		How do I know when it's ten
		o'clock?

	A long reaction from Allenby, then he looks at his watch.

				ALLENBY
		...It's five of, you'd best
		get on in there.

				CHANCE
		Thank you, Robert.

	Wilson begins to push Chance.

				CHANCE
		I would like to walk today.

				ALLENBY
		Hell yes - walk.  You're meeting
		the President, aren't you?

				CHANCE
			(gets out of chair)
		Yes.  I like to watch him on
		television.

	Allenby, a bit puzzled, watches as Wilson opens the front
	door for Chance.

50	INT. RAND'S ROOM - MORNING

	Rand is in an easy chair, dressed for his meeting with the
	President.  The two nurses are nearby.  Rand smiles as
	Chance is shown into the room by Wilson.

				RAND
		Chauncey, up and around this
		morning, are you?

				CHANCE
		Yes, Ben.  I like to walk.

				RAND
		Well, that's good news, my boy.

				CHANCE
		You're looking much better today,
		Ben.

				RAND
		Hah!  It's all makeup, Chauncey...
		I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up,
		I didn't want the President to
		think I was going to die during
		our talk.

				CHANCE
		I understand.

				RAND
		No one likes a dying man, my boy -
		because few know what death is.
		All we know is the terror of it.
		But you're am exception, Chauncey -
		that's what I admire in you, your
		marvelous balance.  You don't
		stagger back and forth between fear
		and hope - you're a truly peaceful
		man.

				CHANCE
		Thank you, Ben.
			(looks at Rand
			closely)
		...Nurse Teresa did a very good
		job, Ben.

	The nurses turn, look at Chance.

51	INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - MORNING

	Allenby gets off the elevator, stands and thinks for a
	moment, then heads off down the hallway in the direction
	of Chance's room.

52	EXT. FRONT RAND MANSION - MORNING

	Perkins is at the head of eight servants lined up on the
	front steps.  Two black PLYMOUTH SEDANS pull up and EIGHT
	MEN in grey business suits get out.  One of them, WOLTZ,
	goes directly to Perkins.

				WOLTZ
		Good morning, Perkins.

				PERKINS
		Good morning, Mr. Woltz, nice
		to see you again.

				WOLTZ
		Thank you.  How have you been?

				PERKINS
		Fine, thank you.
			(hands Woltz paper)
		We have an additional guest with
		us today, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

				WOLTZ
			(reads list)
		I see...
			(turns to other men)
		Okay, let's go to work.

	The eight servants pair up with the eight men in suits
	and go into the house.

53	INT. RAND'S ROOM - MORNING

	Chance watches television as Rand speaks.

				RAND
		Yes, when I was younger I had
		thoughts about public office...
		But I found, Chauncey -- that I
		was able to contribute more as
		a private citizen... Of course,
		my wealth provided me with con-
		siderable influence, but I've
		tried, believe me, not to mis-
		use that power... It's extremely
		important, Chauncey, that you
		don't allow yourself to become
		blinded to the needs of the
		country even when the tempations
		are strong.  I've been labeled a
		'kingmaker' by many, but I have
		tried to stay open to the voices
		of the people... I have tried to
		remain honest to myself...

				CHANCE
			(changing channels)
		...I see, Ben.

54	INT. RAND MANSION - A HALLWAY - MORNING

	One of the servants accompanies Secret Service Agent RIFF
	as he knocks on each door, checks inside, then moves on.

55	EXT. FRONT RAND MANSION - MORNING

	Lewis picks up his phone and dials as he sees the President's
	motorcade come through the far gate.

				LEWIS
			(into phone)
		The President is arriving now,
		Mrs. Aubrey.

56	INT. RAND MANSION - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - MORNING

	MRS. AUBREY is Rand's executive secretary, but her office
	is the Nerve Center of Rand Enterprises.

				MRS. AUBREY
			(on phone)
		Very good, Lewis, thank you.

	Mrs. Aubrey clicks off, pushes another button.

57	INT. RAND'S ROOM - MORNING

	Rand smiles at Chance as the phone buzzes.

				RAND
		He's here.
			(into phone)
		Yes, Mrs. Aubrey?
			(listens)
		Fine.  Show the President to the
		library, we'll be along in a few
		minutes.

	Rand hangs up the phone, turns to Chance with a twinkle
	in his eyes.

				RAND
		It's an old habit that goes
		along with power -- keep them
		waiting...

	Teresa brings Rand's wheelchair to him.

				RAND
			(stands, very week)
		Not now, Teresa.  I'm seeing the
		President on my own two feet.

				TERESA
		But, Mr. Rand...

				RAND
			(puts an arm around
			Chance for support)
		Shall we go, Chauncey?

				CHANCE
		Yes, Ben.  That's a good idea.

	Rand walks slowly, clings to the limping Chance tightly
	as they leave the room.

58	EXT. HALLWAY - MORNING

	The President and his entourage are seen on their way to
	the library as Rand and Chance enter and stop in front
	of Mrs. Aubrey's office.

				RAND
		Mrs. Aubrey, have you received
		the papers on the Caracas
		agreement?

				MRS. AUBREY
		Yes, sir.  They're ready for
		you to sign.

				RAND
		Excellent.
			(as they move away)
		A good woman, Mrs. Aubrey.

				CHANCE
		I agree, Ben.

	They shuffle off down the hallway and are met immediately
	by Woltz and and another agent, Barker.  Both carry small metal
	detectors.

				WOLTZ
		Good morning, Mr. Rand.

				RAND
		Woltz...
			(nods toward Chance)
		This is Mr. Gardiner.

				WOLTZ
			(indicates detector)
		Just a formality, Mr. Gardiner.

	Barker passes the detector over Rand as Woltz checks Chance.

				RAND
		Good thing we're not in our
		wheelchairs, you boys would have
		a devil of a time.

				CHANCE
			(as Woltz finishes)
		Thank you very much.

59	INT. RAND LIBRARY - MORNING

	A somewhat nervous PRESIDENT waits for Rand and Chance.
	When they enter, he goes to Rand with both hands out-
	stretched.

				PRESIDENT
		Ben!

				RAND
		...Mr. President, how good to
		see you.

				PRESIDENT
		It's so good to see you too,
		Ben, you look terrific!

				RAND
			(with a look
			to Chance)
		Thank you, Mr. President.  Let me
		tell you, your visit has raised
		my spirits...

				PRESIDENT
		Well, I've missed you, my friend.
			(guides Rand to
			chair)
		Here, sit down, get off your
		feet.

	As Rand sinks into the chair, Chance approaches the President
	with both hands outstretched.

				CHANCE
		Good morning, Mr. President.

				PRESIDENT
			(smiling)
		...Hello.

				RAND
		Oh, Mr. President, I'd like you
		to meet my dear friend, Mr.
		Chauncey Gardiner.

	Chance and the President exchange a two-handed handshake.
	The President reacts.

				CHANCE
		You look much smaller on
		television, Mr. President.

				PRESIDENT
			(a beat)
		...Oh, really...

				RAND
			(smiling)
		You will find that Chauncey
		does not bandy words, Mr.
		President.

	The President gives Chance a look, then laughs.

				PRESIDENT
		Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's
		just fine with me - I'm a man
		that appreciates a frank dis-
		cussion... Be seated, please,
		Mr. Gardiner...

				CHANCE
			(sitting)
		Yes, I will.

				PRESIDENT
			(also sits)
		Now, Ben, did you happen to get
		a chance to go over...

	Chance reacts to the mention of his name, interrupts.

				CHANCE
		Yes?

	There is a beat as the President look at Chance quizzically,
	then he continues.

				PRESIDENT
		...I just wonder if you had
		gone over my speech, Ben.

				RAND
		Yes, I did.

				PRESIDENT
		...Well?

				RAND
		Overall - pretty good.  But, Mr.
		President, I think it's very
		dangerous to resort to temporary
		measures at this stage of the game.

				PRESIDENT
		Well, Ben... I...

				RAND
		I sympathize with you and, I
		know how difficult it is to be
		straightforward, but I'm telling
		you right now, Bobby - your
		position on this is going to
		cause more dissension that you
		want or might even be able to
		stand.

60	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - MORNING

	Allenby is searching through Chance's clothes looking for
	something.  There is a knock at the door, Allenby pulls
	back from the closet as Riff opens the door, looks inside.

				ALLENBY
		Oh... Hello.

				RIFF
			(entering)
		Good morning.  I'm Riff, Secret
		Service.

				ALLENBY
		...Yes.  Of course.

	Allenby spreads his arms as Riff passes the metal detector
	over him.

61	INT. LIBRARY - MORNING

	The President paces, is worried about what Rand is telling
	him.  Chance smiles through it all.

				RAND
		...There is no longer any margin
		for inflation, it has gone as
		far as it can.  You've reached
		your limits on taxation, dependence
		on foreign energy is at a point of
		crisis, and, from where I see it,
		Mr. President, the so-called Free
		Enterprise System could be at
		the breaking point.

				PRESIDENT
		You don't think I should take
		that chance, huh?

				RAND
		Absolutely not.

	Chance has reacted to his name, but doesn't know what
	to say.  The President sits, turns, to Chance.

				PRESIDENT
		Do you agree with Ben, Mr.
		Gardiner?  Or do you think we
		can stimulate growth through
		temporary incentives?

				CHANCE
			(a beat)
		As long as the roots are not
		severed, all is well and all
		will be well in the garden.

				PRESIDENT
			(a pause)
		...In the garden?

				CHANCE
		That is correct.  In a garden,
		growth has its season.  There
		is spring and summer, but there
		is also fall and winter.  And
		then spring and summer again...

				PRESIDENT
			(staring at Chance)
		...Spring and summer...
			(confused)
		Yes, I see...Fall and winter.
			(smiles at Chance)
		Yes, indeed.

				RAND
			(interrupts)
		I think what my most insightfult
		friend is building up to, Mr.
		President, is that we welcome the
		inevitable saesons of nature, yet
		we are upset by the seasons of
		our economy.

				CHANCE
		Yes.  That is correct.  There will
		be growth in the spring.

				PRESIDENT
			(pleased)
		...Well, Mr. Gardiner, I must
		admit, that is one of the most
		refreshing and optimistic state-
		ments I've heard in a very, very
		long time.
			(he rises)
		...I envy your good, solid sense,
		Mr. Gardiner - that is precisely
		what we lack on Capitol Hill.
			(glances at watch)
		I must be going.
			(holds out hand
			to Chance)
		... This visit has been most
		enlightening...

	Chance rises and shakes the President's hand.

				CHANCE
		Yes.  It has.

				PRESIDENT
		...You will honor me and my family
		with a visit, won't you?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I will.

				PRESIDENT
		Wonderful, we'll all look forward
		to seeing you.
			(turns to Rand)
		Is Eve around?  I'd like to say
		hello.

				RAND
		No, she flew up to Boston for some
		charity event.  She'll be sorry
		to have missed you.

				PRESIDENT
		I'm sorry, too.  Well, Nancy wanted
		me to send along her best to the two
		of you - and, Ben, I want to thank
		you for your time and thoughts.

				RAND
		Nonsense, Mr. President - I
		thank you for coming to spend
		time with a dying man.

				PRESIDENT
		Now, Ben, I won't have any any of
		that.  Why don't you listen to
		your good friend Chauncey -
		this is a time to think of
		life!

	The President claps Rand's hand.

				RAND
		You're right, Mr. President -
		I don't like feeling sorry
		for myself.

				PRESIDENT
		Take care of yourself, Ben.

				RAND
		You too, Bobby.

				PRESIDENT
			(as he turns to
			go, a smile to
			Chance)
		...Chauncey...

				CHANCE
		...Bobby...

	The President leaves the library and Chance turns to Rand.

				RAND
			(as the door
			closes)
		He's a decent fellow, the
		President, isn't he?

				CHANCE
		I'm glad he came, Ben.  It was
		nice talking to the President.

62	INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - MORNING

	The President and his entourage are moving along toward
	the front door.  One aide, KAUFMAN, walks next to the
	President.

				PRESIDENT
		Kaufman, I'm going to need
		information on Mr. Chauncey
		Gardiner's background.

				KAUFMAN
			(makes note of name)
		Gardiner, yes, sir.

				PRESIDENT
		And I'd like it some time today.

				KAUFMAN
		No problem, Chief.

63	INT. RAND MANSION - TAPESTRY ROOM - MORNING

	Rand has an arm around Chance as the two of them walk.
	Behind them, Wilson and Perkins push empty wheelchairs.

				RAND
			(very weak)
		...You know, Chauncey, there's
		something about you... You don't
		play games with words to protect
		yourself.  You're direct...
			(they walk a
			few more feet
			in silence)
		You know what I was talking to
		you about last night?

				CHANCE
			(blankly)
		No, Ben.

				RAND
		Oh, sure you do, the financial
		assistance program for the
		businessman.
			(another beat)
		Well, I think you might be just
		the man to take charge of such an
		undertaking.  I'd like you to meet
		with the other members of the Board
		so you can discuss the matter at
		greater length with them.

				CHANCE
		I understand.

				RAND
		And, please, Chauncey - don't
		rush your decision.  I know
		you're not a man to act on the
		spur of the moment.

				CHANCE
		Thank you, Ben.

				RAND
		And now, Chauncey, I'm afriad
		you must excuse me - I'm very
		tired...

	Rand sits down in his wheelchair and Perkins starts off
	with him.

				CHANCE
			(as they go)
		I'm sorry that you are so sick,
		Ben.

	Chance watches after them for a moment, then his interest
	is taken by one of the large tapestries.

64	EXT. RAND MANSION - MAIN GARDEN - DAY

	Chance and Eve walk through the garden.  At one end, is a
	huge Victorian greenhouse, with smaller greenhouses next
	to it.  Off to one side, stands an attractive stone house.
	Five young men work in one area, shovelling mulch.

				EVE
		There are over sixty thousand
		tulip bulbs planted here.  It's
		quite a sight when they're
		blooming.  Of course, the
		roses are beautiful, too.  We
		have, I think, around twenty
		thousand bushes.
			(gestures to
			men working)
		...We plant something different
		every year in that area... But
		I haven't decided what I would
		like this spring.  What do you
		think, Chauncey?

				CHANCE
		I don't know.

				EVE
		Well, give it some thought.
			(indicates stone
			house)
		That's the gardener's house
		over there.

	Chance looks off to the two story stone house.

65	INT. A GREENHOUSE - DAY

	Chance and Eve are in the middle of a huge potting green-
	house where hundreds of young plants are tended by four
	workers.

				CHANCE
		I like to watch the young
		plants grow.

				EVE
		It is wonderful, isn't it?

				CHANCE
		Young plants do much better
		if a person helps them.

	Eve looks at Chance as he inspects some of the flowers.
	She has decided to make a move.

				EVE
		...Ben tells me the President
		was very taken with you this
		morning.

	Chance doesn't know what to say, continues inspecting the
	flowers.

66	INT. VICTORIAN GREENHOUSE - DAY

	Chance and Eve move through a large and an extra lush green-
	house until they reach a long room filled with cacti.

				EVE
			(as they move)
		...Chauncey...Last night you
		mentioned an old man, that died.
		Was a relative?  Or an
		intimate friend?

				CHANCE
			(looking at
			greenhouse)
		He was a very wealthy man, he
		looked after me since I was
		young.

				EVE
		Oh, I see... Your mentor.

				CHANCE
		...Mentor...?

	Eve takes his uncertainty as a reluctance to discuss the
	Old Man.

				EVE
		Forgive me, Chauncey - I don't
		mean to pry.  You must have
		been very close to him.

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I was.

				EVE
		I'm sorry...
			(getting more
			to the point)
		...And what about Louise?  You
		mentioned that she had gone.
		Were you close to her also?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I liked Louise very
		much.  She was his maid.

				EVE
			(relieved)
		Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I
		thought perhaps she was someone
		that you may have been romantically
		involved with, or maybe your sister.

				CHANCE
		Oh no.  She brought me my meals.

				EVE
			(pleased)
		Of course.

	Eve edges slightly closer to Chance.  Chance edges
	slightly closer to the cacti, is fascinated by it.

67	INT. RAND'S ROOM - DAY

	Rand is in bed, looking bad.  Eve, Chance and Allenby are
	seated around him, the two nurses stand to one side.  They
	all watch the President's address to the Financial Institute
	on TV.

				PRESIDENT'S VOICE
		...I know that many of you believe
		that we are on the brink of the
		worst financial crisis in this
		nation's history.  And there are
		some of you who would like to see
		us put mandatory freezes on prices
		and wages, and then call it a
		temporary measure.  Well, that's
		exactly what I was going to do
		until this moment.  But I have
		decided there are no temporary
		stop gaps.  So I am going to re-
		think my position and find
		another solution.  And, you'll be
		very pleased to know that your
		founder and chairman-of-the-board,
		Mr. Benjamin Turnbull Rand, agrees
		with me on this...
			(a beat)
		...for once.

	There is applause and laughter from the audience.

				PRESIDENT'S VOICE (Cont'd)
			(after applause)
		Chauncey Gardiner, Mr. Rand's close
		friend and advisor, was at our
		meeting this morning.  I found Mr.
		Gardiner to have a feeling for
		this country that we need more of.
		He likened us to a garden...
		...To quote Mr. Gardiner, a most
		intuitive man, 'As long as the
		roots of industry remain firmly
		planted in the national soil,
		the economic prospects are un-
		doubtedly sunny.'

	Rand starts coughing, breathing heavily.  Allenby and
	the nurses rush to his bedside.  Allenby shoots a quick
	look to Eve and Chance.

				ALLENBY
			(motioning toward door)
		I think you should leave.

	Eve and an interested Chance leave the room as Allenby
	administers aid to Rand.

				PRESIDENT'S VOICE (Cont'd)
		Gentlemen, let us not fear the
		inevitable chill and storms of
		autumn and winter, instead, let
		us anticipate the rapid growth
		of springtime, let us await the
		rewards of summer.  As in a
		garden of the earth, let us
		learn to accept and appreciate
		the times when the trees are
		bare as well as the times when
		we pick the fruit.

68	INT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - DAY

	Eve and Chance stand in silence near the palm court.  Eve's
	eyes are swollen, red, she has been crying.  She turns to
	Chance, reaches out, touches his hand.

				EVE
			(hesitates)
		...I'm...
			(pause)
		...I'm very grateful that you're
		here, Chauncey...
			(pause)
		...With us...

				CHANCE
		So am I, Eve.

	Allenby comes out of Rand's room, his mood is serious.

				ALLENBY
		...This has been an exhausting
		day for Ben... He's resting
		comfortably now.  There's no
		cause for alarm...

	Mrs. Aubrey approaches.

				MRS. AUBREY
		Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone
		call for you, Sidney Courtney.

				CHANCE
		...Telephone call?

				MRS. AUBREY
		Yes, Sidney Courtney, the
		Financial Editor of the
		"Washington Post."

	Chance does not react.

				MRS. AUBREY
			(after a moment)
		Would you care to take it, sir?

				CHANCE
		Yes.

	Chance still does not move.  Eve mistakes this for
	concern for herself.

				EVE
		I'll be all right, Chauncey -
		you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...

				CHANCE
		Yes, Eve.  You'll be all right.

	Chance follows Mrs. Aubrey.  Eve watches Chance go, then
	turns to Allenby.

				EVE
		...He's such a sensitive man,
		so considerate...

69	INT. MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - DAY

	Three television sets are on.  Mrs. Aubrey hands a phone
	to Chance, he looks at it, uncertain.

				CHANCE
			(after a moment, into
			phone)
		...Hello.

70	INT. WASHINGTON POST - COURTNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

	SID COURTNEY, a man in his fifties, wears a rumpled wool
	jacket, smokes a pipe.

				COURTNEY
		Hello, Mr. Gardiner.  I'm sorry
		to disturb you, but I watched
		the President's speech at the
		Financial Institute today, and
		I wondered if you have any
		comments on the meeting that
		took place between Mr. Rand,
		the President and yourself.

71	INTERCUT - MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE/COURTNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

				CHANCE
		The President is a nice person.
		I enjoyed it very much.

				COURTNEY
		Good, sir.  And so, it seems,
		did the President - but we would
		like to have some facts; such as,
		uh... What exactly is the
		relationship between yourself and
		that of the First American
		Financial Corporation?

				CHANCE
		I think you should ask Mr. Rand
		that.

				COURTNEY
		Of course.  But since he is ill
		I'm taking the liberty of asking
		you.

				CHANCE
			(watching three
			TV sets)
		Yes, that is correct.  I think
		you should ask Mr. Rand that.

	Courtney doesn't understand but continues his questioning.

				COURTNEY
		I see.  Then one more quick
		question, Mr. Gardiner.

	Chance hangs up the phone, watches the TVs.

	Courtney listens to the dial tone, then puts the receiver
	down.

				COURTNEY
			(to himself)
		No wonder he's so close to
		Rand...

72	INT. MRS. AUBREY'S OFFICE - DAY

	Mrs. Aubrey puts a call on hold, speaks to Chance who
	is still intrigued by the three televisions.

				MRS. AUBREY
		Mr. Gardiner, I have the producer
		of the 'Gary Burns Show' on the
		line.

				CHANCE
		Yes, I have watched that on
		television.

				MRS. AUBREY
		Of course.  They would like you
		to appear on the show tonight.
		The Vice-President was scheduled,
		but he had to cancel, and they
		asked if you would be interested.

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I would like to be on
		television.

				MRS. AUBREY
		Fine.

	Chance turns back to the televisions.  Mrs. Aubrey talks
	to the producer.

				MRS. AUBREY
			(into phone)
		Hello, Mr. Hull... Mr. Gardiner
		has agreed to do the show... Yes,
		I'll tell him.  The show will be
		taped and then shown at ten o'clock,
		but he's to be there at seven.

73	INT. EVE'S BEDROOM - EVENING

	Eve is on the phone while being attended to by a MANICURIST
	and a HAIRDRESSER.  Eve talks to Sophie as if they weren't
	there as one wig is taken off, another is put on.

				EVE
			(into phone)
		...Are you kidding?  Of course,
		I'll bring him, I promise - but
		I'll get Ben to suggest it...
		Hands off, Sophie - this one's
		mine... No, I haven't done that,
		but give me time... Yes, be sure
		and watch the 'Burns' Show to-
		night, you'll see what I mean...
		Ben?  Oh, he's okay - he's got
		his ups and downs...

74	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - EVENING

	Chance wears a velvet bathrobe, watches TV.  Wilson and
	Perkins lay out a suit, shirt, tie, etc.  There is a KNOCK
	at the door.

				PERKINS
		Excuse me, sir.

	Perkins answers the door, it is Eve.

				EVE
			(entering)
		Chauncey, I wanted to wish you
		well.  I know you'll be just
		smashing.

				CHANCE
			(rising)
		Thank you, Eve.

				EVE
		And Benjamin sends along his
		best wishes.

				CHANCE
		How is Ben feeling?

				EVE
		He's tired, Chauncey - but he's
		going to watch you tonight.
		We'll both be watching.

				CHANCE
		That's good.  I like to watch,
		too.

				EVE
		I know you do - you and your
		television...
			(a pause)
		...Good luck, Chauncey.

	Eve impulsively steps forward, kisses Chance on the cheek.
	Chance smiles at her.  Eve returns the smile, then leaves
	the room.  Chance sits back down, watches TV as Wilson
	and Perkins attend to his clothes with a whiskbroom.

75	INT. WASHINGTON POST - RESEARCH ROOM - NIGHT

	A woman, KINNEY, sits behind a stack of paperwork.  She
	has a downcast expression as Sidney Courtney, followed by
	three staffers, enters the room.

				COURTNEY
			(to Staffers)
		...Gardiner is laconic, matter-
		of-fact.  The scuttlebutt is
		that he's a strong candidate
		for one of the seats on the
		Board of First American.
			(to Kinney)
		...Kinney, what did you come up
		with on his background?

				KINNEY
			(after pause)
		...Nothing.

				COURTNEY
		...Skip the levity, Kinney -
		what have you got?

				KINNEY
			(another pause)
		...I realize this sounds banal -
		but there is no information of
		any sort on Gardiner.  We have
		no material on him - zilch...

	The room is quiet.

76	INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Chance is intrigued by the the surroundings as MORTON HULL
	guides him through the corridor.

				HULL
		Of course, Mr. Gardiner, your
		position in the financial
		community carries a lot of
		weight, but what caught Gary's
		attention was your down-to-
		earth philosophy.

				CHANCE
		I see.

	They walk a while through the corridor.

				HULL
			(making conversation)
		Do you realize that more people
		will be watching you tonight
		that all those who have seen
		theater plays in the last
		forty years?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  It's a very good show.

	Hull takes Chance into the makeup room.

77	EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

	AIR FORCE 1 taxies to the ground.

78	INT. AIR FORCE 1 - NIGHT

	The President sits on a couch in one of the compartments
	on the jet.  With him are six of his STAFF, Kaufman
	included.

				PRESIDENT
		What do you mean, no background?
		That's impossible, he's a very
		well known man!

				KAUFMAN
		Yes, sir - we are aware of all
		that, but still, we haven't been
		able to...

				PRESIDENT
			(interrupts)
		He's an advisor and close personal
		friend of Rand's!  For Christ
		sakes, they have volumes of data
		on Benjamin!

				KAUFMAN
		Yes, Mr. President, I plan on
		contacting Mr. Rand as soon as...

				PRESIDENT
			(again interrupts)
		I do not want Benjamin Rand
		disturbed!  You have other ways
		of gathering information than to
		trouble a dying man.  Use whatever
		agencies are necessary to put to-
		gether a detailed history of
		Chauncey Gardiner, if you run
		into problems, alert Honeycutt.
			(he stands)
		Have it in my office at seven
		in the morning.
			(he starts for door)
		I've got to take a leak.

				KAUFMAN
		Right, chief.

	As the President goes to the Men's Room, two of the aides
	reach for telephones.

79	INT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR/MAKEUP ROOM - NIGHT

	A PAGE comes through the corridor carrying a glass of
	water.  He turns into the makeup room to reveal Hull
	sitting next to Chance in front of the mirror.  The
	makeup man, COLSON, works on Chance as he watches the
	guest preceding him on a TV monitor that is reflected
	in the mirror.

				PAGE
			(gives Chance water)
		I thought you might need this
		about now, Mr. Gardiner.  It
		gets real hot under these lights.

				CHANCE
		Thank you.  I am very thirsty.

	The Page leans against the door jamb, smiles if anyone
	looks at him.

				HULL
			(briefing Chance)
		Now, if Gary wants to interrupt
		you, or ask you a question,
		he'll raise his left forefinger
		to his left eyebrow.

				CHANCE
			(to Colson)
		Nurse Teresa did Ben's makeup.

				COLSON
			(laughs)
		Oh?  Did she do a good job?

				CHANCE
		Yes, very good.

	On the TV, GARY BURNS finishes with his guest and the
	band goes into a hot instrumental number.

				COLSON
			(a last minute dab)
		Okay, Mr. Gardiner, looks like
		you're up.

	Hull leads Chance out of the makeup room.  Colson sits
	and watches the TV monitor.  The Page, his back to Colson,
	carefully picks up Chance's water glass so as not to smear
	the fingerprints, then leaves the room.  On the TV monitor,
	the band plays, the audience applauds as Burns introduces
	Chance.

80	INT. RAND LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

				BURNS (on TV)
		I always find it surprising, Mr.
		Gardiner, to find men like your-
		self, who work so intimately with
		the President, yet manage to remain
		relatively unknown.

				CHANCE (on TV)
		Yes.  That is surprising.

				BURNS (on TV)
		...Well, your anonymity will be
		a thing of the past from now on.

				CHANCE (on TV)
			(doesn't understand)
		I hope so.

				BURNS (on TV)
			(a beat)
		Yes...of course.  Well, I assume,
		since the President quoted you, that
		you agree with his view of the
		economy.

				CHANCE (on TV)
		Which view?

	Applause and laughter from the TV audience.

81	INT. ALLENBY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Allenby watches, concerned as to which way it will go.

				BURNS (on TV)
			(a beat)
		Well, the President compared the
		economy of this country to a
		garden, and stated that after a
		period of decline a time of
		growth would naturally follow.

				CHANCE (on TV)
		Yes, I know the garden very well.
		I have worked in it all my life.
		It is a good garden and a healthy
		one;

82	INT. RAND'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Rand is in bed.  Eve sits in a chair next to the bed,
	squeezes Rand's hand in the excitement as they both watch
	Chance on television.  Teresa and Constance watch in
	the Background.

				CHANCE (on TV - cont'd)
		its tress are healthy and so are
		its shrubs and flowers, as long as
		they are trimmed and watered in the
		right seasons.  The garden needs
		a lot of care.  I do agree with
		the President; everything
		will grow strong, and there is
		plenty of room in it for new trees
		and new flowers of all kinds.

	The TV audience applauds Chance and Constance quietly
	leaves the room.

83	INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The President and First Lady are in bed together watching
	the show.

				BURNS (on TV)
		So you're saying, Mr. Gardiner,
		if the Stock Market collapses,
		and unemployment keeps increasing.
		that this is just another season,
		so to speak, in the garden?

	The First Lady cuddles up to the President.

84	INT. RAND LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

	Chance continues to watch himself.

				CHANCE (on TV)
		Yes.  In a garden, things grow - but
		first some things must wither; some
		trees lose their leaves before they
		grow new leaves...

85	INT. THOMAS FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Franklin, the attorney that evicted Chance, comes out of
	the bathroom brushing his teeth.  His wife, JOHANNA, is
	in the bed absorbed in the show.  Franklin sits on the end
	of the bed.

				CHANCE (on TV - cont'd)
		...And if you give your garden a
		lot of love, and if you work very
		hard and have a lot of patience,
		in the proper season you will see
		it grow to be very beautiful...

	More applause from the TV.  Franklin leans closer to
	the set.

				FRANKLIN
			(puzzled)
		It's that gardener!

				JOHANNA
		Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.

				FRANKLIN
		No!  He's a real gardener!

				JOHANNA
			(laughs)
		He does talk like on, but I
		think he's brilliant.

				BURNS (on TV)
		Well, that's very interesting,
		Mr. Gardiner, but, what about
		the bad seasons?

86	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Constance is in Chance's closet searching through his
	clothing.  Finding nothing, she checks the labels on
	his suits, copies them in a notepad.

				BURNS (Cont'd)
			(on TV)
		Such as prolonged droughts that
		have wiped out crops, disastrous
		winters, hurricanes?  Doesn't a
		country need to have someone in
		charge that can see it through
		such crises?  Don't we need a
		leader capable of guiding us
		through the bad seasons as well
		as the good?

				CHANCE
			(on TV)
		Yes.  We need a very good gardner.

	Constance continues her work in the closet.

87	INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROROM - NIGHT

	The President and First Lady are very attentive.

				BURNS
			(on TV)
		I realize this might be a difficult
		question for you, Mr. Gardiner -
		but there are a lot of us around
		the country that would like to hear
		your thoughts on the matter.

				CHANCE
			(on TV)
		I understand.

				BURNS
			(on TV)
		Do you feel that we have a 'very
		good gardener' in office at this
		time, Mr. Gardiner?

				PRESIDENT
		...That bastard...

				CHANCE
			(on TV)
		Oh, yes.  It is possible for one
		side of the garden to be flooded,
		and the other side to be dry...
		Some plants do well in the sun,
		and others grow better in the cool
		of the shade.

	The First Lady moves closer to the President.

88	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	A group of ELDERLY BLACK PEOPLE sit in the lobby, watching
	the show on an old black-and-white TV

				CHANCE (on TV - cont'd)
		..It is the gardner's responsibility
		to take water from the flooded area
		and run it to the area that is dry.
		It is also the gardner's responsi-
		bility not to plant a sun-loving flower
		in the shade of a high wall...

	During the preceding speech, Louise, the maid from the Old
	Man's house, chatters.

				LOUISE
		Gobbledegook!  All the time he
		talked gobbledegook!  An' it's
		for sure a White man's world in
		America, hell, I raised that boy
		since he was the size of a pissant
		an' I'll say right now he never
		learned to read an' write - no sir!
		Had no brains at all, was stuffed
		with rice puddin' between the ears!
		Short-changed by the Lord and dumb
		as a jackass an' look at him now!
		Yes, sir - all you gotta be is
		white in America an' you get whatever
		you want!  Just listen to that boy -
		gobbledegook!

	There is a chorus of "Amens" as she finishes.

89	INT. RAND LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

	Chance watches himself.

				CHANCE (on TV - cont'd)
		...It is the responsibility of
		the gardner to adjust to the bad
		seasons as well as enjoy the good
		ones.

	Chance changes channels to a Game Show.

90	INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The President and First Lady still watch Chance.

				CHANCE (on TV - cont'd)
		If the gardner does his job,
		everything will be fine.

				PRESIDENT
		Oh, Jesus...

	Audience applause is heard on TV.

				BURNS (on TV)
		Before we take a break...
		What sort of gardner would
		you be?

				CHANCE (on TV)
			(with confidence)
		I am a very serious gardner.

				BURNS (on TV)
		I'm sure you are, Mr. Gardiner.
			(looks at camera)
		We'll be right back.

	As a commercial comes on, the President rolls over in bed.
	The First Lady reaches out, puts a comforting hand on his
	shoulder.

91	INT. RAND'S ROOM - NIGHT

	The commercial is on TV.

				RAND
		He's a remarkable man, remarkable...
			(to Eve)
		You're fond of him too, aren't
		you, Eve?

				EVE
			(a beat)
		...Yes, I am, Ben.

				RAND
		That's good... that's good.

	Rand looks up as Constance comes back into the room.

				RAND
		Constance!  Where have you been?
		You missed the whole show - Chauncey
		was wonderful.

92	INT. FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Franklin shuts off the commercial on TV, is talking on
	the phone.

				FRANKLIN
		Okay, Sally, I'll see you in
		twenty minutes.

	Franklin hangs up the phone, scurries around getting
	dressed.  His wife, Johanna, sits grimly in bed.

				FRANKLIN
			(notices her look)
		I won't be long, I've just got
		to talk to her about this Gardiner...

				JOHANNA
			(turns over in bed)
		Good night.

				FRANKLIN
		Look, Johanna...

				JOHANNA
			(cuts him off)
		I said good night!

	Franklin gives up, hurries from the room.

93	EXT. RAND MANSION - NIGHT

	Some of the household staff are lined up applauding
	Chance as he steps from the limousine.  Perkins and
	Wilson come forward.

				WILSON
		Bravo, sir!  You were outstanding.
		Outstanding!

				PERKINS
		May I take your coat, Mr. Gardiner?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  Thank you, Perkins.

	Perkins nods, takes Chance's overcoat, allows everyone
	to enter the house.  Once alone, Perkins quickly searches
	through the coatpockets, finds nothing.

94	INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The First Lady is snuggled up close to the President,
	caresses his body.  After a moment, it becomes clear
	to her that he is not up to the occasion.

				FIRST LADY
		...Darling...  What's wrong?

				PRESIDENT
		...I can't... I just can't right
		now... I'm sorry, dearest... I
		just can't...

	The First Lady looks at him for a beat, then turns, lies
	on her back and stares at the ceiling.

95	INT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

	Rand is in his wheelchair, stripped to the waist.  Eve
	stands nearby.  Chance breathes deeply, enjoys the oxygen.
	Allenby and the nurses prepare four separate injections
	for Rand, which Allenby administers to him during the
	scene.

				RAND
			(with some effort)
		Senator Rowley's widow is hosting
		a reception tomorrow night honoring
		the Soviet Ambasador and I think
		it's rather obvious that Robert
		won't allow me to attend.  So,
		Chauncey, you would be doing me a
		great favor if you would escort
		Eve, and go in my place.

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I would like to escort Eve.

				RAND
		Good.  Together, the two of you
		should create quite a stir - I can
		already hear the gossip.

				EVE
		...Ben, really...

				RAND
		...You possess a great gift, Chauncey,
		of  being natural.  And that, my boy,
		is a rare talent - tonight on television,
		you were strong and brave and didn't
		moralize.  I hope the entire country
		was watching - the entire country.

	Allenby gives Rand the last injection.

96	INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT

	An 'in' meeting place for the upper-middle Washington,
	D.C. crowd.  Thomas Franklin and Sally Hayes sit at a
	table, drinks in front of them.

				FRANKLIN
		...It didn't make any sense to
		me at all.  I didn't know what
		the hell he was talking about...

				SALLY
		It wasn't meant for
		us, Tom - he was talking to the
		masses.  He was very clever,
		keeping it at a third grade
		level - that's what they under-
		stand...

				FRANKLIN
		Yeah?  Well, I don't understand why
		he was in Jennings' house?  What was
		up his sleeve when he pulled that stunt
		with us?  What was he doing?  And why?

				SALLY
		Who knows..?  Maybe the government
		had something to do with it.

				FRANKLIN
		You know, Sally - he made a
		fool out of me, ...and you know
		what that means, don't you?...
		It means that any political future
		I had is right down the toilet!

	The CAMERA begins to slowly move away from the table,
	the sound of Franklin's voice continues.

				FRANKLIN (cont'd)
		...Jesus, the thought of spending
		the rest of my life as an attorney,
		that is really a downer...  And,
		Christ, Sally, I almost forgot -
		Johanna is starting to think some-
		thing's going on between...

	Franklin's voice fades into the background hubbub.  The
	voice of Kinney, the research assistant from the WASHINGTON
	POST is heard as the camera settles on a table occupied
	by Sidney Courtney and his staff.

				KINNEY
		...Sid, be reasonable - I've been
		everywhere, there's no place left
		to check!

				COURTNEY
		Try again.

				KINNEY
		Sure, try again - where?  There's
		nothing, it's like Gardiner never
		existed!

				COURTNEY
		Try again.

				KINNEY
		It's useless!

				COURTNEY
			(coldly)
		I said - try again.

	Kinney stands, shoves her paperwork across the table.

				KINNEY
		Up yours, Sid.  You try again,
		I quit!

	Kinney takes her drink with her as she leaves the lounge.

97	INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

	The elevator door opens revealing Eve and Chance inside.

				EVE
			(as they come out)
		I'll bet you don't have a
		tuxedo with you, do you?

				CHANCE
		No, thank you.

				EVE
		...  Well, we can fix up one
		of Ben's for you tomorrow.
		Sophie insists on Black Tie.

				CHANCE
		I see.

	They walk in silence for a moment.  Eve stops, then
	Chance.

				EVE
			(softly)
		...I have very few friends,
		Chauncey... And Benjamin's
		friends are all quite a bit
		older...

	Eve gives Chance a long look, then kisses him on the
	lips.  She steps back, smiles.

				EVE
		...Good night, Chauncey.

				CHANCE
		Good night, Eve.

	Eve goes into her bedrom, closes the door.  Chance heads
	for his room as though nothing had happened.

98	INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE ANTE ROOM - MORNING

	Kaufman and the five other Aides nervously await the
	President's arrival.  The door opens, the President
	briskly enters.

				PRESIDENT
		Good morning, gentlemen.

				AIDES
			(as one)
		Good morning, sir.

	The President leads the way into the Oval Office.

99	INT. OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

	As the President goes to his desk, Kaufman hands him a
	folder.  The President sits, reads it quickly, it is
	very brief.

				PRESIDENT
			(to Kaufman)
		This is not what I requested.

				KAUFMAN
		No, sir.

				PRESIDENT
		This information goes back a day
		and a half!  I want the standard
		file, you know that.

				KAUFMAN
		Right, Chief.

				PRESIDENT
		So...?  Where the hell is it?

				KAUFMAN
		We...uh, have been unable to come
		up with any information before Mr.
		Gardiner appeared at the Rand's...
		and, uh...

				PRESIDENT
		What the hell are you talking
		about, Kaufman?

				KAUFMAN
		Well, we do have some data from the
		Bureau, but it isn't pertinent.

				PRESIDENT
		I'd like to hear that data
		Kaufman.

				KAUFMAN
		Yes, sir.

	Kaufman takes a clipboard from the man at his right.

				KAUFMAN
			(reading)
		...Suits hand-made by a tailor in
		Chicago in 1928.  The tailor went
		out of business in 1933, then took
		his own life.
		...His shoes were hand-made in
		1936.  The cobbler has long since
		been dead.  Underwear, all of the
		finest cloth, factory destroyed by
		fire in 1948.  The man carries no
		indentification; no wallet, no
		driver's license, no credit cards.
		...He carries one item along with
		him, a fine Swiss Patek-Phillipe watch,
		made in 1887, but there is no
		record of where or when it was
		purchased.
		...Computers have analyzed Gardiner's
		vocal characteristics; it is impos-
		sible to determine his ethnic back-
		ground, they feel his accent may be
		northeastern, but they will not
		commit to that.
		...Fingerprint check proved negative,
		no identification possible.
			(a pause)
		...That's it, Mr. President.

	The President stares at Kaufman for a beat, then speaks
	into his intercom.

				PRESIDENT
		Miss Davis - I'd like my eggs
		poached this morning, please.

100	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - MORNING

	Chance is in bed, a tray on his lap, eating breakfast.
	A pile of the morning's newspapers lie at the foot of
	the bed, untouched.  The TV is playing, Chance watches
	as he eats.  There is a knock at the door.

				CHANCE
			(without turning
			from TV)
		Come in!

	Eve enters, wearing a robe over her nightgown.

				EVE
		Chauncey!  Have you seen the
		papers?

				CHANCE
		No, Eve.  I don't read the
		papers.

				EVE
			(moving to bed)
		Well, it seems you've been
		described as one of the architects
		of the President's speech.  And
		your own comments from the television
		show are quoted side by side with
		the President's.

				CHANCE
		I like the President.  He is a
		very nice man.

				eve
			(sits on bed)
		I know...
			(a moment)
		...So are you, Chauncey...
			(another moment,
			Chance watches TV)
		...Do you mind my being here,
		like this?

				CHANCE
			(a bite of toast)
		No, Eve.  I like you to be here.

	Eve smiles, moves a little closer to Chance.

				EVE
		...You know, Chauncey... I
		want us to be...
			(with difficulty)
		I want us... You and I to
		become... close... I want us
		to become very close, you know...?

				CHANCE
		Yes, Eve.  I know that.

	Eve suddenly begins to cry, sobbing quietly at first,
	then losing control, the tears flowing freely.  To
	comfort her, Chance puts his arm around her shoulder,
	nearly tipping his breakfast tray.  Eve responds to
	his touch, draws closer, holds Chance tightly.  Chance
	does his best to avoid slipping his breakfast, keep an
	eye on the Tv, and to comfort Eve.  She begins to caress
	Chance, running her hand over his body.   She kisses him,
	his eyes, his neck, his lips, his ears.  Chance does not
	return the lovemaking, and Eve eventually catches hold of
	herself, stops.  She lies quietly beside Chance for a
	time, regains her demeanor, then speaks.

				EVE
		...I'm grateful to you, Chauncey...
		I would have opened to you with a
		touch, and you know that...
			(Chance, confused,
			turns to her)

				EVE (cont'd)
		...But you're so strong - I can
		trust myself with you...

				CHANCE
		Yes, Eve.  I'm very glad that
		you didn't open.

				EVE
		I know you are, Chauncey... And
		I appreciate why you've decided
		to wait...until...until...

	There is a long moment, then Eve rises, straightens her
	robe and moves toward the door.

				EVE
			(stopping by door)
		...I do love you, Chauncey.

	Eve leaves.  Chance eats his once-warm scrambled eggs and
	watches "Mr. Roger's Neighborhood" on TV.

101	INT. RAND MANSION - ALLENBY'S ROOM - DAY

	Allenby is at his desk, searching through the Washington,
	D. C. telphone book.  He finds a number, dials.

				ALLENBY
			(into phone)
		Mr. Thomas Franklin, please.
			(a wait)
		Is Thomas Franklin in?
			(a beat)
		Yes, this is Dr. Robert Allenby,
		would you please tell Mr. Franklin
		that I would like to talk to him?
		It concerns Chauncey Gardiner.

102	INT. RAND'S ROOM - DUSK

	Rand is in bed, very still, deep in thought.  Teresa and
	Constance work in the background.

103	 EXT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT

	Chance wears Ben's tuxedo and Eve is done to the teeth
	as they emerge from the limousine and are met by the
	press: a couple of reporters, 5 photographers and a
	mini-cam crew from a local TV station.

				REPORTER #1
		Mr. Gardiner, what did you
		think of the Posts' editorial
		on the President's speech?

				CHANCE
			(smiling for photogs)
		I didn't read it.

				REPORTER #2
		But sir - you must have at least
		glanced at it.

				CHANCE
		No.  I did not glance at it.

				REPORTER #3
		Mr. Gardiner, the New York Times
		spoke of your 'Peculiar brand of
		optimism,' what was your reaction
		to that?

				CHANCE
			(continues to pose
			for pictures)
		I did not read that either.

				REPORTER #3
		Well, how do you feel about that
		phrase, 'Peculiar brand of
		optimism?'

				CHANCE
		I do not know what it means.

				REPORTER #2
		Sorry to persist, sir, but it
		would be of great interest to
		me to know what newspapers you
		do read.

				CHANCE
		I do not read any newspapers.
		I watch TV.

	There is a moment of silence as the reporters digest this.
	The TV Reporter smiles, questions Chance.

				TV REPORTER
		...Do you mean, Mr. Gardiner, that
		you find television's coverage of the
		news superior to that of the news-
		papers?

				CHANCE
			(flatly)
		I like to watch TV.

				TV REPORTER
		Thank you, Mr. Gardiner.

				CHANCE
			(thinks the interview
			is over)
		You're welcome.

	Chance turns and goes toward the house, Eve follows.
	the TV Reporter turns to the TV camera.

				TV REPORTER
		Well, that is probably the most
		honest admission to come from a
		public figure in years.  Few
		men in public life have the
		courage not to read newspapers.
		None, that this reporter has met,
		have the guts to admit it.

104	INT. SOPHIE'S - EVENING

	Chance and Eve move through the hallway toward the Living
	Room.

				EVE
		I've never seen anyone handle
		the press the way you do,
		Chauncey - you're so cool and
		detatched.

				CHANCE
		Thank you, Eve.

	They move on to reveal the Black Tie Reception in progress,
	crowded with Ambassadors and other such dignitaries.
	SOPHIE ROWLEY, the hostess, comes rushing toward to greet
	them.

105	INT. WASHINGTON, D.C. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT

	The same lounge as before.  Sidney Courtney sits at the
	same table as earlier, only this time with the editor
	of the Washington Post, LYMAN STUART.  Courtney puffs
	on his pipe as he speaks.

				COURTNEY
		...It's strictly rumor at this
		stage, Lyman - just something
		in the wind...

				STUART
		Something rather big in the
		wind, I'd say.  So whose files
		were destroyed?  The CIA's or
		the FBI's?

				COURTNEY
		I don't know.  But we should
		start nosing around, see if we
		can talk to some people...

	The CAMERA begins to slowly MOVE AWAY from their table.

				STUART
		What is it about his past they
		are trying to cover up?
			(his volume fades)
		...A criminal record?  A
		membership in a subversive
		organization?  Homosexual,
		perhaps?

	The SOUND of Stuart's voice dissolves into Thomas
	Franklin's as the CAMERA SETTLES on Dr. Allenby and
	Franklin sitting at a table nearby.

				FRANKLIN
		...And he told us that he had been
		living there since he was a child,
		working as a gardener.  He showed
		us a room in the garage, where he
		said he stayed, and I... Well, I
		didn't really believe him, of
		course - but why the act?  He
		must have been involved on some
		major financial level with the
		deceased...
			(catches himself)
		Mr. Jennings, but our firm has
		no record of any such transactions.

				ALLENBY
		Hmmm.  You say he showed you
		his garden?

				FRANKLIN
		Well, he said it was his, he
		walked us through it.

				ALLENBY
		I see.
			(leans close to
			Franklin)
		Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and
		Miss Hayes to keep this incident
		with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves.
		There's no telling what he was
		involved in, and the matter may
		be extremely confidential.  So
		please, not a word.

				FRANKLIN
		Of course, Doctor, I understand.

				ALLENBY
		Fine.  Thank you, Mr. Franklin.

				FRANKLIN
		Certainly, glad to be of help.

	Allenby rises, leaves the bar.

106	INT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT

	Sophie pulls Eve and Chance to AMBASSADOR SKRAPINOV and
	his WIFE.  As they arrive, Eve steps in front of Sophie and
	makes the introduction.

				EVE
		Mr. Chauncey Gardiner, let me
		introduce you to the guest of
		honor, His Excellency Vladimar
		Skrapinov, Ambassador of the
		Soviet Union.

	Chance warmly shakes Skrapinov's hand with both of his own.

				CHANCE
			(stumbles over name)
		Hello... His... His...

				SKRAPINOV
		Delighted, Mr. Gardiner...
			(a nod to Eve)
		Mrs. Rand, delighted.

				SOPHIE
		And this is Mrs. Skrapinov.

	Chance smiles at Mrs. Skrapinov as The Ambassador puts
	am arm around him.

				SKRAPINOV
			(to Chance and Eve)
		You must sit with us, my
		friends, we have much to
		discuss.

				CHANCE
		I agree.

				SOPHIE
			(tugs at Eve)
		Come, Eve, let's let the men
		talk.
			(to Chance and
			Skrapinov)
		Would you two excuse us for
		a moment?

				SKRAPINOV
		Regretfully - we shall yield the
		pleasure of your company to
		others.

				CHANCE
		Yes, Eve.  I shall yield, too.

				EVE
		Fine.  You two have a nice chat.

	Skrapinov leads his wife and Chance to their table as Eve
	and Sophie move through the crowd.

				EVE
			(with self-importance)
		You see?  Didn't I tell you?

				SOPHIE
		Oh, I'm so glad you brought him,
		it makes everything perfect.
			(looks back at Chance)
		He's very, very sexy - don't let
		me alone with him for too long...

	A smiling Senator Jensen comes out of the crowd.

				SENATOR JENSEN

		Mrs. Rand!  How good to see you!

				EVE
		Well, Senator Jensen.

				SENATOR JENSEN
		I certainly would like to meet
		Mr. Gardiner.

				EVE
		I'm sure you would.

	Eve turns away, Sophie follows.

	As they are met by the Senator, we CUT.

107	INT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT

	Chance is seated between Ambassador Skrapinov and his
	wife at their table.

				SKRAPINOV
			(moves chair close
			to Chance)
		Considering the gravity of your
		economic situation, Mr. Gardiner,
		shouldn't we, the diplomats, and
		you, the businessmen - get together
		more often to exchange our thoughts?
		What does a Russian know about
		business?  On the other hand,
		what does an American know about
		diplomacy?  So why not a coming
		together?  An interchange of
		opinion?  We may find, my friend,
		that we are not so far from each
		other, not so far!

				CHANCE
			(an engaging smile)
		We are not so far...
			(motions at nearness
			of their chairs)
		...our chairs almost touch.

				SKRAPINOV
			(laughs)
		Bravo!  Bravo!  Our chairs are
		indeed almost touching!  And
		we want to remain seated on
		them, correct?  We don't want
		them snatched from under us,
		am I right?  Because if one
		goes, the other goes, and then -
		boom!  Boom!  And Boom, Boom!
		And we are both down before our
		time, you see?  And neither of
		us wants that, do you agree?

				CHANCE
		I certainly do.

				SKRAPINOV
		Yes.  Tell me, Mr. Gardiner -
		do you by any chance enjoy
		Krylov's fables?  I ask this
		because there is something...
		there is something Krylovian
		about you.

				CHANCE
		Do you think so?  Do you
		think so?

				SKRAPINOV
		So you know Krylov!

	Skrapinov pauses, then leans close to Chance, speaks
	softly in Russian.  Chance, having never heard this
	language, raises his eyebrows and laughs.  Mrs. Skrapinov
	remains impassive.

				SKRAPINOV
			(amazed)
		So you know your Krylov in
		Russian, do you?  Mr. Gardiner,
		I must confess I had suspected
		as much all along.

				CHANCE
			(beat)
		Would you tell me your name
		again, please?

				SKRAPINOV
			(slaps Chance on
			the back)
		Ho!  Ho!  A dash of American
		humor!  Vladimar Skrapinov!

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I like that name very
		much.

				SKRAPINOV
		And yours, sir - Chauncey
		Gardiner!
			(in Russian)
		How poetic!  Chauncey, a name
		of uncertain meaning!  And
		Gardiner, a bit of French,
		a suggestion of a stroll through
		the flowers!  A beautiful name,
		my friend!

108	INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A light from the adjoining bathroom filters into the
	darkened bedroom.  The President and the First Lady
	are in bed.  They each lie on their backs, a distance
	apart and are silent.

				FIRST LADY
			(after some time)
		...Maybe you should talk to
		somebody, darling.

				PRESIDENT
		No, that won't do any good.

				FIRST LADY
			(another pause)
		...Is it me?  Is there something
		I've done?

				PRESIDENT
		Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not
		you...

				FIRST LADY
			(another pause)
		It's your damn job.  It never
		happened when you were a
		senator...

				PRESIDENT
		It's not that, I just...

	The inter-White House phone buzzes, the President reaches
	for it.

				PRESIDENT
			(into phone)
		Yeah, Kaufman - what is it?

				KAUFMAN'S VOICE
			(over phone)
		Chief, we have a break in the
		case.  Our man at the Washington
		Post says they are working on a
		story that either the CIA or the
		FBI destroyed Gardiner's files
		before anyone could get to them.

				PRESIDENT
		What?  Why?

				KAUFMAN'S VOICE
			(over phone)
		I can't say at this time -
		neither agency will admit to a
		thing.

				PRESIDENT
			(getting out of bed)
		Okay, get Honeycutt and Baldwin
		over here, I'll be right down.

	The President hangs up the phone as the First Lady stares
	at the ceiling.

109	INT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT

	Eve and Chance are talking.  AMBASSADOR GAUFRIDI of France
	edges toward them.

				EVE
		Chauncey, you had Ambassador
		Skrapinov eating out of your
		hand, and you never told me
		you spoke Russian.  That's
		incredible!

	Gaufridi joins in.

				GAUFRIDI
		It's extremely useful to speak
		Russian these days.  Are you
		proficient in other languages,
		Mr. Gardiner?

				EVE
		Mr. Gardiner is a modest man,
		Ambassador Gaufridi.  He
		doesn't advertise his acoomplish-
		ments, his knowledge is for
		himself.

	Chance smiles, then turns away to select an hors d'oeuvre,
	where he is approached by RONALD STIEGLER, a publisher.

				STIEGLER
		Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler,
		of Harvard Books.

				CHANCE
			(a two-handed
			handshake)
		Hello, Ronald.

				STIEGLER
		Mr. Gardiner, my editors and
		I have been wondering if you'd
		consider writing a book for us?
		Something on your political
		philosophy.  What do you say?

				CHANCE
		I can't write.

				STIEGLER
			(smiles)
		Of course, who can nowadays?  I
		have trouble writing a post card
		to my children!  Look, we could
		give you a six figure advance,
		provide you with the very best
		ghostwriters, research assistants,
		proof readers...

				CHANCE
		I can't read.

				STIEGLER
		Of course not!  No one has the
		time to read!  One glances at
		things, watches television...

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I like to watch.

				STIEGLER
		Sure you do!  No one reads!
		...Listen, book publishing isn't
		exactly a bed of roses these days...

				CHANCE
			(mild interest)
		What sort of bed is it?

110	INT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT

	KARPATOV, an aide, sits next to Skrapinov and his wife.

				SKRAPINOV

		I want to know everything about
		his relationship with Rand.  And
		found out the real reason the
		President has singled him out.
			(Karpatov takes
			notes)
		And I want this quote included in
		the TASS coverage...
		"Chauncy Gardiner, in an intimate
		discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov,
		noted that 'unless the leaders
		of the opposing political systems
		move the chairs on which they sit
		closer to each other, all of their
		seats will be pulled from under
		them by rapid social and political
		changes.'"

	Karpatov writes out the quote.

111	INT. SOPHIE'S - NIGHT

	Eve is with SENATOR SLIPSHOD, MRS. SLIPSHOD, and DENNIS
	WATSON of the State Department.

				SENATOR
		I heard that he speaks eight
		languages, and on top of every-
		thing else, holds a degree in
		medicine as well as law.  Isn't
		that true, Eve?

				EVE
		Well, I really don't know,
		Senator, but it wouldn't
		surprise me.

				MRS. SLIPSHOD
		He's very attractive.

				EVE
		Isn't he?

				DENNIS
		Yes... Very.

112	INT. RAND'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Allenby enters the room quietly and stands in the shadows
	watching Rand sitting up in bed with a large loose-leaf
	type book on his lap.  He has a dictaphone mike in one hand,
	with the other, he moves his finger down a page and stops.

				RAND
			(into mike)
		Sell all 750,000 shares of C.C.T.

	His finger continues down the page, does the same to two
	more pages before stopping again.

				RAND
			(into mike)
		...Let's see - just sell a
		million shares of Inland Oil.
			(takes a beat)
		Oh, and Mrs. Aubrey, have
		30,000 shares of Standard
		transferred into your name.
		That's for you.

				ALLENBY
			(steps out of
			shadows)
		...Ben.

				RAND
			(looks up)
		Robert... I was just cleaning
		up some loose ends - getting
		rid of some of the dead wood
		so Eve won't have to put up
		with it...

				ALLENBY
			(a beat)
		...Ben, I want to talk to you
		about Chauncey.

				RAND
			(smiles)
		Oh, yes - Chauncey - you know,
		Robert - there's something about
		him that I trust - he makes me
		feel good.  Since he's been
		around, the thought of dying
		has been much easier for me.

	Allenby is silent and thoughtful.

113	INT. SOPHIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Dennis Watson is a homosexual and is coming on strong
	to Chance.

				DENNIS
		...You're fascinating, Mr. Gardiner -
		I've never met anyone like you in
		Washington before.

				CHANCE
		Yes, I've been here all my life.

				DENNIS
		Really?  Well, where have you
		been all my life?
			(Chance smiles)
		Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, have you
		ever had sex with a man?

				CHANCE
			(a beat)
		No.  I don't think so.

				DENNIS
		We could go upstairs right now.

				CHANCE
		Do they have a TV upstairs?

				DENNIS
		A TV?  I'm sure they do.

				CHANCE
		I like to watch.

				DENNIS
		You like to waaaaaatch?  Well -
		you wait right here, I'll go get
		Warren.

	Dennis hurries off.  Eve appears, moves to Chance.

				EVE
		Let's get out of here, Chauncey -
		Let's go home...

	Eve takes Chance by the arm and they move off.

114	INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

	The President sits behind his desk in a bathrobe, his
	hair mussed.  Standing before him are GROVER HONEYCUTT,
	the Director of the FBI, and CLIFFORD BALDWIN, CIA Chief.
	Kaufman stands to one side.  All are red-eyed, tired,
	and frustrated.

				HONEYCUTT
		I never gave such a directive,
		Mr. President.

				BALDWIN
		Nor I, sir - it would be out
		of the question.

				PRESIDENT
		Gentlemen, I didn't call you
		here at such an hour to make
		accusations, I just want to
		explore the possibilities.
		Now, I have three questions:
		Is the man a foreign agent?
		Or, have we suddenly found
		that our methods of gathering
		data are grossly inefficient?
		Or, thirdly, have the man's
		files been destroyed?  Now,
		I'd like some answers.

				BALDWIN
		Gardiner is not a forign agent,
		there are now sixteen countries
		investigating the man.  We can
		rule that out.

				PRESIDENT
		Very well...  Can we rule out
		inefficiency?

	There is silence in the room.  A couple of looks, but
	silence.

				PRESIDNENT
		I see.  What about question
		three?  Is it possible to
		erase all traces of a man?

				HONEYCUTT
		Highly unlikely, sir... In
		fact, the boys around the Bureau
		feel that the only person capable
		of pulling it off would be an ex-
		F.B.I. man.

				BALDWIN
			(a look to Honeycutt)
		I don't think that's entirely
		true, Grover.

				PRESIDENT
			(to Baldwin)
		And what do the boys around
		Intelligence think?

				BALDWIN
		Well, Mr. President...  They
		don't know quite what to think.

	More silence, more looks.

115	INT. RAND LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

	Chance watches TV.  Eve sits beside him, her hand on his
	thigh.

				EVE
		I feel so close to you, so
		safe with you, Chauncey...
		and Benjamin understands that,
		dearest... He understands and
		accepts my feelings for you...

				CHANCE
		Yes.  Ben is very wise.

	Eve moves her hand up higher on Chance's thigh, there is
	no reaction.

116	INT. RAND MANSION - 3rd FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Eve and Chance stand close together in the hallway.

				EVE
		...It's difficult to say good
		night to you, Chauncey - it's
		very hard for me to leave you.

				CHANCE
		It's very hard for me, too, Eve.

				EVE
		...Oh.

	Flustered at the thought, Eve turns and leaves.  Chance watches
	her go, then moves off to his room.

117	INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Chance is propped up in bed, watches an old movie on tele-
	vision.  The hero gives his lady a passionate kiss and embrace.
	The scene seems to 'sink into' Chance's mind.  Suddenly, Eve,
	robe over her nightgown, comes into the room.

				EVE
		Oh, Chauncey - I just couldn't stand
		it any longer.

	She goes to the bed, takes Chance in her arms, starts to kiss
	him, when he abruptly takes Eve into his arms and kisses her
	full on the mouth.  Once done, Chance's attention returns to
	the television while Eve is in a frenzy of passion.  She
	holds him, kisses him, runs her hands over his body.
	Chance neither resists nor responds, he just watches
	television.  Suddenly Eve stops, lets her head fall on
	Chance's chest.

				EVE
		...You don't want me, Chauncey...
		You don't feel anything for me...
		Nothing at all...

	Chance, feeling her sadness, gently strokes her hair as he
	looks at TV.

				EVE
		...I just don't excite you...
		I don't know what you want.. I
		don't know what you like...

				CHANCE
		I like to watch.

				EVE
			(not understanding)
		To watch...?  To watch me...?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I like to watch.

				EVE
			(uncertain)
		...Is that all you want...?
			(a hesitation)
		...To watch me...?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  It's very good, Eve.

				EVE
		...But I've never done...
			(another hesitation)
		...You mean...?  When... When...
		When I do it?...  When I touch
		myself...?

	Eve slowly gets up from the bed, nervously paces the bed-
	room as Chance watches TV.  She makes a decision, moves
	to Chance, kisses him.

				EVE
			(getting aroused)
		Oh, Chauncey... I do love you so
		much.

	She steps back, slips off her robe.  She does not undress
	any further, instead, leans close to Chance.

				EVE
		One of those little things you
		don't know about me yet, darling -
		I'm a little shy.

	She smiles, drops to the floor.  Chance divides his attention
	between Eve and the TV, watching both with an equal detach-
	ment.  Eve becomes more and more involved with herself,
	finding immense pleasure with her own body.  Chance changes
	the channel with the remote control.  Eve reaches orgasm, her
	body shaking violently, then a delicate tremor.  Then she is
	still.  Chance turns off the TV with the remote, turns over
	in bed.

				CHANCE
		Good night, Eve.

	A low purr is heard from Eve.

118	INT. RAND'S ROOM - MORNING

	There is a feeling of urgency as Allenby and the nurses
	attend to Rand.

				ALLENBY
			(to nurses)
		Get set up for a transfusion
		right away.

				RAND
			(very weakly)
		...No more, Robert - no more
		needles...

				ALLENBY
		It's not good, Ben - I'm
		sure you can feel it.

				RAND
		I know, Robert... I know...

119	INT. RAND MANSION - PATIO - MORNING

	A light snow is falling.  Eve is in a fur coat, holds a
	steaming cup of coffee.  Chance stands near her next to
	the railing.  He reaches out, catches snowflakes as they
	fall.

				EVE
		...And I feel so free now,
		Chauncey.  I never felt so
		acknowledged by a man...
		Until I met you, I always
		had the feeling that I was
		just a vessel for a man,
		something that he could take
		hold of, pierce, and pollute.
		I was merely an aspect of
		somebody's lovemaking.  Do
		you know what I mean?

	Chance turns to her, says nothing, presses the cold snow-
	flakes to his face.

				EVE
		You uncoil my wants; desire
		flows within me, and when you
		watch me my passion dissolves
		it.  You set me free. I
		reveal myself to myself and I
		am drenched and purged.

	Teresa appears in the doorway.

				TERESA
		Mr. Gardiner.  Mr. Rand would
		like to see you.

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I would like to see Ben.

	Chance gives Eve a warm smile, then follows Teresa into
	the house.

120	INT. RAND'S ROOM - MORNING

	Allenby, with nothing more he can do to prolong Rand's
	life, stands close to him, grips his hand tightly.  Teresa
	shows Chance into the room and Allenby motions to the nurses
	to leave.  Chance, with a smile, goes to Rand's bedside.

				RAND
			(slowly)
		...Chauncey... Chauncey...

				CHANCE
		Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?

	Allenby winces.

				RAND
			(a weak smile)
		...I'm about to surrender the
		Horn of Plenty for the Horn
		of Gabriel, my boy...

				CHANCE
		I see.

				RAND
			(reaches out to him)
		Let me feel the strength in
		your hand, Chauncey... Let me
		feel your strength...
			(holds Chance's hand)
		Yes, that's good... I hope,
		Chauncey - I hope that you'll
		stay with Eve... Take care of
		her, watch over her, she's a
		delicate flower, Chauncey...

				CHANCE
			(smiling)
		A flower...

				RAND
		She cares for you and she needs
		your help, Chauncey... there's
		much to be looked after...

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I would like to do that.

				RAND
		...My associates, Chauncey - I've
		talked with them about you...
		They're eager to meet with you...
		very eager...
			(trails off)
		...Tell Eve..

	Rand slumps down, dead.  Allenby checks his pulse, turns
	to Chance.

				ALLENBY
		...He's gone, Chauncey.

				CHANCE
		Yes, Robert.  I have seen it
		before.  It happens to old
		people.

				ALLENBY
			(covers Rand's face)
		Yes, I suppose that's true.

	Chance reaches out, uncovers Rand's face, gently touches
	the man's forehead, feels the coldness.  Allenby eyes him
	as Chance stays with Rand for a moment, then replaces the
	sheet.

				CHANCE
			(turns to Allenby)
		Will you be leaving now, Robert?

				ALLENBY
		In a day or two, yes.

				CHANCE
		Eve is going to stay.  The house
		will not be closed.

				ALLENBY
			(a moment, a look)
		...You've become quite a close
		friend of Eve's - haven't you...
			(a beat)
		...Chance...?

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I love Eve very much.

				ALLENBY
		I see...
			(another beat)
		...And you really are a gardener,
		aren't you?

				CHANCE
			(brightens)
		Yes, Robert - I am.
			(a smile at Allenby)
		I'll got tell Eve about Ben now,
		Robert.

	Chance leaves the bedroom.  Allenby watches him go, then
	sits back in a chair, his head spinning.

121	EXT. RAND ESTATE - DAY

	Rand's funeral services are being held on a hill overlooking
	the mansion.  Six distinguished-looking men stand near Rand's
	casket, which is placed on a concrete block.  They are the
	PALLBEARERS.  The Rand mausoleum is fifty yards further up
	the hill, while the MOURNERS, all close friends and associates
	of Rand's, stand fifty yards down the hill from the pallbearers.
	Chance stands with Eve and Allenby.  The President of the
	United States is before the microphone, which feeds loudspeakers
	for the Rand servants lined up in front of the mansion.

				PRESIDENT
		...I know that Ben said keep it
		small and quiet... No eulogies,
		no fanfares... And I don't want
		to go against Ben's wishes.  But
		I thought it would be good, while
		our close friends carry Ben to
		his last resting place, to read
		from his quotes, which I'm sure
		will have special meaning to all
		of us who are gathered here today.

	With this, the Pallbearers pick up the casket and begin
	the chore of taking it to the mausoleum.  It is hard
	work.

				PRESIDENT
			(reading quotes)
		... 'I have no use for those on
		welfare, no patience whatsoever...
		But if I am to be honest with
		myself, I must admit that they
		have no use for me, either.'

		... 'I do not regret having
		political differences with men
		that I respect; I do regret,
		however, that our philosophies
		kept us apart.'

		... 'I was born into a position
		of extreme wealth, but I have
		spent many sleeples nights
		thinking about extreme poverty.'

	As the President speaks, Chance turns and walks away.  Eve
	and Allenby watch as he goes toward the trees surrounding
	the area.

				PRESIDENT
			(continues reading)
		... 'When I was a boy, I was told
		that the Lord fashioned us from
		his own image.  That's when I
		decided to manufacture mirrors.'

		... 'Life is a state of mind.'

	The Pallbearers are enroute, they are all breathing
	heavily.  JAMES DUDLEY, a powerful industrialist, speaks.

				DUDLEY
		Yes, I agree, Maxwell would be an
		excellent man for the job - but
		he's boring, he would never take
		an election.

	SEWELL NELSON, a corporation Chairman, speaks.

				NELSON
		Correct, the people of this
		country need to be awakened.

	PETER CALDWELL, another executive:

				CALDWELL
		What about Lawson?  He's
		charismatic, exciting...

				DUDLEY
		A bit too exciting, I'm afriad...
		Once they start bringing things
		up about his background.

	WEBB, Railroad money:

				WEBB
		Well, gentlemen.  Time is running
		out, we must come to a decision.

122	EXT. WOODS - DAY

	Chance, his umbrella under his arm, walks through the woods.
	He stops by a tree, brushes some snow from a branch, moves on.

123	EXT. RAND ESTATE - DAY

	The President is still reading Rand's quotes.

				PRESIDENT
			(reading)
		'The world parts with Rand, and
		Rand parts with the world:  A
		fair trade, don't you agree?
		Security, tranquility, a well-
		deserved rest:  All the aims I
		have pursued will soon be
		realized.'

	Eve is concerned about Chance, she turns to Allenby.

				EVE
			(quietly)
		I've got to find Chauncey.

	She leaves the funeral, heads toward the trees.

				PRESIDENT
			(reading)
		...'I do not know the feelings
		of being poor, and that is not
		to know the feelings of the
		majority of people in this
		world.  For a man in my position,
		that is inexcusable.

	The Pallbearers near the mausoleum, they are struggling.

				DUDLEY
		But what do we know of the man?
		Nothing!  We have no inkling of
		his past!

				NELSON
		Correct, and that is an asset.
		A man's past can cripple him,
		his background turns into a
		swamp and invites scrutiny.

				CALDWELL
		...Up to this time, he hasn't
		said anything that could be used
		against him.

				NELSON
		The response from his appearance
		on the 'Burns Show' was over-
		whelming; mail and telephone
		response was the highest they
		ever had, and it was ninety-five
		percent pro!

	CHARLIE BOB BENNET, a Texas oil millionaire;

				BENNET
		Well, I'm certainly open to the
		thought - it would be sheer
		lunacy to support the President
		for another term.

	LYMAN MURRAY, a banker;

				MURRAY
		Exactly.  That is why I agree
		with Ben's final wishes, and
		I firmly believe, gentlemen,
		if we want to retain the
		Presidency, that our one and
		onlt chance is Chauncey Gardiner!

124	EXT. WOODS - DAY

	Chance happens on a tree with a cracked limb, hanging to
	the ground.  He stops, inspects the break, runs his fingers
	along the split of the bark.  He looks to the ground, notices
	that an end of the limb has fallen on a seedling, bending it
	double.  Chance pulls the limb away, then kneels beside the
	seedling.  He removes an expensive pair of suede gloves, and,
	with gentle fingers, brushes the dirt and snow away from the
	seedling.  Chance glances up to the remaining limbs of the
	larger tree which could fall and threaten the emerging tree.
	He unflods his umbrella, places it over the seedling in a way
	to give it protection, yet still allow it to receive light
	from the winter sun.  Chance stands, and is putting his gloves
	on when Eve appears, running towards him.

				EVE
			(breathless)
		Chauncey!  Chauncey!

				CHANCE
			(looks)
		Hello, Eve.

				EVE
			(holds him)
		Oh, Chauncey, darling.  Where were
		you?  I've been looking for you.
		I was scared.

				CHANCE
		Yes.  I've been looking for you
		too, Eve.

	She hugs him one more time, then leads him back from whence she
	came.  The President can still be heard reading quotes.

				PRESIDENT'S VOICE
			(in the distance)
		I've lived a lot, trembled a lot,
		was surrounded by little men who
		forgot that we enter naked and
		exit naked and that no accountant
		can audit life in our favor.



				THE END
