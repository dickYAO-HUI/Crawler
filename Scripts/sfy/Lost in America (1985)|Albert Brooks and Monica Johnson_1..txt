1	EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Sold sign is posted in front of a house.  SHOT OF SIGN.

							CUT TO:

2	INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME NIGHT

The house is empty except for Bekins boxes which are
packed.  They are all over the rooms. The CAMERA
SLOWLY MOVES IN AND AROUND the boxes until we REACH
the bedroom.

3	INT. BEDROOM

The bed is the only piece of furniture left.  The CAM-
ERA STOPS.  In front of the bed is a small black-and-
white television.  In bed are DAVID and NANCY HOWARD.
Nancy is rolled over on her side.  David is lying on
his back with his eyes wide open.

		DAVID
	Nancy?  Nancy?

		NANCY
	What?

		DAVID
	Sleeping?

		NANCY
	Yes.

		DAVID
	Maybe we shouldn't move.

		NANCY
		(sitting up)
	Oh God.  What's the matter now?

		DAVID
	Nothing.  It's just time to ask
	these questions.

		NANCY
	No.  We've sold our house and
	bought another one.  These
	questions should have been
	asked before.

		DAVID
	Okay, fine.  I can't talk to
	you.  Good night.

David pretends like he's actually going to go to sleep.

		NANCY
		(in a monotone; obvi-
		ously she's had to
		say this many times
		before)
	Stop it.  You're nervous about
	tomorrow.  You'll get your
	promotion, don't worry. We'll
	move into our new house and we'll
	be happy, okay?

		DAVID
	Boy, you should hear yourself.
	The excitement in your voice
	just fills the room.

		NANCY
	Look, I'm tired.  Stop questioning.
	We made a wise decision.  Let's try
	and feel good about it, alright?

		DAVID
	Fine.

		NANCY
	Good night.

		DAVID
	Good night.

Nancy tries to go back to sleep.  David just lies
there.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	But why that house?

		NANCY
	What?

		DAVID
	I think it's too close to here.
	It's going to feel like the same
	place.  Maybe we really didn't
	think about this long enough.

		NANCY
	We thought about it forever.
	We wanted more space.  That
	house has more space.

		DAVID
	Yes, but the point of a house is
	not just space.  You can rent
	space.  Maybe we should've moved
	into a completely different
	neighborhood, a step up or
	something.  Maybe we should've
	gotten a house with a tennis
	court.

		NANCY
	Why?  We don't play tennis.

		DAVID
	Sure we don't play tennis.  We
	don't have a court.  When you
	have a court, you learn.

		NANCY
	Well, possibly some day, we'll
	have a court and then we can
	learn.

		DAVID
	Let me ask you one more question?
	Why did we let Bekins do all of
	our packing?

		NANCY
	What?

		DAVID
	Isn't that a waste of money?  We
	could've packed ourselves.  Maybe
	we were too irresponsible.

		NANCY
	I don't believe you.  One minute
	you want a tennis court, the next
	minute you're worried about Bekins
	packing a box?  My God.  Sometimes
	I wish we really were irresponsible.

		DAVID
	What does that mean?

		NANCY
	Nothing.  Look, get some sleep,
	okay?  You'll feel better.

		DAVID
	Don't assume how I'm feeling.
	What do you mean "nothing"?  If
	you're saying we should be more
	irresponsible, I imagine you mean
	we're too responsible?  Is that
	right?

		NANCY
	Well, sometimes I think that we
	are too controlled, yes.

		DAVID
	Oh, I see.  Well, tell me
	something?  How do you go out
	and buy a four-hundred-thousand-
	dollar house and let a moving
	company pack everything and get
	maids and servants and live the
	good life and not be controlled?

		NANCY
	What are you talking about?

		DAVID
	It doesn't matter what I'm
	talking about.

David gets up.  He takes his pillow with him.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	I'm going to sleep in the garage.

		NANCY
	Don't do that.

		DAVID
	Why not?  I'm responsible.  I
	should be guarding the car.

		NANCY
	You're insane.

		DAVID
		(yelling from
		the kitchen)
	You're right.  I am insane.  I
	am insane and I'm responsible.
	A very, very good combination.

We STAY in the bedroom with Nancy.  She lies there.
Her eyes are open.  She's staring straight ahead.  She
looks sad.  After a moment, David reappears at the door.

		DAVID
	I am not an animal.

		NANCY
	What?

		DAVID
	I am not an animal.  I will not
	sleep in the garage.

		NANCY
	Just come to bed.  Come on.

		DAVID
		(sitting down on
		the bed)
	I apologize, okay?  But don't
	call me names.

		NANCY
	What names?

		DAVID
	You know what names.  Calling me
	responsible is saying what?  That
	I'm closed up.  I'm old.  I'm
	stodgy.  That's not fair.  I
	don't like the way things are any
	more than anybody else does but
	what am I supposed to do?  I'm
	trying.  What about you?  You're
	as responsible as I am.  Personnel
	Director for a department store is
	not the most irresponsible job in
	the world.  Go hire anyone you
	want.  Think you'd be fired fast
	if you did that?  How much freedom
	do you have?  We're all in the
	same boat.  We're trying to make
	something of ourselves and it's
	hard.  Okay?

		NANCY
	You're very upset.  I'm sorry I
	used that word.

		DAVID
	No, I'm glad you used that word.
	It's honest but things are going
	to get better.  They're going to
	change.

		NANCY
	You always say that.

		DAVID
	Yes, but this time it's different.
	After tomorrow I'm no longer an
	employee, I'm a Vice President.
	I'll be my own boss.  I'll have
	a piece of the company.  You see
	what I mean?  I can be more
	irresponsible because I'll be in
	a position of responsibility.
	That makes sense, doesn't it?

		NANCY
	I don't know.  I guess it does.
	Good night.

		DAVID
	Okay, go to sleep.

Nancy and David both lie down, each facing the oppo-
site direction.  After a few seconds...

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	It does make sense and things
	will work out, don't you think
	so?

No answer.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Nancy?

No answer.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Asleep already?

No answer.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Maybe men are supposed to fall
	asleep last.  It could be a
	protective thing.

							CUT TO:

4	INT. BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING

David is brushing his teeth.  He stops for a minute
and looks in the mirror.  He starts talking, pretend-
ing the face he's seeing is the one of his boss.

		DAVID
	What can I say?  I'd be a liar if
	I tell you I'm surprised.  I do
	feel it's deserved but yes, I
	still am flattered... That's very
	nice.  Thank you... Oh, stop,
	please.  I've never been good
	at taking too many compliments
	at once... Well, I feel the
	same way about you.

Nancy walks in during this.  She watches him for a bit.

		NANCY
		(interrupting him)
	What are you doing?

		DAVID
		(caught off guard)
	Why?  Nothing.

		NANCY
	Who are you talking to?

		DAVID
	I'm not talking to anybody.
	What is it?

		NANCY
	I'm leaving now.  Mr. Taft will
	be there in twenty minutes.
	Please be on time.

		DAVID
	Wait a second.  I can't do this
	today.  I can't choose tiles.
	This is my big day.  Please?
	You do it.

		NANCY
	We're trying to do this together.
	I think it's important.

		DAVID
	I'm very nervous and it's your
	kitchen anyway.  You'll make
	the right choice.

		NANCY
	You're in the kitchen more than
	I am.

		DAVID
	But I'm not thinking about
	anything when I'm in the kitchen.
	I don't really care.

		NANCY
	We said we would make these
	decisions together.

		DAVID
	Come on.  It's just today.

		NANCY
		(exasperated, turn-
		ing around and
		leaving)
	Fine.

		DAVID
	Please don't be mad.

		NANCY
	I'm not mad.

After a moment, she comes back in.

		NANCY
		(continuing)
	Good luck.  You'll get it.  You
	deserve it.

Nancy exits.

		DAVID
	Thank you.  And I trust any
	decision you make.  You have
	great taste.

There's no answer.

		DAVID
		(continuing; call-
		ing after her)
	Really, you have great taste.
		(turns back around
		to the mirror)
	I'm sorry.  That was my wife...
	Yes, she has wonderful taste.
	She's going to choose the whole
	tile thing herself.  Originally,
	we were going to do it together
	but it's nice to be able to trust
	someone, don't you think?...
	Well, that's very nice.  I trust
	you, too.  Hey!... When our house
	is finished maybe you'd like to
	come over and play tennis... No,
	but we might put one in.

							CUT TO:


5	EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

We see David pulling into the garage.

							CUT TO:


6	INT. MAJOR ADVERTISING AGENCY - DAY

David is walking down the corridor towards his office.
He's saying "Hello"'s to various people.  He comes to
his own office.  There we see his secretary, SUSAN, on
the telephone.  Obviously, she's making a personal call
and she hangs up abnormally fast as soon as she sees
David.

		DAVID
	Morning.

		SUSAN
	Good morning.  Your meeting is
	in forty-five minutes.

		DAVID
	Oh my God.  What time is it now?

		SUSAN
	Ten-thirty.

		DAVID
	Okay.
		(thinking aloud)
	Ten-thirty, eleven, eleven-fifteen
	... okay.  Susan, don't let any
	calls in.  I don't want to be
	bothered.  I don't want to do any
	business.  I just want to prepare.

David walks into his office.  After a beat, he sticks
his head out.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Oh yes. Get me Valley Mercedes,
	will you?

							CUT TO:


7	INT. ROBINSON'S DEPARTMENT STORE

We FOLLOW Nancy as she's walking through the department
store.  She comes to her office.  Her office is on the
third floor in the corner with the other business offi-
ces.  Her friend, PATTY, who works with her, is in the
office next door.  All offices are separated by glass
partitions.  Nancy comes in and sits down.  Patty sees
her and enters.

		PATTY
	Hi.

Nancy looks up from her desk.

		NANCY
	Hi.

		PATTY
	Is it beautiful?

		NANCY
	What?

		PATTY
	The kitchen.  What does it look
	like?

		NANCY
		(half-heartedly)
	I chose an orange tile.

		PATTY
	Orange?

		NANCY
	A burnt orange.

		PATTY
	Sounds pretty.

		NANCY
	Patty, close the door.

Patty closes the door and sits down.

		PATTY
	What's the matter?

		NANCY
	I'm going to hate this house.

		PATTY
	What are you talking about?

		NANCY
	When the contractor left this
	morning, I was all alone there
	and I sat in the middle of the
	living room and I got so sad.  I
	got this preview of the next ten
	years, I just started shaking.

Patty just stares at her.  She knows that Nancy is
serious.

		NANCY
		(continuing)
	I'm so unhappy.  I don't like
	anything anymore.  I don't like
	my job.  I don't like my life.
	I don't like anything.  I feel
	dead.

		PATTY
	What do you mean?

		NANCY
	Nothing's changing.  I'm not
	growing.  David's not growing.
	We've just stopped.  Life is
	passing us by.

		PATTY
	Listen, you've had a tough week.
	With the moving and everything
	you're very tired.  When you get
	tired you feel bad.  Things seem
	worse.

		NANCY
	I'm not that tired.
	Do you know I've been hiring
	girls who are nineteen years
	old, who've already had more
	experience out of life than I
	have?

		PATTY
	You don't know that.  You
	can't tell what a person has
	experienced just by interviewing
	them.

		NANCY
	Okay.  Let's forget it.  I
	really haven't thought this
	through enough.  I don't want
	to discuss it now.  Let's get
	to work.

		PATTY
	No.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean
	to say the wrong thing.  Have
	you talked this over with
	David?

		NANCY
	Of course not.  That's the
	problem.  I can't talk anything
	over with him.  It's hopeless.

		PATTY
	Are you thinking of splitting
	up?

		NANCY
	Well, that's not my first choice
	but what's the alternative?  And
	I'm not blaming David.  I know
	he genuinely believes that being
	made Vice President is going to
	change things.  But he genuinely
	believed that every promotion
	would change things.  It never
	does.  Maybe for a few days, but
	that's it.  Then things are
	always the same.

		PATTY
	Well, this is vice president.
	Maybe this time it will change.

		NANCY
	And what if it won't?

		PATTY
	Then it won't.  Then you get
	divorced, I don't know.  Whatever
	you have to do.

		NANCY
	Oh, God.  Maybe it will.

		PATTY
	It will or it won't.

		NANCY
	Okay.  I'm starting to feel sick
	to my stomach.  Thanks for talking
	to me.  Let's just say maybe it
	will.

		PATTY
		(standing up)
	Good.  Because if it won't, it
	won't anyway so what can you do?

		NANCY
	We said we'd stop on "will."

		PATTY
	We did.  We've stopped.  It will.

Patty hesitantly backs out of Nancy's office.

		PATTY
		(continuing)
	It will.  It will work out.

Nancy stares straight ahead.  She looks very depressed.

							CUT TO:

8 	INT. DAVID'S OFFICE

He is writing at his desk talking on the telephone.
He's writing down figures.

		DAVID
	Oh, then tax, license, out-the-
	door, everything included, what
	are we talking about?... Thirty-
	six thousand, five hundred and
	twelve.  Jesus!  For a car... No,
	I know, a Mercedes.  It's still
	a car... Well, I don't care.  To
	me, if it has wheels, it's a car.
	But that's not the point.  Now,
	that's everything, right?  That's
	it?  You don't have to pay that
	money and then be told that there
	are options?  No extras, everything
	included... Come on! - For thirty-
	seven thousand, leather is extra?
	What kind of seats are in there?...
	What is Mercedes Leather?... So,
	why don't you just say vinyl?...
	Okay, thick vinyl, but it's still
	vinyl... Okay, these kind of
	semantic arguments are silly.

The BUZZER RINGS.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Just a moment.
		(presses the
		intercom)
	Yes?

		SUSAN
	It's eleven ten.

		DAVID
	Thank you.  Susan, I have another
	one of these Mercedes guys on the
	phone, he won't hang up.  Would
	you do something with him please?

David hangs up.  He stands and walks over to a small
mirror.  He straightens his tie, fixes his jacket and
carries on one more little conversation with himself
as the boss.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	What can I say?  I guess, thank
	you... Oh, no.  I can't take your
	office.  This is too nice.
	Where would you sit?... Well, you
	are a very generous man.

He smiles and exits his office.


9	INT. OUTER OFFICE

		SUSAN
		(still on the phone)
	No!  We will call you back.
		(she hangs up)
	What a strange job to be arrogant
	in.

		DAVID
	I know.

		SUSAN
	Good luck.  Don't worry, you've
	got it.

		DAVID
	Thanks, Susan.

We FOLLOW David as he rounds the corners of this large
building on the way to Paul Dunn's office.  With each step,
he is ready to accept this new responsibility.  He stops
at his boss's secretary, MARGARET, a woman in her older
forties, a true executive type.

		MARGARET
	Well, you look very nice.

		DAVID
	Thank you and so do you, Margaret.

		MARGARET
	Go on in.

		DAVID
	Thanks.

David enters.

							CUT TO:


10     INT.  PAUL DUNN'S OFFICE

PAUL DUNN is one of the heads of the advertising agency.
He certainly holds the top position on the West Coast.
His office is large.  It smells of success.  Obviously,
this is a man who has made a great deal of money and spent
it where people can see it.  As David enters, he sees
Paul sitting behind his desk and a baldheaded gentleman,
BRAD TOOLEY, seated on the couch. Brad Tooley is in his
early forties, very well-dressed in the upper Eastern
advertising establishment manner.  As David comes in,
Brad and Paul both get up.

		PAUL
		(his hand out-
		stretched)
	Hello, David.  How are you?

		DAVID
	I'm fine.  I'm excited.

		PAUL
	Me too.

		DAVID
	That's wonderful.

		PAUL
	David, I'd like you to meet Brad
	Tooley.

		DAVID
	Brad, it's a pleasure.

David and Brad shake hands.

		PAUL
	Brad has recently joined the agency
	in New York.  He was one of the best
	men at Doyle, Dane and Bernbach.
	We were lucky to get him.

		DAVID
	Well, that's exciting.

They all sit down again.  David doesn't know quite what
to make of the fact that Brad is in this meeting.  He
just assumes this is part of the ceremony of being made
vice president.

		PAUL
	David, I don't have to tell you
	what I think of you.  You know I
	feel you're one of the most
	creative people in this company.
	I was telling Brad earlier the
	accounts you've been responsible
	for.

		BRAD
	Very impressive.  The Knudsen
	Orange Juice campaign was one of
	the best I've ever seen.  Ever.

		DAVID
		(he smiles; he's
		in his glory)
	Well, thank you.

		PAUL
	Brad has joined this company for
	a very special reason.  David,
	we're going to get Ford.

David, now thinking of himself as the vice president,
realizes that Ford is an account of such proportion,
that the profit participation could be enormous.  His
eyes widen.

		DAVID
	Oh, my God!  That's wonderful!

		PAUL
	Well, it finally puts us at the
	top of the heap.

		DAVID
	I'm stunned.  When did this happen?

		PAUL
	Just in the last few days.  You're
	really the first to know out here.
	We didn't want to say anything until
	it was final.

		DAVID
	That's wonderful.  Just wonderful.
	God, what a week.  What a week for
	all of us.

		PAUL
	It certainly is.  Now, David...

		DAVID
		(interrupts)
	Paul, you don't have to say
	anything.  As the new vice president,
	I know what this means to the
	company.  I'm here twenty-four
	hours a day.

		PAUL
	David, you're too valuable to
	become vice president.  I'd like
	you to move to New York and work
	under Brad.  You two are going
	to be in charge of Ford.  You're
	going to have to hurry, though.
	You start in three weeks.

David is not quite sure what he's just heard.  He thinks
maybe he's heard a compliment.  He's heard a name of a
city, a car, some weeks, but he hasn't put it together.
He needs to hear it again.

		DAVID
	Wait a second.  You gave me too
	much information. I'm valuable
	and I'm vice president?

		PAUL
	No, David.  I've hired Paul
	Shubano as vice president.

		DAVID
	What?

		BRAD
	He's giving you quite a compliment,
	David.  I asked him for the best
	man he had and he didn't hesitate
	for a moment.

		DAVID
	He didn't?  Well, I don't want to
	move to New York.

		PAUL
	What?

		DAVID
	I want to be the vice president.
	I want to be a stockholder in this
	company.  It was promised to me.
	I don't mind working on Ford.
	Don't get me wrong.  I think it
	would be a joy to work on but I'll
	work on it as vice president.  I've
	been here eight years, Paul.  I
	don't want to be transferred to
	just another account.

		PAUL
	This is not "just another" account,
	David.

		BRAD
	It's Ford.

		DAVID
	Brad, I know it's Ford.  I've owned
	Fords, okay?  Now, Paul, I feel it's
	only fair to keep your promise.

		PAUL
	I didn't promise you anything.

		DAVID
	Wait a minute.  What about these
	lunches that we've been having
	for the last four years?  I believe
	we talked about grooming me for
	vice president.  Phil Shubano's
	been here only three years.  Why?

		PAUL
	Well, first of all, quite frankly,
	he's not as clever as you.  He's
	more of an executive type.

		DAVID
	Oh, great.  I think that's wonderful.
	So, by being extra clever, I get
	thrown out of the town that I live
	in, with no promotion, no nothing,
	and just shifted to another account.
	He, on the other hand, because of
	his low intelligence and short time
	with the company stays here, gets
	a large amount of stock and becomes
	vice president.  Well, that makes
	sense!

		PAUL
	You keep referring to this as
	"another account."   It's not.
	It's Ford.

		DAVID
	Why don't you stop saying that?
	You sound like Dinah Shore.  Now,
	damn it, look, this isn't fair.
		(stops for a minute;
		begins to laugh)
	Paul, if I'm working myself up and
	this is a joke, I'll kill you.
	Are they going to burst in here
	and say, "Surprise!"?  Goddamnit.
	You almost had me fooled!

		PAUL
	No one's bursting in here, David.
	I'm offering you something very big.

		DAVID
	No one's bursting in here?

		PAUL
	No.

		DAVID
	No?  Oh God.  But, wait a minute,
	I'm vice president, right?

		PAUL
	No.

		DAVID
	Yes!

		PAUL
	No.

		DAVID
	Stop saying no!  Just a minute.
	I can't go to New York.  This is
	my home.  My wife and I live here.
	I just bought a four-hundred
	thousand dollar house.  I'm
	picking tile out at this very
	moment.  What am I going to do?
	Burn it down?

		PAUL
	Don't worry about that, please?
	You won't lose a penny on the house.
	We'll take care of it.  I think
	Ford is more important than a
	single family dwelling, anyway.
	We'll get you more than you paid
	for it.    The important thing is
	that you and Brad get along.

		DAVID
	Me and Brad get along?  Are you
	crazy?
	I've worked here eight years, for
	what?  For me and Brad to get
	along?  I was born in this city.
	All my friends are here.  I like
	it.  We're joking, aren't we?
	This is a joke.

		PAUL
	What do you mean, a joke?

		DAVID
	What do you mean, a joke?

		PAUL
	I didn't say a joke.

		DAVID
	I'm going to New York City?

		PAUL
	I'd like you there in three weeks.

		DAVID
	Oh, you would?

		PAUL
	This can be a stepping stone to
	something bigger, David.

		DAVID
	What's bigger than being vice
	president?  That's all I want.
	Maybe I'm wrong, but I think I've
	already stepped on every stone
	we have here, haven't I?

		PAUL
	Well, someday you might be vice
	president.

		DAVID
	Someday?  What do you mean?  It's
	today.  I've got it!

		PAUL
	You don't have it.

		DAVID
	Who has it?

		PAUL
	David, I can't say this again.
	Phil Shubano.

		DAVID
	Well, obviously, I'm blocking this
	man's name, aren't I?

		BRAD
	David, I don't know all of your
	work, but I do know you've got to
	be the best here or you wouldn't
	be working with me on this account.

		DAVID
	Brad, shut up!  Don't talk!  This
	is my day.  Paul, look what you're
	doing.  I've been with this company
	a very, very long time.  I'm one of
	the oldest employees on this coast,
	aren't I?  Now, I must get what I
	deserve.  I will be made vice
	president and I will get the stock
	and I will participate in the
	ownership of the company and that's
	that.

		PAUL
	My God, I thought you'd be thrilled.

		DAVID
	You thought I'd be thrilled?  I
	can't believe it.  Why the hell
	don't you go to New York?  If it's
	so thrilling, come on, I'll take
	you to the airport.  I'll put you
	on a plane right now.

		PAUL
	Don't talk to me like that.  I
	came from New York.

		DAVID
	Yeah, that's right and you don't
	want to go back because as soon
	as you land at the airport,
	people steal everything you've got.

		BRAD
	I resent that.  That's a cliché.
	New York's the greatest city there
	is.

		DAVID
	Sit down.  Just sit down and shut
	up.

		PAUL
	David, that's enough.

		DAVID
	No.  I haven't even started yet.
	Now listen, let's say a giant
	mistake was made.  Pretend none of
	this was ever said.  I'm the vice
	president.  Everything will be
	fine.  I'll stay here.  I'll work
	on Ford.  I'll move into my new
	house.  You and Brad can come
	over for drinks.  And now, let's
	bring out Allen Funt and everybody
	will yell, "Surprise," right?
	I'm vice president, right?

		PAUL
	David, the position is filled.

		DAVID
	Well, then you can go fuck yourself!

		BRAD
		(gets up)
	Paul, I can't work with this man.

		PAUL
	I can't either.  David, you're fired.

		DAVID
	Fired!  How dare you?  I can't believe
	this!  You want to know something?
	I was nervous about coming in here
	today.  I said to my friends, "Maybe
	I won't get this."  You know what
	everyone of them said?  "Stop it.
	You're being stupid.  You're the
	best man.  There's no one else.
	You're the best man."  And what does
	the best man do?  He stands next to
	the groom and watches the groom
	become vice president!

		PAUL
	I can see you're upset.  I'll forget
	what you said earlier.  I don't think
	you want to jeopardize eight years
	with this company.

		DAVID
	Fuck you!

		PAUL
	That's it.  Get out.

		DAVID
	I wasted my youth for you and
	for what?  What do you mean
	jeopardize eight years?  What
	eight years?  All I did was live
	for the future.  Why didn't you
	tell me a long time ago that I
	was too clever?  You should have
	told me five years ago, then I
	could've gone somewhere else.

		PAUL
	I didn't know it five years ago.

		DAVID
	Don't say anything else.  I'll
	kill you.

		PAUL
		(presses a buzzer)
	Get me security, please.

		DAVID
	Oh, I can't believe it.  Security.
	Okay, listen to me.  I want my
	eight years back!  Give me my
	life back!  I want my eight years
	back!  Give them to me!

Paul stares at him.  Brad gets up.

		BRAD
	I'm going back to the hotel.  David,
	you're making a big mistake.

		DAVID
	You don't even know me, you
	baldheaded fart!

Brad stares at him and then walks out.  He turns back to
Paul.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	I can't believe that I almost
	wasted my entire life here!
	I've been waiting very, very
	patiently and I realize now what
	would've happened.  This would've
	gone on for years and years and
	years and when I was seventy, I
	would've gotten a watch.  Actually
	you wouldn't even have given me a
	watch.  You would've told me I was
	too clever, that I would instinctively
	know the time.  You know something,
	Paul?  I made fun of my friends who
	dropped out of college and went to
	"find themselves."  I told them they
	were stupid.  I laughed at them.
	And what did I do?  I went with
	you.  Good choice, wasn't it?  What
	did I get for doing that?  A transfer.
	I could've gotten that from a bus.
	You're a human bus, Jesus Christ!
	You liar!  I don't know where those
	drop-outs are today, but I've got
	to find them!  I owe them a big
	apology.  'Cause let me tell you
	something.  They have more integrity
	on their little tab of acid than
	you have in your entire body, you
	big fucking jerk!

A security guard enters.

		PAUL
		(stands up)
	Would you escort Mr. Howard out,
	please?

		DAVID
	He doesn't have to escort me out.
	I'm honored to leave.

David opens the office door.  He begins to yell so
everyone can hear him.  This is reminiscent of the
scene from "Network."

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Before I leave, I think it's very
	important for everyone in this
	company to know what went on in
	here today.
	I don't know how many lunches you've
	all had with that man and I don't
	know what he's said over salad or
	dessert or whatever he buys you,
	but you better not believe it!
	He's a real smoothie!  He'll tell
	you about the stepping stones!
	That's his favorite expression.
	He'll tell you about the stepping
	stones and where they lead.  Well,
	I found out where they lead!  To
	a baldheaded fat man in New York!
	Get out!  Get out now!  Smell the
	roses!  Smell anything!  Just smell!
	Smell before it's too late!!

The office is applauding wildly.  We HOLD on them for
a second.

11	BEVERLY HILLS ROBINSON'S DEPT.  STORE - DAY

David's car enters the parking lot at high speed.  The
car screeches to a halt.  He jumps out.

							CUT TO:


12	INT.  ROBINSON'S MAIN FLOOR

David walks hurriedly towards the elevators oblivious
to the others.

							CUT TO:


13	INT. J.W. ROBINSON'S - DAY

David is walking towards the personnel office.  We've
never seen him like this before.  He's alive.  He's got
more than bounce in his step.  It's as if he weighs 12
pounds.  He's on another planet.  He's smiling at every-
body.  He has the look of a "Re-born."  As he enters
the personnel department, he sees Nancy in her office.
Because Nancy's office is separated from the others by
a thin piece of glass, if you speak too loudly everyone
can hear.  David is not about to lower his voice.  He
has no concept anymore of volume.  He's just too excited.
David bursts in.

		DAVID
	Nancy!

Nancy looks up.

		NANCY
	God, you scared me.

		DAVID
	Nancy, come here.
		(he pulls her up
		by her shoulders)
	Quit.  Quit, right now.  We're
	getting out.

		NANCY
	What?

		DAVID
	Now.  Quit.

		NANCY
	Quit?

		DAVID
	Now.  Come on. I did.  Now, you
	do it.

		NANCY
	You did? You quit your job?

		DAVID
	Surprised, aren't you?  You wouldn't
	have believed me.  You would've loved
	it.  No more me.  No more waiting.
	No more responsible David.  Jesus,
	they were leading me down a dead-end
	street!  I've been on the wrong road.
	I realize what you meant.  I've been
	too responsible.  So responsible, God!
	I've been responsibly blind!

		NANCY
	I never would've used the word
	responsible if I thought you would
	have taken it so literally.  It was
	just a word.  I really didn't mean
	anything by it.

		DAVID
	Stop.  Don't do this.  Don't.  I'm
	giving you the credit.  You did mean
	it and you were right.
	I don't know where the hell I've
	been for the last ten years.  What
	happened to me?  I lost the feeling
	of life.  Jesus, I was being jacked
	off.  Nancy, they were just jacking
	me off!

David's voice is a bit loud.  We can see people look from
other offices.

		NANCY
	Honey, shh.
		(whispering)
	A little lower, please?

		DAVID
		(whispering)
	Okay. They were jacking me off.
		(his voice starts
		to rise again)
	They were leading me down this road.
	You know, this road?

		NANCY
	What road?

		DAVID
	The road to nowhere.  You know the
	road.  The Nowhere Road.  I was
	being tugged along with this carrot.
	"Come here.  Come here.  Come here."
	But no one told me it was a fucking
	cul-de-sac!  We've been on the
	wrong road.

		NANCY
	Who was made vice president?

		DAVID
		(laughing it off)
	Oh, Nancy, that's all over now.
	That's kid's stuff.
		(in a childlike voice)
	Vice President.  Class Secretary.
	Cloakroom Monitor.  Treasurer.
	They're all stupid.
		(regular voice)
	If you really want to know who
	it was, it was Phil Shubano.

		NANCY
	No!  Why?

		DAVID
	We'll never know.  The Lord works
	in mysterious ways, but if there
	is a God, you know what will happen
	to Phil?  He'll get his profit
	sharing and he'll buy a boat with it
	and he'll crash the boat and die.

		NANCY
	Stop it.  You like Phil.  You don't
	mean that.

		DAVID
	Of course I like him, the under-
	qualified son-of-a-bitch.  Okay,
	I was harsh.  He'll crash the boat.
	He'll have a serious injury but
	he'll recover.  But forget about
	Phil!  Forget about the vice
	presidency!  That's the past.
	Nancy, it's time to do it.  We're
	still young.  We can change courses.
	We can do what we should've done
	years ago, what our smart friends
	did.  We can get out there.  We
	can get out and see this country.
	We can find out what it's about.
	We can touch Indians.  We can live
	in the mountains.  We can do
	anything we want to do.  And we're
	still young enough to really
	explore.  So come on, let's go.
	We're late.  I'll wait here.  Go
	quit.  Come on.  We're leaving.

		NANCY
	I can't just quit right now.

		DAVID
		(looking at her with
		a lust we haven't
		seen before)
	Oh, God, I want to fuck you. Come
	on.  Let's fuck, right here.

Nancy is trying, without success, not to call anymore
attention to this particular discussion.

		NANCY
		(lowered voice)
	We can do it later.  There's a
	lot of people around now.

		DAVID
	There's always going to be people
	around.  That was the problem.
	We lived for them, not for us.  It's
	okay.  There are some people you
	want to fuck in front of and some
	people you don't.  Maybe you don't
	want to fuck in front of these
	people, I don't mind.  I'll be
	outside.  You quit.  I'll wait!

		NANCY
	I can't quit now, even if I want
	to.  There is no one I can quit to.
	My boss is not here.  We'll
	talk more about it tonight, please?

		DAVID
	Okay, but we're saved.  Honey, we're
	saved.  Somebody up there likes us.
	I don't know who it is, but we're
	going to find them.  We'll find
	everybody who likes us.  We'll start
	finding people who understand what
	life is all about.  We'll find people
	who are really searching.  We'll find
	people who are willing to take a
	chance.  Look, I'll just get all
	excited and get into it all again.
	You go and finish what you have to
	do and then I'll see you tonight.

David exits.  Nancy watches him go.  She's expressionless.
She doesn't quite know what to make of this.  You can
sense that part of her thinks that maybe her prayers were
answered, maybe this is how the marriage can be saved.
You can also sense that part of her isn't sure her husband
is sane.  Maybe this won't last more than an hour and you
can sense the last part of her is still embarrassed that
the other employees she works with have heard words like
"fuck" and "jacking off."  This is a woman of many parts.

14	INT. THE HOWARD'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

David and Nancy are sitting on the floor.
They're surrounded by various maps, atlases and cata-
logues that show different pieces of property around
the United States, property that most people forget
even exist.  These places look amazing in their little
pictures and, in fact, they might be amazing.  It's
just that almost no one ever gets there to see them for
real.  The longer Nancy has a chance to see what her
husband is saying, the more excited she becomes.

		NANCY
		(looking in one of
		the catalogues)
	Look at this.  This is the cutest
	farmhouse I've ever seen.  Twenty-
	four acres near Darien, Connecticut,
	five bedrooms, eighty thousand
	dollars?  How could that be?

		DAVID
	Because it's there.  It's not here.
	We're used to this city.  You know
	what our new house would cost, if
	it were where this farmhouse was?
	Not four hundred thousand, maybe
	sixty thousand if we were lucky.

Nancy is still looking at pages in the catalogue.  She
stops at one picture.  She is fascinated.

		NANCY
	My God.  Look at this.  A converted
	lighthouse in Maine, fifty-five
	thousand, two bedrooms, a living
	room, a kitchen, a playroom.  How
	do you put this into a lighthouse?

		DAVID
	Well, maybe you go to Maine and
	find out.  Or you don't.  You do
	anything you want.  Nancy, look
	at this...

He opens a piece of paper, showing her the arithmetic
he has worked on all afternoon.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	This seems to make sense to me.
	You tell me what you think.
	The one good thing about spending
	all this time in Los Angeles was
	that we got a free ride on this
	bullshit inflation train.  Don't
	ask me how it happened, but we made
	a hundred and ninety thousand dollar
	profit by staying in this house
	for less than five years.  Now,
	that was money we were never going
	to see 'cause we were about to put
	it back into another stupid house.
	Okay.  We pull out of that house,
	we lose our fifteen thousand dollars
	in Escrow, we take the money from
	this house, we liquidate everything
	else we have, cars, stocks, bonds,
	everything... Nancy, we have two
	hundred thousand dollars!

		NANCY
	We couldn't.

		DAVID
	We do.

David shows her the figures.  As Nancy looks at the piece
of paper, he continues:

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	All we need to buy is a motor
	home and we should get a great
	one because we might live there
	for the rest of our lives, or
	for five years or ten years or
	whatever.

		NANCY
	What do you think a motor home
	costs?

		DAVID
	Guess who went motor home shopping?
	We can get a great one for twenty-
	five thousand dollars.  If there's
	one thing you can get a deal on
	it's a motor home.  This is the best
	time in history to drop out.  It's
	a buyer's market!

		NANCY
	So that would leave us a hundred
	and seventy-five thousand dollars.
	I can't believe it!

		DAVID
	Yes!  On that kind of money we
	could ramble across the country
	for years!  We can paint, we can
	explore, we can meet amazing
	people.

		NANCY
	And if we get to Connecticut and
	we like one of these farmhouses,
	we'd have enough money to put a
	down payment on it, wouldn't we?

		DAVID
	Yes!  Then if we get sick of that
	we could sell it and move on.

		NANCY
	I'd like to go to Alaska.

		DAVID
	Great!  Alaska's great!  We can
	do anything we want.

		NANCY
	This is what we talked about when
	we were nineteen!

		DAVID
	Yes.  We talked about finding
	ourselves but we laughed it off
	because we had no money. Now
	we can do it in comfort. We've
	got our nest egg.  This is a
	dream come true.

Nancy has a tear in her eye. David sees it.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	What's wrong?  Are you okay?

		NANCY
	We really can do whatever we
	want to, can't we?

		DAVID
	Who's stopping us?

Nancy stares.  She thinks about that question.  She
can't come up with an answer.  Finally, almost in
tears.

		NANCY
	Nobody's stopping us!

15	INT. PETE HIRSCH'S HOME - NIGHT

PETE HIRSCH is one of David's former associates at the
agency.  He and his wife are throwing a party for
David and Nancy, a final farewell gathering.  There are
people milling about, talking, general good cheer.
David and Nancy are the heroes of the evening.  In the
corner of the room is a huge cake.  The CAMERA MOVES
ABOUT, PICKING UP various bits of conversation.

		PATTY
	You look very happy.  You look
	so good.  I'm happy for you.

		NANCY
	I know you are.

She gives Patty a hug.  An older, dignified-looking man,
JACK MARTIN and his wife, CAROL, approach Nancy.  Obvi-
ously, he's an executive at Robinson's.

		JACK MARTIN
	Well, well.

		NANCY
	I didn't know you were going to
	come.

		JACK MARTIN
		(he gives her a
		paternal hug)
	One employee we are certainly
	going to miss.

		CAROL
		(to Nancy)
	I think it sounds wonderful.

							CUT TO:

16	INT. OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM

A group of men are gathered around David.  One of
David's friends at work, JIM, is speaking:

		JIM
	You were great.  Man, it was great.
	It was like "Network" and "Take
	This Job and Shove It," all rolled
	into one.  When you left, we all
	wanted to go with you.  Really.
	People really had to think for a
	minute.   They were ready to leave.

		DAVID
	Did anyone else leave?

		JIM
	No.  I mean after a few minutes,
	people just went back to work,
	but for the moment, it was real
	exciting.

		DAVID
	Well, when the time's right, if
	people want to leave, they will.

		JIM
	Of course.  I believe that. I
	got to be honest with you, though.
	I was thinking about my situation
	and I don't think I have the guts.

		DAVID
	I don't know that it's guts.  It
	just takes a certain kind of person.

		JIM
	Yeah, maybe it has nothing to do
	with guts.  'Cause I think I have
	guts.  I guess I'm not that kind
	of person. Let's say that I like
	expensive things and I guess I
	need my job to get what I like.

		DAVID
	Whatever makes you happy.

		JIM
	Right.  I guess expensive things
	make me happy.  These shoes make
	me happy.  Do you like them?

He shows David his shoes.  They look very expensive.
For a moment, David forgets he will no longer partic-
ipate in this world.

		DAVID
	Beauties.  What are they?  Bally's?

		JIM
	A Bally copy.  Bally's would be
	three hundred bucks.  These were
	a hundred and eighty.  Can't tell
	the difference.  The sole's just
	as thick.  Look, feel the sole.

		DAVID
		(starts to touch the
		bottom of his shoe
		and then stops)
	No, I don't know where you've been,
	Jim.  I don't want to touch your
	shoe.  They're beautiful.  Good
	thick sole.

Nancy calls across the room to David.

		NANCY
	Honey?

David walks over and recognizes one of her bosses, Jack
Martin.

		DAVID
	Hello, Jack.  How are you?

		JACK
	Daniel Boone, as I live and
	breathe.  Dan, you know my wife,
	Carol.

		DAVID
		(shakes hands)
		Hi, Carol.

		JACK
	So, Mr. Boone, you leave in the
	morning, uh?

		DAVID
	Let's call me David from now on.
	Just for old times sake.

		JACK
	Oh, come on, I'm just playing with
	you.  Listen, I'll tell you
	something.  What you and your
	wife are doing, well, it's wonderful.
	Carol and I were driving over here
	tonight, and talking seriously
	about breaking the mold ourselves.

		DAVID
	Really?

		JACK
	You bet.  We haven't been that
	happy lately.  Have we, honey?

How can a person respond to this?  Carol just stares
at him.

		JACK
		(continuing)
	I told her, if I can get some time
	off, we're going to try to get down
	to La Costa for a weekend and just
	let it all out.

David now realizes that breaking the "mold" has many
different meanings to different people.

		DAVID
	La Costa?  For a whole weekend,
	huh?  That's great.

		JACK
	That's if I can get away.  If not,
	at least for an afternoon.  Just
	the idea of getting to San Diego,
	maybe take in Sea World.  Anyway,
	did Nancy tell you what Robinson's
	plans to do?

		DAVID
	Actually we haven't talked too much
	about American business lately.

		JACK
	Well, there is a rumor and I would
	appreciate you not telling anyone
	this, but our store may just be
	buying up the May Company.  This is
	just the kind of expansion that can
	make a man like me very, very
	wealthy.

		DAVID
	Well, if it's good for you, I'm
	real happy.

		JACK
	Well, let's just say it could make
	me a million dollars, minimum.  But,
	David, please keep this down.  God,
	I probably shouldn't have said
	anything.

		DAVID
	Jack, we're not going to be around
	people who will care.  I promise
	you.  I don't think a guide at
	the Grand Canyon knows or cares
	too much about the acquisition of
	a department store in L.A.

		JACK
	You want a surprise?  You want to
	know about the Grand Canyon and
	business?  The 7-Eleven at the
	Grand Canyon does more volume
	business per year than any other
	7-Eleven in the country, especially
	around Muscular Dystrophy time.

		DAVID
	Well, that's good to know.

		JACK
	I think it has something to do
	with the hiking and the tragedy
	of the children who can't hike.
	I don't know, but last year they
	did two million, eight-hundred
	thousand.  Now, of course, there
	are no other quickie stores around
	so they have a good one there.  A
	lot of people moving in and out
	of that canyon.  Have you seen
	these new U-Tote-M stores?

		DAVID
	Jack, I don't want to be rude but
	I can't talk business anymore.  I
	hate to sound "sixties" to you
	but I'm in a different place.

		JACK
	Hey, I understand.  I remember
	the sixties.
	As a matter of fact, the concept
	of U-Tote-M is a sixties concept.
	See, the 7-Eleven is a rush-rush
	place.  U-Tote-M is lay-back.  Their
	store in Tarzana this year is
	going to gross almost...

		DAVID
		(interrupts)
	Jack, please?

Pete Hirsch yells from across the room.

		PETE
	I'd like to make a toast.

People mumble, "Great."  "Good."  "It's about time."
Everybody gathers around.  People raise their glasses
up.

		PETE
		(continuing)
	To our beautiful friends, David
	and Nancy Howard... Good luck!

He drinks.

		DAVID
	That's it, huh?  What a well thought
	out toast.  Thank you, Pete.

People laugh.  Scattered laughter around the room.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Well, I think it's time for me
	to say something right now.

We hear a little applause.  "Speech!  Speech!"

		DAVID
		(continuing; calling
		Nancy over)
	Sweetheart, would you come here?

David and Nancy stand together, arm-in-arm.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	I have a surprise for my wife and
	I would like to share it, not only
	with her, but with you, who we
	consider our closest friends.  We
	do have some other close friends.
	I'm sure they got lost.

People laugh.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	When Nancy and I were married we
	had dreams and plans and I guess
	in the pursuit of those things,
	we kind of lost each other.
	Tomorrow morning, when we leave
	here, we have no destination.
	Our only goal is to find out who
	we really are and what it is that's
	really out there.  We're going to
	be adventurers in the classic sense
	of the word, but there is one place
	that we will stop at first.
		(reaches into his
		pocket and takes
		out a little box)
	That place is Las Vegas, Nevada.

		NANCY
		(her eyes open up
		wide; excited)
	Las Vegas?  Really?

		DAVID
	Well, if this is to be a new
	beginning, I think there's only
	one way to really show it to this
	woman that I love.  So, tomorrow
	evening my wife and I are going
	to be remarried.

People applaud.  Nancy is overwhelmed.  She opens the
little box and there is a ruby ring.

		NANCY
	Oh, my God!  Oh!  My!

People are trying to get a glance at the ring.  We can
hear OOHING and AAHING.

		NANCY
		(continuing)
	This is the most beautiful thing
	you've ever done.

		DAVID
	Well, I'd like to say it was
	nothing, but that small little
	ruby cost a fortune.

People laugh.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	That's okay, it's budgeted for.

A little laughter again.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	And now, I would like to propose
	a toast.

Everyone raises their glasses.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	To you, our loyal friends, we will
	miss you.  To my lovely new bride,
	I want to know you all over again...
	And to America, get ready.  Here
	we come!

Everybody drinks.  As they do we...

17	EXT. SAN BERNARDINO FREEWAY - NEXT DAY

We hear MUSIC (possibly the song from "Easy Rider" when
Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda left L.A. on their motor-
cycles).  This is the first time we see the motor home.
No expense was spared on this.  It's seventy feet long.
From the outside, you can see a roof that doubles as a
little patio where you can sun yourself.  The windows
are huge.  It looks luxurious, even from a distance.

							CUT TO:


18	INT. MOTOR HOME

David is driving.  Nancy is in the back in the kitchen
area.

		DAVID
	Honey, we're two minutes from
	crossing the city limits.  Come
	up front.  This is historic.

		NANCY
		(from the rear
		of the trailer)
	Just a second!  This microwave
	oven browns, did you know that?
	The one in our new house couldn't
	even do that.

		DAVID
	Our new house?  No, some poor
	sucker's new house.  This is our
	new house and I love it.

Nancy walks up towards the front with two melted cheese
sandwiches.  No matter how horrible the sandwiches looked
or tasted, to David, it would be great.  That's his new
attitude.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Boy, does this smell good.  How
	long did it take to melt this?

		NANCY
	Twenty seconds.

		DAVID
	Can you believe it?  Boy!  I
	never really tasted melted cheese
	on toast before.  I must have
	eaten it a million times, but
	this is the first time I've really
	tasted it. It's good and I bet
	it gets better the further we
	get from L.A.

		NANCY
	We'll actually be breathing clean
	air.  We haven't done that for --
	how many years?

		DAVID
	Forever. I hope we can recognize
	it.

Nancy smiles.  This is certainly the best mood she's
been in for a long time.

		NANCY
	Last night was so nice, don't you
	think?  Those are good people.
	We had good friends there.

		DAVID
	I know.  It's just that we weren't
	good friends there.

		NANCY
	Every once in a while I can't
	believe what we're doing.  Are
	you scared?  Be honest.

		DAVID
	No, not at all.   Well, let's say
	I'm scared in the same way
	Columbus was scared.

		NANCY
	Columbus must have really been
	scared, huh?  That took a lot
	of guts, didn't it?  What if
	the world was flat?  They really
	didn't know anything.

		DAVID
	Well, I think he covered himself.

		NANCY
	How?

		DAVID
	Oh, let's say there was the Pinta,
	the Nina and the Santa Maria.  I'd
	bet everything I have that Columbus
	was in the Santa Maria.  If the
	world was flat, I think he'd watch
	the Pinta and the Nina go.  Then
	he'd tell the Santa Maria to turn
	around.  He'd probably just go back
	and have sex with the Queen again.
	I don't think he was a complete
	schmuck.

		NANCY
	So, actually, we're braver than
	Columbus.  We don't have two motor
	homes in front of us.

		DAVID
	That's right.  However, we should
	keep our eye on that Buick ahead.
	If it falls off the earth, it
	would be wise to pull over and re-
	evaluate.

19	EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT TIME

The town is all lit up.  The motor home pulls up in
front of a 24-hour wedding chapel.  David stops.  He
stares at the chapel through the window.


20	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

		DAVID
	Doesn't it look beautiful?  I'm
	excited.
		(opens the door
		and starts to get out)
	Let me find out what we do. I'll
	get all the information.

		NANCY
	Wait a second.

		DAVID
	What?

		NANCY
	Aren't you tired?

		DAVID
	I'm excited.

		NANCY
	You know what we should do?  We
	should get married tomorrow.

		DAVID
	Why?  We should get married now
	and then drive out to the Grand
	Canyon and have our second
	honeymoon under the stars.  What
	could be better than that?

		NANCY
	Well, here's what I'd like to do.
	I'd like to get married in the
	morning.  We're trying to start
	a new life.  We should do it at
	the beginning of a new day.  We'll
	both be fresh.  We'll be up.  We
	can get married at the crack of
	dawn.

		DAVID
	That sounds nice.  Alright.  We'll
	camp out some place tonight and
	then come back before dawn.  As
	a matter-of-fact, these places will
	be less crowded then.  Good idea.
	Nancy, you're a genius.

He starts the engine.

		NANCY
	Are we sure we want to camp out
	tonight?

		DAVID
	What?

		NANCY
	Why don't we make tonight a real
	old-fashioned honeymoon?  Let's
	go to the best hotel and get
	the honeymoon suite and celebrate
	our heads off.

		DAVID
	Sweetheart, we don't want to stay
	in a Vegas hotel.  This is what
	we've left, this money-grabbing,
	horrible society.

		NANCY
	I agree, but one night?  We'll
	have room service and make love
	in a big bed and watch porno
	movies.  I think it'll be fun.

		DAVID
	We want to touch Indians.

		NANCY
	We will.  Just tonight and then
	that's it.
		Don't you want to take a bath
	together in one of those big
	tubs?

		DAVID
	Well, okay.

		NANCY
	If you really don't want to, we
	don't have to.  We can camp out.

		DAVID
	No, it's okay.  As a matter-of-fact,
	it might be very exciting.  We
	haven't been in a bath together
	for a long time.

21	EXT.  DESERT  INN - NIGHT

David pulls the motor home into the parking lot and
turns over the keys to the young parking attendant.


22	INT.  LOBBY OF DESERT INN

David and Nancy are coming through the main doors.
We can see the motor home being driven out of the drive-
way by one of the valet parking attendants. David
looks behind him and watches the home drive off.  He's
nervous.

		DAVID
	I don't think they know how to
	drive those things.  He could
	ruin it.

		NANCY
		(all excited)
	Oh, don't worry.  They can drive
	anything.  Look. Isn't this
	wonderful?  It's so romantic.
	God, I used to come here a lot.
	I kind of miss it.

		DAVID
	You never told me you came here.
	When?

		NANCY
	Before we were married.  I'll
	tell you about it later.  Come
	on.

They approach the front desk.  A CLERK is working at
one of the reservation computers.

		CLERK
	Excuse me?

		DAVID
	My wife and I have dropped out of
	society and we're making this
	statement, but we want to spend
	one last night here.  We're
	planning to get up at the crack
	of dawn and get remarried and...

		NANCY
		(interrupting David,
		she whispers to him)
	Just ask him for the room.

		DAVID
		(whispering back)
	I'm getting to it.  I know what
	I'm doing.
		(to the Clerk)
	Anyway, we're going to get up
	very early and get remarried
	so we want something very special
	because we're doing something
	special.  My point is, we'd
	like your finest bridal suite.

		CLERK
	Do you have a reservation?

		DAVID
	No, I told you, we just dropped
	out.  We don't do reservation
	things anymore.  We're living
	spontaneously.

		CLERK
	Well, we're not.  We thrive on
	reservations and I'm sorry but
	the bridal suite is occupied.

		DAVID
	What other rooms do you have?

		NANCY
		(to the Clerk)
	Just a minute, please?
		(she pulls David
		aside, whispering)
	The bridal suite isn't occupied.

		DAVID
	What?

		NANCY
	It's not occupied. I can see it
	in his face.

		DAVID
	What do you mean?

		NANCY
	Give him money.

		DAVID
	What?

		NANCY
	Give him fifty bucks.

		DAVID
	Why?

		NANCY
	We'll get the bridal suite.

		DAVID
	How do you know?

		NANCY
	Trust me.

David approaches the desk again.  He takes out fifty
dollars.  He puts it in the Clerk's hand, like he's
shaking hands with him.

		DAVID
	Hello, again.
		(slips him the
		fifty)
	Do me a favor?  I've worked with
	computers.  I know what can happen.
	Sometimes these things get fouled
	up.  Would you check one more
	time?
	Maybe the bridal suite was empty
	and the room next to it was occupied
	and the computer got mixed up.

		CLERK
		(takes a look)
	I know what you mean.  That can
	happen sometimes.  Let me check.
		(he looks at the
		reservation com-
		puter for a moment)
	Nope.  It's occupied.  These are
	state-of-the-art computers.  Very
	rarely do we have those kind of
	mistakes.

		DAVID
	You're sure?

		CLERK
	Yes. Says right here, "Bridal
	Suite full."

Nancy leans over and whispers to David.

		NANCY
	Give him more.

			DAVID
	Jesus.  Really?

Nancy nods yes.  David turns back to the Clerk.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Listen, I'm not very good at this.
	I don't get good seats in shows
	because of this problem.  I don't
	get good tables in restaurants.
	I've really never been good at
	this particular kind of exchange
	of money so, how much do you
	want?

		CLERK
	A hundred dollars.

		DAVID
	Fine.
		(hands him more cash)
	Here you go.  A hundred.
	Now, I assume we don't have to
	continue this computer talk
	again and say that it's working
	now and everything?

The Clerk doesn't even bother to answer.  He reaches
behind the desk and hands David his key.

		CLERK
	Here you are, eight-twenty.

He rings for the porter.

		DAVID
	Now, this is the best bridal
	suite?

		CLERK
	Heart-shaped bed.  Everything.
	You'll love it.

		DAVID
	Thank you very much.  I'm sure
	the hundred doesn't apply towards
	the room at all.

		CLERK
	You're kidding, right?

		DAVID
	Of course.  I was kidding all
	along.

David and Nancy leave the desk and walk towards the
elevator.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Tell me we didn't do the right
	thing, getting out of this horrible
	society?  Jesus Christ, I told the
	guy we dropped out. Did that make
	any difference?  No. I said we're
	making a statement.  What did he do?
	Stare at me.  I said we're getting
	remarried.  What does he finally
	say?  Give me more money.  God!
	How does a guy like that even live?

		NANCY
	Well, think of all the people
	checking in here.  Everyone giving
	him a hundred dollars, he probably
	lives well.

		DAVID
	No, I meant with himself.  How
	does he... Never mind.

23	INT. BEDROOM SUITE - DESERT INN

David and Nancy enter.  Apparently, the hundred
dollars was not quite enough.  This could not be
Desert Inn's best bridal suite.  This looks like the
junior bridal suite, at best.  At one end of the room
are two twin heart-shaped beds.  Above them, there's a
mirror, heavily-flocked with gold specks.  The rest of
the room is decorated in standard red velour.  Nancy is
disappointed.  David is confused.  He can't figure out
how any manufacturer could make a living turning out
twin heart-shaped beds.

		PORTER
	I'll go down and get your luggage
	for you.  Where is it?

		DAVID
	That's okay.  It's locked in our
	house.  I'll get it later.  Thank
	you very much.

David reaches into his pocket and gives the man a dollar.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	I haven't been here in years.  I
	hope this is enough.  If it isn't,
	take some from the clerk.  I gave
	him a hundred.

The Porter looks at David and walks out without saying
a word.

		NANCY
	So?  What do you think?

		DAVID
	I think if Liberace had children,
	this would be their room.  Cute
	little hearts, aren't they?

		NANCY
	We should ask for a bigger bed.

		DAVID
	Let's hold onto the cash we have.
	I don't want any more favors.
	We can try and push these together.

They try but they find very quickly that hearts don't
fit together.  After a few attempts, they give up.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Look, we can crawl over the
	ventricles when we want to have
	sex.  It'll be exciting.  Why
	don't you order something up,
	okay?  Order up a great meal and
	some great champagne.  I'll go
	run the bath.

David walks into the bathroom.  Nancy sits down on the
bed.  She picks up the room service menu and starts to
read through it.  She calls to David.

		NANCY
	How's the bath?

		DAVID
		(walking out of
		the bathroom)
	There's no bath in there, honey.

		NANCY
	Come on.

		DAVID
	I have no reason to lie to you.
	Go look for yourself.  There's a
	very teeny, heart-shaped
	shower and a medium sized, heart-
	shaped sink.  At best, we can
	wash our socks together.

		NANCY
	Are you disappointed?

		DAVID
	Not at all.

		NANCY
	Maybe we shouldn't order room
	service.  We should get dressed
	and go down and check out some
	of these restaurants.  Hey, do
	you want to see a show?

		DAVID
	I don't want to leave the room.
	I just want to be with you tonight,
	here.  It's our honeymoon.  We
	should order up like we planned
	and then we can figure out a way
	to make love.  Somewhere in this
	room, there has to be space.

		NANCY
	Okay.
		(gets up and walks
		toward the bath-
		room)
	I'm going in to take a nice hot
	shower, okay?

		DAVID
	Good.  You get nice and sexy
	because when you come out, we'll
	pack and leave.

		NANCY
	Come on.  We're going to have fun.

		DAVID
	I'm joking with you.  Now, hurry
	up, I'm getting horny.  When you
	come out, I'll be the naked one
	on the right heart.  I might even
	be looking at myself in the mirror
	and masturbating.  Although, I
	don't think I can see myself
	through all this gold flock.

24 	SHOT OF ALARM CLOCK

It's ringing.  The time is five-thirty A.M.  As we
PULL BACK we see David reaching over and shutting it
off.  He rolls over towards the other heart bed.

		DAVID
	Rise and shine, my darling wife.
		(singing to the
		tune of "My Fair
		Lady")
	We're getting married this morning.
	We're...

He stops singing.  She doesn't seem to be in the other
bed.  The room's still a little dark.  Maybe David isn't
seeing clearly yet.  He's patting all over the bed.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Nancy?  Honey?

He realizes she's not there.  He gets up and walks
towards the bathroom.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Honey?  Are you in there?  Nancy?

There's no answer.  Obviously, she's not in the bathroom.
Possibly, she's gone down the hall to get ice.  He opens
the door and calls down the hall.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Honey?  Nancy?  Are you at the
	ice machine?

He goes back into the room.  He picks up the phone.  A
WOMAN'S VOICE answers.

		WOMAN'S VOICE
	May I help you?

		DAVID
	Yes.  I'd like to page Nancy
	Howard, please.

		WOMAN'S VOICE
	And where would she be?  Do you
	have any idea?

		DAVID
	Probably in the coffee shop.

David sits and waits.  After a short pause:

		MAN'S VOICE
	Hello?

		DAVID
	Hi, honey.  Had a sex change, huh?
		(laughs at his joke)
	I think you picked up the wrong
	phone.  I'm paging my wife.

		MAN
	You're married to Nancy Howard?

		DAVID
	Yes.

		MAN
	Why don't you come down to the
	casino?

		DAVID
	Why?  Is there something wrong?

		MAN
	Your wife has been gambling for
	quite some time and possibly, you
	should speak with her.

		DAVID
	What do I have to say to her?  Is
	she winning?

		MAN
	Why don't you just come downstairs?

		DAVID

	Oh my God!

25	INT. DESERT INN CASINO

David comes tearing into the casino.  He is still in
his bathrobe.  A SECURITY GUARD stops him.

		GUARD
	I'm sorry, you can't come into
	the casino dressed like that.

		DAVID
	What are you, crazy?  I saw
	Electric Horseman.  Animals rode
	through here.  Excuse me.

He pushes past the Guard.  He looks frantically around
trying to find Nancy.  At this hour of the morning, it's
easy to spot people.  There aren't too many of them.
He sees her.  She's off in the corner at the roulette
table.  There's a small group of people around her.  They
seem to be watching, she seems to be gambling.  David
walks as fast as he can.  He doesn't want to run, his
robe might open up.  As he approaches Nancy, he is
frightened by what he sees.  She is a maniac.  She has
been up for hours.  The transformation is scary.  It's
like Jekyll and Hyde.  She's frantically moving chips all
around the table.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Honey?  What are you doing?

		NANCY
		(to the Dealer)
	Eight!  Big chips!

		DAVID
	Honey?

		NANCY
	Not now.  Get away.  Not now.

		DAVID
	What's going on?

		NANCY
	Stop it.  Come on, eight!  Come
	on, eight!

The DEALER spins the wheel.  The ball drops into the
number sixteen slot.

		DEALER
	Sixteen.

		NANCY
		(shrieks)
	Shit!

		DAVID
	Honey, calm down. Sweetheart?

The Man who spoke to David on the telephone approaches
him at the table.

		MAN
	Could I speak to you for a moment?

		DAVID
	What is it?

The Man takes David aside.

		MAN
	Your wife is very distraught.
	She's been gambling almost
	five hours and she has not been
	on a lucky streak.  Now, it's
	not our place to stop her, but
	possibly, you should.

		DAVID
	What do you mean she's not been
	on a lucky streak?  She's losing?

		MAN
	Well, why don't you talk to her?

David runs back to the table.

		DAVID
	Honey, I want to talk to you.

		NANCY
	Get away!
		(to the Dealer)
	Once again!  Give me eight!

The Dealer spins the wheel.  The ball goes around and
around.

		NANCY
		(continuing)
	Come on, baby.  Come on, lucky
	baby.  Baby, baby.  Baby, baby.

		DEALER
	Eight it is.

		NANCY
		(jumping up,
		excited as
		can be)
	Yes!  Great!

		DAVID
		(now a little
		excited himself)
	Hey, that is great.  You're a
	winner.
		(to Dealer)
	How much was that?  How much did
	she win?

		DEALER
	Sixty dollars.

		DAVID
	Alright.  Nothing wrong with that.
	What's wrong with that?  Now, what
	does this man mean who says you
	weren't on a lucky streak?

		NANCY
	I was down earlier.  Just go away.

		DAVID
	But you're up now, right?

		NANCY
	I'm still down.
		(to Dealer)
	Eight again!  And make it happen
	for me!

David turns to the Man who spoke to him on the phone.
The Man is standing at a distance watching what's
happening with a slight look of pity on his face.

		DAVID
		(walking over to him)
	Boy, she keeps betting eight, huh?
	How down is she exactly?

		MAN
	Oh, she's very, very down.  I
	don't know how much money you
	have, but on the average I'd
	say this is what we call "very
	down."

		DAVID
	What do you mean?  A thousand?

At this moment, we hear a GROAN from the roulette table.
The ball has dropped into double zero.  David runs back
over.  He sees the Dealer taking the chips off of eight.

		NANCY
	Dammit!  That keeps coming up,
	that zero.  Jesus Christ!
	Now, once again, eight!  Come back,
	eight!  Come back, eight!

		DAVID
	Just a minute.  Nancy, stop.

		NANCY
	Please, David!  Please!  You're
	bringing me bad luck.

		DAVID
	Well, according to some people here,
	I'm not bringing anything.  You're
	already having bad luck.

		NANCY
	It's changing!  Now come on,
	eight!  Eight's my mate!  Take
	the bait, number eight.

The Dealer spins the ball.  It drops into the number four.

		DEALER
	Four.

		NANCY
	See what you did?  Bad luck!  Get
	away, please.

		DAVID
	This man over here says you're
	very down.  What does he mean?

		NANCY
	Fuck the man!  I don't know who
	you're talking about.
		(to Dealer)
	Try it again!  Eight!

		DAVID
	Nancy, stop betting eight.  There's
	hundreds of numbers on this table.
	Why the hell do you keep betting
	eight?  Now, how much have we lost?

		NANCY
	Everything.  Come on, eight.

		DAVID
	What do you mean everything?  Did
	you say everything?

At this moment, the ball falls into number nine.  The
Dealer takes the last of Nancy's chips.

		NANCY
	Goddammit!  Son-of-a-bitch!  You
	can't get any closer to eight
	than nine.

		DAVID
		(beginning to
		take charge)
	Come over here. Come with me.

He drags Nancy away from the roulette table. She turns
around.   She's yelling at the Dealer.

		NANCY
	Eight again!  One more time!

		DAVID
	There's nothing on the board.
	You're not at the table.  You
	haven't placed a bet.  Stop
	yelling eight.   He doesn't care
	anymore.

		NANCY
	I gotta find some money. Please.
	I'm about to hit.

		DAVID
	No, you're about to get hit.   Come
	on.  We have some serious talking
	to do.

David starts to pull Nancy out of the casino.  He passes
by a one-dollar progressive slot machine with Nancy in
tow as BELLS START TO RING and LIGHTS FLASH.   An OLDER
WOMAN has hit the jackpot and starts to scream.

		WOMAN
	I won!!  I won!!

		NANCY
	Look.  She won... I want to play!

		DAVID
	It's too late.  You chose the table.
	Let's get out of here.

							CUT TO:


26	INT. COFFEE SHOP

They sit down at one of the tables.  David looks a
little worried.  Nancy is still frantic.  She's mixed
up.  She's also looking around for a Keno girl.  She's
obviously in some sort of a daze.

		DAVID
	Okay, talk.  What's going on?

		NANCY
	At two-thirty this morning, I was
	up three hundred thousand dollars.

		DAVID
	Three hundred thousand dollars?
	That's a lot of money!

		NANCY
	More chips than you've ever seen
	in your life.  You wouldn't have
	believed it.  They were all over
	the place.

		DAVID
	But when I came downstairs they
	were all gone.  You didn't have any.

		NANCY
	Yes, but I can get them back.

		DAVID
	Let's wait on that for just a
	second.  So, everything is gone
	and I'm trying to figure out the
	word "everything."  We had a
	little bit of cash with us and
	you lost that?

		NANCY
	Yes.

		DAVID
	So, what did you do?  You got
	more cash?

		NANCY
	Yes.

		DAVID
	So, you wrote a check then?

		NANCY
	Yes.

		DAVID
	You started drawing cash from our
	nest egg?

		NANCY
	Yes.  Yes.

		DAVID
	How much of the nest egg did
	you take?  What's left?

		NANCY
	Nothing.

		DAVID
	Oh, my God. By "everything" you
	mean "nothing."

		NANCY
	Yes.

		DAVID
	You didn't lose a hundred and
	eighty thousand dollars?

		NANCY
	Maybe.  I don't know.  Give or
	take a thousand.

		DAVID
	Give or take a thousand?  Give
	or take a thousand?

David is holding on to one of his testicles so as not
to kill this woman.  This is the first time in his life,
where he truly can't comprehend what he has heard.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Oh my God!  Oh my God! I understand
	what we mean now.  I understand what
	we all mean.  Oh my God!  My God!
	My God!

David puts his hand to his forehead. He looks around.
He's thinking.  Something must be done. Something must
be done quickly.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Oh my God!  Alright.  Let's not
	panic.

David thinks of something.  He stands up from the
table and yells as loud as he can.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Bellhop, please.  Bellhop, in here,
	please.  There's an emergency!

He sits down, he's rubbing his head.

		NANCY
	What's the matter?

		DAVID
	Nothing.  Just wait.  Oh my God!

		NANCY
	Sweetheart, there were these
	Persians around me, staring at
	all these chips that were on
	the table and I've never had
	that feeling before, the feeling
	that I was completely in control.
	I was the one.  I didn't need
	anything.  I didn't care.  I
	didn't have any problems.  Do
	you know that feeling?

		DAVID
	Not now. I don't know that feeling
	now, no.

The BELLHOP approaches.

		BELLHOP
	Yes, sir?

		DAVID
	First of all, I was speaking to a
	gentleman in the casino who seemed
	to be in charge there.  He's what?

		BELLHOP
	The Pit Boss?

		DAVID
	Yes.  What's his name?

		BELLHOP
	Mr. Shuster.

		DAVID
	Fine.  Does he have an office?

		BELLHOP
	Yes, it's behind the front desk.

		DAVID
	Fine.  Alright.  Now would you
	please do me a favor?  My wife
	is tired and would you escort
	her to 820.
		(hands the Bellhop
		his room key)
	Would you please sit with her,
	maybe she'll want to take a shower
	or whatever, and just don't leave
	the room.  I'll be up in a little
	while.  But please don't leave.
	I don't want her to be alone right
	now.

		NANCY
	Why are you treating me like an
	animal?

		DAVID
	I'll explain it to you later.

They all get up.  They exit the coffee shop.


27	INT. LOBBY OUTSIDE COFFEE SHOP

		DAVID
		(speaking to Nancy as
		if she has just had
		a nervous breakdown)
	Just relax.  Lie down, if you want.
	Have some water.  I'll be up in a
	few minutes.

		NANCY
	Stop talking to me this way.

		DAVID
	I'm not talking to you in any
	particular way.  I'm just trying
	to keep everything calm and I'm
	trying to remain calm.  I'm also
	trying to think what I can do to
	help us out now.
		(to the Bellhop)
	The man's name again?  The Pit Boss?

		BELLHOP
	Shuster.

		DAVID
	Thank you.

They are now at the elevators.

		NANCY
	David, I'm sorry.

		DAVID
	Save it.  Just go upstairs.

He leaves her at the elevators.


28 	INT. LOBBY

David walks very slowly towards Shuster's office.  You
can tell he's thinking.  He approaches the front desk
and clears his throat, trying to act dignified.  The robe
diminishes this a bit.

		DAVID
		(to the Clerk)
	Mr. Shuster, the Pit Boss, may I
	speak to him, please?

		CLERK
	I don't know if he's in.  Just a
	moment.

The Clerk picks up the phone.  He buzzes.

		CLERK
		(continuing)
	Yes.  There's a gentleman here
	to see you.
		(to David)
	What is your name?

		DAVID
	I'm David Howard.  He knows me,
	we spoke on the telephone.  My
	wife was the one who was up for
	hours.

		CLERK
		(into phone)
	David Howard.  Yes.  Yes.
		(hangs up phone)
	He'll be right out.

David stands there.  He's thinking, staring straight
ahead.  Out of an office emerges JACK SHUSTER, the Pit
Boss, the man we saw earlier.  Shuster's a large man,
in his early fifties.  He's as intimidating as his
job calls for.  He looks like he might have killed
somebody once, and actually enjoyed it.  He walks
over to David.

		SHUSTER
	Mr. Howard?  Come on in.

							CUT TO:


29 	INT. SHUSTER'S OFFICE

David tries to compose himself even more as he follows
Shuster into his office.  David's story is now formed.
He knows what he wants to say.  He feels confident.
David enters the office.  He sits down in front of
Shuster's desk.

		DAVID
	First of all, let me say, I've
	heard a great deal about you.

		SHUSTER
		(suspicious)
	What do you mean?  From who?
	What did you hear?

		DAVID
	Oh, I just meant I've heard
	wonderful things from everybody
	in general, from the whole hotel.

		SHUSTER
		(relieved)
	Well, that's very nice.  Thank
	you.

		DAVID
	No, thank you.

		SHUSTER
	Is your wife feeling better?

		DAVID
	Yes, she is.

		SHUSTER
	So, what can I do for you?

		DAVID
	I have a very interesting idea.
	I think you'll be taken by it.

Shuster stares at him.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	I was a key executive with a major
	advertising agency - one of the
	biggest in the world.

		SHUSTER
	Yes, right.  So?

		DAVID
	Well, I was the Idea Man there.
	So, when I say I have an interesting
	idea, I'm not speaking like any slob
	that walks in off the street.

		SHUSTER
	Okay.

		DAVID
		(clearing his throat,
		about to enter into
		The Big Story)
	My wife and I, we dropped out of
	society.  She had a very important
	position in a department store and
	again, I remind you that I was one
	of the highest executives in the
	world's largest advertising firm.

Shuster just stares at him.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Anyway, we were going to find
	ourselves.  Then, we thought, maybe
	we're too old, it's too late.  We
	can't find ourselves, that's only
	for kids.  And then we thought about
	it some more and it hit us.  Wait a
	minute.  Who's to say at what age
	you stop being a kid?

		SHUSTER
	You gotta have some age.  How else
	could a court separate rape from
	fun?  In this state, it's eighteen,
	by the way.

		DAVID
	Yes.  But my point is we wanted
	to find ourselves and we did and
	we dropped out, just like they
	did in "Easy Rider."

		SHUSTER
	Easy what?

		DAVID
	The movie, "Easy Rider."  Famous
	movie.  Important movie.

		SHUSTER
	Didn't see that, I'm sorry.

		DAVID
	It's a classic.  If it comes on
	cable here, see it.  Anyway, we
	did something that no one has done
	for a long time.  Maybe no one has
	ever done it because in the movie
	they were movie stars, so they
	didn't really do it, even though
	they portrayed people that did it.

		SHUSTER
	I'm getting mixed up here.  What
	is your point?

		DAVID
	Well, we did it for real.  We
	quit our jobs and we sold everything
	that we had.  The only thing we own
	is our little motor home, which is
	parked outside.  That's all we've
	got and we were going to spend
	years roaming around this beautiful
	country, but we knew we couldn't
	do it unless we had our little
	nest egg tucked away in the bank.

		SHUSTER
		(interrupts)
	I'm going off duty in a few minutes.
	Now, your point is what?

		DAVID
	I'm getting to it.  Why did we
	come to Las Vegas?  Because it was
	a new beginning and I wanted to
	remarry my lovely wife.  That's
	nice, don't you think?

		SHUSTER
	Very nice.

		DAVID
	I wanted to get remarried but I
	wanted to spend our honeymoon in
	the Grand Canyon, places like we
	intend to spend the rest of our
	lives in, but my wife is very fond
	of your hotel and all of the
	employees and she said, "Oh, come
	on, let's spend our honeymoon here."
	And we did and the room was very
	lovely and everybody was very nice
	to us, but my wife lost the nest
	egg.

		SHUSTER
	Mr. Howard, stop right here.  I
	think I know what you're getting at.
	I realize you've lost a great deal
	here and I want you to know that
	your room and your meals are comped.

		DAVID
	That's very nice but that's not
	exactly what I'm saying.  I think
	I have a multi-million dollar idea.
	Now, you have to be very secretive
	about what I'm going to tell you
	because the other hotels, if they
	heard about it, well, they'll grab
	it in a minute.

David leans over Shuster's desk and whispers to make
the idea really sound secretive:

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	I think, as an experiment, you
	give us back the money we lost.

		SHUSTER
	I beg your pardon?

		DAVID
	Well, imagine the publicity?  I
	mean, the Hilton, for example,
	they have billboards all over L.A.
	where they put the faces of the
	winners of those slot machines.
	Now, those people win a couple
	hundred thousand dollars, but the
	hotel is getting millions of
	dollars of publicity with those
	billboards because people drive
	by and say, "Gee, the Hilton looks
	like a nice place.  Look at those
	smiling people."  So, what about a
	billboard with my wife and I on it
	and we would be smiling and there
	would be a saying, something like,
	"These people dropped out of society,
	they couldn't take it any longer,
	but they made a mistake.  They
	lost their nest egg at The Desert
	Inn, but The Desert Inn gave it
	back."  And maybe there could be
	some kind of a visual with you
	handing us an egg or something.
	Now I mean, I'm just formulating
	this now, as I'm talking, but you
	can imagine, when it's worked
	out how effective it could be.

		SHUSTER
		(chuckling)
	That's wonderful.
		(he gets up)
	Well, Mr. Howard, nice to meet
	you.

		DAVID
	What do you mean nice to meet
	me?  You said this is wonderful.

		SHUSTER
	We're kidding each other here,
	right?
		(starts to
		laugh again)
	I gotta tell you, this is one of
	the best things I've ever heard.
	What's the board gonna say again?
	"Gamblers, come and get your
	money back."
		(he laughs)
	Great.  That's great.

		DAVID
		(standing up)
	No.  No.  Wait... Not "Gamblers,
	get your money back."
	That's wrong.  We're not gamblers.
	We're the few people in society
	that have tried to do something
	with our lives.  See?  We're drop-
	outs.  We're finding ourselves.
	Someone's got to help the few
	people like us, because if they
	don't, nobody will ever drop out
	again.  Nobody will ever have
	the courage to find themselves.

		SHUSTER
	Well, I understand what you mean,
	but I don't think The Desert Inn
	can help find you.  I'm sorry, but
	thank you for the idea and good
	night.

He begins to escort David to the door.

		DAVID
		(stopping him)
	Listen, I've experienced this
	before.  I've had clients that
	didn't understand the idea until
	they saw it on television and
	then they said, "My God!  What a
	brilliant idea!  Why didn't I
	understand this?" I might have
	used the wrong phrase.  Okay,
	picture this: maybe, my wife
	and I will do a television
	commercial for you and there
	could be a jingle and it could
	go:
		(begins to sing)
	"The Desert Inn has heart!  The
	Desert Inn has heart!  The Desert
	Inn has heart!"  Something like
	that.  See what I mean?

		SHUSTER
	That's a nice jingle.  Mr. Howard,
	let's assume you're serious here.
	What if this caught on?  Could you
	imagine what would happen?  Why,
	we would have to return everybody's
	losses.  The casino would just
	crumble.  We couldn't pay our bills.
	You know the casino accounts for
	a great deal of our profits.

		DAVID
	I understand.  Of course, you don't
	pay back everybody's losses.  You
	make a distinct division between
	the bold, who are out there searching,
	and all the other schmucks, who come
	here to see Wayne Newton.

		SHUSTER
	I see.  Now, I like Wayne Newton.
	So, I fall into what category?

		DAVID
		(realizing this was
		not the best example)
	Oh, look, I picked a name out of a
	hat.  I like Wayne Newton, too.
	I'm saying a schmuck, representing
	the gambler and a bold person,
	representing me and my wife and the
	one or two others that probably
	wouldn't come here anyway.  You
	wouldn't have to do this more than
	once or twice, there's not too many
	bold people around.  I think it was
	a mistake to use entertainers as
	the dividing line.  We could find
	another system.  Anyway, what do
	you say?  We do need that nest egg
	back.

		SHUSTER
	I say good luck to you and stay
	away from the tables next time.

		DAVID
	Oh, that's for sure, but come on?
	Half the money, for courage?

Shuster opens up his office door.  He escorts David out.


30	INT. LOBBY AT FRONT DESK

		SHUSTER
	Mr. Howard, nice to meet you.
	A pleasure.

		DAVID
	Hold it.  What about "Miracle
	on 34th Street?"

		SHUSTER
	Christmas picture, right?

		DAVID
		(now rambling on very
		fast, desperate, rea-
		lizing his plan is
		about to fail)
	More than a Christmas picture.  What
	happened there?  Macy's didn't want
	to send their customers to Gimble's
	because the president of Macy's
	thought they would lose all of their
	customers and lose a tremendous
	amount of money and it would be taken
	wrong.  But it wasn't taken wrong.
	What happened? Macy's did much better
	than they ever did before. And that's
	what would happen to you.  The Desert
	Inn would do much, much better because
	you would get Gimble's business and
	the casino would be full.

		SHUSTER
	Well, I'm not too familiar with
	that picture but didn't Macy's have
	Santa Claus to help them out?
		(he starts to laugh)
	I mean, if they didn't have Santy
	Claus there, they might have done
	very badly.

He continues to laugh.  David now starts to laugh along
with him, except David's laugh has a pitiful ring to it.
He senses this is not going to work.

		DAVID
	Yes.  I guess they did have Santy
	Claus.  Well, thank you.  Thank you.
	And just so I understand, we can t
	get any of our money back, right?

		SHUSTER
	Well, not today, no.  But if the
	policy ever changes, we'll write
	you.
		(still chuckling as
		he goes back into
		his office)
	That's wonderful.  Very good.

He closes the door.  The desk Clerk, who has just seen
Shuster laugh, turns to David, who is standing there
looking as bad as he's ever looked.

		CLERK
	I think he likes you.  He rarely
	laughs at anything.

David just nods a sickly "thank you."

							CUT TO:


31	EXT.  MOTOR HOME - DAY

David and Nancy are driving.  They are well outside of
Las Vegas.  Nancy is staring out of the window.  David
is driving in silence.  Obviously, they have been driving
for a great deal of time without saying anything.  Nancy
finally breaks the silence.


32	INT.  MOTOR HOME

		NANCY
	I can't take this.  Say something.
	Yell at me.  Hit me.  Drive off
	the road.  Do anything.  Just stop
	being so silent.

		DAVID
	I have nothing to say.

		NANCY
	I can't keep apologizing.  I'm
	sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
	I feel horrible.  I would do
	anything to change it.

David says nothing.  He just clears his throat.

		NANCY
		(continuing)
	You're going to make yourself
	sick.  It's unnatural.  I
	understand.  If I were you, I'd
	be furious.  Don't hold it in.
	Go ahead.

		DAVID
		(looking at her)
	I'm fine.

More silent driving.  Nancy is desperately uncomfort-
able.  Obviously, David is not fine.  How could he be?
He's seen ten years of earnings dissipate in less than
three hours and he didn't participate in any of the
dissipation.  After a while, Nancy tries a new approach.

		NANCY
	Obviously, I can't apologize anymore
	for what I did so we should talk
	about what we're going to do.

		DAVID
	And what would that be?

		NANCY
	Well, our dream is still the same.
	We just don't have any money.

David clears his throat again.

		NANCY
		(continuing)
	And, also, we should stop saying
	we don't have any money.  We do
	have some.

		DAVID
		(very patiently)
	We have eight hundred and two
	dollars.

		NANCY
	That's something.

		DAVID
	It is something.  Yes.

		NANCY
	Well, look, I think we should
	try to make the rest of the day
	as pleasant as we can.  Since
	we're heading towards Hoover Dam
	anyway, we should make that our
	destination for today.  We can
	go there, look around, maybe
	have a picnic or something, and
	maybe just see the dam and just
	have a nice day outside.  What
	do you think?

		DAVID
		(staring straight
		ahead, speaking
		in a monotone)
	Is that what you'd like?

		NANCY
	Maybe it would be fun.

		DAVID
		(still staring,
		still speaking
		in a monotone)
	Fine.  Hoover Dam.

							CUT TO:


33	EXT. HOOVER DAM - DAY

There are people walking around, tours going on and
children playing.  The motor home pulls up.  They park.
Nancy gets out with a bounce in her step, hoping David
might copy her.  David gets out like Frankenstein,
walking very slowly, with no expression.

		NANCY
	Look at this!  Come here.  God!
	Just think.  Men built this!

		DAVID
		(still with no
		expression)
	Yes.  Men did build this.

		NANCY
	What about something to eat?
	Hungry?

		DAVID
	No.

		NANCY
	I'm starved.

		DAVID
	I don't think you can eat now.

		NANCY
	Why?

		DAVID
	Because with the little bit of
	money that we have left, I think
	we have to sit down and make up
	a new budget.  Until we do, maybe
	we shouldn't spend it all on
	cotton candy and other various
	knickknacks here at the dam.

Nancy is beginning to get irritated and frustrated that
he will not talk to her like an adult.

		NANCY
	Well, if that's your attitude,
	I think you should give me half
	the money and let me eat whatever
	I want and you can do what you
	want with your half.  I think
	that's the fair thing.

		DAVID
		(the release of his
		anger now begins)
	The fair thing?  The fair thing?
	That's it!  You're right.  I've
	been controlled!  Boy, have I
	been controlled!  I guess any
	doctor could have spotted it.
	I was about to die, I was so
	controlled.  You took all the
	money we had!

People can hear this echoing for miles around.

		DAVID
		(continuing; now
		yelling)
	You took our nest egg and you
	broke it up!  You got yoke all
	over the casino!  You got the
	white all over the coffee shop!
	You threw the shells in the
	parking lot!  Fair?  Fair?!
	Where was I when you were
	playing with the egg?  Sleeping.
	Sleeping.  Goddammit!

		NANCY
	Good.  Get it out.

		DAVID
	Shut up!   Don't talk to me like
	I'm an insane patient!

		NANCY
	Let's just go back inside. You
	can yell at me. You should, I
	think it's right. I just don't
	want you to yell out here.

		DAVID
	Out where?  This is where we're
	going to have to live.  Why not
	yell out here?  We're going to have
	to do everything else out here.
	We'll be sleeping out here and
	eating out here and going to the
	bathroom out here!  Get used to
	this cement, baby!  This is it!
	Out here is it!  We found ourselves!
	We found ourselves, alright!  We
	found ourselves with eight hundred
	dollars in the middle of nowhere!

Nancy walks away.  She sees a crowd that is gathered
around and she does not want to have an argument in
front of these people.  David follows her.


34	EXT. SIDE OF ROAD - HOOVER DAM VISITOR AREA

		DAVID
	Where are you going?

		NANCY
	I don't want to have an argument
	in front of those people.

		DAVID
	Why not?  I think those people
	are entitled to know how stupid
	you are.

		NANCY
	This is going to turn into a
	personal attack, isn't it?

		DAVID
	What else?  A general attack?  Who
	am I going to attack?   Nevada?   I
	can't attack the state.  It wasn't
	their fault.  I can't attack the
	motor home. It stayed in the
	parking lot.  I can't attack me.
	I was fast asleep.  By process
	of elimination, who's left?

		NANCY
	I am.  I'm left, okay?  And I'll
	say it one more time - I'm sorry.

They are off by themselves now.  They have reasonable
privacy.  They are both very upset.

		DAVID
	I don't want your apologies.  I
	want to know why?   I want to try
	to understand how it happened.  Tell
	me.  How did it happen?

		NANCY
	I couldn't sleep.

		DAVID
	You couldn't sleep.  I see.  Now,
	I remember nights where I couldn't
	sleep.  I'm just trying to think
	what I did.  Let's see.  I tried
	warm milk or I took a long walk or
	I took Nytol and then, if all that
	didn't work, I gave away all the
	money I ever earned.  But you
	didn't try any of those things
	first.  You just gave away the
	money first, right?  What did you
	intend to do?  Have warm milk
	afterwards?  Tell me.  I'm mixed
	up.

		NANCY
	You're not even listening.

		DAVID
	I'm sorry.  You're right.  Go
	ahead.  You couldn't sleep.  Then
	what happened?

		NANCY
	I don't remember.  I just went
	downstairs.

		DAVID
	Why didn't you wake me up?

		NANCY
	What would you have done?

		DAVID
	What would I have done?  I would
	have followed you.
	I would've seen you.  I would have
	watched you take your money and
	begin to lose it and I would have
	stopped you at thirty dollars,
	maybe thirty-two dollars, at the
	most.  I would have said,
	"Sweetheart, come back to bed.
	We don't want to fool with our
	nest egg."  You know, Nancy, I
	think you just considered nest
	egg to be a term but to me, it
	was a key to this whole experiment.
	Why, I considered it like a third
	person.  It was our best friend,
	our guardian angel.  It was going
	to allow us to do everything we
	wanted to do.  It was going to
	watch over us during bad times
	and laugh with us during good times.
	It was going to help us roam and
	purchase and eat and explore.  It
	was going to help us make love
	and laugh and cry and now, it's
	gone and who's got it?  The Desert
	Inn!  They've got our nest egg.
	They can sure use it, can't they?
	They don't have their own.  They're
	a poor little organization.  They
	need our nest egg.  Gee, I hope
	they use it wisely.  I know someday
	those mirrors are going to have
	to be reflocked and the red velvet
	was looking kind of worn.  And
	those little heart beds are going
	to need new sheets.  I'm glad we
	could help them pay for that.  I'm
	glad our life savings will go
	towards making that room look a
	little prettier.  I'm glad we
	gave it all to them, Nancy.  I'm
	just going to miss the little nest
	egg, that's all.  Won't you,
	sweetheart?  Won't you miss the
	nest egg?  In the middle of the
	night, won't you feel kind of
	lonely because little nest egg
	is paying for the gas in Frank
	Sinatra's limo?

		NANCY
	Shut up, David!
		(begins to cry; she's
		getting hysterical)
	Shut up!  I don't want to hear nest
	egg anymore!  I don't want to hear
	that word.  Let me tell you something.
	That's not the way you drop out
	anyway.  If you're really going to
	drop out, you drop out with nothing!

		DAVID
	You drop out with nothing?  Oh
	where did you read that?  In the
	Las Vegas Guide?

		NANCY
	I didn't read that.  I know that.

		DAVID
	Oh, I see.  Who told you?

		NANCY
	Friends, people who know.  I don't
	have to answer you.

		DAVID
	No.  You don't have to answer me.
	You can't answer me because no one
	ever told you that.  You never
	had friends who dropped out.  You
	don't know anybody who dropped
	out except for us.  So how the
	hell did you know that?  Come on,
	tell me?

		NANCY
	Alright.  The movie you're basing
	your whole life on, "Easy Rider,"
	they dropped out with nothing.
	They had no nest egg.

		DAVID
	Bullshit.  They had a huge nest
	egg.  They sold cocaine.  They
	didn't get on their motorcycles
	till their nest egg was giant,
	fifty times the size of ours.

		NANCY
	That's not true.

		DAVID
	Oh, look.  I'm not going to stand
	here, in front of one of the seven
	wonders of the world and argue about
	an old movie.  I'm going to go now
	and get back in the motor home and
	maybe you can wander around out here
	and figure out something to do.  We
	have eight hundred dollars left and
	an entire lifetime.  See what you
	can come up with.

David starts to walk away.

		NANCY
	We could sell cocaine.

		DAVID
		(stops and turns
		around)
	Well, my God.  Why didn't I think
	of that?  Great idea.  As a matter-
	of-fact, I remember after seeing
	"Midnight Express" I went out of
	the theater saying to myself, "That's
	for me.  Sex with hundreds of
	Turkish men."

David turns around and walks towards the motor home.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Come on.  Let's go.

Nancy doesn't go with him.

		NANCY
	No.  Forget it.

		DAVID
	Forget what?

		NANCY
	Forget everything.

		DAVID
	What are you talking about?

		NANCY
	You know, I'll tell you one good
	thing that came out of all of this.
	We forgot to get remarried.  That
	was one good thing that happened
	and no one has mentioned that yet.

		DAVID
	What are you saying?

		NANCY
	I'm saying that if we got remarried
	it would be much more difficult to
	get divorced.  Now it's easy.  It's
	over.  I'll just stay in Nevada for
	six weeks and then we'll be legally
	through.  This is how it should
	have happened anyway, David.  We
	were stupid to think it could have
	happened any other way.

		DAVID
	Do you really believe that?

		NANCY
	You bet your life I do.  I realize
	now, you're never going to let me
	forget this.  For the rest of our
	lives, you'll blame me and I won't
	take it.  So, goodbye.  I'm sorry.
	It didn't work out.


35	EXT. SIDE OF ROAD

Nancy walks to the side of the road and sticks out her
thumb.  David walks after her.

		DAVID
	What do you expect to do?  Where
	do you think you're going?

		NANCY
	I still have my dreams.  I'll have
	to find somebody else who understands
	them a little bit better and then
	I'll start over.

		DAVID
	Okay.  Enough is enough. I
	understand your dreams. You said,
	"Explode."  I exploded. It's done.
	Now, come on.  Let's not act stupid.
	I'm over it.

		NANCY
		(crying)
	You'll never be over it. I know
	you.  You're right.  I'm stupid.
	You don't want to be with a
	stupid person so leave me alone.

		DAVID
	What are you doing?

		NANCY
	None of your business. Now get
	out of here, please.

		DAVID
	You told me to be angry.  You said
	it was unhealthy not to be angry.
	You'd be angry, too.  God knows
	you'd be angry.

We see a car approaching in the distance.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Nancy, there's a car coming and
	there's a man in there who looks
	like an animal.  Now if you don't
	put your thumb back, he's going
	to pick you up and if he picks
	you up, you're going to be in
	his car.  I don t know him.  You
	don't know him.  We don't know
	where we are, so why don't we
	stop acting like this?!

		NANCY
	Goodbye.

		DAVID
		(yelling)
	What is happening?  You said it
	fifteen hundred times, "Get
	angry."  I got angry.  I thought
	I got angry well.  I'm over it.

		NANCY
	Sure you're over it. You're
	still yelling.

		DAVID
	I'm yelling because you're about
	to get in someone else's car!

An old Chevy pulls over.  A guy in his late thirties,
large, ugly, RED-NECK-looking fellow says to Nancy:

		RED-NECK
	Where ya headin'?

		NANCY
	With you.

		RED-NECK
	Alright.  You got it.  Come on.

Nancy gets in the car.  David starts to run after them.

		DAVID
		(yelling)
	This has gotten out of hand.  Look
	around you, Nancy, you're in another
	car!  That man is not me!  Nancy!
	I apologize!  I'm sorry!

David stops yelling.  He just stands there for a minute.

		DAVID
		(continuing; to
		himself)
	Listen to what I'm saying.  I was
	sleeping and I'm yelling I'm sorry.
	What's going on?  Jesus Christ!
	She's going to get killed!


36	EXT. ROAD TO HOOVER - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY

David runs back to the motor home.  He starts the
engine.  David tries to catch up to the Chevy.  The
Chevy's gotten a large lead.  He goes faster but it
doesn't help.  He loses the car.

							CUT TO:


37 	INT. MOTOR HOME

		DAVID
		(mumbling)
	I've lost my wife in the desert.
	This is just silly.  You lose
	your wallet or your keys but I've
	lost a whole woman.

David continues to drive.  After a short while, he spots
a road stop, a gas-food-rest stop.

There's a small restaurant.  He spots the Chevy.  He
pulls in.  David gets out of the motor home.  Through
the window, he can see this Red-Neck and Nancy sitting
at a table.

							CUT TO:


38 	INT. ROADSIDE RESTAURANT

David walks in.  He approaches the table where Nancy
and the Red-Neck are sitting.

		DAVID
	Nancy, I think we should go.

		RED-NECK
	I don't think she wants to speak
	to you, buddy.

		DAVID
	I've known her for a long time.
	I think I would rather have direct
	communication with her.  Nancy,
	come on.

		RED-NECK
	I said she don't want to talk to
	you.

		DAVID
	We're leaving now, okay, honey?

		RED-NECK
	You're not listenin', are you?

		DAVID
	I'm listening.  This is my wife.
	It's between her and me.   Nancy?
	We're going to work things out
	now.  Thank this gentleman for
	the ride and let's go.

Nancy says nothing.  The Red-Neck stands up.  He is huge.

		RED-NECK
	Mister, I'm gonna count to three
	and I want you out of here.  One...

		DAVID
	Nancy, this man's counting.  Who
	is he?

		RED-NECK
	Two.

		DAVID
	Honey, there's one number left.

		RED-NECK
	Three.

The Red-Neck takes David by the shoulder and starts to
lead him outside.

		RED-NECK
		(continuing)
	Let's go.  You and I, we have
	some fighting to do.

David is being shoved outside.  He looks back at Nancy.

		DAVID
	Is this what you want?  Is this
	what was supposed to happen?  I'm
	now going to be killed by a gorilla?

David and the Red-Neck are outside.  Nancy realizes
David is probably right.  He will be killed.  She gets
up.  She runs after them.


39	EXT. ROADSIDE RESTAURANT

By the time she gets outside, David is already being
punched in the stomach and then in the face.  In be-
tween punches, David is yelling to Nancy:

		DAVID
	Call him off!  He'll obey you!
	Tell him it's alright!

The Red-Neck is now really angry.

		RED-NECK
	I hate you.  I'm going to kill you.

		NANCY
	It's okay.  Stop.  Please?  Thank
	you for the ride but we can handle it.

		RED-NECK
	You're out of this now.  This is
	between him and me.
	I haven't hated somebody so much
	in a long time.  He reminds me
	of everything I hate.

David is on the ground.  The Red-Neck picks him up.

		RED-NECK
	Come on.  Come on.  Let's really
	go at it.

		DAVID
	This is going to disappoint you
	but I have really gone at it.
	I haven't had a fight since I
	was in the third grade.  I'm just
	not used to it.  Nancy, tell him.

		NANCY
	Please!  It's okay.  My husband
	and I had a fight but we can handle
	it.

		RED-NECK
	I said get out, lady.  I'm on a
	mission now.

Nancy, realizing that she can't stop the fight, begins to
scream:

		NANCY
	Help!  Help!  Police!  Help!
	Murder! Help!

People start to come out of the restaurant.  This is more
attention than the Red-Neck wanted.

		RED-NECK
	Well, look at this.  A woman has
	to help you by yelling for the
	police.  Well, if I wasn't wanted,
	I wouldn't care.  I'd stay here
	and beat the shit out of you, but
	right now I can't afford to see
	the police.  But I'll get you.  I
	don't know where or when, but I'll
	get you, mister.

The Red-Neck starts to walk back to his car.

		DAVID
	Yell "Police!" more.  Keep yelling.

		NANCY
	Police!  Police!

We see the Red-Neck hasten a bit. He starts his engine.

		DAVID
	More.  Yell.  Yell.  Police!
	Help!  Help!

The Chevy pulls out.  The Red-Neck yells back:

		RED-NECK
	I'll get you.

David is holding his jaw.

		NANCY
	Are you alright?

		DAVID
	That man will spend the rest of
	his life trying to find me.  I'll
	be killed, Nancy.

Nancy helps him towards the motor home.


40	INT. MOTOR HOME

They get inside.  David is holding his jaw.

		NANCY
	Are you sure you're okay?

		DAVID
	Yeah, I'm okay.  Next time, if
	you're going to hitch, get a ride
	with a small woman, will you?

		NANCY
	I'm proud of you.

		DAVID
	For what?  Getting beat up?

		NANCY
	For rescuing me.

		DAVID
	Well, I had no choice really.  I
	thought about just forgetting it
	and finding someone new, but I
	realized I had nothing to offer
	them.

		NANCY
	David, listen to me... We're going
	to be alright.

		DAVID
	I hope so.  Maybe we will.

David starts the engine.  The home slowly begins to
move.

		NANCY
	What do you think we should do
	first?

		DAVID
	First?  First, I think we fill this
	thing with gas so we can get as far
	away as possible from that mental
	patient.  Then, I guess we'll head
	east.  We'll drive until we find a
	place we both like and that'll be
	our new home. We'll start there
	and we'll begin to rebuild.

		NANCY
	I swear to God I think this is a
	blessing in disguise.  The whole
	idea of going to Las Vegas was to
	get remarried so we could have a
	new beginning, right?  Well, that
	would've just been a ceremony.  Now,
	we really are starting from the
	beginning.  I think this way is
	much better.

		DAVID
	Well, I hope it is.  But since we
	really will never know the other
	way, let's not compare.

		NANCY
	But after all, the whole purpose
	was to find ourselves and to be
	free and now we really are free.
	The other way...

		DAVID
		(interrupting)
	Hold it, honey.  Another comparison,
	right?

		NANCY
	Well, I'm just excited.  I think
	this is a blessing.

		DAVID
	It very well might be.  All I'm
	saying is let's just let our
	original plan rest in peace.

41A	EXT. ARIZONA HIGHWAYS
thru
41C

A)  We see the motor home driving along.  In the
background there is MUSIC.  As they head east,
the sun slowly is setting behind them.  After
various SHOTS of David and Nancy moving along
the desert...

B) ... we finally see them pass a sign that says,
"WELCOME TO PRESCOTT, ARIZONA."

C)  They drive on further until they pull up to a
trailer park.  The sign above the park says,
"PRESCOTT TRAILER PARK."  He stops.  He pulls
the motor home into this park.  He sticks his
head out the window, as if to feel the climate.
It feels right.

							CUT TO:


42	INT.  MOTOR HOME

The sun has set.  This is where they've chosen to live.
Nancy is lying on the bed as David is at the kitchen
table, figuring out the money they have left.

		DAVID
	Okay, so, gas and the payment
	here and the electricity hook-up,
	the water hook-up, lunch... Oh my!

		NANCY
	What?

		DAVID
	Three hundred and twenty dollars.

He takes that amount out of his pocket.  He lays it out
in front of then, like a magician doing a card trick.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	There it is, sweetheart.  That's it.

		NANCY
	Okay. Let's call this "emergency"
	money. We'll get jobs right away
	so we don't have to touch this.

		DAVID
	Absolutely.  This money we seal away.

		NANCY
	We'll both have jobs by tomorrow.
	It's going to be good.

		DAVID
	We have no choice.  We have to
	have jobs by tomorrow.

		NANCY
	We should celebrate tonight.

		DAVID
	Celebrate what?

		NANCY
	This!  This is the real beginning!

David sits there.  He smiles.  He's staring at Nancy.
After a while he feels a little uncomfortable.

		NANCY
		(continuing)
	What's the matter?  What are you
	staring at?

		DAVID
	Your legs.  They look different.

		NANCY
	Different?

		DAVID
	They look longer.

		NANCY
	You're joking, right?

		DAVID
	No.

		NANCY
	I have long legs, remember?

		DAVID
	Remember what?

		NANCY
	That was the first thing you
	ever said to me.  You said I
	had sexy long legs.  That was
	before you even asked me my
	name.

		DAVID
	My God.  You're right.  We talked
	about your legs for a long time
	before your name came up.  Was I
	rude?

		NANCY
	You were great.

		DAVID
	You didn't think I was so sexy
	the first time you saw me, did
	you?

		NANCY
	Yes I did.

		DAVID
	You didn't say anything.

		NANCY
	Yes I did.

		DAVID
	No you didn't.


		NANCY
	Yes.  I remember I told you I
	thought curly hair was very,
	very sexy.  I said I liked your
	hair.

		DAVID
	No, sweetheart, you said curly
	hair was sexy and then you asked
	me if that was my own hair.

		NANCY
	Well, I was shy.

		DAVID
	Don't worry.  I took it as a
	compliment.

Nancy smiles.  David walks over and gives her a passionate
kiss, the likes of which we have not yet seen in this film.
They begin to make love.  It's the real thing.  As they do
we...

							CUT TO:


43	EXT. MOTOR HOME

We hear MOANING.  We see the home rocking gently back
and forth.  Older people who live in the trailer park
start to come out and watch this new residence move
from side to side. Some have folding chairs, others
have picnic baskets.  This is one trailer park that
hasn't yet put in cable television.  So, to these
people, this is entertainment they so badly needed.

We SLOWLY...

							DISSOLVE INTO:


44	INT. MOTOR HOME - NEXT MORNING

David is still in bed. Nancy is almost dressed. She has
an extraordinary amount of energy.

		NANCY
	David, I love you.  That was the
	best.  It was amazing.

David is a bit dazed.  Obviously they've had the best sex
of their lives.  It's given her energy.  It's made him a
little confused.

		DAVID
	It never happened like that in
	L.A.  I wonder why?

		NANCY
	We stopped having sex in L.A.

		DAVID
	That must be it.

		NANCY
	Seriously.  What do you really
	think happened?  What did we do
	right?

		DAVID
	I don't think it had anything to
	do with us.

		NANCY
	What was it?  The air?

		DAVID
	Maybe.  My guess is extreme poverty.

		NANCY
	Well, then I say we should stay poor.

		DAVID
	Look, I was just guessing.  I think
	we have to make some money, we don't
	want to starve to death and then find
	out it really was the air.  We'll
	feel so stupid.

		NANCY
		(smiles)
	I have so much energy.  I can't
	wait to get out and just explore
	this city.  I'm going to get a
	great job.  I know it.

David gets out of bed.  He puts on his robe.

		DAVID
	Me, too.  Now, I think we should
	have some kind of a plan.  What do
	you say we look for work together?

		NANCY
	I don't think so.  I think we
	should go in separate directions.

		DAVID
	Why?

		NANCY
	We'll cover more territory.

		DAVID
	Alright.  That sounds right.  Good.
	Good idea.

		NANCY
	Let's say we meet back here no
	later than five o'clock.

		DAVID
	Five o'clock.  Good.

		NANCY
		(kissing him)
	I can't wait for five o'clock.

Nancy exits.  David stands at the door calling out to
her:

		DAVID
	Good luck!  Go for the high pay!

		NANCY
	I know.

		DAVID
	And buy a cheap lunch!

		NANCY
	Don't worry.

		DAVID
	I love you.

		NANCY
	I love you, too.

		DAVID
	I mean it!  Cheap lunch!

We see Nancy wave as she walks off into the distance.

45	EXT. PRESCOTT, ARIZONA STREET - MORNING

David is walking down the street staring into various
stores.  He stops in front of a pharmacy.  There's a
sign that says:  "DELIVERY MAN WANTED."  David enters
the store.

							CUT TO:


46	INT. PHARMACY

David approaches PHARMACIST.

		DAVID
	Hello?

		PHARMACIST
	Yes sir.

		DAVID
	The delivery job, I'm interested
	in it.

		PHARMACIST
	This is for your son?

		DAVID
	No, for me.

		PHARMACIST
	For you?  Well, you have your own
	car? -

		DAVID
	No.

		PHARMACIST
	Gee, I'm sorry, but it's a delivery
	job.  You would need a car.

		DAVID
	Well, I have transportation.  I
	own a motor home.

		PHARMACIST
	A motor home?

		DAVID
	Yes.

		PHARMACIST
	I don't really think that would
	suit this particular job.  I have
	just a few small deliveries a
	day.  Those things aren't too
	efficient and you probably wouldn't
	be able to pay for gas with what
	I'd pay you.

		DAVID
	Oh, I didn't know I'd have to pay
	for my own gas.

		PHARMACIST
	Yes.  Actually, my intention was
	to get a high school kid with a
	Rabbit or something.
	I think an older man with a motor
	home would be impractical for the
	both of us.  You understand, I don't
	have that many deliveries.  Also,
	you'd have trouble parking.  I
	don't think this would work out.

		DAVID
	I agree.

		PHARMACIST
	You know what I should do?  I should
	cross out "man" and put "boy,"
	"delivery boy" is more correct.
	I guess "delivery man" is misleading.

		DAVID
	No, the sign's alright.  It looks
	fine.  You don't know of any
	immensely high-paying jobs in the
	immediate area, do you?

		PHARMACIST
	Um, let me think.  No, not in the
	immediate area.

		DAVID
	What about in the outlying areas?

		PHARMACIST
	Uh, no.  I don't know of any high-
	paying jobs anywhere in the whole
	country.  Do you?

		DAVID
	Um, no.  Not now.  Well, good day.

		PHARMACIST
	Good day to you.

		DAVID
	Is there an employment agency in
	this town?

		PHARMACIST
	Yes.  Just continue down this
	street about half a mile.  It's
	a small building but you can't
	miss it.

							CUT TO:


47 	INT. EMPLOYMENT OFFICE

It's a small employment agency befitting a small town.
David is just sitting and waiting his turn along with
various other types.  David looks a little out of
place in that the others look like they want some job
relating to alcohol.  The AGENT steps out of a small
glass cubicle and asks David to step in.  David does
and sits down.

		AGENT
	So.  What can we do for you?

		DAVID
	Well, I'm originally from Los
	Angeles and I'm now living here.
	I need a job.

		AGENT
	Alright.

He takes out a piece of paper and begins to write down
information.

		AGENT
		(continuing)
	What was your previous working
	experience?

		DAVID
	Well, for the last eight years I
	was a major executive with one of
	the biggest advertising agencies
	in the country.

		AGENT
	Oh, I see.  And your previous salary?

		DAVID
	Seventy thousand dollars.

	You said seventy thousand?

		DAVID
	Yes.

		AGENT
	Over how long a period are we
	talking about?

		DAVID
	A year.  Seventy thousand a year.

The Agent begins to laugh.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	What's so funny?

		AGENT
	Nothing.  That's very good.  So,
	what brings you around these parts?
	Trying to double up that income?

Agent laughs again.

		DAVID
	No.  I came here to live.  I
	wanted to change my life.

		AGENT
	You couldn't change your life
	on seventy thousand?

		DAVID
	Could we just get back to what
	we're doing here?

		AGENT
	Sure.  Uh, I don't think I have
	anything at all right now.  I
	mean the only thing I have, you
	wouldn't be interested in.  Why
	don't you check back with me in
	a month?

		DAVID
	Well, you don't know what I'd be
	interested in.  Why don't you just
	tell me what you have?

		AGENT
	I don't think that coming from
	your position and your salary
	you'd be interested in it.

		DAVID
	Well, you don't know me.  What is
	it?

		AGENT
	It's a crossing guard.

		DAVID
	A crossing guard?  You mean at a
	school?

		AGENT
	Yes.  Where else do you see them
	work?

		DAVID
	No, I just didn't know if there
	were different kinds.  Well, what
	does that pay?

		AGENT
	A hundred thousand dollars.

He starts to laugh.  David laughs along with him.

		DAVID
	But, really, what does it pay?

		AGENT
	It pays three twenty-five an hour,
	plus benefits.

		DAVID
	Benefits meaning what?

		AGENT
	Benefits meaning you can get a
	ride to and from work if you need
	it.

		DAVID
	Well, listen, I've just started
	looking for work and I don't want
	to rule anything out but I think
	I probably can find something where
	I can use my ability a bit more.
	Would you have another kind of
	file, like an executive box or
	something?

		AGENT
	What kind of box would that be?

		DAVID
	You know, a box of higher-paying
	jobs.

		AGENT
	My goodness, I forgot.  Sure.
	You mean the hundred thousand
	dollar box?

Agent begins to laugh again.

		DAVID
		(getting up)
	Well, I'm happy I could provide
	you with your morning's entertainment.
	You can laugh at me but let me
	tell you something.  I made a
	statement.  You understand what
	I'm saying?  I made a statement.

		AGENT
	A statement?

		DAVID
	Never mind.  Thank you.

		AGENT
	Thank you.  Good luck.

48     EXT. TRAILER PARK - LATER THAT DAY

David is walking dejectedly towards home.  Nancy is
inside fixing dinner.


49	INT. MOTOR HOME

As he enters, she turns around excited.  She runs up
and gives him a hug.

		NANCY
	Guess what?

		DAVID
		(perking up a bit;
		at least one of
		them sounds like
		they had success)
	A job?

		NANCY
	Sure looks like it.

		DAVID
	Fantastic!
		(he sits down)
	Tell me everything.  What is it?
	How much do you get?  When do
	you start?

		NANCY
	I won't know anything for sure
	until tomorrow.  I don't want to
	say anything until then.

		DAVID
	Oh come on!  Tell me?  At least
	tell me what the job is.

		NANCY
	Please.  We'll get all excited and
	then what if I don't get it?  Let's
	just wait.

		DAVID
	Just give me a hint!

		NANCY
	Well... alright.  I would be
	an assistant manager.

		DAVID
	Jesus!  After one day?  Assistant
	manager!  Where?

		NANCY
	That's all I'm saying. The manager's
	thinking it over.  He said he'll let
	me know tomorrow.  I don't want to
	jinx it.  Now, come on.  Let's hear
	about you.  What happened?

David can't get over the words "Assistant Manager."  His
own search hasn't brought him words of that caliber.
He hedges.

		DAVID
	Well, I'm not saying anything
	either, but I'll also know in
	the morning.

		NANCY
	I gave you a hint, you have to
	give me one.

		DAVID
	I can't.  I have too many leads.
	I've had many firm offers and
	right now I'm just mulling them
	over.

		NANCY
	What kind of offers?

		DAVID
	Listen, I think you're right, we're
	going to jinx this thing.  Let's
	just keep the mystery.  It's more
	exciting that way.

							CUT TO:


50	INT. SCHOOL BASEMENT - THE NEXT DAY

David is standing with an older MAN in front of a
locker.  The Man takes out a uniform.

		MAN
	Now, this won't fit you exactly
	'cause the fellow who had this
	before was about eighty and very
	heavy, but if you go up to the
	nurse's office they'll take it in.

		DAVID
	Thank you.

		MAN
	Now, I don't have the sign here,
	but do you understand?  It's stop
	on one side...

		DAVID
		(interrupts)
	Yes.  Go on the other.

		MAN
	No.  If you're going to interrupt
	me I'm not going to be able to
	explain it.  It's stop an one
	side and stop on the other.  It's
	just a stop sign.  So, when you
	want people to go you'll have to
	hide the sign.

		DAVID
	That's right. I remember.  You
	just put it down so people can't
	see.

		MAN
	That's right.  Behind your back
	is generally the best place.

		DAVID
	Yes.  I think, basically, this job
	hasn't changed since I went to
	school.

		MAN
	Aren't you a little young for this
	kind of work?

		DAVID
	I don't think so.  Why?

		MAN
	Well, all the other guards here
	have been in their late sixties or
	seventies.  We had one who was
	fifty once but that's as young
	as I can remember.

		DAVID
	Well, times are changing.  I
	mean stereotypes have to be
	broken sometime, don't they?

		MAN
	I guess they do.  I never thought
	they did but yeah, I guess they do.
	Okay.  Happy to have you here and I
	guess all you should know is that
	some of these children are rude.

		DAVID
	Well, all children are rude.

		MAN
	Well, these children are a little
	ruder than they used to be.  You
	see we had this cutback in the
	school lunch program and sometimes
	they're hungry.  And you know what
	happens when you're hungry?  You
	get a little bit ornery.  I guess
	what I'm saying is you'll need a
	little bit of tolerance.

		DAVID
	Oh, tolerance is my middle name.
	Believe me.

							CUT TO:


51	EXT. STREET SCENE - DAY

David is at the crosswalk.  He's leading a group of
CHILDREN across the street.  They are about twelve
years old.  Obviously, old enough to cross by them-
selves.  David greets them.  He wants to make a good
impression.  God knows why.

		DAVID
	Hello, children.  How was school?

		CHILD #1
	Screw you!

							CHILD #2
	Yeah.  Mind your own business.

		DAVID
	Ah.  You must be two of the hungry
	ones.

The Kids glare at him. David walks back across the
street alone. David is waiting. A bunch of KIDS, a
little older, about six of them, walk up.  One of them
says:

		OLDER KID #1
	Hey, who's the new Retardo?

		DAVID
	Oh, my goodness. More hungry
	children.  You want to cross the
	street?

		OLDER KID #1
	Yeah, Retardo.

		DAVID
	My name is David. I would appreciate
	not being called that name.  It's an
	ugly name.

		OLDER KID #2
	Ugly name for an ugly face.

		DAVID
	I see no reason to walk future
	prisoners across the street.  Why
	don't you get some practice working
	on your own right now since you'll
	probably be in solitary most of your
	life.  You can handle it.

		OLDER KID #2
	No, man.  That's what you're paid
	for.  Come on.  Take us across the
	street.

		DAVID
	No, I can't take you across the
	street and, also, I'm allowed to
	make judgments.  If I think someone
	shouldn't be allowed to cross the
	street I'm allowed to deny them
	that privilege.  So, if you want
	to cross, you'll have to cross on
	your own.

		OLDER KID #2
	Hey, no.  No, man.  You work for
	us.  Let's go.

		DAVID
	What do you mean let's go? Is
	that a threat?  Be careful. I've
	got a metal sign here.

		OLDER KID #2
		(takes out a knife)
	Yeah?  I've got a metal knife.

		DAVID
	Knife wins.  Come on.

He leads them across the street.  David walks back alone,
mumbling.  He sits in his little chair.  There's no
action and no children.  Cars are passing by.  A new
black MERCEDES SCREECHES UP.  The passenger window is
electrically lowered.  A GUY, in his early 30's, calls
to David.

		DRIVER
	Mister?

		DAVID
	Call me David.  I'm your age.  I
	look a little older because I'm
	in this uniform.

		DRIVER
	David, how do I get out of this
	place?  Actually, what is this
	place?

		DAVID
	What do you mean?

		DRIVER
	What town is this?

		DAVID
	Prescott.

		DRIVER
	Jesus Christ.  I'm lost.  How do
	I get to Phoenix?

		DAVID
	You have to get on Highway 90.  So,
	what you do is go down about two
	miles, you'll come to a stoplight,
	you turn right and keep going and
	you'll see a sign.

		DRIVER
	Two miles down and then right?

		DAVID
	That's it.

		DRIVER
	Thanks, man.

		DAVID
	Hold it.

David approaches the car.  He sticks his head inside and
starts sniffing, rather intensely.

		DRIVER
	What are you doing?  Stop doing
	that.  Get away.

		DAVID
	I'm just smelling the interior.
	This is leather, isn't it?

		DRIVER
	It's Mercedes Leather.  They call
	it leather but it's vinyl.  Smells
	like leather, though.  Huh?

		DAVID
		(still sniffing)
	Yeah it does.  You like this car?

		DRIVER
	What's not to like?  Hey, thanks,
	man.  See ya.

He floors it and tears off into the distance.  David
watches the car slowly disappear.  He's still sniffing.

		DAVID
		(to himself)
	It smelled like leather.  They
	must spray it with something.

Interrupting David's thought is a CHILD'S VOICE coming
from behind him.

		CHILD
	Hey, Retardo!  Over here!

		DAVID
		(to himself)
	Without even looking I'm sure he
	means me.

							CUT TO:


52	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHTTIME

David enters.  Nancy is taking off her coat.  David can
see that she has on a uniform.  It's a candy-striped
short skirt and blouse.  Also, she has on a candy-
striped apron and hat.  It looks familiar but David
can't quite place it.

		DAVID
	Hi.

Nancy turns around.

		NANCY
	My God!  You scared me.

They stare at each other, each looking at the other's
uniform.

		NANCY
		(continuing)
	You got your job?

		DAVID
	Yes.  Did you get yours?

		NANCY
	Yes.  Yes, I did.

		DAVID
	Is that a uniform you're wearing?

		NANCY
	Of course.  What did you think, I
	bought this?

		DAVID
	What do you do?

		NANCY
	I work at Burger King.  I got
	it.  I'm the assistant manager.

		DAVID
	Burger King?

		NANCY
	The reason I wasn't sure last
	night was because the manager said
	he needed time to sleep on it, but
	this morning he told me he made his
	decision as soon as I left.  He just
	didn't know how to get hold of me.

		DAVID
	Hold it a second.  Burger King?
	The hamburger place?

Just after David finishes this sentence, we hear the
TOILET FLUSH.  Out comes SKIP, a nineteen-year-old boy,
dressed in the male version of the same uniform Nancy
is wearing.  Skip is one of those kids who talks like
he's from Torrance, through his nose, blending all syl-
lables into one, a kid whose speech could mask his
intelligence, if there was intelligence to be masked.

		DAVID
		(continuing)
	Nancy, who's this child?

		NANCY
	Oh.  This is Skip.  He's the
	manager.  He wanted to see
	where we live.

David just stares.  His image of the "Manager" was
obviously way off.

		SKIP
	Hey, thanks, Nancy.  Wow, this is
	like a real home.  Now, when you
	flush the toilet, where does it go?

Before Nancy can answer, Skip sees David.

		SKIP
		(continuing)
	Oh, wow!  Who's the crossing guard?

		NANCY
	That's what you are!  A crossing
	guard!  I couldn't place it.  That's
	wonderful!  You're working with
	children!

		DAVID
	I'm walking with children.  There's
	a difference, but we'll talk about
	it later.  Now, tell me again.
	This child is who?

		NANCY
	This is Skip.  He's the manager.

		DAVID
	The manager?  This is who slept
	on it?

Skip stretches his hand out eagerly wiping it first
on his pants, just to make sure it's clean.

		SKIP
	Hey, it's nice to meet you.  Call
	me Skippy, though, huh?  That's what
	my friends call me.  Hey, your wife's
	really something.  Man, I think what
	you're both doing is amazing.  She
	told me all about it.  It's really
	great.  You've got a lot of courage.
	It blew my mind.  I'll tell ya, man,
	when I get old, I sure hope I drop
	out.  It really sounds neat.  Hey,
	did she tell ya what happened today?

		NANCY
		(a little embarrassed)
	David just got home, Skip.  I'll
	tell him later.

		DAVID
	No.  Let Skippy tell it.   I want
	to hear him talk some more.

		SKIPPY
	Hey, thanks.  Well, you know the
	fry machine?  We were never using
	it right.  See, no one ever told
	us.  I mean we did everything the
	instructions said.  You know, we
	put the oil in and everything, but
	we took the fries out, like, much
	too soon and no one knew.  And
	your wife said, "Hey, these are
	frozen in the middle."  And then
	we took them outside and we looked
	at 'em in the sun and she was
	right!  They were still frozen.
	She spotted it on the first day!
	Do you believe it?

		DAVID
	And how long were you making them
	the other way?

		SKIPPY
	Oh, I don't know, a little less
	than a year.

		DAVID
	Nancy, where are the keys?

		NANCY
	They're in the ignition.  Why?

							CUT TO:


53 	INT. MOTOR HOME

We are somewhere outside of Prescott.  David and Nancy
are driving along.  They are still in their Burger King
and crossing guard outfits, but obviously they have left
their first home.  Nancy has a map in her hand.  She's
looking it over.

		NANCY
	You know I think Denver could be
	a good place to go.

		DAVID
	Denver, huh?

		NANCY
	Well, it's bigger.  We do need a
	bigger city.

		DAVID
	We certainly do.  Sweetheart,
	let's talk for a second.

		NANCY
	What?

		DAVID
	I love you very much.  You know
	that, don't you?

		NANCY
	I love you, too.

		DAVID
	Well, I think it's wonderful that
	we could say this and mean it.  Do
	you know that ever since we were
	married I just was waiting for us
	to get divorced?  I never thought
	we would make it, ever.  But now
	I do.

		NANCY
	I know.  I feel the same way.

		DAVID
	Well, my God, that's wonderful.
	I mean the experiences that we
	went through in the last two weeks,
	it did that.  It showed us that
	we're going to be married forever.
	Nancy, we're together for the rest
	of our lives and I'm so grateful
	to finally have that peace of
	mind. It's wonderful.

		NANCY
	I told you this would all be a
	blessing.

		DAVID
	I know you did.  But now, let's
	talk facts.  Our nest egg broke.
	Forget who did it, no blame.
	That's not the point.  The point
	is we didn't split up.
	We stayed together and decided to
	rebuild.  And it was the best
	decision we ever made.  Because
	for the first time we really know
	how to share.  Whatever we have we
	can enjoy it together.

		NANCY
	But we don't have anything.

		DAVID
	There!  Now we're getting to it.
	This afternoon I was guiding some
	children across the street and I
	realized something.  Given our age,
	and the years we have left together,
	and the way we're going about this
	rebuilding program, we will never
	have another egg in our lifetime.

		NANCY
	I was thinking the same thing.

		DAVID
	Really?

		NANCY
	Yes.  As a matter-of-fact, I began
	thinking what we might do to speed
	things up.

		DAVID
	That's amazing.  So was I.  Denver?
	Is that what Denver is about?

		NANCY
	No.  Not exactly.  I was just kind
	of thinking of a general plan.

		DAVID
	Me too.

		NANCY
	Great.  What?

		DAVID
	Well, you tell me yours first.

		NANCY
		(hesitating)
	No, you go first.

		DAVID
	No.  I'm almost embarrassed to
	tell you, mine's like a last resort.

		NANCY
	Don't be embarrassed.  What is it?

		DAVID
		(hesitating)
	Well...

		NANCY
	Come on.

		DAVID
	Okay.  I thought we'd just get to
	New York as fast as we can...

		NANCY
		(interrupts)
	And you eat shit?

		DAVID
	Your plan too, huh?

		NANCY
	Exactly.

		DAVID
	We really are a team.

		NANCY
	We certainly are.

54 	EXT./INT. MOTOR HOME - MONTAGE - DAY

It does a fast U-turn away from the northern direction
and begins heading east.  They are now on their way
to New York going as fast as they can.  As they do the
THEME from the commercial "I LOVE NEW YORK" BEGINS TO
PLAY.  It grows and grows in intensity as David and
Nancy cross the United States.  Their trip from Arizona
to New York will take place in a space of about thirty
seconds.  States whiz by.  Signs "ENTERING MISSOURI"
"LEAVING MISSOURI" "ENTERING VIRGINIA," "LEAVING
VIRGINIA," all taking place in a period of seconds.  The
MUSIC is getting more intense. It's now filling our
ears. VOICES BEGIN SINGING, "I LOVE NEW YORK."

We see the mobile home approaching the George Washington
Bridge.  As it enters the tollbooth we...

							CUT TO:


56	EXT. MADISON AVENUE - SNOW

It's Monday morning, 8:45.  Thousands of New Yorkers
are filing into their offices.  We see the motor home
pull up in front of the advertising agency.  Hundreds of
people are entering this building.  We see that one of
these people is Brad Tooley, the baldheaded man David
was supposed to work under. From a LONG SHOT, we see
David exit the motor home. He's still in his crossing
guard uniform.  He's been up for three days, taking No
Doz and drinking hundreds of cups of coffee.  He looks
like hell.  He runs down the street and corners Brad
near the front entrance.  Brad sees David.  He's scared.
He can't believe it. He starts to run.  He tries to
escape.  David turns after him.  All this is shown in a
LONG SHOT, with the busy Madison Avenue traffic in the
foreground.  We hear David yelling:

		DAVID
	Brad, I made it!  Three weeks on
	the button! Let's go to work.
	We got Fords to sell!

Brad looks frightened. He'd like to get away but he
can't.  David catches up to him.  He grabs him around
the waist.  He drops to his knees.  He begins to plead.
As New Yorkers pass by going about their business, we
see David begging.  Brad just staring down at him.

OVER THIS SCENE the following CRAWL appears on the screen:

	"Most people lead their entire lives
		without ever having the courage to
	break the mold, to find out who they
	really are and what life is all about.

	Those that do should take Route 16.
	This goes through Utah, avoiding the state
	of Nevada completely."
