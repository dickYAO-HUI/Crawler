				SEQUENCE "A"

FADE IN:

A-1 THE MAN-MADE MOUNTAIN PEAKS OF MANHATTAN

on a sunny day in October, 1938. THE CAMERA PANS ACROSS the 
distant ridge of midtown buildings, then slowly FINDS A 
FOREGROUND: THE REAR OF A SMALL APARTMENT HOUSE on East 55th 
Street.

It is a 4-story affair of brick, housing some eight 
apartments, half of them giving on the garden or rather on 
the routine back yard with a sumac tree, a stone bench, and 
some mouldy flower boxes in which geraniums are dying.

THE MOVING CAMERA CONCENTRATES on the 4th-floor apartment, 
which boasts three windows. Two of them give on the living 
room, one on the bedroom of the brothers Birnam. THE CAMERA 
NARROWS its interest to THE BEDROOM WINDOW.

It is open, like a million other windows in New York that 
warm day. What gives it individuality is that from an awning 
cleat there dangles down the outside wall something which 
very few people hang from their windows: a bottle of whiskey.

Through the window we can see the brothers Birnam packing.

A-2 INT. BEDROOM

It is a smallish room with twin beds in opposite corners, 
both of them unmade. There are books on the night tables, 
two chests of drawers with some of the drawers open, and the 
closet is open too. One door leads to the living room, another 
to the cramped entrance hall.

(Maybe this is the time to describe the apartment. You've 
seen that living room a hundred times if you know literate, 
artistically inclined people. On one wall are bookshelves 
surrounding a marble fireplace, on which stands a tiny plaster 
bust of Shakespeare. In the shelves, art books and serious 
works of fiction: Thomas Mann, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James 
Joyce and the like. There are Picasso, Van Gogh and Utrillo 
reproductions on the other walls. A comfortable, elderly 
armchair stands near one of the windows. There is a studio 
couch, a low, tiled table -- oh, you know.

Off the living room is the familiar kitchenette for the light 
housekeeping of two bachelors -- i.e. coffee and coffee.

The bathroom, inconveniently enough, is off the entrance 
hall. A floor plan, authenticated by the author of the book, 
will be furnished on request).

To get back to the bedroom and the Birnam brothers: a small 
suitcase lies open on each bed. DON, the brother nearest the 
window, is bent over one, putting in socks, shirts, etc. He 
is thirty-three, an extremely attractive guy, but ten pounds 
underweight, and in his eye there is something rebellious, 
something sly.

WICK, two years younger, is much sturdier, kindly, 
sympathetic, solid gold. He wears glasses and is smoking a 
cigarette. He is on his way from the closet to his suitcase 
with some stuff. He throws a sweater across to Don.

			WICK
	Better take this along, Don. It's 
	going to be cold on the farm.

			DON
	Okay.

			WICK
	How many shirts are you taking?

			DON
	Three.

			WICK
	I'm taking five.

			DON
	Five?

			WICK
	I told them at the office I might 
	not be back till Tuesday. We'll get 
	there this afternoon. That'll give 
	us all Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 
	Monday. We'll make it a long weekend.

			DON
	Sounds long, all right.

			WICK
	It'll do you good, Don, after what 
	you've been through.

Don has crossed to the chest of drawers and fished out more 
shirts and socks.

			WICK
	Trees and grass and sweet cider and 
	buttermilk and water from that well 
	that's colder than any other water.

			DON
	Wick, please, why this emphasis on 
	liquids? Noble, upstanding, nauseating 
	liquids.

			WICK
	Sorry, Don.

DON, his back toward Wick, is bent over the suitcase, packing. 
His eyes travel to the window.

			DON
	Think it would be a good idea if we 
	took my typewriter?

			WICK
	What for?

			DON
		(Indignantly)
	To write. To write there. I'm going 
	to get started on my novel.

			WICK
	You really feel up to writing?

			DON
	Why not?

			WICK
	I mean, after what you've been 
	through.

			DON
	I haven't touched the stuff for ten 
	days now.

			WICK
	I know you haven't. Where's the 
	portable?

			DON
	In the living room closet, kind of 
	towards the back.

Bent forward tensely, he watches Wick go into the living 
room. Left alone, he acts with lightning rapidity. He takes 
the sweater, goes over to the window, pulls up the whiskey 
bottle, wraps the sweater around it so that only the top 
with the string around it shows. He tries to loosen the noose 
but he's nervous and loses a precious second.

From the living room has been coming the sound of Wick opening 
the closet door and ransacking. Now comes:

			WICK'S VOICE
	You sure it's in the closet? I can't 
	find it.

			DON
		(Working desperately)
	Look by the big chair.

			WICK'S VOICE
		(Approaching fast)
	Isn't it under your bed?

Don sees he can't loosen the string in time. In the last 
fraction of a second before Wick enters, he manages to lower 
the bottle back down the wall. With what nonchalance he can 
muster he bends down and looks under the bed just as Wick 
enters, a sheaf of white paper in his hand.

			DON
	Of course. Here it is.

He pulls out a Remington portable, 1930 model.

			WICK
	Here's some paper.

He puts it in Don's suitcase.

			WICK
	We'll fix a table on the south porch. 
	Nobody to disturb you -- I'll see to 
	it. Except maybe Saturday night we'll 
	go over to the Country Club.

			DON
	I'm not going near that Country Club.

			WICK
	Why not?

			DON
	Because they're a bunch of hypocrites 
	and I don't like to be whispered 
	about: Look who's here from New York. 
	The Birnam brothers -- or rather the 
	nurse and the invalid.

			WICK
	Stop that, Don. Nobody there knows 
	about you.

			DON
	No? We get off the train and the 
	alarm is sounded: The leper is back. 
	Better hide your liquor.

Footsteps have been racing up the stairs outside the flat, 
and now there is a distinctive ring of the doorbell: short, 
short, long, short.

			DON
	Helen.

			WICK
	I'll take it.

He goes toward the door while the bell resumes short, short, 
long, short.

From the bedroom we see him open the door. It's HELEN, all 
right. She is a clean-cut, good looking girl of twenty-six. 
Her face is brave, gay piquant. She's wearing a three-quarter-
length leopard coat. The Indian Summer day is a good ten 
degrees too warm for the coat, but that doesn't stop Helen 
from wearing her beloved. In her hand are two books wrapped, 
and another small package. She enters breathlessly.

			HELEN
	Hello, Wick. Where's Don?

Seeing him, she crosses to the bedroom.

			HELEN
	Glad I made it. I was afraid you 
	might be gone. Presents.

She puts the packages in the suitcase.

			HELEN
	The new Thurber book, with comical 
	jokes and pictures, and a quiet little 
	double murder by Agatha Christie.
		(Putting in the second 
			package)
	Cigarettes and chewing gum.

			DON
	Thanks, Helen.

			HELEN
	Now have a good time, darling. And 
	remember -- lots of sleep, lots of 
	milk --

			DON
	And sweet cider and some of that 
	nice cold water from the well.

			HELEN
	Bend down.

It's a running gag between these two. Don bends so that she 
can kiss him on the cheek.

			HELEN
	I'd better be going. I've missed ten 
	minutes of the concert already.

			DON
	What concert?

			HELEN
	Carnegie Hall. Barbirolli conducting. 
	They gave me two tickets at the 
	office.

			DON
	Who are you going with?

			HELEN
	Nobody.

Something flickers in Don's eye.

			DON
	What are they playing?

			HELEN
	Brahms' Second Symphony, something 
	by Beethoven, something by Handel, 
	and not one note of Grieg.

			DON
	Sounds wonderful.

			HELEN
	Goodbye, boys. See you Monday.

			WICK
	Tuesday.

			DON
		(Holding Helen by the 
			arm)
	Just a minute. Wick --

Wick looks up.

			DON
	I just had a crazy idea.

			WICK
	As for instance.

			DON
	Who says we have to take the two-
	forty-five train? We could go on the 
	six-thirty.

			WICK
	What are you talking about?

			DON
	I just thought we could take a later 
	train and Helen wouldn't have to go 
	alone to the concert. She's got two 
	tickets, hasn't she?

			HELEN
	No. I'm not upsetting any plans. 
	You're going on that two-forty-five.

			DON
	But Helen, it's so silly! A whale of 
	a concert and an empty seat next 
	you.

			WICK
	No, Don. Everything's all set. They'll 
	be at the station to meet us. 
	Dinner'll be waiting.

			DON
	So what? We put in a call that we're 
	taking the late train, have supper 
	at nine o'clock, be in bed by ten.

			WICK
	Nothing doing. We're going.

			HELEN
	Wick's right. And don't worry about 
	that empty seat. I'll find myself a 
	very handsome South American 
	millionaire.

			DON
	There. Did you hear her? And now 
	we'd have to break our necks to catch 
	the train anyway.

			HELEN
		(Looking at her wrist 
			watch)
	Two-twenty.

			DON
	See?

			WICK
		(Giving up)
	All right. Go ahead.

			DON
	Wait a minute. I'm not going.

			WICK
	Then what are we talking about?

			DON
	I want you to go. You and Helen.

			WICK
	Me and Helen?

			DON
	Yes. That was the idea. Who likes 
	Brahms, you or I?

			WICK
	Since when don't you like Brahms?

			DON
	I'll stay right here and finish 
	packing. Take a little nap maybe.

			WICK
	Nonsense. If anybody goes... Helen's 
	your girl.

There is an exchange of suspicious looks between Wick and 
Helen.

			HELEN
	There's something in that, Don.

			WICK
	What's more, I don't think you should 
	be left alone.

			DON
	I shouldn't?

			WICK
	No.

			HELEN
	Really, Don.

			DON
	Why? I can't be trusted. Is that it?

			WICK
	What I meant to say --

			HELEN
	Wick.

			WICK
	After what Don's been through --

			DON
	After what I've been through, I 
	couldn't go to a concert. I couldn't 
	face the crowd. I couldn't sit through 
	it with all those people around. I 
	want to be alone for a couple of 
	hours and kind of assemble myself. 
	Is that such an extraordinary thing 
	to want?

			WICK
	Don't act so outraged, would you 
	mind?

			DON
	All right. Anything else?

			HELEN
	Please, boys.

Wick, who has been smoking a cigarette throughout the scene, 
throws it out the window. None of the three see, but we do, 
that it doesn't fall out the window but ricochets against 
the opened casement to the window sill, where it lies 
smouldering.

			WICK
	Come on, Helen.

			HELEN
	You'll stay right here, won't you?

			DON
	Where would I go?

			HELEN
	Then you'll be here when we come 
	back?

			DON
	I told you I'm not leaving this 
	apartment.

			WICK
	You've told us a good many things, 
	Don.

Furious, Don takes a bunch of keys from his pocket.

			DON
	All right, if you don't believe me, 
	why don't you take my key and lock 
	me in like a dog.

			HELEN
		(To Wick)
	We've got to trust Don. That's the 
	only way.

			WICK
	Sorry, Don.
		(To Helen)
	Here we go.

			HELEN
	So long, Don.

			DON
	So long.

			HELEN
		(Pulling him by the 
			lapel)
	Bend down.

His face is now close to hers. She kisses him. Wick turns 
away. His eyes fall on the cigarette still smouldering on 
the sill. He goes toward the window.

Don, held by Helen, watches him tensely. Wick flips the 
cigarette into the garden and is about to turn back into the 
room when his eyes fall on the cleat and the string. He leans 
from the window.

Don lets Helen go, staring at Wick, panic in his eyes. Helen, 
sensing something amiss, looks from one brother to the other.

			WICK
		(Hauling up the bottle)
	What's this, Don?

Helen and Wick watch Don. Don's face relaxes into an innocent 
grin.

			DON
	That? That's whiskey, isn't it?

			WICK
	How did it get there?

			DON
	I don't know.

			WICK
	I suppose it dropped from some cloud. 
	Or someone was bouncing it against 
	this wall and it got stuck.

			DON
	I must have put it there.

			WICK
	Yes, you must.

			DON
	Only I don't remember when. Probably 
	during my last spell, or maybe the 
	one before.

His eyes meet Helen's. Hers are infinitely distressed.

			DON
	Don't look at me like that, Helen. 
	Doesn't mean a thing. I didn't know 
	it was there. And if I had, I wouldn't 
	have touched it.

Wick has twisted the string off the bottle.

			WICK
	Then you won't mind.

			DON
	Won't mind what?

Wick, the bottle in his hand, goes through the living room 
toward the kitchenette. Don looks after him, then follows 
him, a stubborn smile on his lips. Helen trails after them, 
acutely embarrassed.

A-3 KITCHENETTE

Wick has stepped to the sink. He opens the bottle, turns it 
upside down and lets the whiskey run out. Don and Helen come 
to the door from the living room and stand watching. Don has 
something of the feeling of a man watching the execution of 
a very good friend, but he senses Helen's eyes upon him and 
preserves his nonchalant expression. The bottle emptied, 
Wick puts it in the sink.

			WICK
	Now you trot along with Helen.

			DON
	Why? On account of that?
		(Pointing at the bottle)
	You think I wanted you out of the 
	apartment because of that? I resent 
	that like the devil, and if there's 
	one more word of discussion, I don't 
	leave on your blasted weekend.

			HELEN
	Let's go.

Wick shrugs and goes to the hall for his hat.

			HELEN
		(To Don)
	Be good, won't you, Don, darling?

She turns to go, but Don holds her back.

			DON
	Of course, Helen. Just stop watching 
	me all the time, you two. Let me 
	work it out my way. I'm trying, I'm 
	trying.

			HELEN
	We're both trying, Don. You're trying 
	not to drink, and I'm trying not to 
	love you.

She kisses him on the mouth, a woman hopelessly in love. 
Then, so that he won't see her moist eyes, she turns and 
hurries into the entrance hall.

A-4 LITTLE ENTRANCE HALL - BIRNAM APARTMENT

Wick stands, hat in hand, holding the door open. Helen comes 
out quickly and taking a handkerchief from her bag, hurries 
past Wick into the hall. Wick turns toward Don, who has 
followed Helen to the entrance hall.

			WICK
	You call the farm, Don. Tell them 
	we're taking the six-thirty train.

			DON
	Sure.

			WICK
	So long.

He goes out, shutting the door behind him. Don steps quickly 
to the door, presses his ear against it to hear what the two 
are saying outside.

A-5 FOURTH FLOOR HALL AND STAIRCASE - APARTMENT HOUSE

It is narrow and simple. There is no elevator. A skylight, 
somewhat obscured by dirt and dust, lights the fourth floor 
back. Every so often down the stair there is a light bracket, 
always burning.

Helen stands at the top of the stairs, blowing her nose. 
Wick takes her arm quickly.

			WICK
	Come on, Helen.

			HELEN
	Oh, Wick, what are we going to do 
	about him ever.

			WICK
	He'll be all right.

			HELEN
	What if he goes out and buys another 
	bottle?

			WICK
	With what? He hasn't a nickel. There 
	isn't a store, there isn't a bar 
	that'd give him five cents' worth of 
	credit.

They descend a few steps.

			HELEN
	Are you sure he hasn't another bottle 
	hidden somewhere?

			WICK
	Not any more, he hasn't. I went 
	through the apartment with a fine-
	toothed comb. The places he can figure 
	out!

They go on down the stairs.

A-6 INT. THE APARTMENT

Don stands at the door, panic in his face. Has his brother 
discovered the other two bottles? He puts the chain on the 
door to insure his privacy, then dashes into the bathroom.

A-7 BATHROOM - BIRNAM APARTMENT

It's old-fashioned, with a bath tub on claw feet, a shower 
cutain above it -- all the plumbing on that scale. Don dashes 
in, takes a nail file, kneels beside the grille of a register 
in the side wall, pries it out with the file, looks inside, 
puts his hand in. The bottle is gone. He looks at the hole 
wide-eyed, pushes back the grille and runs out.

A-8

Don comes running in, goes to the couch, pulls it away from 
the wall, throws himself on his belly on the couch and reaches 
under the side of it which was towards the wall. His hand 
explores among the springs. There is no bottle there. He 
sits up. His face is covered with sweat. He takes out his 
handkerchief and wipes his face.

Just then, from the direction of the entrance door, there is 
the noise of a key being turned in the lock. Don freezes, 
his eyes turning towards the door, horrified.

A-9 ENTRANCE DOOR TO THE APARTMENT (FROM DON'S ANGLE)

It opens as far as the chain will allow, stops with a sharp 
bite of metal on wood. There is another try. Then the doorbell 
is rung.

He has not stirred. He rises slowly from the couch, takes a 
few steps towards the entrance door.

			DON
	Who is it?

No answer. Just the doorbell being rung again.

			DON
	WHO IS IT?

A-11 CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BIRNAM APARTMENT

At the door stands MRS. FOLEY, a middle-aged charwoman with 
a large utility bag over her arm. Her key is in the door, 
which is open as far as the chain will permit.

			MRS. FOLEY
	Mrs. Foley. Come to clean up.

A-12 DON

			DON
		(His nerves on edge)
	Not today. Does it have to be today?

A-13 MRS. FOLEY

			MRS. FOLEY
	I ought to change the sheets, and 
	today's my day to vacuum.

A-14 DON

			DON
	You can't come in. I'm not dressed.

A-15 MRS. FOLEY

			MRS. FOLEY
	Shall I wait, shall I come back, or 
	what?

			DON'S VOICE
	You come on Monday.

			MRS. FOLEY
	All right, Mr. Birnam. Is your brother 
	here?

			DON'S VOICE
	No, he isn't.

			MRS. FOLEY
	How about my money? Didn't he leave 
	my money?

A-16 DON

He stands galvanized. The word "money" has sent an electric 
current through his mind.

			DON
	What money?

			MRS. FOLEY
	My five dollars. Didn't he leave it?

			DON
		(Stalking his prey)
	Probably. Where would he leave it?

			MRS. FOLEY'S VOICE
	In the kitchen.

			DON
	Where in the kitchen?

			MRS. FOLEY'S VOICE
	In the sugar bowl.

Don breathes like one who's found the combination to the 
safe with the crown jewels.

			DON
	Just a minute.

He goes to the kitchenette.

A-17 KITCHENETTE

On the counter under the cupboards stands the sugar bowl. 
Don lifts the lid. There's nothing but sugar in the bowl, 
but lining the lid is a folded five-dollar bill. Don takes 
it out, goes into the entrance hall and even though Mrs. 
Foley can't see him, instinctively holds the five dollars 
behind his back.

			DON
	Sorry, Mrs. Foley. It's not there. 
	He must have forgotten.

A-18 MRS. FOLEY

			MRS. FOLEY
	Oh, Putt! I wanted to do some 
	shopping.

			DON'S VOICE
	You'll get it Monday all right.

			MRS. FOLEY
	Goodbye, Mr. Birnam.

She closes the door, takes the key and starts down the stairs.

A-19 DON

He brings the five dollars from behind his back. He looks at 
it, folds it neatly, pockets it, puts on his hat, then, with 
an afterthought, goes into the living room. He pushes the 
couch back against the wall with his foot, then goes out.

A-20 FOURTH FLOOR HALL AND STAIRS

Don goes to the balustrade, looks down.

A-21 STEEP SHOT OF THE STAIRS

Don's head in the foreground. The coast is clear of Mrs. 
Foley. Like a convict escaping, Don slips down the stairs.

									SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

A-22 BROPHY'S LIQUOR STORE - (TRANSP.) - CLOSE SHOT OF LIQUOR 
BOTTLES

A rackful of them, filling the screen. THE CAMERA IS BEHIND 
the rack of liquor in a store on Third Avenue. THE CAMERA 
MOVES slowly toward them so that only about eight bottles 
fill the screen and we can see, between them, the shop, its 
window on Third Avenue, its entrance door. No one is visible 
in the shop.

Through the glass door we see Don Birnam hurrying up. He 
gives a quick glance in each direction, to see that he's not 
observed. He peers into the shop to make sure there are no 
other customers, then quickly steps inside and stands 
breathing heavily.

A salesman rises in the foreground, his back to the CAMERA. 
Don points to two bottles in the foreground.

			DON
		(With all the 
			nonchalance he can 
			scrape together)
	Two bottles of rye.

			SALESMAN
	I'm sorry, Mr. Birnam.

			DON
	What are you sorry about?

			SALESMAN
	Your brother was in here. He said 
	he's not going to pay for you any 
	more. That was the last time.

			DON
	He won't, huh?

He takes the five dollars from his pocket and unfurls it, 
like a card trickster.

			DON
	Two bottles of rye.

			SALESMAN
	What brand?

			DON
	You know what brand, Mr. Brophy. The 
	cheapest.

			SALESMAN
	All right.

			DON
	None of that twelve-year-old, aged-
	in-the-wood chichi. Not for me. Liquor 
	is all one, anyway.

The salesman has taken two bottles from the rack in the 
foreground and put them on the counter. Don gives him the 
money and picks up the bottles like a miser grabbing gold.

			SALESMAN
	Don't you want a bag?

			DON
	Yes, I want a bag.

The salesman hands him a bag and steps out of the shot towards 
the cash register. We hear the ping of its bell, the opening 
of its drawer. Meanwhile, Don thrusts the bottles in the 
bag. It is a little short and the necks of the bottles 
protrude. The salesman hands him his change. Don pockets it.

			SALESMAN
	You know, your brother asked me not 
	to sell you anything even if you had 
	money, but I can't stop nobody, can 
	I, not unless you're a minor.

			DON
	I'm not a minor, Mr. Brophy, and 
	just to quiet your conscience, I'm 
	buying this as a refill for my 
	cigarette lighter.

Another customer enters the shop. Don takes the package and 
walks past the newcomer towards the door, hiding it from him 
gracefully, like a football in a sneak play.

A-23 THIRD AVENUE, OUTSIDE BROPHY'S LIQUOR SHOP

Don comes out with the bottles in the paper bag. He wants to 
start down the street but about twenty-five feet away stand 
two middle-aged Hokinson ladies, one of them kerbing her dog 
on a leash. They are chatting.

Don stops. He'll have to pass them if he goes down the street 
and he doesn't want to, not with these bottles peeking out 
of that bag. He turns back and approaches the grocery store 
next door to Brophy's. In front of it is a fruit stand. 
Screening his gesture from the ladies with his back, he picks 
up three apples and puts them in the top of the bag, to 
camouflage the bottles. He puts down a coin, then walks down 
the street toward the ladies, flaunting a paper bag which is 
obviously full of apples.

The lady with the dog sees him. Don removes his hat in a 
courtly bow, very much at ease with the apples.

			DON
	Good afternoon, Mrs. Deveridge.

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
	Hello, Mr. Birnam.

Don passes the ladies.

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
		(Confidentially, to 
			her companion)
	That's that nice young man that 
	drinks.

The other lady tsk-tsks. They both look after Don.

Don is about ten feet beyond them. Perhaps he has overheard 
the remark. In any case, he is looking back. His look meets 
theirs. Embarrassed, they turn. Mrs. Deveridge jerks on the 
leash.

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
	Come on, Sophie. Let's go.

They walk down the street in the opposite direction from 
Don.

A-24 DON

He looks after them. He is just in front of NAT'S BAR. He 
steps hurriedly into the bar.

A-25 INT. NAT'S BAR

A typical dingy Third Avenue bar. The sun slants dustily 
into the walnut-brown room. There is a long bar with a mirror 
behind it, some marble-topped tables and bentwood chairs. 
The woodwork, the furniture, the plaster of the place have 
absorbed and give forth a sour breath of hard liquor, a stale 
smell of flat beer.

As Don enters with the two bottles and the apples, there are 
three people in the bar. Nat, the bartender, a broad-
shouldered, no-nonsense type of guy, squeezing lemons in 
preparation for the evening trade; and, sitting at a table 
in the corner, a girl named GLORIA, with an out-of-towner 
who hasn't bothered to take off his hat. He's about fifty 
and the manager of a hardware store in Elizabeth, New Jersey. 
Gloria is a shopworn twenty-three. She's brunette, wears net 
stockings and a small patent leather hat, and is a little 
below the standards of the St. Moritz lobby trade.

Don crosses to the bar.

			DON
	And how is my very good friend Nat 
	today?

			NAT
		(On guard)
	Yes, Mr. Birnam.

Don sits on a bar stool, putting down the paper bag.

			DON
	This being an especially fine 
	afternoon, I have decided to ask for 
	your hand in marriage.

			NAT
		(Wiping his hands)
	Look, Mr. Birnam --

			DON
	If that is your attitude, Nat, I 
	shall have to drown my sorrows in a 
	jigger of rye. Just one, that's all.

			NAT
	Can't be done, Mr. Birnam.

			DON
	Can't? Let me guess why. My brother 
	was here, undermining my financial 
	structure.

			NAT
	I didn't tell him nothing about the 
	wrist watch you left here, or your 
	cuff links.

			DON
	Thank you, Nat. Today, you'll be 
	glad to know, we can barter on a 
	cash basis.

He takes the bills and change from his pocket, puts it on 
the bar.

			NAT
		(Reaching for the 
			bottle and the jigger)
	One straight rye.

			DON
	That was the idea.

Nat pours the drink, then returns to squeezing lemons. Don 
picks up the glass, is suddenly acutely aware of the people 
at the table, of Nat's eyes. The glass freezes halfway to 
his mouth. He puts it down and starts playing the nonchalant, 
casual drinker -- the man who can take it or leave it. He 
fingers the glass, turning it round and round. He takes a 
pack of cigarettes from his pocket and shakes one out, lights 
it. As he puts the match in the ashtray, his eyes fall on 
that jigger of whiskey. It's hard to resist it any longer. 
He takes a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes his forehead, 
then his parched mouth. The time has come now. He puts the 
handkerchief back in his pocket, lifts the glass and drains 
it in one gulp. Actually, Don doesn't like the taste of 
liquor, actively hates it indeed, as a one-legged man might 
hate the sight of his crutches but need them in order to 
walk.

Now that he has the drink in him, a kind of relieved grin 
comes back to Don's face. He holds the empty jigger in his 
hand. Nat has come up with the bar towel to wipe off the wet 
ring left by the glass.

			DON
	Don't wipe it away, Nat. Let me have 
	my little vicious circle. The circle 
	is the perfect geometric figure. No 
	end, no beginning... What time is 
	it?

			NAT
	Quarter of four.

			DON
	Good. That gives us the whole 
	afternoon together.
		(He holds out his 
			glass for another 
			drink)
	Only remind me when it's a quarter 
	of six. Very important. We're going 
	to the country for a weekend, my 
	brother and I.

From the table in the background comes Gloria, headed for 
the powder room. Passing Don, she runs her finger through 
the neckline of his hair.

			GLORIA
	Hello, Mr. Birnam. Glad to have you 
	back with the organization.

			DON
	Hello, Gloria.

She goes on. Don turns back to Nat.

			DON
	Not just a Saturday-Sunday weekend. 
	A very long weekend. I wish I could 
	take you along, Nat. You --
		(With a gesture towards 
			the liquor shelves)
	and all that goes with you.

Without a change of expression, Nat pours the second drink.

			DON
	Not that I'm cutting myself off from 
	civilization altogether.

He points at the bag with the apples showing. Nat looks, but 
doesn't get it. Like a magician, Don takes two apples out, 
revealing the necks of the bottles.

			DON
		(Gulping down the 
			whiskey)
	Now of course there arises the problem 
	of transportation into the country. 
	How to smuggle these two time bombs 
	past the royal guard. I shall tell 
	you how, Nat, because I'm so fond of 
	you. Only give me another drink.

Nat pours one.

			DON
	I'm going to roll one bottle in a 
	copy of the Saturday Evening Post, 
	so my brother can discover it like 
	that.
		(He snaps his fingers)
	And I want him to discover it, because 
	that'll set his mind at rest. The 
	other bottle --
		(Confidentially to 
			Nat)
	Come here.

Nat leans over the bar towards --

			DON
	That one I'm tucking into my dear 
	brother's suitcase. He'll transport 
	it himself, without knowing it, of 
	course. While he's greeting the care-
	taker, I'll sneak it out and hide it 
	in a hollow of the old apple tree.

			NAT
	Aw, Mr. Birnam, why don't you lay 
	off the stuff for a while.

			DON
	I may never touch it while I'm there. 
	Not a drop. What you don't understand, 
	all of you, is that I've got to know 
	it's around. That I can have it if I 
	need it. I can't be cut off 
	completely. That's the devil. That's 
	what drives you crazy.

			NAT
	Yeah. I know a lot of guys like that. 
	They take a bottle and put it on the 
	shelf. All they want is just to look 
	at it. They won't even carry a cork-
	screw along, just to be sure. Only 
	all of a sudden they grab the bottle 
	and bite off the neck.

			DON
	Nat, one more reproving word and I 
	shall consult our lawyer about a 
	divorce.

He points to the empty glass for Nat to fill it. Nat pours 
another jigger.

			DON
	Quarter of six. Don't forget. My 
	brother must find me at home, ready 
	and packed.

Gloria is back from the powder room. On her way to her 
gentleman friend at the table, she runs her finger through 
the neckline of Don's hair. She is almost past him when he 
catches her hand and pulls her towards him.

			DON
	Shall we dance?

			GLORIA
	You're awfully pretty, Mr. Birnam.

			DON
	You say that to all the boys.

			GLORIA
	Why, natch. Only with you it's on 
	the level.

			DON
	Is it? Whatever became of your 
	manicurist job?

			GLORIA
	I've still got it. Only I find I 
	can't work more than four hours a 
	day, three days a week. It's too 
	tough on your eyes, all those little 
	hangnails.

			DON
	Sit down.

			GLORIA
	No thanks. Thanks a lot, but no 
	thanks. There's somebody waiting.

Don looks off toward the table.

			DON
	Him? I bet he wears arch supporters.

			GLORIA
	He's just an old friend of the folks. 
	Lovely gentleman. Buys me dimpled 
	Scotch.

			DON
	He should buy you Indian rubies, and 
	a villa in Calcutta overlooking the 
	Ganges.

			GLORIA
	Don't be ridic.

			DON
	Gloria, please, why imperil our 
	friendship with these loathsome 
	abbreviations.

			GLORIA
	I could make myself free for later 
	on if you want.

			DON
	I'm leaving for the weekend, Gloria. 
	Maybe another time.

			GLORIA
	Any time.

And as she leans over, she runs her forefinger again through 
the neckline of his hair.

			GLORIA
	Just crazy about the back of your 
	hair.

She returns to the table. Don drinks his drink, puts down 
the glass.

			DON
		(To Nat)
	Nat, weave me another.

			NAT
	You'd better take it easy.

			DON
	Don't worry about me. Just let me 
	know when it's a quarter of six.

			NAT
	Okay.

He pours.

			DON
	And have one yourself, Nat.

			NAT
	Not me, Mr. Birnam.

			DON
	I often wonder what the barman buys, 
	one-half so precious as the stuff he 
	sells.

Nat has poured the drink. Don points at it.

			DON
	Come on, Nat. One little jigger of 
	dreams.

			NAT
	Nope.

			DON
	You don't approve of drinking?

			NAT
	Not the way you drink.

			DON
	It shrinks my liver, doesn't it, 
	Nat? It pickles my kidneys. Yes. But 
	what does it do to my mind? It tosses 
	the sandbags overboard so the balloon 
	can soar. Suddenly I'm above the 
	ordinary. I'm competent, supremely 
	competent. I'm walking a tightrope 
	over Niagara Falls. I'm one of the 
	great ones. I'm Michelangelo moulding 
	the beard of Moses. I'm Van Gogh, 
	painting pure sunlight. I'm Horowitz 
	playing the Emperor Concerto. I'm 
	John Barrymore before the movies got 
	him by the throat. I'm a holdup man -- 
	I'm Jesse James and his two brothers, 
	all three of them. I'm W. Shakespeare. 
	And out there it's not Third Avenue 
	any longer. It's the Nile. The Nile, 
	Nat, and down it moves the barge of 
	Cleopatra. Listen: Purple the sails, 
	and so perfumed that The winds were 
	love-sick with them; the oars were 
	silver, Which to the tune of flutes 
	kept stroke, and made The water which 
	they beat to follow faster, As amorous 
	of their strokes. For her own person, 
	It beggar'd all description.

During the last two lines he has picked up the jigger of 
rye. THE CAMERA is on the wet rings which the wet glass has 
left on the bar.

Gradually the music swells under the Shakespearean quotation 
and drowns it out. In two QUICK DISSOLVES we see the five 
rings, then six, then nine. Over the last, the light has 
changed.

												DISSOLVE TO:

A-26 THE BAR AGAIN

It is dusk. The electric lights are on. The place is about 
half filled -- eight customers at the bar, five tables 
occupied. Gloria and her friend are still there.

Don, an empty jigger in his hand, stands at the same spot, 
only now leaning with his back against the bar. He is doggedly 
quoting Shakespeare, more to himself than to the others at 
the bar, who are ignoring him.

			DON
	The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous 
	palaces, The solemn temples, the 
	great globe itself --

Nat puts drinks before some other customers, then goes over 
to Don, taps him on the shoulder.

			NAT
	Mr. Birnam, you ought to go home. 
	You're late.

			DON
	Yea, all which it inherit shall 
	dissolve --

Nat leans forward as tactfully as possible.

			NAT
	You ought to be home, on account of 
	your brother.

Don half turns to him.

			DON
	Who says so?

			NAT
	You said so yourself. On account of 
	you're going away somewheres.

			DON
	Huh?

			NAT
	Don't you remember?

He pushes the bag with the bottles and the apples towards 
Don. Don looks at them. Suddenly it penetrates. He is seized 
by alarm.

			DON
	What time is it?

			NAT
	Ten past six.

			DON
	Why didn't you tell me?

			NAT
	What do you think I've been doing 
	for half an hour?

Don snatches up the bag, the apples spilling out as he does 
so. He turns to go. Nat points at the few coins which is all 
that is left of Don's money.

			NAT
	Take your change.

Don scoops up the money, a few dollar bills and some silver, 
and hurries out.

A-27 THIRD AVENUE, CORNER OF 55TH STREET - (EVENING)

Don comes from Nat's bar, runs around the corner to his house.

A-28 APARTMENT HOUSE WHERE THE BIRNAMS LIVE

Don, clutching the bag with the bottles, runs into the house.

A-29 FIRST FLOOR HALL, APARTMENT HOUSE

Don dashes in and starts upstairs. After a few steps he stops. 
What if his brother is up there already? He stands undecided, 
then sneaks down the steps and walks to the rear of the 
entrance hall, where there's a glass door leading into the 
shabby garden.

A-30 GARDEN IN BACK OF APARTMENT HOUSE - (DARK)

Don comes out, walks far enough to be able to look up at the 
back of the building. Are the lights on in their apartment 
on the fourth floor? There is a light on the second floor, 
nothing on the third, and on the fourth the lights are on in 
the living room and the bedroom windows, all of which are 
open.

Don stands looking up. What shall he do? Go up and face the 
music? Run away? Weakly he walks over to the stone bench and 
sits down, putting the bottles on the bench next him. He 
takes out his handkerchief, mops his forehead. His eyes go 
up to the lighted windows again.

A-31 THE LIGHTED WINDOWS, FROM DOWN BELOW

Someone has stepped to the bedroom window. It's Helen. He 
can recognize her, silhouetted against the light of the room.

A-32 DON, SITTING ON THE BENCH

His eyes fixed on the window above. Instinctively, he draws 
back into the shadow of the sumac tree, as though Helen could 
see him through the darkness.

A-33 EXT. BEDROOM WINDOW, FROM DON'S POINT OF VIEW

Helen disappears from the window into the room.

A-34 INT. BEDROOM

Helen is moving away from the window. Wick stands before his 
suitcase, which is open and all packed save for slippers and 
bathrobe, which he is rolling together.

			HELEN
	Do you suppose he's at Morandi's, or 
	Nat's bar, or that place on Forty-
	second Street?

			WICK
	What difference does it make?

			HELEN
	You're not really going, Wick.

			WICK
	I certainly am.

He puts the robe with the slippers inside it into the case.

			HELEN
	You can't leave him alone. Not for 
	four days.

Wick slams shut the suitcase, snaps the lock.

			HELEN
	Wick, for heaven's sake, if he's 
	left alone anything can happen! I'll 
	be tied up at the office every minute, 
	All Saturday. All Sunday. I can't 
	look out for him. You know how he 
	gets. He'll be run over by a car. 
	He'll be arrested. He doesn't know 
	what he's doing. A cigarette will 
	fall out of his mouth and he'll burn 
	in his bed --

			WICK
	Oh Helen, if it happens, it happens. 
	And I hope it does. I've had six 
	years of this. I've had my bellyful.

			HELEN
	You can't mean that.

Wick takes his suitcase, goes into the living room.

			WICK
	Yes, I do. It's terrible, I know, 
	but I mean it.

Helen follows him.

A-35 LIVING ROOM

Wick comes into the living room, sets down the suitcase and 
during the ensuing scene takes a topcoat from the closet.

			HELEN
	For heaven's sake, Wick --

			WICK
	Who are we fooling? We've tried 
	everything, haven't we? We've reasoned 
	with him, we've babied him. We've 
	watched him like a hawk. We've tried 
	trusting him. How often have you 
	cried? How often have I beaten him 
	up? We scrape him out of the gutter 
	and pump some kind of self-respect 
	into him, and back he falls, back 
	in, every time.

			HELEN
	He's a sick person. It's as though 
	he had something wrong with his lungs 
	or his heart. You wouldn't walk out 
	on him because he had an attack. He 
	needs our help.

			WICK
	He won't accept our help. Not Don. 
	He hates us. He wants to be alone 
	with that bottle of his. It's the 
	only thing he gives a hang about.

Helen turns away from Wick, leans against the wall, hoping 
he won't see that she's crying.

			WICK
	Why kid ourselves? He's one of the 
	lost ones.
		(OR, ALTERNATE LINE:)
	Why kid ourselves? He's a hopeless 
	alcoholic.

Wick leans into the bedroom, snaps off the light. He picks 
up the suitcase, puts the topcoat over his arm, takes her 
very gently by the arm.

			WICK
	Come, Helen.

He leads her towards the entrance door.

A-36 DON, ON THE BENCH IN THE DARK GARDEN

He stares towards the windows.

A-37 THE WINDOWS, FROM BELOW

The bedroom window is dark. In the next second the lights in 
the living room go off.

A-38 DON, IN THE GARDEN

He picks up the bottles, rises, walks across the garden 
towards the glass door to the hall, peers through it 
cautiously.

A-39 STAIRCASE AND HALL, FIRST FLOOR OF THE APARTMENT HOUSE 
(FROM DON'S POINT OF VIEW)

Wick and Helen come down the stairs, Wick carrying the 
suitcase and topcoat. They go out the front door.

A-40 EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE

Wick and Helen have come out. Wick is hailing a taxi.

			WICK
	Taxi! Taxi!
		(To Helen)
	I'll give you a lift as far as Grand 
	Central.

			HELEN
	No thanks, Wick. I'm going to wait 
	here.

			WICK
	You're crazy.

			HELEN
	Because I won't give up? Maybe I am.

A taxi drives up.

			WICK
	Oh Helen, give yourself a chance. 
	Let go of him.

			HELEN
	Goodbye, Wick.

Wick opens the door of the taxi.

A-41 DON, AT THE GLASS DOOR TO THE GARDEN

He stands with the bag of bottles in his hand, peering through 
the entrance hall out to the street.

A-42 STREET (SHOT FROM BEHIND DON)

Wick gets in the taxi, it drives off. Helen paces up and 
down in front of the house.

Don opens the glass door, steps cautiously into the entrance 
hall.

A-43 ENTRANCE HALL

Squeezing close to the staircase wall so that Helen won't 
see him, Don gets to the staircase, then leaps up the stairs 
as though pursued.

A-44 EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE

Helen waits outside the house. A couple of kids chasing each 
other on roller skates almost run into her. She steps back 
and stands in the doorway, looking up and down the street.

A-45 STAIRS BETWEEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH FLOORS

Don is hurrying up on tiptoe, two steps at a time. Suddenly 
the door of a third-floor apartment toward the street is 
opened. Don flattens himself against the wall, not to be 
seen by Mrs. Deveridge, who is coming out with her dog, 
Sophie, to give Sophie her evening airing. Sophie gives one 
bark in the direction of Don, but Mrs. Deveridge pays no 
attention and descends the stairs. Don starts up the stairs 
again, as silently and as fast as he can.

A-46 FOURTH-FLOOR LANDING

Don gets to his door, opens it cautiously, slips inside.

A-47 INT. LITTLE ENTRANCE HALL OF BIRNAM APARTMENT

The only light is the light from outside, coming from living 
room and bedroom. Don steps inside, closes the door. He 
doesn't turn on the light but very carefully adjusts the 
chain on the door, puts his hat away.

A-48 LIVING ROOM

Dim but for the light outside. As Don enters, he slips the 
bottles from the paper bag and puts them on a table next the 
armchair. He crumples the bag and throws it in the fireplace. 
He takes one bottle, starts towards a bookcase and is about 
to hide it behind the books when he changes his mind. He 
looks around the room. His eyes fall on the ceiling. He goes 
to the table next the couch, pulls it into the middle of the 
room, brushes some magazines to the floor, takes a small 
chair, puts it on the table, climbs to the table, from the 
table to the chair. He is now directly below the ceiling 
lighting fixture, an inverted metal bowl about two and a 
half feet in diameter. Don reaches over the edge and deposits 
the bottle inside the bowl so it can't be seen from the room. 
He climbs down, readjusts the table, the chair, and puts the 
magazines back. Don picks up a glass which is over a carafe 
on the mantelpiece. He puts it next the bottle by the wing 
chair. He opens the bottle, pours a glass about three quarters 
full, puts the glass down. He loosens his tie and lets himself 
fall into the easy chair. He looks through the open window 
on the lights of New York. His eyes slowly wander to the 
glass. He smiles. It's a smile of relief, of contentment at 
being alone with his vice. There's a little pain in his smile, 
too.

A-49 THE GLASS OF WHISKEY

THE CAMERA MOVES TOWARD IT until the glass isn't visible any 
more -- just a smooth sea of alcohol, with a little light 
playing on it. THE CAMERA plunges deep into that sea.

FADE IN:

B-1 STAIRCASE AND LANDING, FOURTH FLOOR - DAY

Through the skylight streams a dazzling shaft of sunlight, 
falling square on the door to the Birnams' apartment.

On the threshold lies a copy of the New York Times, and beside 
it stands a quart of milk. Pinned to the door is a piece of 
paper from a notebook.

From inside there is the sound of the chain being detached, 
and the door opens slowly. Don emerges. He is dressed exactly 
as he was the day before -- same suit, same shirt, same tie. 
He has slept in them and they are wrinkled. He hasn't shaved. 
As he comes out and the sun hits his face, he squints in 
agony. As he carefully closes the door, his eyes fall on the 
note. He reads it.

"Don dear: I waited for you to come home. Please be careful. 
Get some sleep. Eat. And call me, call me, call me. Helen"

There's a sly expression on Don's face as he closes the door, 
leaving everything just where it is -- note, milk bottle, 
paper. Peering down, he assures himself that the coast is 
clear, slips down the stairs.

												DISSOLVE TO:

B-2 EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY, SUNNY - LIGHT TRAFFIC

The entrance door is half open and Dave, the janitor, an 
Italian-looking man about fifty-five, is sweeping the side-
walk in front of the house. Don comes to the doorway, waits 
until Dave's back is turned, then hurries out and slips down 
the street, CAMERA WITH HIM.

Two houses down, in a semi-basement, is MRS. WERTHEIM'S HAND 
LAUNDRY. Don goes down the steps into it.

B-3 INT. MRS. WERTHEIM'S LAUNDRY

The outer room is a kind of office, with a counter and shelves 
of clean laundry in boxes and paper packages. Steam issues 
from the actual laundry at the rear.

MRS. WERTHEIM, a gray-haired, stocky woman, is sorting 
laundry. The shop's bell rings as Don comes in. His nerves 
are on edge but he manages to work up a little nonchalance.

			DON
	Guten Tag, Mrs. Wertheim. How's 
	business?

			MRS. WERTHEIM
	Business he is good, thank you. There 
	isn't a fortune in it, but you know: 
	small fish, good fish. And I keep 
	young and healthy. Why shouldn't I, 
	sitting in a Turkish bath all day 
	for free?

She has picked a package from the shelf, puts it on the 
counter.

			MRS. WERTHEIM
	Three dollars and ninety.

			DON
	I wonder if you could do me a favor, 
	gnaedige Frau?

			MRS. WERTHEIM
	Always glad, Mr. Birnam.

			DON
	My brother's gone away for the weekend 
	and he took the checkbook along...

			MRS. WERTHEIM
	Oh, you want a blank check?

			DON
	It's not that. It's just that I'm a 
	little short.

			MRS. WERTHEIM
		(Sizing up his stature)
	What do you mean, you're short?

			DON
	I wonder if you could let me have a 
	little cash, bitte schoen?

			MRS. WERTHEIM
	A little cash?

			DON
	I thought about twenty dollars, maybe. 
	Only till Monday, when my brother 
	comes back.

			MRS. WERTHEIM
	You thought... No, Mr. Birnam. I 
	cannot. Not that I don't want to, 
	because I want to, but I cannot. And 
	when I say not, I mean absolutely 
	not.

Her eyes fall on his tortured face. It's too much for her. 
She rings open the cash register.

			MRS. WERTHEIM
	I'll let you have five dollars.

			DON
	That's all right.

She hands him the five dollars.

			DON
	Danke schoen, Mrs. Wertheim.

He turns and leaves, doesn't even hear:

			MRS. WERTHEIM
	Your laundry, Mr. Birnam! How about 
	your laundry?

She looks after him but there's only the ringing of the shop 
bell as he leaves.

B-4 NAT'S BAR - BRILLIANT SUNSHINE OUTSIDE

No one is in the bar but Nat: he is cooking some ham and 
eggs for himself on an electric plate behind the bar. The 
floor has been mopped and is still shiny. The chairs are 
piled on the tables.

Into the bar comes Don. He is walking rather slowly but it's 
a tremendous effort not to race in and yell for what he needs 
so desperately.

			NAT
	Hi.

Don goes to the bar and sits. He takes the five dollars from 
his pocket, puts it on the bar.

			NAT
	Thought you were going away for the 
	weekend.

No answer from Don. He sits holding his head in his hands. 
The bar is silent except for the sizzling noise of the eggs 
and ham. Suddenly Don pounds the bar and explodes.

			DON
	For the love of Pete, what are you 
	doing, Nat. Give me a drink!

			NAT
	Right with you, Mr. Birnam. Just 
	fixing my lunch.

			DON
	Well, stop it and come on and give 
	me a drink, for heaven's sake.
		(Banging the bar)
	Come on, come on!

			NAT
	Okay.

He stirs the food once more and takes the skillet off the 
stove, snaps off the electricity with a slowness agonizing 
to Don.

			DON
		(Quietly, though his 
			nerves are cracking)
	Can't you hurry it up a little, Nat?

Nat pours a jiggerful.

			NAT
	Here you are, Mr. Birnam.

			DON
	Thank you, Nat.

Don chokes it down and holds out the jigger for another. Nat 
pours it.

			NAT
	That young lady stopped in last night, 
	looking for you.

			DON
	What young lady?

			NAT
	The one with the leopard coat.

			DON
	Yeah?

			NAT
	She was acting like she just happened 
	to drop in, but I know she was making 
	the rounds after you.

			DON
		(Panicky)
	What did you say to her?

			NAT
	I said you hadn't been in for two 
	weeks.

			DON
	Good. I can't let her see me. Not 
	now while I'm "off" like this.

			NAT
	Then why in the name of -- Why don't 
	you cut it short?

			DON
	You're talking like a child. You 
	can't cut it short! You're on that 
	merry-go-round and you've got to 
	ride it all the way, round and round, 
	till the blasted music wears itself 
	out and the thing dies down and clunks 
	to a stop.

Nat brings over the plate of ham and eggs.

			NAT
	How about you eating this?

			DON
	Take it away.

			NAT
	You got to eat something sometime.

			DON
	Give me another drink.

			NAT
	Look, Mr. Birnam, this is still 
	morning.

He pours another drink. Don downs it.

			DON
	That's when you need it most, in the 
	morning. Haven't you learned that, 
	Nat? At night this stuff's a drink. 
	In the morning it's medicine.

			NAT
	Okay if I eat?

			DON
	Move it a little to one side.

Don taps with the jigger. Nat fills it, then sits down to 
his ham and eggs.

			DON
	Nat, are you ever scared when you 
	wake up? So scared the sweat starts 
	out of you? No, not you. With you 
	it's simple. Your alarm clock goes 
	off and you open your eyes and brush 
	your teeth and read the Daily Mirror. 
	That's all. Do you ever lie in your 
	bed looking at the window? A little 
	daylight's coming through, and you 
	start wondering: is it getting 
	lighter, is it getting darker? Is it 
	dawn or dusk? That's a terrifying 
	problem, Nat. You hold your breath 
	and you pray that it's dusk, so you 
	can go out and get yourself some 
	more liquor. Because if it's dawn, 
	you're dead. The bars are closed and 
	the liquor stores don't open till 
	nine. You can't last till nine. Or 
	it might be Sunday. That's the worst. 
	No liquor stores at all, and you 
	guys wouldn't open a bar, not until 
	one o'clock. Why? Why, Nat?

			NAT
	Because we got to go to church once 
	in a while. That's why.

			DON
	Yes, when a guy needs it most.

He drinks his jiggerful.

			NAT
	How about those two quarts? Did you 
	polish them off last night?

			DON
	What two quarts?

			NAT
	The two bottles you had.

An electric current runs through Don.

			DON
	That's right, I did have two bottles, 
	didn't I? I hid one of them. I've 
	still got it. I'm a capitalist, Nat! 
	I've got untapped reserves. I'm rich!

He taps the glass on the bar.

			NAT
		(Pouring another drink)
	Mr. Birnam, if you had enough money 
	you'd kill yourself in a month.

From the street enters Gloria, wearing a shirtwaist and skirt, 
another foolish little hat, and high-heeled shoes with bows.

			GLORIA
	Say, Nat, was there a gentleman --
		(She sees Don)
	Hello, Mr. Birnam. Didn't you go 
	away for the weekend?

			DON
	Apparently not, Gloria.

			GLORIA
		(Back to Nat)
	Was there a gentleman in here asking 
	for me?

			NAT
	Not to my knowledge there wasn't.

He is drinking his coffee.

			GLORIA
	He was supposed to come around twelve 
	o'clock. He's from Albany.

			DON
	Another friend of the folks?

			GLORIA
	More a friend of a friend of the 
	folks type. A fellow telephoned me 
	about him. Wants me to show him the 
	town.

			NAT
	Like Grant's Tomb for instance?

			GLORIA
	But def.

			NAT
	Amazing, ain't it, how many guys run 
	down from Albany just to see Grant's 
	Tomb.

			GLORIA
		(To Don)
	Sometimes I wish you came from Albany.

			DON
	Where would you take me?

			GLORIA
	Oh, lots of places. The Music Hall, 
	and then the New Yorker Roof maybe.

			DON
	There is now being presented at a 
	theatre on Forty-fourth Street the 
	uncut version of Hamlet. I see us as 
	setting out for that. Do you know 
	Hamlet?

			GLORIA
	I know Forty-fourth Street.

			DON
	I'd like to get your interpretation 
	of Hamlet's character.

			GLORIA
	And I'd like to give it to you.

			DON
	Dinner afterwards, I think. Nothing 
	before. Always see Shakespeare on an 
	empty stomach.

			GLORIA
	Not even a pretzel?

Don shakes his head.

			DON
	But afterwards, dozens of bluepoints 
	in the Rainbow Room. And a very light 
	wine. Vouvray perhaps. Do you care 
	for Vouvray?

			GLORIA
		(Mystified)
	Why, natch.

			DON
	We may blindfold the orchestra so 
	that I can dance with abandon.

			GLORIA
	Aren't you going to dance with me?

			DON
	Of course, little Gloria.

A man has entered the bar, a round-faced, middle-aged man 
with pince-nez. There is a Guide of New York sticking from 
his pocket. He's the guy from Albany, all right.

			ALBANY
		(Rather loud)
	Could I have a glass of water?

			NAT
	Why, sure. And what shall it be for 
	a chaser?

			ALBANY
		(Confidentially)
	Tell me: this is Nat's Bar, isn't 
	it?

			NAT
	That's what the man said.

			ALBANY
	I'm looking for a young lady name of 
	Gloria.

With his thumb, Nat indicates Gloria.

			ALBANY
		(Beaming)
	Are you Miss Gloria?

			GLORIA
	Who, me? No, I'm not. I just live 
	with Gloria. She's not here.

			ALBANY
	She isn't?

			GLORIA
	And she won't be. She's down to the 
	Aquarium.

			ALBANY
	Aquarium?

			GLORIA
	Feeding bubble-gum to the jelly fish.

			ALBANY
	Beg pardon?

			GLORIA
	Ruptured appendix. Middle of last 
	night. Went like that!
		(She lets out her 
			breath with an 
			exploding noise)
	Scared the life out of me.

			ALBANY
	That's terrible.

			GLORIA
	Goodbye.

			ALBANY
	Goodbye.

He takes a couple of steps towards the door, turns.

			ALBANY
	Could I have a word with you?

			GLORIA
	No thanks. Thanks a lot, but no 
	thanks.

			ALBANY
	You're welcome, I'm sure.

He walks out, bewildered.

			DON
	Wasn't that rather rude, Gloria, to 
	send that nice man all alone to 
	Grant's Tomb?

			GLORIA
	When I have a chance to go out with 
	you? Don't be ridic.

			DON
	Oh, is our engagement definite?

			GLORIA
	You meant it, didn't you?

			DON
	Surely, surely.

He downs the jigger of rye.

			GLORIA
	I'm going to get a facial, a 
	fingerwave, a manicure. The works. 
	Right now.
		(With a sudden thought)
	You're going to call for me, aren't 
	you? If you are, what time?

			DON
	What time do you suggest?

			GLORIA
	How about eight?

			DON
	Eight's fine.

			GLORIA
	I live right in the corner house. 
	You know where the antique shop is, 
	the one with the wooden Indian 
	outside? They've got the Indian sign 
	on me, I always say.

			DON
	I'll be there.

			GLORIA
	Second floor. Oh, Mr. Birnam, all 
	I've got is a semi-formal. Will that 
	be all right?

			DON
	That'll be fine.

			GLORIA
		(Happily)
	Goodbye, Not.

She starts for the door, turns.

			GLORIA
	You know, this show you're taking me 
	to. If it's too highbrow, I can just 
	lean back and look at the back of 
	your neck, can't I? Eight o'clock.

She exits.

			DON
	One last one, Nat. Pour it softly, 
	pour it gently, and pour it to the 
	brim.

			NAT
	Look, Mr. Birnam, there's a lot of 
	bars on Third Avenue. Do me a favor -- 
	get out of here and buy it someplace 
	else.

			DON
	What's the matter?

			NAT
	I don't like you much. What was the 
	idea of pulling her leg? You know 
	you're never going to take her out.

			DON
	Who says I'm not?

			NAT
	I say so. You're drunk and you're 
	just making with your mouth.

			DON
	Give me a drink, Nat.

			NAT
	And that other dame -- I mean the 
	lady. I don't like what you're doing 
	to her either.

			DON
	Shut up.

			NAT
	You should've seen her last night, 
	coming in here looking for you, with 
	her eyes all rainy and the mascara 
	all washed away.

			DON
	Give me a drink!

			NAT
	That's an awful high class young 
	lady.

			DON
	You bet she is.

			NAT
	How the heck did she ever get mixed 
	up with a guy that sops it up like 
	you do?

			DON
	It's a problem, isn't it. That nice 
	young man that drinks, and the high-
	class young lady, and how did she 
	ever get mixed up with him, and why 
	does he drink and why doesn't he 
	stop. That's my novel, Nat. I wanted 
	to start writing it out in the 
	country. Morbid stuff. Nothing for 
	the Book-of-the Month Club. A horror 
	story. The confessions of a booze 
	addict, the log book of an alcoholic.
		(Holding out the jigger)
	Come on, Nat. Break down.

Nat does break down and pours a drink.

			DON
	Do you know what I'm going to call 
	my novel? The Bottle -- that's all. 
	Very simply, The Bottle. I've got it 
	all in my mind. Let me tell you the 
	first chapter. It all starts one wet 
	afternoon about three years ago. 
	There was a matinee of La Traviata 
	at the Metropolitan --

									SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

B-5 EXT. METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - AN AUTUMN AFTERNOON, 
HEAVY RAIN

HIGH CAMERA, SHOOTING DOWN past the glass-and-iron marquee 
towards the entrance, beside which is a billboard announcing 
Verdi's LA TRAVIATA. A crowd of people is streaming into the 
building. They are wearing raincoats, carrying umbrellas.

B-6 THE VESTIBULE AND CLOAKROOM WINDOW AT THE METROPOLITAN

It is doing a land-office business, checking dripping 
umbrellas and apparel. Among the crowd is Don Birnam. He is 
alone and wears a bowler and a straight raincoat. He takes 
off his hat and shakes the rain from it, then peels off his 
raincoat. In the side pocket of his suit is a pint of liquor. 
It bulges and the nose projects. For a second Don considers 
whether it'll pass muster, but it's a little too prominent. 
With a quick gesture he transfers the bottle to the pocket 
of the raincoat, rolls the raincoat up like swaddling clothes 
around a precious infant. Seeing an opening in the line at 
the cloak room counter, he steps into it.

There is a great confusion of hands, coats, coat checks, 
customers and overworked attendants. Don hands his coat to 
an attendant. His eyes linger on its pocket with a certain 
tenderness, then he turns and starts towards the door of the 
auditorium.

												DISSOLVE TO:

B-7 A SECTION OF SEATS AT THE METROPOLITAN

Don sits about five seats from the aisle. He is under the 
pleasant spell of the overture of La Traviata.

B-8 DON

He sits between an elderly daughter and her age-old mother, 
and a middle-aged man and wife. He is glancing through the 
program as the curtain rises (changing the light on our 
group). Don looks up.

B-9 THE STAGE

The set is a Louis XIVth salon, in the year 1700. It's 
Violetta's supper. The guests are singing "Libiamo, libiamo," 
which is a drinking song in waltz time.

B-10 DON

He loves music and especially Italian opera, but maybe he'd 
have come late if he'd remembered the content of the first 
scene.

B-11 ON THE STAGE

Powdered footmen are pouring wine into the glasses of the 
over-vivacious guests.

B-12 DON

Thirst in his eyes, he looks away from the stage, tries to 
concentrate on the ceiling of the Metropolitan. No go. His 
eyes wander back to:

B-13 THE STAGE

Alfred and Violetta are batting the drinking song back and 
forth, as the chorus, glasses in hand, stands slowly swaying, 
echoing each couplet.

B-14 DON

That thirst is coming up again. The first drops of sweat are 
gathering on his forehead. As he looks at the stage, his 
imagination is working at top speed.

B-15 STAGE

The swaying echelon of choristers SLOWLY DISSOLVES to a row 
of raincoats, exactly like the one Don wore. They hang from 
hangers and sway slowly to Verdi's rhythm.

B-16 DON'S FACE

His eyes glued to what he sees on the stage. He takes the 
handkerchief from his pocket and wipes his forehead.

B-17 THE STAGE

The raincoats swaying slowly. THE CAMERA APPROACHES one of 
them. From the pocket projects a bottle of whiskey.

B-18 DON

He is wiping his parched mouth. He puts the handkerchief 
back. He fishes the coat check from his pocket, buries it in 
his fist, fighting the foolish impulse. It's a short struggle, 
which he loses. He rises and, to the irritation of his 
neighbors, leaves his seat amid some disapproving shushings 
from the row behind.

												DISSOLVE TO:

B-19 CLOAK ROOM AND VESTIBULE

It is completely empty save for the elderly attendant, who 
is dozing over his paper. From inside comes Verdi's music 
and Don Birnam. He puts the check on the counter. The 
attendant looks up from a newspaper.

			ATTENDANT
	Did you forget something?

			DON
	No. Going home, if it's all right 
	with you.

The attendant takes the check and leaves. Don rolls his 
program and sticks it into the sand of the cuspidor. He is 
filled with a nervous anticipation of the drink which is on 
its way. The attendant returns.

			ATTENDANT
	Say, this isn't yours.

Don looks. The attendant holds a short leopard coat and a 
lady's small umbrella.

			DON
	No, it certainly isn't.

			ATTENDANT
		(Comparing the check 
			with the number on 
			the hanger)
	That's what it says though -- 417.

			DON
	I don't care what it says.

			ATTENDANT
	The checks must have got mixed up.

			DON
	Maybe they did. Find me my coat. 
	It's a plain man's raincoat and a 
	derby.

			ATTENDANT
	Are you kidding? Do you know how 
	many plain men's raincoats we have 
	on a day like this? About a thousand.

			DON
	Let me get back there. I can find 
	it.

			ATTENDANT
	That's against regulations, sir.

			DON
	I'm not going to wait till the end 
	of the performance.

			ATTENDANT
	You can get your coat tomorrow.

Don's nervousness is mounting. He is searching his pockets.

			DON
	Look, man, there's something in the 
	pocket of that coat I -- It so happens 
	I find myself without any money and 
	I need that coat. And I need it now.

			ATTENDANT
	Listen, if everybody went in there 
	digging through those coats... There's 
	regulations. There's got to be 
	regulations.

			DON
	What do you suggest?

			ATTENDANT
	You just wait till the other party 
	comes and then you can swap.

			DON
	I want my coat.

			ATTENDANT
	As far as I'm concerned, that's your 
	coat.

He shoves the leopard coat and umbrella close to Don.

			DON
	You're a great help.

He is biting his lips, unable to find another argument. The 
attendant has returned to the other end of the counter and 
resumed his doze. Don gets out a cigarette. Without opening 
his eyes, the attendant calls it.

			ATTENDANT
	No smoking.

			DON
		(Sourly)
	I thought so.

He puts the cigarette away, leans back on the counter, arms 
folded.

												DISSOLVE TO:

B-20 VESITBULE, NEAR CLOAK ROOM

Empty, save for Don, who paces up and down nervously, carrying 
the leopard coat and the umbrella. He glances over the coat 
a little, at the initials inside, at the label. Over the 
scene comes a muted aria from the second act.

												DISSOLVE TO:

B-21 A STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE GALLERY

Empty, save for Don, who sits on a step, the coat next him. 
With the umbrella he is nervously tracing the pattern in the 
carpet. Inside, the music rises to a finale and the first 
people start streaming down from the gallery. Don grabs up 
the coat and hurries towards the cloak room.

B-22 VESTIBULE AND CLOAK ROOM

People are streaming up from all sides to get their 
belongings. Don comes into the shot and, standing on his 
toes, tries to locate the claimant of his coat and hat.

												DISSOLVE TO:

B-23 VESTIBULE AND CLOAK ROOM

It is almost empty. Don still stands with the coat, looking. 
As the last few people leave, at the far end of the counter 
he sees Helen, in a little leopard hat, his coat over her 
arm, his derby in her hand. She sees him with her coat and 
her umbrella and the two approach slowly.

			DON
		(Trying to control 
			his irritation)
	That's my coat you've got.

			HELEN
	And that's mine, thank heaven. They 
	mixed up the checks.

			DON
	They certainly did. I thought you'd 
	never come.

He takes his coat rather brusquely, thrusts the leopard coat 
at her.

			HELEN
	You can't have been waiting so long.

			DON
	Only since the first aria of the 
	first act. That's all.

			HELEN
	Do you always just drop in for the 
	overture?

Don takes the coat, feels it hurriedly to make sure the bottle 
is still there, and starts away.

			DON
	Goodbye.

Helen is left with the leopard coat and his bowler.

			HELEN
		(Waving the hat toward 
			Don)
	Hey, wait a minute!

Don comes back, takes the hat, starts away again.

			HELEN
	My umbrella, if you don't mind.

His patience exhausted, Don stops again, takes the umbrella 
and tosses it in Helen's direction. Helen, who is getting 
into her coat, can't catch it. It falls right next to her.

			HELEN
	Thank you very much.

Don stands abashed. He goes back, picks up the umbrella.

			DON
	I'm terribly sorry.

			HELEN
	You're the rudest person I ever saw. 
	What's the matter with you?

			DON
	Just rude, I guess.

			HELEN
	Really, somebody should talk to your 
	mother.

			DON
	They tried, Miss St. John.

			HELEN
	My name's not St. John.

			DON
	St. Joseph, then.

			HELEN
	St. James.

			DON
	First name Hilda or Helen, or Harriet 
	maybe?

			HELEN
	Helen.

			DON
	You come from Toledo, Ohio.

			HELEN
	How do you know?

			DON
	I've had three long acts to work you 
	out from that coat of yours. Initials, 
	label -- Alfred Spitzer, Fine Furs, 
	Toledo, Ohio.

			HELEN
	Maybe I should have explored your 
	coat.

			DON
	But you didn't.

			HELEN
	Didn't have time.

			DON
	Good. My name is Don Birnam.

As they go on talking, they walk from the cloak room, through 
the vestibule, to the street, Don carrying his coat over his 
arm.

			DON
	How do you like New York?

			HELEN
	Love it.

			DON
	How long are you going to stay?

			HELEN
	Oh, sixty years, perhaps.

Don doesn't get it.

			HELEN
	I live here now. I've got a job.

			DON
	Doing what?

			HELEN
	I'm on Time Magazine.

			DON
	Time Magazine? In that case perhaps 
	you could do something for me.

			HELEN
	Yes.

			DON
	Could you help me to become Man of 
	the Year?

			HELEN
	Delighted. What do you do?

			DON
	Yes, what do I do? I'm a writer. 
	I've just started a novel. I've 
	started quite a few novels. I never 
	seem to finish one.

			HELEN
	In that case, why not write short 
	stories.

			DON
	I have some of those. The first 
	paragraph. Then there's one-half of 
	the opening scene of a play. It all 
	takes place in the leaning tower of 
	Pisa and explains why it leans. And 
	why all sensible buildings should 
	lean.

			HELEN
	They'll love that in Toledo.

			DON
	Are you by any chance coming here to 
	Lohengrin next week?

			HELEN
	I don't know.

			DON
	Because if you are, I'm not going to 
	let this coat out of my hands.

			HELEN
	Don't worry.

			DON
	I do, though. To be really safe, 
	maybe we should go together.

			HELEN
	We could.

			DON
	Are you in the telephone book?

			HELEN
	Yes, but I'm not home very much.

			DON
	Then I'll call you at the office.

			HELEN
	Editorial Research. If Henry Luce 
	answers the phone, hang up.

They have reached the curb outside the Metropolitan. It is 
dark and the rain has settled to a drizzle.

			DON
	Taxi?

			HELEN
	No, thank you. I'm taking the subway.

			DON
	Very sensible.

			HELEN
	As a matter of fact, I'm going to an 
	extremely crazy party on Washington 
	Square. If you want, I'll take you 
	along.

There is a split second of indecision but it is ended by 
Don's awareness of the bottle in his raincoat.

			DON
	Thank you very much, Miss St. James, 
	but I have to see a friend uptown.

			HELEN
	Goodbye, Mr. Birnam.

			DON
	Goodbye.

He is unfurling his raincoat in order to put it on before he 
steps from under the marquee. Helen is about a step and a 
half away when there is a crash. She stops and looks down, 
as does Don. On the sidewalk lies the pint of whiskey, broken.

			HELEN
	Who threw that?

			DON
		(Casually)
	It fell out of my pocket.

			HELEN
	Do you always carry those things?

			DON
	You see... that friend, the one 
	uptown, he has a cold. I thought I'd 
	take this along and make him a hot 
	toddy.

			HELEN
	Now he gets hot lemonade and some 
	aspirin.

			DON
	I shall.

			HELEN
	Goodbye.

She goes. Don looks at the broken bottle, then after Helen. 
With sudden decision he calls after her.

			DON
	Miss St. James!

			HELEN
		(Turning)
	Yes?

			DON
	What kind of a party was that you 
	asked me to?

			HELEN
	A cocktail party.

			DON
	Invitation still stand?

			HELEN
	Of course. Come on.

He joins her, takes the umbrella out of her hand and holds 
it over them both as they go down the street.

												DISSOLVE TO:

B-24 NAT'S BAR

As we have left it, empty save for Nat and Don. Sunlight 
outside. Nat is now taking the chairs from the tables and 
arranging the bar for the afternoon and evening trade, while 
Don leans back against the bar, the jigger of whiskey in his 
hand, and goes on talking.

			DON
	How's that for a first meeting, Nat? 
	Cute, full of laughs. A charming 
	girl, an extra special girl. Her 
	coat-check might just as well have 
	been mixed up with the coat-check of 
	a solid citizen, the son of the 
	chairman of some insurance company, 
	highly eligible, no vices except 
	that sometimes he plays the cello. 
	But oh no, that would have made 
	everything too simple. It had to be 
	that young man with the bottle.

			NAT
	Listen, once that bottle smashes, 
	doesn't she catch on?

			DON
	No, she doesn't.

			NAT
	Okay. So they go to that cocktail 
	party and he gets stinko and falls 
	flat on his face.

			DON
	He doesn't. He's crazy about that 
	girl by then. He drinks tomato juice. 
	Doesn't touch liquor for that whole 
	week -- for two weeks, for six weeks.

			NAT
	He's in love, huh?

			DON
	That's what's going to be hard to 
	write. Love's the hardest thing in 
	the world to write about. So simple. 
	You've got to catch it through 
	details, like the early morning 
	sunlight hitting the gray tin of the 
	ashcans in front of her house. A 
	ringing telephone that sounds like 
	Beethoven's Pastoral. A letter 
	scribbled on her office stationery 
	that you carry in your pocket because 
	it smells of all the lilacs in Ohio.

			NAT
	And no drinking?

			DON
	He thinks he's cured. If he can get 
	a job now, they can be married and 
	that's that. Only it's not, Nat. Not 
	quite. Because one day, one terrible 
	day --
		(He taps the jigger)
	Pour it, Nat.

Nat does.

			NAT
	Yeah?

Don drinks.

			NAT
	Well, go on.

			DON
	You see, that girl's been writing to 
	her family in Toledo They want to 
	meet this young man. So they come to 
	New York. They stay at the Hotel 
	Manhattan. Their very first day, 
	she's to introduce him to her parents. 
	One o'clock. Lobby of the hotel...

B-25 INT. LOBBY OF THE MANHATTAN HOTEL - (MIDDAY)

It is filled with the routine activity of a big commercial 
hotel on a hot summer day.

Don Birnam, in a light summer suit, paces up and down the 
lobby. Under his arm is a florist's box. He keeps eyeing the 
doors to the elevators. He walks toward one of those circular 
plush settees common to hotels, sits down, puts the flower 
box next to him and adjusts the knot of his tie, his eye 
still on the elevator doors.

On the other side of the settee are a middle-aged couple. 
Don can't see them, they can't see him, as he overhears their 
conversation, and it takes him a little time to realize that 
they are Helen's parents.

MR. ST. JAMES is wearing a linen suit and a good but yellowing 
panama hat, the brim turned up. MRS. ST. JAMES is a cheerful 
little woman with glasses pinned to her dress, the kind that 
pull. Mr. St. James is fuming a little.

			MR. ST. JAMES
	Just walked in for a simple haircut. 
	No, that wasn't enough, not for New 
	York. They gave me a shampoo, a scalp 
	massage, a manicure. Thought they'd 
	tear my shoes off and paint my 
	toenails.

Mrs. St. James laughs comfortably.

			MRS. ST. JAMES
	I had a lovely morning. Just did a 
	little window shopping. I didn't 
	want to get all tired out.

			MR. ST. JAMES
	On account of meeting that young 
	man? Now, Mother.

			MRS. ST. JAMES
	Who did you get a haircut for?

			MR. ST. JAMES
	Wonder what's keeping Helen.

			MRS. ST. JAMES
	She'll be here.

			MR. ST. JAMES
	This Birnam fellow went to Cornell, 
	didn't he?

			MRS. ST. JAMES
	I believe so, but Helen says he never 
	graduated.

			MR. ST. JAMES
	I wonder why. How old is he?

			MRS. ST. JAMES
	Thirty-three.

			MR. ST. JAMES
	He has no job. As far as I can find 
	out, he never had one. I wish Helen 
	wasn't so vague.

By now Don knows only too well that he is the subject of 
their discussion. He leans his head against the back of the 
settee, acutely uncomfortable.

			MRS. ST. JAMES
	Maybe he has a little money. Some 
	people do, you know, Father.

			MR. ST. JAMES
	He ought to have a job anyway.

			MRS. ST. JAMES
	He's a writer.

			MR. ST. JAMES
	A writer? What does he write? I never 
	heard of his name.

			MRS. ST. JAMES
	Now Father, relax. You always expect 
	the worst. I've made up my mind he's 
	a well-brought-up young man who wipes 
	his feet before he enters a house 
	and doesn't even smoke.

			MR. ST. JAMES
	I hope he realizes Helen's our only 
	daughter and we ought to know a few 
	things about him.

			MRS. ST. JAMES
	Those'll all come out -- his 
	background, his prospects, his church 
	affiliations.

Don can't take any more of this. He picks up the florist's 
box, rises and moves away from the settee. When he has reached 
the security of some potted palms, he looks back. Through 
one of the revolving doors comes Helen, in a new spring suit. 
She looks around, sees her parents, goes up to them. There 
is a greeting, some conversation apparently about Don and 
the fact that he'll get there any minute. She sits on the 
settee between her parents, all three of them waiting for 
Don.

Don stands undecided, then looks around, locates the public 
telephone booths, steps into one of them.

B-26 INT. TELEPHONE BOOTH

Don deposits a nickel and dials the number of the Hotel 
Manhattan, which is above the mouthpiece of the phone.

			DON
	Manhattan Hotel?... Will you page 
	Miss St. James? She must be in the 
	lobby.

He holds the phone and looks through the glass door of the 
telephone booth.

B-27 LOBBY, FROM DON'S POINT OF VIEW - (SILENT, AS IT IS 
SHOT THROUGH THE GLASS OF THE PHONE BOOTH)

A bell-hop crosses the lobby, paging Miss St. James. Helen 
rises and follows him over to the line of house phones on a 
shelf. She picks up the phone, speaks.

B-28 DON, AT THE PHONE

			DON
	Helen?... Don. I'm terribly sorry 
	but I can't get there for a while. 
	Please go ahead with your lunch and 
	apologize to your parents... No, 
	nothing serious. I'll be there. 
	Goodbye.

B-29 LOBBY, FROM DON'S ANGLE, THROUGH THE GLASS OF THE PHONE 
BOOTH

Helen has hung up too. She goes towards her parents, her 
face a little crestfallen. As she joins them she evidently 
starts to explain.

B-30 EXT. TELEPHONE BOOTH

Don emerges with the florist's box, careful not to be seen. 
He leaves through one of the side doors.

												DISSOLVE TO:

B-31 LIVING ROOM, BIRNAM BROTHERS' APARTMENT - TWILIGHT

SHOOTING TOWARDS hall and entrance door. In the dim fore-
ground stands a small table, beyond it the vague contours of 
Don lying on the couch. On the floor beside him an empty 
bottle, in his hand a half-filled glass. There are footsteps 
from the stairs. A key is turned in the lock, and Wick enters. 
He wears a hat and carries a brief-case. He switches on the 
light in the little entrance hall, flips his hat jauntily to 
a hook on the coat-rack and comes into the living room. As 
he crosses the threshold he becomes aware of Don's presence.

			WICK
	Don?

He snaps on the light, sees Don on the couch, drunk. Don 
doesn't move an inch, only his eyes close.

			DON
	Turn off that light.

			WICK
	For heaven's sake, Don.

			DON
	Turn it off!

Wick snaps off the light. From now on the scene plays in 
dimness, save for the shaft of light from the entrance hall. 
Wick throws the briefcase into a chair.

			WICK
	I thought you were with Helen and 
	her father and mother.

No answer.

			WICK
	What happened?

Still no answer. Wick goes and sits beside Don, takes the 
glass from his hand.

			WICK
		(Gently)
	Come on, Don.

			DON
	I couldn't face it.

			WICK
	You couldn't face what? Didn't you 
	go to see them?

			DON
	Certainly I went. One o'clock sharp. 
	And I saw them, all right. Only they 
	didn't see me.

			WICK
	How was that?

			DON
	Such nice, respectable people. I 
	couldn't face them, Wick, and all 
	the questions they'd ask me. I 
	couldn't face them. Not cold. I had 
	to have a drink first. Just one. 
	Only the one didn't do anything to 
	me.

			WICK
	So you had another and another. You 
	poor idiot, Don. Won't you ever learn 
	with you it's like stepping off a 
	roof and expecting to fall just one 
	floor?

Don puts his arm over his face.

			DON
	You're right, you're right. There's 
	nothing I can say.

There is a long second of silence, Wick looking at Don.

			DON
	Go ahead. Bawl me out, Wick, let me 
	have it. Why don't you take that 
	bottle and smash it over my face.

There is another pause. Wick speaks very quietly.

			WICK
	It's a quarter of eight. I suppose 
	they're still in that hotel, waiting 
	for you.

			DON
	Call her up, Wick, will you? Tell 
	her something. Tell her I'm sick. 
	Tell her I'm dead.

Wick has bent over Don and loosened his tie.

			DON
	Will you call her?

			WICK
	Yes, I'll call her.

			DON
	She must have written them a lot of 
	nice things about me. What a gentleman 
	I am. A prince.

			WICK
	Which hotel is it?

			DON
	The Manhattan. Mr. and Mrs. Charles 
	St. James from Toledo, Ohio.

Paying no attention to the sound of steps which has been 
coming from the staircase, Wick rises, puts the glass of 
whiskey on the table and is about to cross towards the 
telephone when the doorbell rings -- short, short, long, 
short. Wick freezes. Don sits up on the couch. They know 
that ring. There is a helpless look in Don's eyes.

			WICK
		(Whispering)
	Get up, Don.

Don, clinging to Wick's arm, pulls himself up. Wick pushes 
him through the doorway to the dark bedroom, closing the 
door after him. The bell rings again, that same ring.

			WICK
	Just a minute, Helen.

He snaps on the lights in the living room, rolls the empty 
bottle under the couch, takes the glass of whiskey, puts it 
behind the pile of records. As he is starting towards the 
door, the bottle rolls from under the couch. Wick stops and 
rolls it back again, then goes into the hall and opens the 
door. Helen, in a great hurry, stands outside, nervous.

			HELEN
	Hello, Wick. Is Don here?

			WICK
	Don? No.

Helen comes into the living room.

			HELEN
	Any idea where he could be?

			WICK
	Wasn't he meeting you?

B-32 DON, IN THE DARK BEDROOM

He stands leaning against the wall, breathing heavily. His 
eyes gleam with anxiety. Coming from the living room, stabbing 
him deep, is:

			HELEN'S VOICE
	He was supposed to meet us for lunch, 
	then he telephoned he'd be late. 
	Mother's beginning to think I just 
	made him up.

B-33 LIVING ROOM

			HELEN
	Do you suppose something's happened 
	to him?

			WICK
	Nonsense.

			HELEN
	But surely he'd have called back if 
	he were all right.

			WICK
	Where did he call you from?

			HELEN
	I don't know.

			WICK
	I think I've got an idea. He called 
	from out of town.

			HELEN
	Out of town? Where?

			WICK
	Philadelphia.

			HELEN
	What's he doing in Philadelphia?

			WICK
	There's an opening on the Philadelphia 
	Inquirer, The Book Section. Don wrote 
	them. He wired. I think this morning 
	early he just took a train.

			HELEN
	He never told me a word about it.

			WICK
	I'm not supposed to tell you either. 
	He wanted it to be a surprise.

			HELEN
	He did!

B-34 DON, IN THE DARK BEDROOM

He suffers like a dog as he hears what's being said in the 
living room.

			WICK'S VOICE
	He probably couldn't get to the right 
	people right away, missed a train. 
	You know how it is.

			HELEN'S VOICE
	Oh, it would be just wonderful if he 
	got the job and started working. Or 
	would it, Wick, with him in 
	Philadelphia and me in New York?

B-35 LIVING ROOM - WICK AND HELEN

			HELEN
	Don't ever tell him I said that 
	though, will you?

			WICK
	Of course not.

Suddenly his eyes are transfixed. From under the couch has 
rolled the bottle. As Helen speaks, he tries to get near it 
without her noticing.

			HELEN
	I could never understand why somebody 
	like Don, a person with so much 
	talent, such flashes of real 
	brilliance... Maybe I'm a little 
	prejudiced.

Suddenly she sees Wick trying to kick the bottle back under 
the couch.

			HELEN
	What are you doing, Wick?

			WICK
	Nothing, Helen.

			HELEN
	Where'd that bottle come from?

			WICK
	It just rolled out.

			HELEN
	From under the couch?

			WICK
	Yes, Helen.
		(With an attempt at 
			casualness)
	It's my guess that Don caught an 
	early train.

			HELEN
		(A wild guess)
	Is that Don's bottle?

			WICK
	What makes you think that?

			HELEN
	There was a bottle the first time we 
	met.

			WICK
	There was?

			HELEN
	It fell out of Don's pocket.

			WICK
	It was for me, Helen.

B-36 DON, IN THE DARK BEDROOM

He stands with his head against the door post, listening, 
harassed.

			WICK'S VOICE
	This one is mine, too. You might as 
	well hear the family scandal. I drink.

B-37 WICK AND HELEN IN THE LIVING ROOM

			WICK
	Don thinks I drink too much.

He walks over to the records and picks up the glass.

			WICK
	I had to promise I'd go on the wagon. 
	That's why I hid the bottle, so he 
	wouldn't see it.

He takes a drink.

			HELEN
	I'm so sorry, Wick. I shouldn't have 
	started asking questions. It was 
	none of my business.

			WICK
	Forget it.

B-38 DON, IN THE DARK BEDROOM

His brother's gesture has shaken him.

			HELEN'S VOICE
	I'd better be getting back to the 
	hotel. Don may be there already. And 
	don't worry, Wick, I won't mention 
	this to him.

			WICK'S VOICE
	Thank you, Helen.

			HELEN'S VOICE
	Goodbye, Wick.

			WICK'S VOICE
	Goodbye.

She must be on her way to the front door. With sudden decision 
Don opens the door to the living room and walks slowly out.

			DON
	Helen!

B-39 LIVING ROOM & ENTRANCE HALL

Almost at the door to the entrance hall, Helen turns back. 
Wick stands, the glass of whiskey in his hand, startled taut 
at the sight of Don who comes in, not too steady on his feet.

			DON
	I'm sorry, Helen. I can't let you 
	go. Not like that.

			HELEN
	Don!

			WICK
	Shut your mouth, Don.
		(To Helen)
	I'll take you downstairs.

			DON
	Thank you very much for your 
	Philadelphia story, Wick. Nice try.

Helen comes back into the room, staring at Don. She is 
beginning to realize that he's drunk. Don looks at the glass 
in Wick's hand.

			DON
	That looks so silly on you.

He takes the glass out of Wick's hand.

			WICK
		(To Helen)
	Don't listen to him.

			DON
	You don't have to. Just look at the 
	two of us.

			HELEN
	Yes. What's all this covering up?

			WICK
	All that happened is that Don was 
	nervous at the idea of meeting your 
	parents and so he took a couple of 
	drinks.

			DON
	Come on, Wick, she'd have found out 
	sooner or later.

			HELEN
	Stop it, both of you. Don's a little 
	tight. Most people drink a little. A 
	lot of them get tight once in a while.

			DON
	Sure. The lucky ones who can take it 
	or leave it. But then there are the 
	ones who can't take it, but can't 
	leave it either. What I'm trying to 
	say is I'm not a drinker. I'm a drunk. 
	They had to put me away once.

			WICK
	He went to a cure.

			DON
	Which didn't take. That first day we 
	met, you see, the dirty trick was I 
	should have had the decency to get 
	drunk, just for your sake.

			HELEN
	For my sake? We're talking about 
	you.
		(Turning to Wick)
	Is it really that bad, Wick?

			DON
	Yes, it is.

			WICK
	Can't we go over this tomorrow, Don 
	when you're feeling more like 
	yourself?

			DON
	Helen's heard the facts. That's all 
	there is to it.

			HELEN
	I've heard them and they're not very 
	pleasant. But they could be worse. 
	After all, you're not an embezzler 
	or a murderer. You drink too much. 
	That's not fatal. One cure didn't 
	take. There are others.

			WICK
	Of course there are.

			DON
	This has a familiar ring.

			HELEN
	There must be a reason why you drink. 
	The right doctor can find it.

			DON
	I'm way ahead of the right doctor. I 
	know the reason. The reason is me. 
	What I am. Or, rather, what I'm not.

			HELEN
	What aren't you that you want to be, 
	Don?

			DON
	A writer. Silly, isn't it? You see, 
	in college I passed for a genius. 
	They couldn't get out the college 
	magazine without one of my stories. 
	Boy, was I hot. Hemingway stuff. I 
	reached my peak when I was nineteen. 
	Sold a piece to the Atlantic Monthly. 
	It was reprinted in the Readers' 
	Digest. Who wants to stay in college 
	when he's Hemingway? My mother bought 
	me a brand new typewriter, and I 
	moved right in on New York. Well, 
	the first thing I wrote, that didn't 
	quite come off. And the second I 
	dropped. The public wasn't ready for 
	that one. I started a third, a fourth, 
	only about then somebody began to 
	look over my shoulder and whisper, 
	in a thin, clear voice like the E-
	string on a violin. Don Birnam, he'd 
	whisper, it's not good enough. Not 
	that way. How about a couple of drinks 
	just to put it on its feet? So I had 
	a couple. Oh, that was a great idea. 
	That made all the difference. Suddenly 
	I could see the whole thing -- the 
	tragic sweep of the great novel, 
	beautifully proportioned. But before 
	I could really grab it and throw it 
	down on paper, the drink would wear 
	off and everything be gone like a 
	mirage. Then there was despair, and 
	a drink to counterbalance despair, 
	and one to counterbalance the 
	counterbalance. I'd be sitting in 
	front of that typewriter, trying to 
	squeeze out a page that was halfway 
	decent, and that guy would pop up 
	again.

			HELEN
	What guy? Who are you talking about?

			DON
	The other Don Birnam. There are two 
	of us, you know: Don the drunk and 
	Don the writer. And the drunk will 
	say to the writer, Come on, you idiot. 
	Let's get some good out of that 
	portable. Let's hock it. We'll take 
	it to that pawn shop over on Third 
	Avenue. Always good for ten dollars, 
	for another drink, another binge, 
	another bender, another spree. Such 
	humorous words. I tried to break 
	away from that guy a lot of ways. No 
	good. Once I even bought myself a 
	gun and some bullets.
		(He goes to the desk)
	I meant to do it on my thirtieth 
	birthday.

He opens the drawer, takes out two bullets, holds them in 
the palm of his hand.

			DON
	Here are the bullets. The gun went 
	for three quarts of whiskey. That 
	other Don wanted us to have a drink 
	first. He always wants us to have a 
	drink first. The flop suicide of a 
	flop writer.

			WICK
	All right, maybe you're not a writer. 
	Why don't you do something else?

			DON
	Yes, take a nice job. Public 
	accountant, real estate salesman. I 
	haven't the guts, Helen. Most men 
	lead lives of quiet desperation. I 
	can't take quiet desperation.

			HELEN
	But you are a writer. You have every 
	quality for it. Imagination, wit, 
	pity --

			DON
	Come on, let's face reality. I'm 
	thirty-three and I'm living on the 
	charity of my brother. Room and board 
	free, and fifty cents a week for 
	cigarettes. An occasional ticket for 
	a concert or a show, out of the 
	bigness of his heart. And it is a 
	big heart, a patient heart.

			WICK
	Now, Don, I'm just carrying you along 
	for the time being.

			DON
	Shut up, Wick. I've never done 
	anything, I'm not doing anything, I 
	never will do anything. Zero, zero, 
	zero.

			HELEN
	Now you shut up. We'll straighten it 
	out.

			DON
	Look. Wick has the misfortune to be 
	my brother. You just walked in on 
	this, and if you know what's good 
	for you, you'll turn around and walk 
	out again. Walk fast and don't turn 
	back.

Helen looks at him for a second, then takes off her hat and 
throws it into a nearby chair.

			HELEN
		(To Wick)
	Why don't you make some coffee, Wick? 
	Strong. Three cups.

Wick goes into the kitchenette.

			DON
	Do yourself a favor, Helen. Go on, 
	clear out.

			HELEN
	Because I've got a rival? Because 
	you're in love with this?
		(She points at the 
			bottle)
	You don't know me, Don. I'm going to 
	fight and fight and fight. Bend down.

He doesn't bend. She raises herself to her tiptoes and kisses 
him warmly.

									DISSOLVE BACK TO:

B-40 NAT'S BAR - LATER IN THE DAY

Nat and Don alone. Nat is behind the bar, putting tooth-picks 
into olives which he takes from a bowl and arranges in a row 
on a plate. Don, about ten wet rings in front of him and 
what's left of Mrs. Wertheim's five dollars, is playing with 
a full jigger of rye.

			DON
	That was three years ago, Nat. That's 
	a long time to keep fighting, to 
	keep believing. They'd try a health 
	farm, a psychiatrist, a sanatorium 
	in New Jersey, No go. She'd be 
	patient. She'd be gay. She'd encourage 
	him. She'd buy a new ribbon for his 
	typewriter -- a two-color job, black 
	and red. Just write, Don. Keep 
	writing. That first paragraph came 
	off so well... There was no second 
	paragraph. There were drinks. Drinks 
	sneaked in secret. In the bathroom, 
	here, in Harlem. Promises again, 
	lies again. But she holds on. She 
	knows she's clutching a razor blade 
	but she won't let go. Three years of 
	it.

			NAT
	And what? How does it come out?

			DON
	I don't know. Haven't figured that 
	far.

			NAT
	Want me to tell you? One day your 
	guy gets wise to himself and gets 
	back that gun. Or, if he's only got 
	a dollar ten, he goes up to the Empire 
	State Building, way up on top, and 
	then --
		(he snaps his fingers)
	Or he can do it for a nickel, in a 
	subway under a train.

			DON
	Think so, Nat? What if Helen is right, 
	after all, and he sits down and turns 
	out something good -- but good -- 
	and that pulls him up and snaps him 
	out of it?

			NAT
	This guy? Not from where I sit.

Don jumps up.

			DON
	Shut up, Nat. I'm going to do it. 
	I'm going to do it now. It's all 
	there. You heard it.

			NAT
	Yes, Mr. Birnam.

			DON
	That's why I didn't go on that 
	weekend, see, so I can be alone up 
	there and sit down at my typewriter. 
	This time I'm going to do it, Nat. 
	I'm going to do it.

			NAT
	By gosh, maybe you will.

			DON
	Thank you, Nat.
		(he's up on his feet)
	Am I all paid up?

			NAT
	Yes, Mr. Birnam.

			DON
	Goodbye, Nat. I'm going home. This 
	time I've got it. I'm going to write.

			NAT
	Good luck, Mr. Birnam.

							DISSOLVE:

B-41 INT. BIRNAM APARTMENT - (DAY)

Don enters, the fire of real purpose in his eye. He hangs 
his hat on the hatrack, goes to the bedroom, picks up the 
typewriter, grabs the sheaf of typewriter paper Wick has 
laid on top of his suitcase and carries them into the living 
room. He puts the typewriter on the desk. Sitting down, he 
inserts a sheet of paper in the roller and begins to type:

								THE BOTTLE
					A Novel by Don Birnam

He pauses, then types underneath:

				For Helen - With All My Love

He rolls the sheet of paper up, studies what he has typed as 
though it were a painting. Then he begins to try and formulate 
that first sentence of his book. To do so is absolute agony 
for him. He gets up, puts a cigarette in his mouth, takes a 
match from a folder, lights the cigarette, throws the folder 
on the small table next to the big chair. As he does so his 
eyes fall on the empty bottle and glass. He looks at them 
for a minute, then goes over to the bookcase, puts his arm 
in back of the books and runs his hand along the rear of the 
shelf, looking for that bottle. It's not there.

He runs into the bedroom, hurries to his bed, where his 
suitcase lies packed but not closed. He wipes the suitcase 
from the bed, the contents spilling over the floor. He pulls 
up one end of the mattress, looks under it. Nothing.

He goes back into the living room, pulls the couch from the 
wall and, lying on his stomach, probes among the springs. 
Nothing there. He lies on the couch, breathing heavily.

			DON
	You had another bottle, you know you 
	did. Where did you put it? You're 
	not crazy. Where did you put it?

He jumps up, runs back to the bookcase, starts pulling out 
books, row by row. He goes to the closet, opens it wide, 
pulls out all its contents, throwing them on the floor. 
Nothing there.

He goes back to the big chair, throws himself down, exhausted. 
His eyes fall again on the empty bottle and the empty glass. 
Behind the glass lies the folder of matches. Something is 
written on it but it is distorted by the glass. However, it 
attracts Don's attention enough to make him push the glass 
to one side. The folder reads:

			HARRY'S & JOE'S
					Where Good Liquor Flows 13 W. 52nd St.

												DISSOLVE TO:

B-42 INT. HARRY'S & JOE'S ON 52ND ST

You know how those places look: the lower floor of a 
brownstone house, narrow, intimate, smoky. One side is a 
bar. Along the other wall there is a long, built-in bench 
with individual tables in front of it. At a miniature piano 
a guy is playing and singing "It Was So Beautiful."

Don Birnam sits on the bench at one of the small tables. In 
front of him is an empty cocktail glass. It is about his 
fourth. At the next table on the bench sits a couple -- a 
show girl type, about twenty-four, and a man about thirty-
five. They are nuts about each other and are holding hands 
as they listen to the hoarse pianist. However, to Don the 
music means little. He is very much the man of the world, 
holding his alcohol superbly, smoking a cigarette. He snaps 
his finger at a waiter, who is passing with a tray of drinks. 
The waiter stops.

			DON
	Where is my check.

			WAITER
	Right here, sir.

The waiter takes the check which is thrust between his vest 
and his stiff shirt and puts it face down in front of Don, 
then hurries on with the tray of drinks. Don turns the check 
over. It's for four dollars. Suddenly his financial situation 
dawns on Don. He puts his hand in his pocket and pulls out 
what cash he has. He does it very cautiously, under the table, 
so that no one else can see it. He hasn't enough -- only two 
one-dollar bills and some small change. Panic seizes him. At 
that moment the waiter returns, expecting to be paid.

			WAITER
	Yes, sir.

			DON
		(A little stiffly)
	One more gin vermouth.

			WAITER
	Yes, sir.

Taking the check, the waiter leaves. Don has gained a little 
time, but what shall he do with it? He considers the 
situation. The door is some thirty feet away, and the check-
room girl stands in front of it. Don looks around. Nobody in 
the bar he knows. Next him the couple is cooing away like 
Spring, -- but on the bench between him and the girl lies 
her bag. It's a handsome leather bag with gold initials, M. 
M. It's about a foot and a half away from him, but it seems 
like a mile and a half to Don. There must be some money in 
that bag. Don looks around the room, his plan forming. No 
one is looking at him. As though inadvertently, he drops his 
hand on the bench beside the bag.

The man is whispering something into the girl's ear. She is 
shaking her head. Don pulls the purse imperceptibly closer 
to himself. Guests and waiters are passing by. Very calmly 
Don smokes his cigarette, a great gentleman. The bag moves 
very close to his coat. Now, switching his cigarette, Don 
crosses his other arm so he can pull the bag up under his 
coat. He pulls it to his armpit and holds it there, tucked 
close to his ribs. Nothing in his face betrays him.

The lovers are still at it. The waiter comes back with the 
drink.

			DON
		(The young Duke)
	Thank you. Where is your wash room?

			WAITER
	Over there, sir.

He points to a door at the other end of the room. On its 
panel is the stylized profile of a gentleman with a top hat.

Don starts to rise. The waiter pulls the table away for him. 
Don carries the bag under his open coat by the pressure of 
his upper arm. Between his fingers is a cigarette, so that 
the whole thing looks fairly natural. There is a tiny puzzled 
look from the waiter as Don walks slowly towards the wash 
room.

B-43 INT. WASHROOM

It's a two-wash-basin affair, with a colored attendant who, 
as Don enters, is brushing a customer.

			ATTENDANT
	How's about a carnation, sir?

			CUSTOMER
	What for?

			ATTENDANT
		(Chuckling)
	For your buttonhole, sir.

			CUSTOMER
	Okay.

On the shelf above the washstand between talcum powder, nail 
files and brushes, there stands a tumbler with carnations. 
The attendant takes one, puts it into the customer's lapel. 
The customer tips him and walks out.

Don is left alone with the attendant, who points to the other 
bowl, runs fresh water in it.

			ATTENDANT
	Right here, sir.

Don steps to the wash bowl. His brain is functioning 
perfectly.

			DON
	Wipe my shoes, will you?

			ATTENDANT
	Yes, sir.

As Don picks up the cake of soap, he watches the attendant 
get a polishing rag and bend down to dust off his shoes. Now 
Don doesn't lose a split second. He plays his cards like a 
master. He puts down the cake of soap, pulls out the bag, 
opens it. There, between a compact, lipstick and keyes, are 
some bills. He fishes out a ten-dollar bill, thrusts it in 
his pocket and is about to close the purse when he sees the 
carnations. He can't help smiling at the idea which flashes 
into his mind. He takes one of the carnations, puts it into 
the purse, closes the purse and thrusts it back under his 
coat. Just as the attendant straightens up, Don puts both 
hands into the water. The attendant holds out a towel, Don 
wipes his hands.

			ATTENDANT
	How's about a carnation?

			DON
		(Raffles by now)
	I took one.

			ATTENDANT
	You did, sir?

He looks at Don's lapel, mystified,

			DON
	Yes, for a very kind lady.

Don tips the attendant with a fifty-cent piece. The attendant 
doesn't get the joke but chuckles automatically and opens 
the door into the bar.

B-44 THE BAR

The piano isn't being played and the place is strangely quiet. 
Don walks from the wash room, slowly towards his table. 
Suddenly he stops. The space where the lovers sat is empty 
now. That's the storm signal. Don looks around. Near the 
little piano stands Don's waiter, the head waiter, the piano 
player and the lovers. They're staring at Don. In fact, he's 
suddenly aware that he is the focus of every eye in the room. 
In the next second the storm breaks.

			WAITER
	That's him. That's the man.

			HEADWAITER
	You were sitting here, sir?

			DON
	I beg your pardon.

He doesn't play it very well now. M.M.'s escort is right at 
him, grabbing him by the coat.

			M.M.'S ESCORT
	You took this lady's bag, didntcha? 
	Come on, give it back.

			DON
		(With very little 
			hesitation and a wan 
			smile)
	Of course.

He takes the bag out from under his coat and hands it to the 
lady.

			M.M.'S ESCORT
	Somebody call a cop.

			M.M.
	No, George, no. It doesn't matter as 
	long as I have the bag.

			M.M.'S ESCORT
	Well, look in it. Maybe he's taken 
	something.

			DON
	Ten dollars, to be exact.

Don holds out the bill. M. M.'s escort snatches it from his 
hand.

			M.M.'S ESCORT
	I ought to kick your teeth in.

			M.M.
	George, George! He's drunk.

			HEADWAITER
		(Grabbing Don)
	Get out of here.

			WAITER
	How about the check?

			DON
	Exactly. That's why I had to borrow 
	from the lady. I didn't have enough.

He fishes what money he has left from his pocket. The waiter 
snaps it up.

			DON
	I'll come back and pay the rest.

			HEADWAITER
	Don't you show your face here again 
	ever.
		(Shouting towards the 
			entrance door)
	Mike! Mike!
		(To waiter)
	Come on, Charlie.

He and the waiter grab Don, start him towards the door. From 
the street comes Mike, the huge doorman-bouncer. He helps 
with the ejection.

			DON
		(To the entire bar)
	I assure you I'm not a thief. I'm 
	not a thief!

As they drag him toward the entrance door, the pianist, in 
an access of delicate humor, begins to pound the piano and 
sing, "Somebody stole my purse, Somebody stole my purse."

By this time they've got Don to the door. The headwaiter 
gets Don's hat from the checkroom girl's hand. He puts it on 
Don's head, the bouncer pulls him through the door.

B-45 EXT. FIFTY SECOND STREET (NIGHT)

A line of waiting taxis along the brilliantly lighted night 
club street. The bouncer, dragging Don from Harry's and Joe's, 
gives him one last shove down the street.

Don comes to a stop and leans heavily against an iron railing, 
wiping his face with his hand. He straightens his hat, looks 
back. The doorman and the taxi drivers are staring after 
him. Don turns, straightens himself as best he can and starts 
for home, shame weighing down every limb.

												DISSOLVE TO:

B-46 STAIRCASE & FOURTH FLOOR LANDING, BIRNAM APT. HOUSE 
(NIGHT)

It is meanly lighted by the wall brackets. The newspaper, 
the bottle of milk, Helen's note -- are all as they were.

Don drags himself up the last few steps, unlocks the door 
and goes in, leaving paper, bottle and note untouched.

B-47 INT. BIRNAM APARTMENT - DARK

Don has entered. Automatically he switches on the light in 
the corridor. In a stupor of shame and misery he stumbles 
over to the living room couch, flings himself down on it and 
lies covering his face with his arms. After a time he brushes 
the tears from his eyes with his sleeve and as he does so, 
catches sight of something which rivets his attention, brings 
a half-crazed smile to his lips.

On the ceiling is the shadow of the bottle which he hid in 
the light fixture.

With new strength Don gets to his feet, nervous laughter 
shaking him. He pulls the coffee table under the light 
fixture, puts the chair on it, climbs up and retrieves his 
bottle. He climbs down again, opening the bottle fiercely. 
He goes to the table where his empty glass stands, pours it 
half full. Over his face as he looks at the glass of whiskey 
comes the uplifted peace of a worshipper at the high altar. 
There the glass stands, gleaming in the light from above. 
Again the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES TOWARD IT, immerses in its 
depths. Oblivion again.

				SEQUENCE "C"

FADE IN:

C-1 THE BIRNAM APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

About 9:30 the next morning. The living room is in the same 
wild disorder -- books on the floor, a table on the chair 
under the ceiling fixture, the couch moved from the wall, 
clothes and shoes spilled from the closet. Two empty bottles 
and a sticky glass stand about, and the portable, with its 
almost virgin sheet of white paper in the roller.

It's a nasty sight, and its nastiness is emphasized by the 
sunlight streaming in and mixing with the yellow pallor of 
the electric light, forgotten and burning on.

Don is not in sight. Only the telephone, which stands on the 
desk next the open portable, is alive. It is ringing at the 
top of its bell.

C-2 BIRNAM APARTMENT - BEDROOM

Here reigns the same confusion: the suitcase flung on the 
floor, the window shade flapping, and on the unmade bed, not 
in it, fully dressed -- shoes, suit, tie -- lies Don, the 
comforter and bedspread pulled up over him.

The telephone rings remorselessly. Don opens his eyes slowly. 
The brightness of the day stabs them, he shuts them. Again 
the telephone.

Don gets up. He is weaker than he thought. Steadying himself 
on the bedpost and holding the door frame, he slowly moves 
out of the bedroom.

C-3 LIVING ROOM

Don enters. He seems to be going straight to the ringing 
telephone, only he isn't. He passes it and goes to the open 
window. He puts his arm against the window frame, presses 
his forehead against it, stands there, every vibration of 
the telephone bell shaking his nerves.

			DON
	Stop it, Helen, stop it, stop it. 
	I'm all right. I just can't talk. 
	Stop it.

There is another ring and another, then the phone stops. 
Don's eyes fall on the bottle and the glass by the big chair. 
He moves slowly towards it, picks up the bottle, holds it 
upside down over the glass. One slow drop is all it yields. 
Don puts down the bottle, goes to the other bottle on the 
mantel shelf, picks it up, goes to the kitchen.

C-4 KITCHEN - BIRNAM APARTMENT

In the sink is the bottle Wick emptied that first afternoon. 
Don picks it up, goes back into the living room.

C-5 LIVING ROOM - BIRNAM APARTMENT

Don goes to the glass, holds the two bottles upside down 
over it. Two more meagre drops emerge, like thick syrup. 
They barely stain the bottom of the glass.

Don puts down the two bottles, picks up the glass, empties 
the pitiable three drops into the parched desert of his 
throat. For a second it seems that he has found some relief. 
That's not true. His need for alcohol has been multiplied 
tenfold by that mockery of a drink. He's got to get another 
bottle, another drink.

What are his finances? Quickly he goes through his pockets. 
In the palm of his hand there are exactly two cents. He looks 
around the apartment. There on the desk stands the typewriter. 
Don walks towards it, rips the sheet of paper from the roller, 
slams the lid of the cover shut, picks up the typewriter. It 
is heavy, terribly heavy. He drags it to the little hall, 
picks up his hat and puts it on.

At the door, weakness overcomes him. Dragging his hand with 
it, the typewriter sinks to the floor.

			DON
	You'll never make it. You'll never 
	make that hock shop. It's a block 
	and a half away.

He is crouched helplessly against the door. At that moment 
the telephone shrills again. Once more Don straightens 
himself, opens the door and leaves.

C-6 OUTER DOOR - BIRNAM APARTMENT

The note from Helen is still pinned to the door. There are 
now two newspapers, two bottles of milk. Don steps over them 
carefully, closes the door and starts down the stairs.

												DISSOLVE TO:

C-7 EXT. BIRNAM APARTMENT - (SUNNY MORNING)

Mrs. Deveridge and her dog Sophie are outside the apartment 
house. Mrs. Deveridge is talking to Dave, the janitor, who 
leans on his broom.

Don comes from the house with the typewriter. He stops to 
make sure the two are absorbed in conversation, then steps 
quickly past them down the street toward Third Avenue. Looking 
back to see whether they have seen him, he turns into Third 
Avenue and starts uptown.

C-8 THIRD AVENUE

This is to be Don's Via Dolorosa, this black, roaring, 
perilous street up which he, drags the hellish weight of 
that portable -- that portable which grows heavier with every 
step -- in quest of a pawn shop which will give him a few 
dollars for it. A few dollars which will mean drink, drink 
which he needs to live.

Setting his jaw and whipping on his will, he reaches the 
first hock shop. A steel gate is drawn across its entrance. 
Don stares at the obstruction, completely mystified. There 
is a woman standing nearby, wheeling a baby in a baby 
carriage. Don turns to her.

			DON
	This isn't Sunday, is it, lady?

			WOMAN
	Huh?

			DON
	I asked is this Sunday.

			WOMAN
	No, Sattaday. Why?

			DON
	Because it's closed.
		(Looking around)
	Nothing else is closed.

			WOMAN
	Well, somebody passed away, most 
	likely.

Don stands helpless for a moment, then, feeling the woman's 
intrusive stare, straightens up. In the next block, miles 
and miles away for the way he feels, is another pawn shop. 
He starts for it.

Again every step is agony. Overhead the elevated thunders 
excruciatingly. Sweat pours from his forehead. He changes 
the typewriter from one hand to another.

At last he makes the second pawn shop. It too is closed. He 
peers through the iron gate into the dark shop, turns around.

Across the street, in the same block, is the third pawn shop. 
He must make it, but to get there he must cross the raging 
torrent of Third Avenue.

He makes a pillar of the el, leans against it, shaking. When 
a trolley car gets out of his way, he continues to cross the 
street.

That pawn shop is closed too. Don takes a bar and shakes it.

			DON
	What's going on? What is it? Did you 
	all go to a funeral, all of you? 
	Maybe it's you that died, Don Birnam. 
	Maybe it's your funeral.

He pulls himself away and recrosses the street.

Reason has entirely deserted him, but blind instinct drives 
him on.

Sixty-first Street, Seventy-first Street. Four more pawn 
shops, all of them closed. Seventy-ninth Street. He's almost 
struck by a car. The typewriter falls from his hand. A truck 
runs over it but straddles it. Don gets it again.

Up the street, up the street, up the street. One pawn shop 
closed after another. His feet are burning, as if the sidewalk 
were hot lava. His ears are bursting.

Eighty-ninth Street, Ninety-fifth Street. Past bars, funeral 
parlors, children on roller skates, and always the recurrent 
torture of the elevated overhead. On and on, unable to stop.

Finally, half dead, he reaches a pawn shop on 120th St., and 
finds the answer to his crucifixion. Two men in dark suits 
with black bowlers and prayer books under their arms watch 
him as he rattles the closed gate of the pawn shop, almost 
out of his mind.

			1ST MAN
	What's the matter with you?

			DON
	Why are they all closed? They're all 
	closed, every one of them.

			1ST MAN
	Sure they are. It's Yom Kippur.

			DON
	It's what?

			1ST MAN
	It's Yom Kippur, a Jewish holiday.

			DON
	It is.

That makes sense to him. Or does it?

			DON
	What are you talking about? How about 
	Kelly's? How about Gallagher's?

			1ST MAN
	They're closed too. We've got an 
	agreement. They keep closed on Yom 
	Kippur and we don't open on St. 
	Patrick's.

The two men stand grinning.

			DON
		(Almost weeping)
	That's a good joke. That's funny, 
	that's very funny.

He picks up the typewriter, turns and starts walking back. 
THE CAMERA goes slowly up to a sidewalk clock with a diadem 
of three balls, which stands outside the hock shop. The time 
is twenty minutes of one.

							VERY SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

C-9 THE CLOCK IN NAT'S BAR

It says five minutes of four. THE CAMERA PANS DOWN. Nat is 
at the bar. He and two or three customers are listening to 
race results on a little radio. Don drags himself in, drenched 
in sweat, his breath as short and agonized as that of a dying 
man. He goes to the end of the bar closest the door, hoists 
the typewriter on it with a final awful effort, leans his 
head on it.

			DON
	Nat --

Nat comes to him.

			NAT
	What's the matter, Mr. Birnam?

			DON
	Let me have one, Nat. I'm dying. 
	Just one.

			NAT
	I thought you were home writing that 
	book.

			DON
	They're playing a trick on me. A 
	dirty trick. Give me one, Nat. I'll 
	pay you when I can. Just don't let 
	me die here.

			NAT
	No credit, and you know it.

			DON
	All right, so it's charity. I'm 
	begging you for one. Give me one.

			NAT
	Yeah, one.
		(Pouring a drink)
	One's too many and a hundred's not 
	enough.

He shoves the drink at Don.

Don is shaking so that he can't pick up the glass. He bends 
down, sucks half of it, then lifts the glass, drains the 
rest. He holds out the empty glass to Nat, his eyes imploring.

			NAT
	That's all.

			DON
	Come on, Nat, come on. I'll let you 
	have my typewriter.

			NAT
	I'm no writer. You're the writer. 
	Now go. Go away.

			DON
	Nat --

			NAT
	I mean it. Get out.

Don takes the typewriter, drags himself out of Nat's place.

C-10 THIRD AVENUE, OUTSIDE NAT'S

Don emerges, starts dragging himself up the street towards 
home. As he passes the antique shop, suddenly he stops. There 
stands the wooden Indian Gloria spoke about, pointing up. 
That's where Gloria lives. Second floor, this same house. 
Don walks into the house.

												DISSOLVE TO:

C-11 STAIRS AND HALLWAY OUTSIDE GLORIA'S DOOR

This is a really crummy Third Avenue house -- dark woodwork, 
paint peeling from the walls. Beside the door at the head of 
the stairs there are about three bells, for the several 
occupants of the apartment within. Don drags himself up the 
stairs, puts down the typewriter and inspects the name tags 
by the bells. One of them says: GLORIA DE VRIES. Don rings 
the bell beside it. From inside comes:

			GLORIA'S VOICE
	Who is it?

Don rings again.

			GLORIA'S VOICE
	Who is it?

			DON
	It's me.

The door is opened by Gloria. She is wearing a dressing gown 
and bedroom slippers. Her hair is the ruined elaborate 
hairdress of yesterday, and her eyes are blazing with anger.

			GLORIA
	Why, Mr. Birnam, as I live and 
	breathe! Only if you're coming for 
	our date, you're a little late, aren't 
	you, Mr. Birnam? And if you're coming 
	to apologize -- no thanks. Thanks a 
	lot, but no thanks.

			DON
	Gloria --

			GLORIA
	Save your saliva. I've had enough of 
	you. Def, but def. What do you think 
	I am? I break a business date. I buy 
	an evening purse, a facial, a new 
	hair-do. Well, maybe you can do that 
	to your ritzy friends. You can't to 
	me, understand?

			DON
	Gloria.

			GLORIA
	Okay, what do you want, Mr. Don Birnam 
	Esquire?

			DON
	I need some money.

			GLORIA
	You what?

			DON
	Could you let me have some money?

			GLORIA
	Say, you out of your mind? Don't be 
	ridic. Get out of here. Make with 
	those stairs. Go on!

She starts back into the apartment, but Don gets her by the 
hand, pulls her towards him and kisses her. At first she 
resists, then her hand creeps up to the back of his neck, 
clutches it hungrily.

			GLORIA
	I was waiting half the night, like 
	it was the first date I ever had. 
	And the other half I was crying.
		(She looks at him)
	How much money?

			DON
	Could you let me have ten or five, 
	or something?

			GLORIA
	I'll see.

She slips into the apartment, leaving the door about three 
inches a jar. Don leans against the door jamb, breathing 
heavily.

After a couple of seconds Gloria reappears with a wallet. 
She takes five dollars out, gives it to him. Don takes it 
with a shaking hand.

			GLORIA
		(noticing)
	You look awful sick, honey. You got 
	a fever or something?

She brushes his forehead with the back of her hand.

			DON
	I'm all right now.

He takes her hand and kisses it. Gloria looks at him, then 
at her hand.

			GLORIA
	Thank you a lot. You do really like 
	me a little, don't you, honey?

			DON
	Why, natch, Gloria. Natch.

He bends, picks up the typewriter and starts downstairs. 
Gloria looks after him. From inside the apartment comes:

			NAGGING WOMAN'S VOICE
	Gloria, where are you?

			GLORIA
	Coming.

She reenters the apartment, closing the door.

C-12 STAIRCASE - GLORIA'S HOUSE

Don is coming down, holding the banister with his left hand, 
the typewriter in his right. Up the staircase comes a little 
girl about seven, running a stick along the spindles of the 
banister and singing the Hut Sut Song. The sound makes Don 
wince, and as the child gives no sign of yielding precedence 
to him, he switches the typewriter to his other hand and 
leans against the stair wall.

The child passes him. As Don goes on, he slips, starts 
falling, clutches a light bracket trying to check his fall. 
It pulls from the wall under his weight and he falls, 
clutching the typewriter, down the long flight of stairs. A 
terrible, back-breaking fall.

The little girl stands horrified, then starts crying and 
runs up the stairs. For an instant Don lies at the foot of 
the stairs, still clutching the typewriter. His hat has fallen 
off. He struck his head. It is in wild pain. He gets to his 
knees, to his feet, lunges towards the door to the street, 
taking the five dollars from his pocket.

C-13 THIRD AVENUE

Don comes out of Gloria's house, staggers towards Nat's bar, 
the typewriter in one hand, the five dollars in the other.

			DON
	Nat! I've got money now, Nat, I've 
	got money!

The fall has been too much for him. He sinks to his knees, 
drags himself a few feet.

			DON
	I need a straight one, Nat! Quick, 
	quick!

He collapses. People become aware of him -- one, two, four. 
A crowd closes in.

Don lies on the sidewalk, looking up helplessly. His eyes 
are dim. He tries to hold the money up but is too weak. His 
hand drops back. The ring of faces looks down at him, among 
them the familiar face of Nat.

			DON
	Nat. I got the money, Nat.

There is the clang of an ambulance, the shriek of brakes. 
The faces part to let two stretcher-bearers bend over Don 
and take him on a stretcher.

Don is carried to the ambulance as the crowd watches.

The doors of the ambulance are closed. The ambulance starts 
off, bell ringing like mad.

Nat has picked up the typewriter and looks after the 
ambulance, his eyes full of pity.

C-14 INT. MOVING AMBULANCE

Don lies half-conscious, his eyes staring through the 
ambulance window.

C-15 TO C-25 OUT OF THE AMBULANCE WINDOW - (TRANSPARENCIES)

Fleeting impressions of a wild `U' turn on Third Avenue -- 
the elevated, the Chrysler Building, the tall midtown 
structures, the lower houses of downtown, a high iron fence, 
the entrance of Bellevue Hospital.

C-26 DON - IN THE AMBULANCE

His eyes close. He loses consciousness.

D-1 A WIRE BASKET WITH FOUR MILK BOTTLES IN IT

moving away from the CAMERA. Gradually we see that it is in 
the hand of a milkman ascending the stairs of the Birnam 
apartment house. He leaves a bottle by the door of the rear 
apartment on the third floor, one in front of Mrs. 
Deveridge's, then starts up to the fourth floor.

As he gets halfway up, he stops momentarily in surprise.

In the embrasure by the banister at the top of the stairs, 
wrapped in her leopard coat, is Helen St. James, dozing 
wearily. Beyond her is the door to the Birnam apartment, 
Helen's note still pinned to the panel, two milk bottles and 
the newspapers of the last two days on the threshold.

The milkman resumes his walk, careful not to wake up the 
young lady. He deposits a milk bottle beside the others and 
descends carefully. As he reaches the third floor, Mrs. 
Deveridge, in a kimono, has just opened her door and is taking 
in her milk bottle.

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
		(Briskly)
	Good morning.

The milkman gestures to her not to speak so loudly, then 
makes a mysterious gesture of the thumb indicating the upper 
hall. Mrs. Deveridge looks up. The milkman proceeds down the 
stairs. Mrs. Deveridge sets down the milk bottle and goes up 
the stairs. As she goes, she calls sharply.

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
	Anything wrong up there? Anything 
	wrong?

Helen wakens at the first syllable, orientates herself as to 
where she is, and gets up.

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
	Are you all right?

			HELEN
	I'm fine, thank you.

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
	Have you been here all night?

			HELEN
	I've been waiting for Mr. Birnam.

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
	Mr. Don Birnam?

			HELEN
	Yes. I suppose he must have stayed 
	overnight with -- some friends. He 
	has some friends on Long Island.

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
	Now, now, what kind of story is that?

			HELEN

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
	Look, I'm his landlady. I know what 
	goes on in this house. I know Mr. 
	Don Birnam. I knew all about him the 
	first week they moved here, three 
	years ago. Heard those bottles rattle 
	in their garbage can. I know all 
	about you. You're Don Birnam's girl. 
	I also know he's not staying with 
	any friends in Long Island. He's off 
	on another toot and you know I'm 
	darned right. Now come on down and 
	I'll make you some breakfast.

	I don't care for any breakfast, nor 
	do I care for that kind of talk, 
	even supposing you were right.

	Which I am. Now you're going to have 
	some coffee.

They start downstairs, Mrs. Deveridge talking as they descend.

	I could have kicked him out fifty 
	times. The last when two taxi drivers 
	dumped him into the entrance hall, 
	out cold on the floor, with all my 
	tenants going in and out, and children 
	leaving for school.

			HELEN
	Oh please, please!

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
	Well, I didn't put him out, not as 
	long as his brother could pay the 
	rent. You couldn't help liking him 
	anyway. He was so good-looking, he 
	had such nice manners. He always had 
	a little joke.

	Stop talking about him as if he were 
	dead.

	Did I? I didn't mean to. Hope it 
	wasn't bad luck.

D-2 THE ALCOHOLIC WARD

We start on Don Birnam's face. He is lying on a cot, his 
eyes closed. He has a three-day growth of beard. His face 
has the pallor and immobility of death.

Over the shot come curious sounds of moaning, of incoherent 
mumbling, of slippered feet shuffling along a concrete floor, 
of a mysterious metallic chattering.

Don isn't dead. The sounds reach his ears at last. His eyes 
open for a second. Then his gaze is directed emptily upward.

D-3 THE BILE-COLORED CEILING OF A LARGE ROOM

Over it the same strange noises. Don's eyes (i.E. THE CAMERA) 
slowly descend the bile-colored walls, broken by opaque leaded-
glass windows and the large glassed swinging door leading to 
an outer room. At last the nature of the room itself is 
revealed. It is filled with rows of strangely low cots, about 
thirty of them, standing on dwarf legs. Eight of them are 
occupied by men whose ages range from 20 to 60. Six of them 
are white, two of them colored, All are unshaven and dressed 
in shabby flannel hospital pajamas.

Don's dull eyes don't quite comprehend. His head aches 
furiously. In the cot next him is a man about 50, burrowing 
into the mattress in drunken sleep, his mouth fallen open. 
In the cot opposite him, a very thin young fellow lies shaking 
and sweating profusely. His entire frame, all of it, trembles 
as if a fine motor operated somewhere beneath the mattress 
itself.

On the other side of Don's cot, a huge negro lies babbling 
incoherently. No words are audible, save now and then a 
number. His voice has the sound of infinite worry.

Against the wall, not far from Don, stands a man about 30, 
in a faded terry-cloth bathrobe. He has an incredibly 
sensitive face. One ear is bandaged. He looks as though he 
wanted to crawl into the wall from shame. The rest of the 
men in the cots are sleeping lumps.

Don addresses the man standing against the wall.

			DON
	What's this place?

The man looks at Don but doesn't answer.

			DON
	Hey, you, what's this place?

The man stands staring at him, terrified.

			DON
	I'm talking to you.

The man drifts away eerily.

From the opposite direction comes a male nurse. He is a robust 
guy with a sarcastic mouth. He makes constantly with the 
jokes, all of them at the listener's expense. His name is 
BIM.

			BIM
	Good morning, merry sunshine. How's 
	your head?

			DON
	Where am I? What is this?

			BIM
	This? This is the Hangover Plaza.

			DON
	What hospital is this?

			BIM
	Alcoholic Ward. How's the head?

			DON
	It aches.

			BIM
	We thought you'd fractured her till 
	we seen the X-rays. All in one piece. 
	Just a concussion.

			DON
	Why did they put me in the Alcoholic 
	Ward?

			BIM
	Are you kidding? We took a peek at 
	your blood. Straight applejack. Ninety-
	six proof.

			DON
	What day is this?

			BIM
	Sunday.
		(He holds out the key-
			ring)
	These yours? They fell out of 
	somebody's pocket. You and the colored 
	fellow was being undressed at the 
	same time.

			DON
	They're mine.

Bim throws them at him.

			DON
	Are you a doctor?

			BIM
	Nope. I'm a nurse. Name of Dolan. 
	They call me Bim. You can call me 
	Bim.

He gets a pad and pencil from his pocket.

			BIM
	What's your name?

			DON
	Birnam.

			BIM
	What kind of Birnam?

			DON
	Don Birnam.

			BIM
	Where do you live?

			DON
	Two hundred and nine East Fif -- 
	Say, what do you need that for?

			BIM
	For the post card.

			DON
	What post card?

			BIM
	To your folks, so's they'll know 
	where honey-boy is and where they 
	can pick him up when he's feeling 
	better.

			DON
	No address.

			BIM
	Okay. We'll get it out of the 
	telephone book, or the directory, or 
	maybe you've got it in your wallet.

			DON
		(On his feet)
	No post card. Understand? Nobody's 
	going to pick me up.

			BIM
	The management insists. If we let 
	you guys go home alone a lot of you 
	don't go home. You hit the nearest 
	bar and bounce right back. What we 
	call the Quick Ricochet.

			DON
	Listen, I'm as well as you are. I 
	can leave right now.

			BIM
	You think so?

			DON
	Where are my clothes?

			BIM
	Downstairs.

			DON
	How do I get out of this place?

			BIM
		(Pointing to the glass 
			doors)
	Right through here.

Don has risen. He is wearing flannel pajamas like all the 
rest of the patients. There are canvas slippers on his feet. 
He is not quite as steady on his pins as he thought. However 
he manages to make the swinging glass door.

Bim stands quietly watching him, a great big grin on his 
face.

D-4 THE ANTE-ROOM

It is L-shaped, about fourteen feet wide. Along the walls 
are benches and a collection of wheel-chairs. Sitting on 
them and milling aimlessly around, are some thirty alcoholics. 
They wear terry-cloth bathrobes over their pajamas, canvas 
slippers on their feet. They are well on their way to 
normality, but they are still not a pretty sight -- unshaven, 
bunged-up, shame-faced.

In the listless, burned-out collection, Don is the only person 
who moves with purpose. He scarcely notices the men as he 
passes them, intent on finding the door. He goes around the 
bend of the ell and there is the door, a heavy wooden one 
with a grated peep-hole and beside it a uniformed guard. Don 
goes to the door, tries to open it.

			GUARD
	Where do you think you're going?

			DON
	To get my clothes.

			GUARD
	You got your discharge?

			DON
	My what?

			GUARD
	Your release?

			DON
	I'm all right. Let me out.

At this moment the door is opened by another male nurse, 
carrying a pile of clean sheets and pillow cases. Don tries 
to take advantage of the opening of the door to get out, but 
the guard pulls him by the arm, while the entering nurse 
locks the door with his own key.

			GUARD
	Go on, get back.

			DON
	Keep your hands off me.

Over the shot comes:

			BIM'S VOICE
	Birnam!

Don turns, At the bend of the corridor stands Bim, with a 
tumbler of medicine in his hand.

			BIM
	Come here, Birnam.

Don approaches him slowly.

			DON
	Is this a jail?

			BIM
	Well, this department -- it's kind 
	of halfway hospital, halfway jail, 
	but we run it more like a flophouse.

He guides Don back toward the ward, CAMERA AHEAD OF THEM.

			DON
	Listen, Bim, in my clothes there's 
	five dollars. That's for you if only 
	you won't send that post card.

			BIM
	Nothing doing.

			DON
	I don't want anybody to know.

			BIM
	Listen, your folks might as well get 
	used to our little post cards,

			DON
	What are you talking about?

			BIM
	There'll be more of them, You'll be 
	back.

			DON
	Shut your face.

			BIM
	Listen, I can pick an alky with one 
	eye shut. You're one and you'll come 
	back. They all do.

He points at a man in a wheel-chair,

			BIM
	Him, for instance. He turns up every 
	month, just as sure as the gas bill.
		(He points at another 
			man)
	And him there. That's another 
	repeater. This is his forty-fifth 
	time. Big executive in the advertising 
	business, A lovely fellow. Been coming 
	here ever since 1927. Good old 
	prohibition days. You should have 
	seen the place then. Say, this is 
	nothing. Back then we had really a 
	turnover. Standing room only. 
	Prohibition! That's what started 
	half these guys off. Whoopee!

They have reached the ward by now.

D-5 THE WARD

Bim seats Don on his bed.

			BIM
	Now lie down like a good boy and 
	drink this.

			DON
	What is it?

			BIM
	Doctor's orders. It'll calm you down.

			DON
	I don't want it.

			BIM
	You better take it. Come the night 
	there's apt to be a little floor 
	show around here. Might get on your 
	nerves.

			DON
	Floor show?

			BIM
	Didn't you ever have the D.T.'s?

			DON
	No.

			BIM
	You will, brother.

			DON
	Not me.

			BIM
	Want to make a small bet? You're 
	just a freshman. Wait till you're a 
	sophomore. That's when you start 
	seeing the little animals.
		(He holds out the 
			drink)
	Drink it.

			DON
	I don't want it.

			BIM
	That stuff about pink elephants, 
	that's the bunk. It's little animals. 
	Little tiny turkeys in straw hats. 
	Midget monkeys that come through the 
	key-holes. See that guy in the corner?

He points to the man with the sensitive face, who stands 
against the wall.

			BIM
	With him it's beetles. Comes the 
	night, he sees beetles crawling all 
	over him. Has to be dark, though. 
	It's like the doctor was saying to 
	me, "Delirium is a disease of the 
	night." Well, good night.

And on the grinning face of Bim,

D-6 THE WARD - (NIGHT)

It is lighted by a faint blue light, but the lights are on 
in the anteroom and some light comes through the glass doors. 
There are the sounds of a ward full of drunken men -- sighs, 
heavy breathing, snoring, babbling, moaning. On his cot lies 
Don, his eyes wide open. Suddenly there comes a sharper sound -- 
a violent slapping of a bed. Don pivots in the direction of 
the sound.

On a cot in the corner is the man with the sensitive face 
and the addiction to beetles. He is slapping wildly at his 
bed, moaning. He rises and begins to slap the wall and scream.

Don stares at him through the dimness.

Through the glass doors come two male nurses with flashlights. 
They run to the cot of the D.T. victim. There is a wild 
scrabble as he fights them off. One of the nurses races back 
to the door and calls:

			NURSE
	Straitjacket! And the doctor!

By now, from several other beds in the ward comes demented 
screaming. A third nurse races in, throws a straitjacket to 
the first nurse, hurries to one of the other beds.

Seen through the glass doors, a doctor comes running down 
the ante-room, followed by another male nurse with a cart on 
which are hypodermic syringes, etc. The doctor must have 
been in another building, because over his shoulders is flung 
a dark blue overcoat. He enters the ward and dashes in the 
direction of the beetle patient. As he goes, he tosses the 
overcoat on the empty cot next Don.

Don looks after the doctor, then is fascinated by the coat 
lying beside him. In the corner the three nurses and the 
doctor are working over the beetle patient, the doctor giving 
him a hypo, the nurses getting him into the straitjacket. 
The ward is now really going off like a bunch of firecrackers.

			DOCTOR
		(To the nurses)
	Get him up to the violent ward.

From the cot on the other side of the ward, the third male 
nurse calls:

			3RD MALE NURSE
	Help me with this one, will you, 
	Doc?

The doctor goes to him while the nurses drag the beetle 
patient through the swing door into the ante-room.

Don slips from his bed and, crouching on the floor, pulls 
the doctor's coat from the cot and, holding it tight, crawls 
to the swinging glass doors and slides through them.

D-7 THE LIGHTED ANTE-ROOM

It is empty save for the two nurses, who are leading the 
beetle patient around the bend of the ell. In a crouching 
position, Don makes his way down the ante-room, holding the 
coat close. At the bend he looks.

The two nurses with the beetle patient have reached the outer 
door, beside which stands a night guard.

			1ST NURSE
	Violent ward. Get the elevator.

The guard opens the door and leads the way. The nurses drag 
the patient out.

Don makes his way to the door, glances through the peephole, 
then sneaks out.

D-8 CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE WARD

The guard, the two nurses and the patient are at the elevator. 
Don sneaks behind them, through the door to the fire stairs.

D-9 FIRE STAIRS

Don runs cautiously down, putting the coat on as he goes. He 
feels something in the pocket, takes out a package of 
cigarettes, matches, a couple of nickels. He hurries down 
the stairs.

D-10 GROUND FLOOR CORRIDOR OF HOSPITAL

A guard stands at the steps leading from the main entrance 
to the psychiatric hospital. He is talking with three female 
nurses. Don slides behind them and out the entrance, which 
is by now grey with the cold dawn.

D-11 EXT. ENTRANCE TO PSYCHIATRIC WARD

Don comes out, orientates himself quickly, runs through the 
gate and up the deserted street.

D-12 A STREET IN THE 20'S

Deserted except for a water wagon. Don runs up it toward the 
entrance of the elevated.

D-13 THE STAIRS OF THE ELEVATED

Don runs up them just as a train rattles in. THE PANNING 
CAMERA catches the train as it leaves for uptown.

D-15 43RD STREET - ABOUT 6:30 IN THE MORNING

Don comes from the elevated, hurries down the street. CAMERA 
PANS with him. Don stops in front of a shop. On its window 
is painted LIQUOR AND WINES, and a couple of bottles are in 
the foreground. It is closed. Don crosses the street and 
stations himself in front of the building opposite, leaning 
against an iron railing.

Elderly people pass him and go up some steps. Slowly Don 
becomes aware that he is standing in front of a church and 
the people are going to morning mass.

THE CAMERA PANS up the church to the cross on its gable, 
then SWINGS ACROSS to the Chrysler Building opposite, now 
bathed in bright sunlight. As the CAMERA PANS along the clear 
sky,

THE CAMERA CONTINUES DOWN to the one-story building which 
houses the liquor shop. It is 9 o'clock by now and the owner, 
a middle-aged man in hat, coat and muffler, is just unlocking 
the door.

Don, tormented by the long wait, sees him open it and starts 
to cross the street.

D-17 INT. THE LIQUOR STORE

The proprietor enters, hangs up his hat, takes off his muffler 
and is about to take off his coat when Don comes in. The 
scene between the two is played very quietly.

			DON
	I want a quart of rye. Quick.

			PROPRIETOR
	All right if I take off my coat first?

			DON
	No.

The proprietor senses that there is something wrong. He looks 
at Don. As his gaze reaches Don's pajama trousers and canvas 
slippers. Don speaks.

			DON
	No cracks, no questions. Just a quart 
	of rye.

The proprietor grasps that this is no joking matter. He picks 
up a bottle.

			PROPRIETOR
	That'll be two fifteen.

			DON
	Give it to me.

			PROPRIETOR
	Two fifteen.

			DON
	Come on. I need that liquor, I want 
	it, I'm going to get it. I'm going 
	to walk out of here with that quart 
	of rye, understand. One way or 
	another.

There is murder in his eyes. The proprietor is completely 
under the spell of that terrible glance. He hands over the 
bottle. Don takes it and walks out. The proprietor takes a 
few steps toward the door as if he were about to summon help 
and catch Don, then he thinks better of it. With a what-the-
hell gesture, he starts taking off his coat.

												DISSOLVE TO:

D-18 EXT. THE BIRNAM APARTMENT HOUSE

Don, holding the bottle under his blue coat, slips quietly 
past Mrs. Wertheim's laundry and into the entranceway. He 
looks inside, to be sure he is not observed, then fishes the 
keys from his pajama pocket, where Bim dropped them, and 
opens his mail box. The post card is there. He takes it out, 
crumples it and, putting it in the pocket of his over-coat, 
goes inside the house.

D-19 INT. THE BIRNAM APARTMENT

Don enters, looks around the apartment, which is still in 
utter disorder. The electric lights, burning on heedlessly, 
offend him and he snaps off the light switch. Automatically 
he takes the chain to hook it into its socket, but misses 
the socket. The chain slips down and dangles.

Don, not noticing, walks to his big chair. On the small table 
next it stand the three empty bottles. He sweeps them to the 
floor. He takes the new bottle from his pocket and, sinking 
into the big chair, starts opening it.

On the desk behind him, the telephone starts ringing. He 
doesn't seem to hear it. Without winking an eyelash, he pours 
his glass half full, lifts it so that glass and hand obscure 
his face.

												DISSOLVE TO:

D-20 THE APARTMENT (NIGHT)

In the dark sits Don, passed out. The bottle next him is 
four-fifths empty. He opens his eyes, still in a half-stupor, 
stares straight before him. Out of the corner of one eye he 
sees something and slowly and with difficulty turns his head.

In the wall above the couch, close to the door, there is a 
hole in the plaster, as if left by a large nail carelessly 
withdrawn so that some of the plaster went with it. Out of 
the hole peers a small mouse.

At first Don draws back, repelled, but the mouse is such a 
friendly, harmless creature that after a moment his face 
relaxes and he half smiles at it.

Just as he does so, from the direction of the window there 
whirs past him a strange winged thing. It is a bat, swooping 
in slow loops around the room. Don crouches into the back of 
his chair, staring in wild distaste. The top of the bat's 
hooked wing nicks his forehead as it speeds in swift but 
fluttering flight straight at the mouse.

Don stiffens against the back of his chair.

The bat has made another swoop and spread its wings over the 
mouse. Beneath those black wings some hideous pygmy struggle 
is going on. Apparently the bat has seized the mouse in its 
claws.

Don gives a cry of horror.

Now from behind the struggling wings comes a spurt of blood.

Don cries out so hard his throat seems to burst apart, buries 
his horrified eyes in the back of his chair.

From downstairs comes the barking of Mrs. Deveridge's dog.

D-21 STAIRCASE TO THE FOURTH FLOOR AND THIRD FLOOR LANDING

Mrs. Deveridge stands about four steps up, looking at the 
door to the Birnam apartment. She must have been listening 
from Don's first scream. Sophie, standing beside her, is 
barking wildly. Beyond her, the door to her apartment is 
open.

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
	Shut up, Sophie! Shut up!

Dragging Sophie after her, she hurries into her apartment.

D-22 LITTLE ENTRANCE HALL OF MRS. DEVERIDGE'S APARTMENT

The telephone is on the table by the door, a memorandum pad 
beside it. Mrs. Deveridge picks up the phone and, glancing 
at the pad, dials a number.

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
		(Into phone)
	Miss St. James?... He's back. He's 
	upstairs... This is Mrs. Deveridge. 
	He's back! In the apartment. I heard 
	him yelling. He's just got to remember 
	that there are other tenants... Miss 
	St. James? Miss St. James?

Helen has obviously hung up. Mrs. Deveridge, a little 
indignant, does the same.

D-23 INT. BIRNAM APARTMENT

Don still cowers in his chair, his face hidden in his arms, 
his breathing heavy with terror. From outside comes the sound 
of footsteps racing upstairs toward his door, then the door-
bell: short, short, long short.

Don's eyes turn slowly toward the door. His brain is still 
functioning, for there is new terror in those eyes.

D-24 EXT. DOOR OF BIRNAM APARTMENT

Helen stands outside, ringing the bell. No answer.

			HELEN
	Don, open the door. Open it, please.

Still no answer and she raps on the door.

He sits staring at the door, holding his breath not to betray 
his presence.

			HELEN'S VOICE
	Don, won't you let me in? I know

Don doesn't move, doesn't answer.

			HELEN'S VOICE
	I won't go away, Don. Do I have to 
	get the janitor with the pass key to 
	let me in?

Don sits bathed in sweat, tears of terror in his eyes.

D-28 HELEN AT THE DOOR

She turns and runs down the stairs. Mrs. Deveridge stands in 
her door, peering up. She hurries to the stairwell and calls 
down it.

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
	Dave! Dave!

			DAVE'S VOICE
	Yes, Mrs. Deveridge?

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
	Come on up with the pass key.

D-29 DON, INT. APARTMENT

His eyes are on the door. Now they focus ON THE DOOR CHAIN. 
It is not hooked in place but hangs limply. Don realizes 
he's forgotten to put it up, but it's not too late, is it? 
With a desperate effort he flings himself to the floor and 
starts inching his way to the door.

D-30 STAIRS LEADING TO THE FOURTH FLOOR

Dave, the janitor, a ring with labelled keys on it in his 
hand, leads Helen and Mrs. Deveridge up the stairs.

D-31 INT. BIRNAM APARTMENT

Don is almost at the door. There is the sound of ascending 
footsteps. With his last strength Don raises himself against 
the door, stretches out his hand, gets the door chain, tries 
to slip it in its notch, but misses. The foot-steps have 
stopped by now. There is the noise of a key being pushed 
into the key-hole. Don tries again, but by this time the 
door is open. Don throws all his weight against the door but 
it is no use.

D-32 OUTSIDE THE DOOR

Dave has opened the door and holds it open as far as he can. 
Helen slips into Dave's place in the doorway. From behind 
the door comes the sound of Don's agonized breathing.

			HELEN
		(Holding the doorknob)
	Thank you very much.

			MRS. DEVERIDGE
	You'd better let us come too. You 
	can't go in there alone.

			HELEN
	I'll be fine, thank you.

She stands waiting until Dave and Mrs. Deveridge start 
downstairs.

D-33 INT. THE APARTMENT

Don crouches behind the door. A shaft of light comes from 
the corridor. Helen enters, closing the door behind her. She 
kneels down beside Don.

			HELEN
	Don, darling --

			DON
	Go away, Helen.

			HELEN
	I'm here to help you, Don.

			DON
	No, no.

			HELEN
	Look at you. How long is it since 
	you've had anything to eat?

Don doesn't answer.

			HELEN
	You want to get up, Don. Put your 
	hand on my shoulder.

Don blindly does as she says.

			HELEN
	You'll have a bath. I'll help you 
	shave. You'll eat and sleep, and 
	when Wick comes back everything will 
	be all right.

They are beside the light switch. Helen snaps it on.

			DON
	No, Helen, no!

			HELEN
	What's the matter, Don?

			DON
	The wall. Don't look.

			HELEN
	What wall?

Don gestures toward the spot where the bat and the mouse 
were.

			DON
	The mouse and the bat.

			HELEN
	What mouse? What bat?

			DON
	That hole in the wall --

			HELEN
	There isn't any hole in the wall. 
	Look.

She leads Don toward it. He stares at the smooth, unstained 
wall.

			HELEN
	See?

Don runs his hand over the wall.

			HELEN
	You had some kind of a nightmare.

She leads him into the bedroom, talking as they go.

			HELEN
	Stop shaking, Don. Everything will 
	be all right. I'll stay right with 
	you.

She seats him on the bed. Don is panting hard, completely 
oblivious of the fact that Helen is in the room.

			DON
	Little animals. It's always little 
	animals. That's what Bim said.

			HELEN
	You're not making much sense.

She turns on the bed lamp.

			DON
	And do you know what Nat said about 
	the ending? Like this.

	Or like that.

He goes on repeating the gesture, growing despair in his 
eyes.

THE CAMERA PANS to include the whole living room. Helen lies 
asleep on the couch, using the pillow and the comforter from 
Wick's bed. She is wearing Wick's foulard dressing gown. The 
room is all tidy now. On the armchair near the kitchen door

In the door to the bedroom stands Don. Now that he is shaved, 
we can see how pale his face is. He wears the dark suit (the 
one he wore to the opera) and as his eyes shift from Helen 
to the coat, he is just tying his tie. He has not yet buttoned 
the buttons on the points of his soft collar. Very cautiously 
he begins to tiptoe toward the chair. He picks up the leopard 
coat and starts towards the entrance door. He opens it 
carefully but it does creak a little.

Just as he is slipping out, comes --

			HELEN'S VOICE
	Don! Don!

Don shuts the door behind him. In the next second Helen 
hurries into the shot. She is barefooted, just wearing the 
foulard dressing gown. She flings open the door and runs 
out.

E-2 FOURTH FLOOR LANDING AND STAIRS

Helen runs to the banister and looks down. Don has already 
reached the second floor and is hurrying down the stairs, 
the fur coat over his arm, not paying any attention to Helen.

			HELEN
	Where are you going, Don?

												DISSOLVE TO:

E-3 EXT. PAWN SHOP, THIRD AVENUE - LIGHT RAIN

Don is just coming from it. He walks down the street about 
ten steps when Helen comes up to him. She wears the dress 
she wore last night. No hat, no coat.

			HELEN
	All right, Don. Give me the pawn 
	ticket.

Don disregards her, tries to go on. Helen overtakes him and 
blocks his way.

			DON
	No scene, please.

			HELEN
	No scene. Just give me the pawn 
	ticket.

			DON
	I don't want you to go in there now 
	claiming it. It would look queer.

			HELEN
	You're ashamed of what the pawn broker 
	may think, is that it? It doesn't 
	matter what I think.

			DON
	Wick'll get you back your coat.

			HELEN
	You couldn't have taken my bracelet 
	or my pay check? It had to be that 
	coat?

			DON
	You mean the one that brought us 
	together? Stop being sentimental.

			HELEN
	I have, Don, I assure you. It's 
	finished. It's dead. For three years 
	they couldn't talk me out of you. I 
	was the only one who really understood 
	you. I knew there was a core of 
	something... And there was a core, 
	and now I know what it is. A sponge. 
	And to soak it full you'll do anything 
	ruthless, selfish, dishonest.

			DON
	I asked you not to make a scene.

			HELEN
	Then give me the ticket.

			DON
	No, Helen, not now I told you. Cut 
	it out.

			HELEN
	I don't want the money. You can get 
	as drunk as you like for all I care.

			DON
	Thank you.

He goes on. Helen stands looking after him for a moment, 
then turns angrily and proceeds toward the pawn shop.

E-4 INTERIOR PAWN SHOP #1

The pawn broker has put Helen's coat on a hanger and is 
brushing it. Helen enters, very matter-of-fact.

			HELEN
	A gentleman was here a while ago. 
	How much did you give him for that 
	coat?

			PAWN BROKER
	Huh?

			HELEN
	I want it back. It's my coat.

			PAWN BROKER
	It's your coat?

			HELEN
	It's all right. He had my permission. 
	How much did you give him?

			PAWN BROKER
	He didn't want any money. He wanted 
	to swap it.

			HELEN
	For what?

			PAWN BROKER
	Something he hocked here a long while 
	back.

			HELEN
	What?

			PAWN BROKER
	A gun. Now if you want that coat I 
	can --

Helen is already out of the shop and running down the rainy 
street.

							DISSOLVE:

E-5 DON'S DESK

On it lies a revolver and the second page of a letter on 
which Don is writing:

...But amid all the grimness can we share one little joke, 
dear Wick: I did finish something, didn't I? Goodbye. Don.

E-6 THE BIRNAM APARTMENT

Don is seated at the desk. As he has been out in the rain, 
his hair is still a little damp. He puts down the pen, gets 
up, stands the letter conspicuously on the desk, picks up 
the revolver, gets the cartridges from the drawer and loads 
the gun. With a last look at the room, he walks into the 
bathroom.

Don stands and looks at himself in the mirror, the gun in 
his hand. He notices the unbuttoned points of his collar and 
with a rueful smile at the funny timing of his urge for 
tidiness, buttons one. As he is buttoning the second, there 
is a sound from outside. Startled, Don puts the gun into the 
empty wash bowl.

The door is being opened. Dave, the janitor, is letting Helen 
in. She looks around wildly. She is breathing hard from her 
race to get there. There is rain on her hair and her face, 
and her dress is wet.

Don comes from the bathroom. Helen stands staring at him, 
wiping the rain from her face, and maybe some tears too.

			DON
	What is it, Helen?

			HELEN
		(To the janitor)
	Thank you very much.

			DAVE
	That's all right, Miss.

He leaves, closing the door. Don and Helen are alone. During 
the following scene, Helen's eyes are constantly on the 
lookout for the gun.

			DON
	What's the matter? Come on.

			HELEN
	Nothing's the matter, except the 
	rain's worse and I can't get a taxi. 
	Perhaps you can lend me a coat under 
	the circumstances.

			DON
	Sure. How about my raincoat?

He takes it from the hook.

			HELEN
	Funny, after all these years we should 
	wind up just as we met -- I with 
	your raincoat --

			DON
	And I with your leopard coat. I always 
	got the best of the bargain. Goodbye, 
	Helen.

			HELEN
	Goodbye.

She stands looking about.

			DON
	What are you looking for?

			HELEN
	I just thought if you had anything 
	for my head --

			DON
	Would you care to wear my black 
	bowler?

			HELEN
	Some old scarf or something.

			DON
	All right.

He steps to the chest of drawers in the bedroom.

Helen, looking around desperately, sees something reflected 
in the shaving mirror: THE GUN IN THE WASH BOWL.

Before she can step toward it, Don is back with the scarf.

			DON
	Here you are.

			HELEN
	Thanks.

			DON
	Well, goodbye.

			HELEN
	Oh, Don, there was still some whiskey 
	left in the bottle when I cleaned up 
	last night.

			DON
	Was there?

			HELEN
	Would you like to know where I put 
	the bottle?

			DON
	No.

			HELEN
	Don't you want a drink, Don?

			DON
	No.

Helen goes to the umbrella stand, takes out the bottle.

			HELEN
	Just one. Look, it's right here.

She puts down the raincoat and the scarf and goes to the 
kitchen for a glass.

			DON
	What are you up to?

			HELEN
	Nothing. I'm just ashamed of the way 
	I talked to you, like a narrow-minded, 
	insensitive, dried-up, small-town 
	teetotaller.

			DON
	I don't feel like a drink. Not now, 
	I told you.

			HELEN
	Come on, Don. Just one. I'll have 
	one with you. I'm in no hurry. This 
	is my easy day at the office.

			DON
	Helen, there are a few things I want 
	to put in order before Wick comes.

			HELEN
	Let me stay.

			DON
	No.

He picks up the raincoat and the scarf.

			DON
	I'm sorry. You'll have to run along.

He bends down for a kiss. Helen stands looking at him.

			DON
	Don't let me bend for nothing.

Helen holds out the glass.

			HELEN
	You need this, Don. Drink it. I want 
	you to drink it. I'll get you some 
	more. I'll get you all you want.

			DON
	What kind of talk is that?

			HELEN
	It's just that I'd rather have you 
	drunk than dead.

			DON
	Who wants to be dead?

			HELEN
	Stop lying to me.

She turns and runs into the bathroom and picks up the gun. 
Don follows her.

			DON
	Give it to me.

Helen holds it behind her.

			DON
	Helen!

Helen turns toward the window, lifting her arm to throw the 
gun out. Don catches her arm and twists it.

			DON
	Let go!

Helen drops the gun.

Don picks up the gun.

			DON
	Go on now.

He half pushes, half leads her into the entrance hall.

			DON
	And no fuss, please. Don't call in 
	the neighbors. It won't do any good, 
	I promise you.

			HELEN
	I won't. You've made up your mind. 
	Could you tell me exactly why?

			DON
	Because it's best all around, for 
	everybody. For you, for Wick, for 
	me.

			HELEN
	That's not true. We love you, Wick 
	and I.

			DON
	All right. Just for me, then. Selfish 
	again.

			HELEN
	That's a sad final word, Don.

			DON
	Look at it this way, Helen. This 
	business is just a formality. Don 
	Birnam is dead already. He died over 
	this weekend.

			HELEN
	Did he? What did he die of?

			DON
	Of a lot of things. Of alcohol, of 
	moral anemia, of fear, of shame, of 
	D.T.'s.

			HELEN
	Oh, that Don Birnam. And now you 
	want to kill the other one.

			DON
	What other?

			HELEN
	There were two Dons. You told me so 
	yourself. Don the drunk and Don the 
	writer.

			DON
	Let's not go back to a fancy figure 
	of speech. There's one Don, and he's 
	through.

A wave of weakness overcomes him and he sags against the 
door.

			HELEN
		(With a gesture toward 
			him)
	Don --

He pushes her away.

			DON
	I'm all right. I have enough strength 
	left.

			HELEN
	I know you have. I can see it. Don't 
	waste it on pulling a trigger, Don.

			DON
	Let me get it over. Or do you want 
	me to give you another one of my 
	promises that I never keep?

			HELEN
	I don't want you to give me your 
	promise. I don't want you to give 
	your promise to anybody but Don 
	Birnam.

			DON
	To me? It's too late. I wouldn't 
	know how to start.

			HELEN
	The only way to start is to stop. 
	There's no cure besides just stopping.

			DON
	Can't be done.

			HELEN
	Other people have stopped.

			DON
	People with some purpose, with 
	something to do.

			HELEN
	You've got your talent, your ambition.

			DON
	Talent. Ambition. That's dead long 
	ago. That's drowned. That's drifting 
	around with a bloated belly on a 
	lake of alcohol.

			HELEN
	It's not. You still have it.

			DON
	Oh, Helen, I couldn't write. What do 
	you expect, a miracle?

			HELEN
	Yes, yes, yes! If I could only make 
	you see --

The buzzer sounds.

			DON
	Who is it?

			NAT'S VOICE
	It's me, Mr. Birnam.

			DON
	What is it, Nat?

			NAT
	I got something for you.

Don goes to the door and opens it. Nat stands outside holding 
something under his wet raincoat.

			NAT
	You know when you had your accident? 
	Well, afterwards I found this floating 
	around on the Nile.

He pulls out Don's typewriter.

			DON
	Thank you, Nat.

			NAT
	She writes real good. I oiled her up 
	a little. And I didn't oil her up so 
	you can hock her.

Helen comes up.

			HELEN
	I'll take it, Nat.

			NAT
	Hello, Miss.

Helen takes the typewriter, carries it toward the desk.

			NAT
	Goodbye, everybody.
		(Discreetly, to Don)
	How's all them lilacs in Ohio?

			HELEN
	Well, Don. here it is. What do you 
	say now?

			DON
	Say about what?

			HELEN
	This. Someone, somewhere, sent it 
	back. Why? Because He means you to 
	stay alive, because He wants you to 
	write. I didn't ask for a big miracle.

			DON
	Write! With these hands?
		(He holds them out; 
			they are trembling)
	And a brain that's all out of focus?

			HELEN
	It'll clear up again. You'll be well.

			DON
	And I'll be sitting there in front 
	of that white piece of paper, scared.

She puts a cigarette in his mouth, lights it.

			HELEN
	No you won't. You've forgotten what 
	it feels like to be well.

			DON
	And what will I write about? What?

			HELEN
	What you always wanted to write. 
	Where's that page?
		(She picks it up)
	"The Bottle. A Novel by Don Birnam." 
	What was that going to be?

			DON
	About a messed-up life. A man, a 
	woman and a bottle. Nightmares, 
	horrors, humiliations, things I want 
	to forget.

			HELEN
	Put them on paper. Get rid of them 
	that way. Tell it all, to whom it 
	may concern. It concerns so many 
	people, Don.

			DON
	Yeah.

			HELEN
	I'll fix us some breakfast.

She starts into the kitchen.

			DON
	We have quite a supply of milk.

Helen goes into the kitchen, puts the gun away, runs water 
into the percolator.

			DON'S VOICE
	You'll notice I didn't even find a 
	first line.

			HELEN
	Of course you couldn't write the 
	beginning because you didn't know 
	the ending. Only now --

She looks into the living room and her face freezes.

Don has risen from the couch and has picked up the glass of 
whiskey. There's a second of hesitation, then he uses it for 
an ashtray, dropping the cigarette into it.

A smile of relief comes on Helen's face.

			HELEN
	Only now you know the ending.

Don has sunk back on the couch again.

			DON
	I'll send one copy to Bim, one to 
	that doctor who loaned me his coat, 
	and one to Nat. Imagine Wick standing 
	in front of a book store. A great 
	big pyramid of my books. A Novel by 
	Don Birnam. "That's my brother, you 
	know."

Helen enters the shot.

			HELEN
	That's by my fellow. Didn't I always 
	tell you?

			DON
	I'm going to put the whole weekend 
	down, minute by minute.

			HELEN
	Why not?

			DON
	The way I stood in there, packing my 
	suitcase...

									SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

E-7 FIRST SHOT OF THE PICTURE

Only this time in reverse: We start with Don standing on 
that sunny day in the bedroom, packing. THE CAMERA MOVES 
AWAY, GOES DOWN THE WALL to the bottle hanging there, and 
MOVES ON ALONG THE BACK OF THE FACADE OF THE APARTMENT to 
the splendid panorama of New York.

			DON'S VOICE
		(continuing)
	Only my mind wasn't on the suitcase, 
	and it wasn't on the weekend. It 
	wasn't on the shirts I was putting 
	in, either. My mind was hanging 
	outside the window. It was suspended 
	about eighteen inches below the 
	sill... And out there in that great 
	big concrete jungle, I wonder how 
	many others there are like me. Poor 
	bedevilled guys, on fire with thirst. 
	Such comical figures to the rest of 
	the world, as they stagger blindly 
	towards another binge, another bender, 
	another spree...
