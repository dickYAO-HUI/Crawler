EXT. PORTLAND, OREGON (ESTABLISHING) - DAYPortland, home of rivers, bridges, and more parks than youcan shake a stick at. The Columbia River, spanned by the Highway 5 and 205bridges, glistens a muddy brown in the sunlight; the Willamette glittersoff to the South.INT. PARKING GARAGE/UPPER LEVEL - DAYEMILY ROSE T. HOPE cut her teeth on a million dollar teethingring, and it was bitter -- too bitter. It left her an old woman's attitudein a young woman's body. She idly taps a cellular phone's keypad with one perfectlymanicured nail as she stares through the parking level's open struts ata distant bridge -- and an approaching river barge. The barge draws closer to the bridge. Closer. Closer still.She takes a drag off a cigarette, stubs it out, and dials a number on thephone's keypad.EXT. BRIDGE - DAYAMADEUS T. HOPE, an older man who most assuredly broke histeeth on a Rolls Royce, stands in a phone booth just off the bridge, waitingfor the phone to ring and caressing a briefcase like it contained a milliondollars -- which it does. Nearby, idle joggers in the park are more thanobviously undercover cops. The phone rings and Amadeus lifts it.AMADEUSI'm here.EMILY (V.O./FILTERED)Amadeus T. Hope?AMADEUSYes.EMILY (V.O./FILTERED)Did you bring the money.AMADEUSYes.EMILY (V.O./FILTERED)Listen carefully.AMADEUSI wish to speak to my daughter.EMILY (V.O./FILTERED)I'm not interested in what you wish, Mr. Hope. Justfollow directions and stick to the plan. Am I clear?AMADEUSVery.INT. PARKING GARAGE/UPPER LEVEL - DAYEmily watches the barge move towards the bridge and readjustsher speaking apparatus -- it's a voice filter and it's a real bitch talkingthrough this rig.EMILYDo you see the barge approaching the bridge?INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAYAmadeus squints through glass booth walls, notes the approachingbarge, nods.AMADEUSI see it.EMILY (V.O./FILTERED)Walk to the bridge, throw the briefcase onto thebarge, and come back to the phone booth for further directions.AMADEUSHow do I know you'll release her?EMILY (V.O./FILTERED)You don't.INT. DETECTIVE VAN - DAYDETECTIVE DAN SIMS is the kind of guy who does his job well,but everything always goes to hell anyway. This gives him a grim take onlife, but he keeps trying. He watches a fellow COP fiddle with telephonetracing equipment. Sims' less than garrulous partner, BARNABY, listens inon an extra set of headphones.COPShit. Cellular phone. SIMSWhat did you expect? A silver platter? COPWould'a been nice.Sims stares out the van's polarized window at Amadeus, who'swalking steadily out along the bridge.SIMSIt's probably hers -- where's he going?BARNABYTo throw the money over the side.SIMSWhat?BARNABYThat's what they just told him to do.Sims, glaring, grabs for a walkie talkie.SIMSWere you going to tell me before or after he tossedit?Barnaby shrugs.SIMS (CONT'D)(into walkie talkie)He's throwing the money onto the barge. I want fullsurveillance -- don't lose that barge --INT. PARKING GARAGE/UPPER LEVEL - DAYEmily's got the phone balanced precariously on one shoulderas she flips open the trunk of a gray Mercedes Benz and extracts some heavyduty tape. She stands again to stare out at the distant bridge. Amadeus, stick figure tiny with distance, heaves his briefcaseover the side and starts back to his phone booth at a steady pace.EMILYNice throw, Dad.Joggers (i.e. under cover cops), looking like ants fromhere, scramble to keep pace with the barge. Emily laughs softly as she tapesher ankles together.The phone crackles to life.AMADEUS (V.O.)You've got the money. Where's my daughter? Ankles taped, Emily hops to the edge of the trunk to rummagefor more bondage paraphernalia and holds the voice filter carefully in placewhile she speaks:EMILYYou'll find her in the trunk of her car, which isin fifth level parking at --She pulls a wrinkled slip of paper from her jeans pocketand squints at it --EMILY (CONT'D)352 East Tenth Street.She hangs up and, working fast now, because time is runningout, gags herself -- a real gag: stuffing, knots, the works. Lifting hand cuffs -- the final touch -- she crawls intothe car's trunk and, still clutching the handcuffs -- presumably for lateruse -- slams the lid closed from the inside. The ECHO of the slamming trunk reverberates through thedim garage, and dies.EXT. BRIDGE - DAYJudging from the number of plain cars screaming out of parkingspaces, it's a good bet they got that address.INT. DETECTIVE VAN - DAYSims comes out of the van at a dead run, talking into awalkie talkie, as undercover cars peel out, SIRENS wailing on as they go.SIMSOdds are someone's still inside monitoring -- He glances at the distant parking structure.SIMS (CONT'D)They can still see us from there, turn off the goddamn sirens!INT. PARKING GARAGE/UPPER LEVEL - DAYThe Mercedes sits innocently in its parking slot. Silence-- except for the slap slap slap of approaching footsteps, and a light,airy tune being whistled by the person approaching.WILL POGUE ambles nonchalantly between cars, well dressedyuppie at large, just picking up his car and heading home -- or that's whatyou'd think, until he saunters to the Mercedes, casually glances both ways,and a slim jim flashes in the gloom. He's inside the car, yanking the ignition and starting themotor, between whistles.EXT. RIVER BARGE - DAYB.g., a helicopter drones. The barge MATE steps out of thewheelhouse, notices the briefcase on the aft deck, frowns, walks to it,picks it up, shakes it, opens it -- and ogles a million bucks, cash.MATEHoly shit! He spins back to the wheelhouse -- a plea for help. MATE (CONT'D)Larry! Larry! You gotta come see this!The PILOT (let's take a wild guess and assume this is Larry)sticks his head out the wheelhouse cabin's door -- just as a helicopterzooms down and a SHARP SHOOTER aims a high powered rifle straight at themate. A HELICOPTER COP leans out with a megaphone.HELICOPTER COP (MEGAPHONED)This is the Portland Police Department. You withthe briefcase, set it down and put your hands on your head.MATEWhat the -- ?HELICOPTER COP (MEGAPHONED)You in the cockpit, pull over immediately.The mate drops the briefcase and money starts flutteringall the hell over.INT. POLICE HELICOPTER - DAYThe sharp shooter smirks at the helicopter cop in a superiorway --SHARP SHOOTERIt's not a car, John, it's a boat. You don't pullover -- -- when he sees the money take wind --SHARP SHOOTER (CONT'D)-- Oh shit, the money!The helicopter cop pales -- still yelling through the megaphone--HELICOPTER COP (MEGAPHONED)-- Oh fuck, the money. You! Pick the briefcase backup!Below, the mate wants nothing more to do with that briefcaseand has gotten down on his knees to say a few Hail Marys.HELICOPTER COP (CONT'D) (MEGAPHONED)You with your hands over your head, pick that briefcaseup immediately!EXT. RIVER BARGE - DAYThe pilot abandons the wheelhouse to try to stop the money'spell mell trail into the sky -- He stops dead when the sharp shooter brings the rifle tobear on him -- going after the money is threatening behavior --The helicopter cop is still yelling through his megaphone--HELICOPTER COP (MEGAPHONED)Pick up that briefcase! You moron! Pick it up!The mate is staring up at the helicopter, eyes big, shakinghis head back and forth -- no way is he touching that brief case --The barge, minus its pilot, hits bottom, the jolt spinningthe briefcase out along the deck --INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAYDan Sims wrestles his seat belt, struggling to snap it intoa mechanism that just doesn't want to work, riding shot gun as the undercovercar careens around the corner and down the street toward the parking structure-- EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAYThe gray Mercedes slips out the structure's exit -- as miscellaneousundercover cars careen past it on their way in -- and turns down the streettowards Sims' car. INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAYDan, cursing his seat belt, glances up in time to see theMercedes pass, does a double take and turns to read the license plate --SIMSHoly shit, that's her car!Barnaby, at the wheel, speeds along in the opposite direction.BARNABYWhat?Sims, still clutching his seat belt, grabs for the sirenas they hit a bump, drops the siren, grabs it again.BARNABY (CONT'D)I thought you said no sirens.SIMSTurn around! That's her god damned car! INT. MERCEDES - DAYWill, whistling casually, hears tires squeal behind himand checks the rear view mirror -- in time to see Sims slap the SIREN atopthe undercover car.WILLHoly shit!Will steps on it, sliding between two more unmarked carsthat screech around corners to cut him off -- he cranks the wheel and avoidsa third -- Will drives better than well -- but he's sweating, cursingunder his breath, fighting to outdistance cop cars converging behind him,to dodge incoming cars that keep adding up --WILL (CONT'D)Jesus Christ, all this for a lousy grand theft auto?EXT. RIVER BANK - DAYLife is not looking good here. Money scattered all overthe ground, all over the water, the barge pilot and mate shaking in theirshoes, the barge grounded in mud at an awkward angle -- and glum undercovercops milling to and fro. The helicopter cop talks into a radio mike.HELICOPTER COPDan, we lost the money.INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAYDan Sims, rocking around each curve, hangs onto his swingingseat belt for dear life and yells into his radio.SIMSWhat do you mean, you lost the money? It's on abarge! How hard could it be to keep track of a barge?HELICOPTER COP (V.O.)We didn't lose the barge. We lost the money.SIMSFor Christ's sake, where'd it go?INT. RIVER BANK - DAYThe helicopter cop stares glumly up at all those flutteringbills in the sky. . . down at all those floating bills on the water. . ..HELICOPTER COPHalf is air borne, and the other half sank.INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - DAYDan's about three shades of purple, still clinging to hisdysfunctional seat belt, yelling into the radio --SIMSWell fish it out! --When the car slows. Dan rounds on Barnaby, the driver.SIMS (CONT'D)What are you slowing down for!BARNABYWe lost him.Sims looks up from the radio at the abandoned street.SIMSGod damn it, where are the helicopters.BARNABYThey lost him too.Sims slumps.SIMSI don't believe this.Barnaby shrugs.BARNABYHe can't have gone far. They'll pick him up.INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - DAYThe warehouse is large, immaculate, and dark -- ground levelwindows are painted black and barred. Shelves hold engine parts. An oldbeat up Porsche Speedster sits in a corner. Loft steps lead to living quartersabove. An electric garage door slides open, triggering a ceilinglight, and Emily's Mercedes glides in. The garage door shuts behind it andWill climbs from the car to run a shaky hand through his hair. B.g., a helicopter DRONES. He lets out an explosion of breath,frowning at the ceiling, WILLing the copter away.WILLJesus.He pats the car.WILL (CONT'D)Who'd you belong to, sweetheart? The president orwhat?He checks the car, inside and out, admiring the interior,checking underneath the chassis.WILL (CONT'D)Last job, and I nab the president's car. It figures.He pops the trunk -- there's Emily, bound and gagged, lookingthe worse for the ride, glaring up at him -- it might have been a mistake,her cuffing her arms behind her back. WILLJesus Christ!He slams the trunk. Muffled POUNDING inside. He opens the trunk cautiously,to stare incredulously at Emily.WILL (CONT'D)Who the hell are you?EMILY (MUFFLED)Mmmmphmmmphmmmphmmmph!WILLI don't need this.He lowers the trunk lid and scrubs his face with a wearyhand.EMILY (MUFFLED) (O.S.)MmmmMmmmph-ph-ph!He raises the trunk lid.WILLCan you breathe?EMILY (MUFFLED)MMmmmmmmMMMphmmmmm!He nods.WILLHave you had water within the last twenty-four hours?EMILYMphMphMph!WILLYou look healthy to me.He slams the lid, jumps into the driver's seat, and hitsthe control for the garage door.WILLSweating, revving the engine, waiting for clearance underthe door --WILLIt's okay. She doesn't know your name. She doesn'tknow the address. Nobody saw you come in. We're just going to leavethe car somewhere for the cops to find. No. She could die by then.Okay, we'll call the cops -- an anonymous tip. No problem. Finda corner. Dump the car. Stay calm. Everything is all right --As the garage door opens, the helicopter DRONE fills thewarehouse.Will sits, listening to that drone in the sky, tapping thesteering wheel -- he turns off the engine and listens a second longer, beforeclosing the garage door against that sound. WILLShit.INT. AMADEUS's STUDY - EVENINGAn ad for the house would boast five fireplaces, parkingfor nine cars, two hundred feet of river frontage, a dock. . . we are talkingexceptionally expensive -- and frighteningly neat. THOMAS PERKINS steps into the study: Thomas has scars toprove he's been bad places and lived to not talk about them, whichconflicts with his million dollar suit only insofar as he wears it well.Amadeus, intently manicuring what looks like a perfectlymanicured Bonsai, nods.AMADEUSSomeone's kidnapped Emily.Perkins snorts. Amadeus pinches off a microscopic sectionof tree, discarding it in an empty waste basket.AMADEUSThe police --(Amadeus uses the word "police" much theway a bull dyke says "penis")PERKINSYou called the police. AMADEUSNo. They called the police.PERKINSThey. AMADEUSYes.PERKINSWell she's got your attention now, hasn't she?Amadeus shoots him a dour glance.AMADEUSI fail to see the humor in the situation, Thomas.There's a precedent at stake here.Thomas snorts again -- no way is he believing this.AMADEUS (CONT'D)The police informed me a man drove her car awayfrom the pick-up zone.Thomas frowns -- less sure of himself.PERKINSAn accomplice? That doesn't sound like Emily.A peremptory KNOCK and Dan Sims pushes into the study. Thomasturns, giving Sims a view of the back of his head and not much else. SIMSMr. Hope, I'd love to answer phones in your foyerall day, but this man --Sims glowers at Thomas's back.SIMS (CONT'D)-- is not on my roster of household staff -- orguests.AMADEUSMr. Perkins is a private associate, Detective Sims.He'll be taking over.SIMSExcuse me?AMADEUSYour services are no longer necessary, DetectiveSims. If you WILL excuse us?Amadeus drops another nothing into the waste basket -- amove not lost on Sims.SIMSWe are not a cleaning service, Mr. Hope. We arethe police.Amadeus stares blankly, like "what's the difference?" PERKINSI think what Detective Sims is trying to say, Amadeus,is you can't fire the police.SIMSExactly.AMADEUS(to Perkins)Are you sure about this?Perkins nods solemnly.AMADEUS (CONT'D) Very well, Detective Sims may maintain surveillance.Sims chokes.SIMSI. May.AMADEUS (to Sims)That will be all, Detective Sims.Sims stands his ground, mutely refusing dismissal.AMADEUS (CONT'D)Unless you'd like to discuss the money.SIMSI'll be in the foyer.Sims spins for the door -- the door handle fights him.AMADEUS Turn to the right, Detective Sims.Sims, crimson, turns to the right.AMADEUS (CONT'D)And Detective Sims? If you're going to remain afixture in this household, speak to my assistant -- he'll cut youa wardrobe check.The door slams behind Sims.AMADEUS (CONT'D)Nobody holds me hostage.Perkins stares into a glass case -- one of those pedestaljobs you find museum displays in, but this holds photographs:Emily at three; Emily at the military academy; Emily atgraduation; Emily at a high powered reception beside her father -- ThomasPerkins loves that little girl.PERKINSWe'll make that clear.INT. AMADEUS'S ANTEROOM/OFF THE STUDY - EVENINGWires run from phones to phones to black boxes -- presumablythe latest in police tech surveillance -- monitored by bleary eyed COPS.Amadeus's ASSISTANT attempts to work around the squad roomsqualor. Barnaby, being a calm soul, doesn't jump when Sims slamsin.SIMSMr. Hope just fired us.Shocked silence from the cops -- sounds perfectly reasonableto Hope's assistant, though.HOPE'S ASSISTANTYou'll be leaving, then.Dan stares at the assistant, incredulous.SIMSNo we won't be leaving!COPCan he do that?SIMSNo he can't do that!BARNABY(aside to the cop)We're the police, Corey.COPOh, right.SIMS Let's get this straight. We are the police. Andwe are in control here. ASSISTANTNot on this planet.INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - EVENINGThe Porsche is gone. The Mercedes sits in the gloom.INT. MERCEDES/TRUNK - EVENINGEmily is in a minor fix -- and judging from the sweat anddiscontent factor, has been for some time. It's not easy to pass arms, handcuffedbehind you, under your legs to in front of you -- especially when you'relying on your side in a trunk -- and Emily's stuck mid-way. She struggles again to get her hands past her feet. Strugglessome more. They come free.Next job is to wrench the gag away -- she tied a good gag,so it's tough going, but she gets it off. She yanks stuffing from her mouth,takes a big breath -- spits, tries to wet her mouth.EMILYThank God.Smiling grimly at success, she extracts the handcuff keyfrom her front jeans pocket and releases the cuffs. EMILY (CONT'D)Can you breathe. What an asshole.EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHTWill's old Porsche glides down a dimly illuminated street.INT. WILL'S PORSCHE (WAREHOUSE DISTRICT) - NIGHTWill's checking the neighborhood for signs of stress, andwhat he sees isn't good. On the corner, a cruiser.WILLCop.Across the street, another cruiser.WILL (CONT'D)Cop.Overhead, a helicopter. WILL (CONT'D)Cop. On the sidewalk, a German Shepherd -- WILL (CONT'D)Cop -- dog?He shakes his head.WILL (CONT'D)Don't be paranoid. That is not a cop dog.He cranes his neck to stare up through the windshield.WILL (CONT'D)But that is definitely a cop helicopter.He eyes the passing cruiser.WILL (CONT'D)And that is definitely a cop car.Another cruiser sits quietly on the corner, lights out,but there's a guy in uniform in the car all right.WILL (CONT'D)Cop cop cop.Will jerks the steering wheel hard, swerving down a darkstreet and away --INT. MERCEDES/TRUNK - EVENINGEmily searches around the trunk lid's key slot -- frustrated,not finding what she wants, then finding it -- a small hole in the metal-- There's a piece of metal blocking the mechanism that wouldusually allow someone to open the trunk from the inside.EMILYWhy does it always have to be the hard way?She squirms around to face the back of the trunk --								DISSOLVE TO:EXT. MILITARY SCHOOL - DAY (FLASHBACK)Impeccable grounds, impeccable buildings -- except for one,the corner of which has been reduced to rubble by an explosion, if the burnmarks are any indication. Thomas Perkins, hands clasped behind his back, rolls forwardand backward on the balls of his feet, studying the rubble.Emily (young) stands beside him, dressed "academy," suitcaseby her feet, and grins, proud. PERKINSYou're lucky no one was in there.Emily's offended.YOUNG EMILYThat wasn't luck. I called.PERKINSVoice I.D.Emily grimaces chagrin.YOUNG EMILYThat won't happen again.Thomas lifts her suitcase and strides across impeccablelawn, towards a faraway and expensive automobile with tinted windows.PERKINSYou won't call?

He opens the passenger door for her.She pulls out a cigarette and lights up.YOUNG EMILYI don't need a future. I'm rich.Thomas plucks the cigarette from her mouth, grinds it underhis heel, and extends his open palm, waiting.She glares, sighs, and hands over the pack.INT. PERKINS' DISCREET AUTOMOBILE - DAY (FLASHBACK CONT'D)Thomas drives. Young Emily broods in injured silence.YOUNG EMILYHe could have come. Probably playing with thosedamn trees.PERKINSMaybe he doesn't appreciate paying for a new wing.Injured silence.PERKINS (CONT'D)You know what this means.YOUNG EMILYUh oh.PERKINSBack to Catholic school.YOUNG EMILYNuns? Again?PERKINSIt's going to take a while for me to get you inanywhere else.YOUNG EMILYNuns are the worst.PERKINSLook in the glove box.Emily brightens and digs, coming up with a gift wrappedbox.PERKINS (CONT'D)Happy Birthday, Emily.Emily shoots him a grateful smile, reads the card, grimaces.YOUNG EMILYThank you, Uncle Thomas.PERKINSIt's from your father.YOUNG EMILYIt's a nice lie.

WILL'S WAREHOUSE - EVENINGThe Mercedes' back seat pops loose and Emily, scuffed, crawlsfrom the trunk, over the back seat, into the car's interior. EMILYYou owe me a drink, Thomas.The first thing she reaches for is the Mercedes' cellularphone. The cord is cut.EMILY (CONT'D)Oh, you creep.She pulls her purse from the trunk, rearranges the backseat, and considers a cigarette -- sniffs the air, wrinkles her nose, shakesher head sorrowfully, and puts the cigarette away -- before climbing outof the car to survey her surroundings. No phones.INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - NIGHTWill steers down a dark street he knows by heart -- takesan alley by rote, a short cut, passes a sign: "Portland International Airport"--EXT. PORTLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHTThe Porsche idles, headlights illuminating Will as he shovesaside a fence marked "Airport Personnel Only" --He pulls the car into an abandoned lot off the runway, settlesonto the car's hood with a weary sigh, stress falling away as he staresup at planes taking off for Somewhere Else. And watching his face, you know he wants to be going toSomewhere Else -- has wanted that for all his life -- INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - EVENINGWhoever designed this place was more than security conscious.Bars and locks on what few windows there are, each requiring a key. Emilystrokes the bars in disgust, shoves a finger through to scratch a thin linein the black paint covering the glass surface.EMILY (CONT'D)Shit.There're a couple of doors on the ground floor. First one'sa bathroom. She checks it out. Nothing in there but toilet paper, toilet,sink, and soap. The second door is locked.She pads upstairs to study the door to the living quarters-- also locked. Not with a household doorknob. With a key lock.EMILY (CONT'D)What a control freak.She turns to study the garage door. No buttons for gettingthis baby open -- ceiling and door mechanisms out of reach. Everything lockeddown, barred, keyed, bolted.She pads to a tool bench and rummages in its drawers --the only things not locked down. EXT. PORTLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHTWill's still watching those planes -- but he's calmer, moretogether, and it's time to shake it off. Moving stiffly, he climbs off the hood, walks around toclimb into the porsche's driver's seat.INT. WILL'S PORSCHE (PORTLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT) - NIGHTStarting the engine, shooting one more "Wait for me, I'mcoming back" grimace at those rumbling planes.WILLAnother day. Another life.He pulls out and away.INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT Emily, surrounded by tools, works to disassemble the lockon the living quarters door -- this is one killer lock. The tool slips, stabs into her finger -- adding to a growingassortment of insults to what used to be a perfect manicure -- she popsthe injured digit into her mouth, studies the nicks, cuts, and abrasionswith contempt. A police SIREN flares outside. She brightens, till the siren FADES into the distance.EMILYTo protect and serve. Yeah, right.She rises stiffly, shoves sweaty hair off her forehead,glares angrily at the lock -- which looks intact as hell -- stretches, sighs,and pads to the bathroom.EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHTThe Porsche glides to the warehouse's garage door.INT. WILL'S PORSCHE - NIGHTWill triggers the garage door with the opener that neverleaves his side -- preferably, as high tech a coded mechanism as God puton this green earth, when it comes to garage door openers. The door slidesopen.INT./EXT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/BATHROOM/MAIN WAREHOUSE - NIGHTEmily's on the toilet when the electric garage door HUMS,b.g.EMILYNo!It's hard to hurry these things up, but she's ready to peeher jeans to get out of there -- she reaches automatically to flush thetoilet, jerks her hand back.EMILY (CONT'D)What, am I nuts?Struggling to get her pants put to rights as she stumblesto the door --MAIN WAREHOUSEWill guides the Porsche into the slot beside the Mercedes,swings out of the Porsche, approaching the Mercedes, as the garage doorstarts down, pauses -- He doesn't want to open that damn trunk. He eyes it, apprehensive-- WILLThis is ridiculous.He pops the trunk.It's empty.WILL (CONT'D)Oh shit.He stares around the warehouse -- nothing -- spins to eyethe closing garage door in horror.WILL (CONT'D)No!He smacks the control, halting the door in mid-close, ducksunder it to stare up and down the street of a run down warehouse district.Emily slips from the bathroom, working her way stealthilyalong the wall towards the open door.WILL (CONT'D)God damn it!An OLD WOMAN stops picking through a dumpster to glare defiantlyat him. He rakes a hand through his hair --Emily's almost to the open door --Will turns, ducking back inside -- looking both ways --Emily, busted, lunges for the opening --He lunges to cut her off -- It's a flying, freewheeling tackle -- they hit the concretefloor -- inside -- and hard. POV Outside the door, the old woman gawks.WILL and emilyWill's fighting to hold Emily down as he clicks the garagedoor opener -- the door starts going up -- WILLDamn it!Clicking again -- going down --Fighting -- it's not a sure thing who's winning here --she kicks the door's bottom edge -- going up --He's cursing, hitting buttons -- going down --She's kicking -- there's a lot of defense training in thosekicks -- which is unfortunate for Will's jaw -- going for the door againwith that foot --He heaves, dragging them both backwards across concrete,out of reach -- and the door slams closed.Silence.Will rolls onto his toes, breathing heavy, waiting for thenext attack.Emily stares at the closed door in disgust, rubs her concreteburned elbow.WILLIf you were smart, you would have pulled that stuntwhen I pulled in.EMILYI am smart. I had to pee.Not what he was expecting -- and he almost laughs, stopswhen he touches his injured chin. Wincing -- that elbow hurts -- she studies him. EMILY (CONT'D)This place is harder to get out of than a convent.WILLHow'd you get out of the trunk?She surveys the Mercedes, the warehouse, him.EMILYYou're not a kidnapper. You're a thief.Will snorts.WILLAnd the handcuffs.EMILYHah. You were after the car.WILLLady, you're giving me a headache. Who are you?She smiles, all winsome charm.EMILYTell you what. Give me the car keys, let me outof here, and this'll be our little secret? Deal?INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)Emily sits on the commode, handcuffed again, this time tothe sink. She's wearing pants this time, too, but that doesn't appear tocheer her up. Will, flaunting a new and improved jaw injury, smiles grimlyand pockets the handcuff key.EMILYYou scum sucking, arrogant, peg-headed, sadistic--Will touches his jaw gingerly.WILLI liked you better in the trunk.EMILYI hope you go bald.A doorbell CHIMES above in the living quarters.WILLOh, hell.He shuts the bathroom door -- on a few stifled yells --and punches an intercom button on the wall.WILLYeah?JOE (V.O.)Will?WILLJoe?JOE (V.O.)Yep.Will winces.WILLWhat are you doing here, Joe?JOE (V.O.)Plates ring a bell? Maybe tags? Maybe you were supposedto be at my place five hours ago?WILLOh. Great. (he doesn't sound great)Hang on -- I'll be right up.EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHTThe old woman from the dumpster stalks, stiff backed, toa parked police cruiser and raps on the window. A startled PATROLMAN rollsit down.

I'm on special assignment.OLD WOMANExcuse me, while I pull out my portable phone.PATROLMANYou want a ride downtown, Sister?OLD WOMANThere is a man beating his wife down the street.The patrolman winces.

Over.A pause.RADIO (V.O.)Sit tight, 223. I'll see what I can do.INT. WILL'S WAREHOUSE/APARTMENT - NIGHT(Uncle) JOE POGUE is a pretty good indication of what Will'sgoing to grow up to be, if Will doesn't get on one of those planes prettyquick. Not that Joe's a bad guy -- he isn't -- but he's got a habit, namelya bottle, and a tired stoop to his shoulders that says bad news has perchedon his doorstep one too many times.Will opens the door, ready to say something appropriate,like maybe this is a bad time -- but doesn't get the chance.JOEJesus, Mary, and Joseph. Where have you been?Joe barges right in, waving a crinkled up brown paper shoppingbag under Will's nose -- about the size and shape of license plates.WILLOh god, I forgot.JOEYou forgot? You forgot? I thought you were in jail.Stalking to the refrigerator.JOE (CONT'D)He forgot. You got anything to drink around here?The question's moot, as Joe's got his beer and is headedfor the door to downstairs.JOE (CONT'D)Did you get her?Will panics for a quick second.WILLHer?JOEThe car?
