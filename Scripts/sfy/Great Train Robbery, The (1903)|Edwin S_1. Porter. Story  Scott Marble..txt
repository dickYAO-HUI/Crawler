1 INTERIOR OF RAILROAD TELEGRAPH OFFICE.

Two masked robbers enter and compel the operator to get the 
"signal block" to stop the approaching train, and make him 
write a fictitious order to the engineer to take water at 
this station, instead of "Red Lodge," the regular watering 
stop. The train comes to a standstill (seen through window 
of office); the conductor comes to the window, and the 
frightened operator delivers the order while the bandits 
crouch out of sight, at the same time keeping him covered 
with their revolvers. As soon as the conductor leaves, they 
fall upon the operator, bind and gag him, and hastily depart 
to catch the moving train.

2 RAILROAD WATER TOWER.

The bandits are hiding behind the tank as the train, under 
the false order, stops to take water. Just before she pulls 
out they stealthily board the train between the express car 
and the tender.

3 INTERIOR OF EXPRESS CAR.

Messenger is busily engaged. An unusual sound alarms him. He 
goes to the door, peeps through the keyhole and discovers 
two men trying to break in. He starts back bewildered, but, 
quickly recovering, he hastily locks the strong box containing 
the valuables and throws the key through the open side door. 
Drawing his revolver, he crouches behind a desk. In the 
meantime, the two robbers have succeeded in breaking in the 
door and enter cautiously. The messenger opens fire, and a 
desperate pistol duel takes place in which the messenger is 
killed. One of the robbers stands watch while the other tries 
to open the treasure box. Finding it locked, he vainly 
searches the messenger for the key, and blows the safe open 
with dynamite. Securing the valuables and mail bags they 
leave the car.

4 THE TENDER AND INTERIOR OF THE LOCOMOTIVE CAB

This thrilling scene shows THE TENDER AND INTERIOR OF THE 
LOCOMOTIVE CAB, while the the train is running forty miles 
an hour. While two of the bandits have been robbing the mail 
car, two others climb over the tender. One of them holds up 
the engineer while the other covers the fireman, who seizes 
a coal shovel and climbs up on the tender, where a desperate 
fight takes place. They struggle fiercely all over the tank 
and narrowly escape being hurled over the side of the tender. 
Finally they fall, with the robber on top. He seizes a lump 
of coal, and strikes the fireman on the head until he becomes 
senseless. He then hurls the body from the swiftly moving 
train. The bandits then compel the engineer to bring the 
train to a stop.

5 SHOWS THE TRAIN COMING TO A STOP

Shows THE TRAIN coming to a stop. The engineer leaves the 
locomotive, uncouples it from the train, and pulls ahead 
about 100 feet while the robbers hold their pistols to his 
face.

6 EXTERIOR SCENE SHOWING TRAIN.

The bandits compel the passengers to leave the coaches, "hands 
up," and line up along the tracks. One of the robbers covers 
them with a revolver in each hand, while the others relieve 
the passengers of their valuables. A passenger attempts to 
escape, and is instantly shot down. Securing everything of 
value, the band terrorize the passengers by firing their 
revolvers in the air, while they make their escape to the 
locomotive.

7 LOCOMOTIVE.

The desperadoes board the locomotive with this booty, compel 
the engineer to start, and disappear in the distance.

8 

The robbers bring the engine to a stop several miles from 
the scene of the "hold up," and take to the mountains. 

9 VALLEY

A beautiful scene in A VALLEY. The bandits come down the 
side of a hill, across a narrow stream, mounting their horses, 
and make for the wilderness. 

10 INTERIOR OF TELEGRAPH OFFICE.

The operator lies bound and gagged on the floor. After 
struggling to his feet, he leans on the table, and telegraphs 
for assistance by manipulating the key with his chin, and 
then faints from exhaustion. His little daughter enters with 
his dinner pail. She cuts the rope, throws a glass of water 
in his face, restores him to consciousness, and, recalling 
his thrilling experience, he rushes out to give the alarm.

11 INTERIOR OF A TYPICAL WESTERN DANCE HALL.

Shows a number of men and women in a lively quadrille. A 
"tenderfoot" is quickly spotted and pushed to the center of 
the hall, and compelled to do a jig, while bystanders amuse 
themselves by shooting dangerously close to his feet. Suddenly 
the door opens and the half-dead telegraph operator staggers 
in. The dance breaks up in confusion. The men secure their 
rifles and hastily leave the room.

12 RUGGED HILL

Shows the mounted robbers dashing down A RUGGED HILL at a 
terrific pace, followed closely by a large posse, both parties 
firing as they ride. One of the desperadoes is shot and 
plunges headlong from his horse. Staggering to his feet, he 
fires at the nearest pursuer, only to be shot dead a moment 
later.

13 

The three remaining bandits, thinking they have eluded the 
pursuers, have dismounted from their horses, and after 
carefully surveying their surroundings, they start to examine 
the contents of the mail pouches. They are so grossly engaged 
in their work that they do not realize the approaching danger 
until too late. The pursuers, having left their horses, steal 
noiselessly down upon them until they are completely 
surrounded. A desperate battle then takes place, and after a 
brave stand all the robbers and some of the posse bite the 
dust.

14 BARNES

A life-size [close-up] picture of Barnes, leader of the outlaw 
band, taking aim and firing point-blank at the audience. The 
resulting excitement is great. This scene can be used to 
begin or end the picture.
