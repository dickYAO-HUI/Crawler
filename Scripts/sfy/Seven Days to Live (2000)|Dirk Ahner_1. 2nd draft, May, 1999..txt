FADE IN

1.	OUTSIDE COUNTRY HOUSE - EXT. / NIGHT

An ancient house, standing lonely in the middle of a deserted 
landscape in Northern Germany; lying there like a sleeping 
giant under the starry sky.

But something seems strange: All of the windows and doors have 
been nailed shut.

Text chart: "1976"

The headlights of a car pierce the darkness.  A car halts in 
the yard.  Three MEN step out.  One of them is wearing a police 
uniform.  The men switch on their flashlights and look around. 

			MAN #1
	How long has the house already been 
	like this?

KARL LINDNER, a keen police officer in his late thirties, 
approaches the entrance door.  He speaks in a calm, hoarse 
voice.

			LINDNER
	No idea. I haven't seen them in 
	weeks. 

Lindner makes himself a picture of the situation.
He rings the doorbell.  Nothing stirs inside the house.  Then, 
he tries to get a look inside through one of the nailed-shut 
windows.
Through the cracks, he can barely make out a faint pulsating 
light.

			LINDNER
	I haven't seen them in weeks.

The three men exchange looks.  

With a heavy heart, Lindner makes his decision:

			LINDNER
	We're going in.

The third man fetches a crowbar and prepares to open the door 
with it.

2.	ENTRANCE AREA / COUNTRY HOUSE - INT. / NIGHT

The house door breaks open with a loud crack.

On the floor below the mail slot, there are piles of mail and 
unread newspapers which the door pushes out of the way as it 
opens.

The three men cautiously enter.  They look around.  The hallway 
is as dark as night.  Lindner tries the light switch - nothing.  
The only light comes from a TV-set running in the living room.

3.	LIVING ROOM - INT. / NIGHT

The three of them enter the living room.  Disgusted, the first 
man holds a handkerchief to his mouth.

			MAN #1
	Pooh, what a stench...

There is a massive armchair in the center of the room, in front 
of the television. - There seems to be someone sitting in it.  
In the darkness we cannot recognize who it is.

Lindner carefully steps closer.

The second man stops in front of a large, dark stain on the 
wall.  He touches it, draws back his hand and inspects it  - 
blood.

Lindner slowly walks around the armchair.

			LINDNER
	My God... Marlene...!

During the next flicker of light from the television, we 
recognize the corpse of a woman around forty years of age.

Suddenly, Lindner hears something behind him - breathing!

He turns around.

Indeed, hidden in the semi-darkness, there is the shadow of a 
figure squatting on the floor.

			LINDNER
	Frank... Hell, what happened in 
	here?

Lindner carefully approaches the figure.

It is a man, FRANK KOSINSKI.  He looks scrawny, all skin and 
bones, with a pale and hollow face.
He doesn't pay the least attention to Lindner.  Mesmerized, he 
just stares at the dead woman in the armchair.

The "first man" follows the direction the man is looking in 
and takes a careful look at the dead woman.  Something seems to 
be irritating him.

			MAN #1
	Now that's really odd.

			MAN #2
	What?  What is it?

			MAN #1
	I'd say she drowned...

Lindner leans over to the lethargic man in the shadows.

			LINDNER
	Frank...!?

He gently touches his shoulder.  At the same moment, Kosinski 
seems to snap out of it.

He begins to scream in wild panic - loud, heartrending!

4.	TITLE SEQUENCE

A photo montage of corpses, preserved in the swamps over 
hundreds and thousands of years: children, old people, 
warriors, farmers with hair stained red from the humin acid, 
bony extremities and shriveled faces with skin that resembles 
an ancient landscape ...

... FADE TO:

5.	LANDSCAPE OF SWAMPS IN NORTHERN GERMANY - EXT. / DAY

The structures of the corpses' skin fade into pictures of a 
vast landscape of heaths, forests and moors.

An expensive offroad vehicle is leading a sports car along a 
deserted country road.  It's a wonderful late-summer's day.  
The two cars take a bend...

6.	OUTSIDE COUNTRY HOUSE - EXT. / DAY

... into the driveway of the same old house.  It lies 
peacefully in the afternoon sun.  The gravel crunches 
underneath the tires.
A large moving truck is already parked outside.

Title chart: "23 years later"

7.	OFFROAD VEHICLE - INT. / DAY

Driving the Jeep is ELLEN STRAUB, an attractive, self-assured 
woman of approx. 30 years.
Asleep on the passenger's seat beside her is her husband 
MARTIN, who in no way resembles the clich√© of the successful 
author - he has a rather boyish charisma and is a bit too 
attractive.

Ellen stops the car and takes out some house keys.  She holds 
them right up to her sleeping husband's ear.  Then, she shakes 
them.  They tinkle.

			ELLEN
		(playful)
	Sir, we have arrived at your 
	residence.

Martin blinks and takes the keys.

			MARTIN
	Thank you, James.

The two of them step out of the car.

8.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT. / DAY

Also getting out of their sports car are PAUL - a dynamic 
looking man in his mid-forties - and his wife CLAUDIA.  Despite 
their careful choice of casual dress, they still look like the 
epitome of snobbish city people.

They take a look around.  Time has left it's marks on the old 
house:  Like an enchanted castle, it is camouflaged in waist-
high grass and wildly ranking shrubs.
Paul and Claudia exchange skeptic looks.

			PAUL
	Well, look here!

			MARTIN
	Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub 
	country-residence".

			CLAUDIA
	It looks more like the "Straub 
	ruins".

			PAUL
	Welcome to the far end of the 
	world.

Ellen contradicts.

			ELLEN
	The lap of nature.  Where's your 
	famous optimism?

Two REMOVAL MEN climb out of the truck.  One of them is still 
chewing on his lunch.
He points at his watch as he addresses Martin.

			REMOVAL MAN
	Lunch break is 'til one o'clock.

			MARTIN
		(sarcastic)
	Sure, take your time.
		(to Ellen)
	They get a lunch break before they 
	even start working.  
	Cool job.

Laughing, the four of them enter the house.

9.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / DAY

They step into the entrance area.  The golden sunlight shines 
in stripes through the shutters.  The house is old, monumental.  
One senses the centuries. 
A staircase leads upstairs, the rooms on the first floor are 
the kitchen and living room.  A heavy wooden door opens to the 
cellar stairs.

			MARTIN
	The country residence offers 
	everything the doctor ordered for a 
	stressed author needs: fresh air, 
	clean water and - most of all - 
	absolute peace and quiet.

Paul walks upstairs.  The staircase creaks.

			PAUL
	This wood is pretty decayed.  Hope 
	I don't land a floor lower.

			ELLEN
	Although it would give you a 
	perfect opportunity to visit our 
	new wine cellar.

			CLAUDIA
	How old is this shack, anyway?

			ELLEN
	Four hundred years.  Come on, I'll 
	give you a tour of the museum...
		(blinking an eye at Martin and 
	Paul)
	...while our husbands already get 
	to work.

CUT TO:

10.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT. / DAY

Martin and Paul are lugging a heavy desk out of the truck.  As 
opposed to the two removal men, they are really working hard.

			PAUL
	Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do 
	you want to have it?

			MARTIN
	Tenth floor.

			PAUL
	Very funny.

CUT TO:

11.	STUDY - INT. / DAY

Sweating, Martin and Paul are trying to push the desk through 
the narrow door to the study.  They are doing a pretty awkward 
job of it.
Martin's hand brushes the door frame - a splinter.

			MARTIN
	Shit!

Martin draws back his hand.  He's hurt.

			PAUL
	What's the matter?

Martin presses a handkerchief on the wound and has a closer 
look at the door frame.
It is totally splintered, as if someone had forcefully broken 
the door open!

			MARTIN
	Look at this.  The lock is totally 
	demolished.

			PAUL
	I guess someone lost their key.  
	You did get your tetanus shots, I 
	hope?

Martin is still looking at the broken lock.

			MARTIN
	I mean, seriously: It is strange, 
	isn't it?

Paul puts it off.  Only now does he have a better look around 
the room.

			PAUL
	So what if it is.  There hasn't 
	been anyone in this house for at 
	least ten years.

The study is covered with dust, the walls are stained and full 
of cobwebs - blind, high arched windows.  Single pieces of 
furniture that the previous owner left behind in this spacious 
room.

			MARTIN
	Twenty-three, to be exact.

			PAUL
	I wonder how you guys figure on 
	renovating this whole place.  You 
	can afford to spend some money.  If 
	I was you, I'd spare myself all the 
	hard work.  Besides, didn't you 
	want to start writing again?

Martin suddenly seems lost in thought.

			MARTIN
	Yeah sure, I will. Give me a little 
	more time.

Paul gives him a downcast look.

			PAUL
	If you throw away your career, that 
	won't change anything either.  Now 
	don't get me wrong, but I'm telling 
	you this as your friend:  Your last 
	books were awful.  The publishing 
	house isn't even sure whether to 
	extend your contract.

Martin takes the handkerchief from his wound and looks at it.

			MARTIN
	I don't care about my career right 
	now, Paul.  Ellen and I need to get 
	our minds on other things, first.  
	After everything we've been 
	through.

12.	KITCHEN - INT. / DAY

Ellen is dragging a moving carton full of dishes into the 
kitchen.  It seems to be very heavy.  Claudia hooks up a radio 
and switches it on.  We hear a cheerful oldie (Life could be a 
Dream).  
The song seems to bring back memories to Ellen:  She stares at 
the radio.

(Transformation from radio to:)

13.	DINING ROOM OF CITY APARTMENT - INT. / DAY

Flashback:
Ellen, Martin and their son THOMAS (8 years old) are joined at 
the breakfast table.  The radio is on - it's playing the same 
tune.
The little boy is totally absorbed with his Game-boy.

Martin sets a bowl of cornflakes and fresh fruit on the table.

			MARTIN
	Here, partner:  A breakfast for 
	champions.

The little boy rolls his eyes and turns back to his Game-boy.

			THOMAS
	I can't right now!  I'm about to 
	break the high-score!

Ellen gets into the discussion.

			ELLEN
	You do that.  But first, eat your 
	breakfast, Tommi.

Now, Thomas reacts.  He puts the Game-boy on the table.  
He continues the game with one hand, while he obediently 
shovels the breakfast cereal into his mouth with the other.

			MARTIN
	Goes to show again who's in command 
	around here.

Martin gives Ellen a playful pat on the behind and kisses her.

			ELLEN
		(joking)
	Sometimes I get the feeling you 
	only love me for my body.

Martin grins.

			MARTIN
	Why else?

			ELLEN
	Come on, say it.  You know...

Martin seems to know exactly what Ellen wants to hear.

			MARTIN
	Oh no, not again.  I just said it 
	for you last week.

For a moment, the two of them stop paying attention to their 
son.  Suddenly, Thomas grabs his throat.  He swallowed wrong.  
He chokes without making a sound.

			ELLEN
	Say it anyway.  Come on, how much 
	do you love me?

			MARTIN
		(quotes)
	"With you, my life began 
	and with you shall it end..."

Ellen gives him her most beautiful smile.  Martin responds with 
a short kiss.  
At the same time, they hear the Game-boy fall to the floor.  It 
immediately draws their attention to Thomas.

The little boy is desperately gasping for air.  His face is 
already starting to turn blue.

Martin runs to him.

			MARTIN
	Tommi, what's the matter?

He pats Thomas on the back, attempting to clear his throat.

			ELLEN
	What is it?  What's wrong with him?

Thomas coughs, choking, but he can't get his throat clear.  
Martin recognizes the situation.

			MARTIN
		(yells)
	This is serious!  Quick, call 
	emergency!

Ellen hurries to the phone.

Martin realizes that hitting Thomas' back is not doing any 
good.  He uses his finger to try to get the swallowed piece out 
of his son's throat.
For Thomas, it is a battle against death.

Ellen has gotten through to the emergency line.  She speaks 
into the phone with distress.

			ELLEN
	This is Straub.  You have to come, 
	fast!  My son, he swallowed 
	something... Quick, he's choking to 
	death...

Martin's attempts at helping his son remain futile.  Thomas is 
beginning to lose conscience.
Martin sweeps the table free of dishes in a single move and 
lays the little boy down flat.  He reaches for a sharp fruit 
knife.

Ellen comes running.

			ELLEN
	What are you doing?

Martin holds the tip of the knife to the boy's throat.  It's 
not easy, since his son is wildly kicking around himself.

			MARTIN
	I have to cut his windpipe...

			ELLEN
		(horrified)
	You're not a doctor, you'll hurt 
	him!

			MARTIN
		(screams)
	What else should I do, damn it, 
	he's dying!

Again, Martin prepares to cut - he holds the knife to the 
larynx.  The boy's movements grow weaker.

			ELLEN
	Too high, you're way too far up... 
	you have to cut here...

She points at the spot below the larynx while holding her 
little son tight.

			MARTIN
	Ellen, move aside...

			ELLEN
	Oh God, Tommi...

Martin prepares to cut, but he can't - his trembling hand 
refuses to move.  Endless seconds pass.  The voices blur, like 
in a dream.  The music playing on the radio seems to become 
louder and louder (Life could be a Dream).

			ELLEN
	What's the matter?  Come on, cut...

Martin looks up at his wife.  He can't do it.

			CLAUDIA (O.S.)
	Ellen!

14.	KITCHEN - INT. / DAY

Ellen starts. 

			CLAUDIA
	Ellen, are you alright?

Claudia has already started unpacking the carton.

Ellen quickly switches the radio off.  She tries to act as if 
nothing happened.

			ELLEN
	I'm fine.  I was just distracted 
	for a moment.

Claudia notices how upset her friend is and wants to put her 
arm around Ellen's shoulder.  
But just then, the removal men push their way past them with a 
cupboard.

Claudia drops the issue with a look of sympathy.

CUT TO:

15.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT. / DUSK

The old house is resting peacefully in the sunset.  The last 
rays of sunlight paint the horizon orange.  Warm light shines 
out through the windows of the house.

16.	KITCHEN - INT. / NIGHT

The four friends are joined at the dinner table,  surrounded by 
packing cartons.  Their shadows are silhouetted outside the 
large window.  Behind them lie the vast, lonely moors.

Martin opens himself a beer, raises it for a toast.

			MARTIN
	To our hard-working wives.

			CLAUDIA
	Don't rejoice too soon.  The bill 
	is already on it's way.

They toast with their bottles.  Ellen takes herself a 
cigarette.  Martin notices it with disapproval.

			CLAUDIA
	I still can't picture it: The two 
	of you as country folk.  I'm 
	telling you, in six weeks you'll be 
	back in the city.

			PAUL
	Hold it right there!  I hate to 
	play the big boss, but as Martin's 
	publisher I can only say:  Make the 
	best of the peace and quiet, the 
	fresh air and all that - and write 
	a new masterpiece!

Ellen gives Martin a skeptical look - the moment of silence is 
almost too long.

			MARTIN
	First things first.  Now it's our 
	turn - just the two of us.

Martin's hand wanders over to Ellen's.  She reacts a bit 
hesitantly at first, but then they hold each other tight.

CUT TO:

17.	BATHROOM - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen is taking a shower, washing off the dirt from a hard 
day's work.
The bathroom fills with steam.

Ellen turns off the water faucet and steps out of the shower 
cabin.  She reaches for a towel and wraps it around herself.

Something catches her eye in the fogged-up mirror.  
There is a number, as if someone had used a finger to write it 
into the moisture: "7".

She wipes the mirror clean and looks at it.

FADE TO:

18.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT. / DAY

The following day:
A warm late-summer's morning.  The house stands lonely in the 
rays of the rising sun.  Occasional dew drops glitter in the 
grass.

19.	BEDROOM - INT. / DAY

Ellen is asleep in her bed, despite the sun shining right in 
her face.

Martin enters the room with a tray loaded with breakfast 
delicacies.  He holds it under Ellen's nose.

			MARTIN
		(acting gallant)
	 "Wake up, wake up, it's break of 
	day."  Paul and Claudia have 
	already left, you sleepyhead.

Ellen hides under her blanket.  Martin sets down the tray.

			MARTIN
	You're right.  Forget about getting 
	up.  We'll have breakfast in bed.

Ellen resurfaces with a grin.  She is still sleepy.
Martin jumps into bed and crawls under the blanket.

			ELLEN
	How romantic!

He playfully burrows around under the blanket, making silly 
grunting sounds.
Ellen giggles.  Suddenly, Martin sticks his head out.

			ELLEN
		(laughing)
	Stop that!

			MARTIN
		(with a grunting voice)
	You'll never get away from me!

He grabs her and pulls her under the blanket.  Ellen screams, 
and laughs.

20.	STUDY - INT. / DAY

Martin is working at his computer.  Everything is still set up 
a bit provisionally.  Only Martin's novels have already been 
sorted into a shelf, with 10 copies of "Cherry-red Tears" in 
front.

He is trying to write, but by the look on his face and his 
hesitant typing, we can tell that it's obviously not going so 
well.

Ellen carefully approaches him from behind, hugs him and gives 
him a kiss on the cheek.

			ELLEN
	So, how does it feel to be kissed 
	by two women?

			MARTIN
	They say it's fantastic.  At least 
	that's what I read in a men's 
	magazine.  So who are the two lucky 
	ones?

			ELLEN
	Me and the muse, of course.  How is 
	your book coming along?

He grins and takes her in his arms.

			MARTIN
	Oh, the muse... we're still having 
	our differences.  You know how it 
	is with women.

			ELLEN
	Well then, I guess I'd better leave 
	the two of you alone.  But don't 
	forget...

Martin finishes her thought.

			MARTIN
	... we wanted to take some time out 
	for ourselves.  I know.  And I'll 
	only work a little while, I 
	promise.

Just as Ellen prepares to leave, she catches sight of an old 
photograph lying on top of one of the cartons.  She picks it up 
and takes the dust off of it.

Under the dust, she finds an old black and white picture of a 
couple with very earnest looks.  The retouched, pitch-black 
eyes give the photo a somewhat eerie touch.

All of a sudden, unexpectedly, the man on the photo turns his 
head.
His dead eyes look straight at Ellen!

Startled, she drops the picture to the floor.

Martin spins around.

			MARTIN
	What's the matter?

Ellen hesitantly picks up the picture and looks at it again.  
It was only her imagination.  It is a normal, old black and 
white photo.

			ELLEN
		(irritated)
	Oh, nothing.  Where did this 
	picture come from?

Martin turns back to his work.

			MARTIN
	I found it here.  It's kind of 
	creepy, don't you think?

Ellen makes a face.

			ELLEN
	Yeah.  It is, kind of.

She puts the picture back and leaves.

21.	LIVING ROOM - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen comes out of the kitchen and walks into the dark living 
room.  She is carrying some sandwiches on a tray.

The room is only lit by the flickering of the television set.  
A spooky atmosphere.

In front of the TV is a large, old armchair (the same one from 
the opening sequence!).  Ellen frowns.  She slowly walks closer 
to it.

			ELLEN
	Martin?

Suddenly, Martin's voice comes from behind the armchair.

			MARTIN
	Damn!

Martin pounds his flat hand against the television.  The screen 
shows no image, only snow.

Ellen sets down the tray.

			ELLEN
	What kind of a horrible thing is 
	that?

			MARTIN
	It still worked in town.

			ELLEN
	I mean the armchair!

			MARTIN
	Oh, that was upstairs.  A real 
	antiquity!  I think it's great.

Ellen instinctively feels appalled by the old piece of 
furniture.

			ELLEN
	I don't know.

Martin is still fighting with the TV-set, trying to find a 
channel.

			ELLEN
	Maybe the antenna's broken.

			MARTIN
	We're probably lucky that we even 
	have running water and electricity!  
	Damned box!

He hits the TV with his fist.

Suddenly, everything is dark!

			ELLEN
	Hey... the fuse.

			MARTIN
	Oh, damnit!

He looks for a flashlight and switches it on.

			ELLEN
	Do you know where fuse box is?

			MARTIN
	In the cellar, I think.  
	Wait, I'll take care of it.

He leaves the room.

22.	CELLAR - INT. / NIGHT

Martin opens the fuse box and shines inside with his 
flashlight:  A moldy mess of half-corroded wires leading into 
various ancient switches.  The entire construction makes a 
dangerous impression.

			MARTIN
		(talking to himself)
	God, look at that...

The cellar seems even older than the house.  It is a large, 
cold sandstone catacomb.  Several pillars support the ceiling.  
The walls are clammy and cold.

Martin is standing in the darkness.  Something approaches him 
from behind - slowly, threateningly.

Martin is looking for the blown fuse.

The thing comes closer.  Finally, it grabs him.

			ELLEN
	Boo!

Martin spins around, startled.

			MARTIN
	Jesus Christ!

Ellen laughs.

			ELLEN
	I wanted to know what's taking you 
	so long.  You've been down here 
	forever.  
		(looks around, shivering)
	It sure is cold down here.  We 
	certainly won't be needing a 
	freezer.

She catches sight of an old shelf loaded with all kinds of 
strange old junk.  The shelf looks old and rickety.  Ellen 
shakes at it, testing its stability.

			ELLEN
	We'll sure be sorting a bunch of 
	this stuff out.

Martin points to the fuse box.

			MARTIN
	Look at this!  We'll have to fix 
	the whole wiring.  This stuff is 
	dangerous as hell.

			ELLEN
	We'll call for someone from town 
	first thing in the morning.

			MARTIN
	Are you crazy?  That costs a 
	fortune!

			ELLEN
	Do you have a better idea?

			MARTIN
	I'll do it myself.

			ELLEN
	You?

			MARTIN
	My father was an electrician.  
	Already forgot that?

			ELLEN
	My father was a pilot.  And do I 
	know how to fly?

There's a lot more Ellen would like to say about this, but she 
contends herself with a meaningful look.

			ELLEN
	Just do me a favor and don't get 
	yourself roasted!

Martin fumbles with one of the bigger switches, finally flips 
it to the other side.  Click!  The catacomb is lit: A lonely 
40-Watt lamp dangling from the ceiling casts a dim light.
Martin gives Ellen a triumphant smile.

CUT TO:

23.	OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE DOOR - EXT. / NIGHT

Ellen is leaning against the door frame, dreamily gazing into 
the night.  She is smoking a joint.

Martin steps up from behind and takes the hand-rolled 
"cigarette" out of her hand with a swift move.  He tosses it 
away.

			MARTIN
	Hey, flower child, the sixties are 
	over.  And this stuff is hazardous 
	to your health.

			ELLEN
	Yes, daddy.

She gives him a hasty kiss and walks to the car.

			MARTIN
	Where are you going?

			ELLEN
	Well, if you won't let me smoke 
	grass, then at least I'll go get 
	myself some cigarettes. 

Ellen gets in the car and takes off.

Martin contemplatively watches her go.

			MARTIN
	That stuff is gonna end up killing 
	you.

CUT TO:

24.	COUNTRY ROAD / INSIDE CAR - EXT. / NIGHT

Ellen is behind the steering wheel.  She lights up a cigarette 
as she drives down a lonely road.  There is a small bridge in 
the distance.

Ellen slows down.  She glances at a road sign.

Suddenly, her eyes widen.  She takes a second look.

The road sign clearly reads: 

"You have 6 days to live"

The shock hits her like a fist.
It takes her a moment to react.  Then, she slams her foot on 
the brake pedal.

The car halts with screeching tires.  Ellen shifts into reverse 
gear and drives back.  She stops by the sign.

She reads: "Max. 6 t. Agricultural vehicles pass" - a 
perfectly normal sign.
Ellen is confused.  How creepy.  She continues on her way, 
feeling a bit sick to the stomach.

25.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT. / NIGHT

Ellen parks in front of the house and steps out of the car.  
She looks worn-out.

Martin has piled up all of the old furniture from the house.  
Ellen walks over to him.

			ELLEN
	What are you doing?

			MARTIN
	Making our very own solstice fire.

A match lights up.  The stacked furniture quickly catches fire.

Only now does Martin notice the state his wife is in.

			MARTIN
	Is everything alright?  Aren't you 
	feeling well?

			ELLEN
	I just had a really strange 
	experience.

Martin gives her a questioning look.

			ELLEN
	On an ordinary traffic sign, I 
	read...

Ellen interrupts her sentence.  She's just too embarrassed to 
say it.

			ELLEN
	Oh, nothing.  I guess I just still 
	haven't recovered as well as I try 
	to make everyone believe.

Martin puts his arm around her and holds her close.

			ELLEN
	Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth 
	about it.

			MARTIN
	Hey, take your time.  You know time 
	heals better than any shrink ever 
	can.

Arm in arm, Ellen and Martin stand by the burning pile of 
furniture, staring into the fire.

			ELLEN
	I have a funny feeling.  Do you 
	think we'll get over all that's 
	happened?

			MARTIN
	We just have to make a new 
	beginning.

			ELLEN
	Cherry-red Tears.

			MARTIN
	What?

			ELLEN
	Cherry-red Tears, your first book.  
	I read it at least nine times.  And 
	then I found out you were going to 
	attend some kind of book fair.

			MARTIN
	Not a book fair.  I was signing 
	autographs in a department store.

			ELLEN
	I was so excited about meeting you.  
	Again and again, I kept getting in 
	the back of the line so I could be 
	the last to talk to you.

			MARTIN
	And two months later, we got 
	married.  And all because of one 
	sentence:
		(quotes)
	"With you, my life began 
	and with you shall it end..."

This sentence strikes a chord within Ellen.  It hardens her 
heart.

			ELLEN
	Don't say that.  Please.

A short moment of silence.  Ellen's eyes well up with tears.

			ELLEN
	I miss Tommi so much.

			MARTIN
	So do I, believe me.

			ELLEN
	Do you really think anything can 
	ever be like it was before?

			MARTIN
	Maybe different.  I don't know, 
	Ellen.

			ELLEN
	If we stand a chance at all, it's 
	only by sticking together.

Martin gives her a tender kiss.  The fire casts a warming shine 
on the two of them and the old house - in the loneliness of the 
moors.

CUT TO:

26.	KITCHEN - INT. / DAY

Ellen is wearing a paint-stained flannel shirt. She is busy 
painting the kitchen walls.
The RADIO is playing in the background.

			RADIOBROADCASTER
	"... a very special day today.  
	Exceptionally hot, even for this 
	time of year.  And all the windows 
	in my studio are already wide 
	open..."

Ellen isn't paying much attention to the radio.  Suddenly, the 
tone of the radiobroadcaster's voice gets a more penetrating 
touch.

			RADIOBROADCASTER
	By the way, Ellen: 
	You have five days left to live.

Ellen freezes.  She turns pale.

Then suddenly, a noise - someone is knocking on the window.

Ellen spins around and, startled, tips over a bowl.  It smashes 
on the floor.

Standing by the open window is Karl Lindner, a total stranger 
to Ellen.
Obviously, he is much older now.  His face is caved in, his 
hair gray.  However, his pleasant demeanor has stayed the same.

He realizes that he's startled her.

			LINDNER
	Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean to scare 
	you.

For a moment, Ellen is at a loss for words.  She looks back to 
the radio, where the normal program is being continued.

			RADIOBROADCASTER
	"... and matching today's weather 
	it's time for some more of the 
	hottest music of the North..."

Ellen turns the radio off.

			ELLEN
	Hello.  Can I help you?

			LINDNER
	Does this dog here belong to you?

Sitting next to him is a large mixed-breed with friendly eyes.

			ELLEN
	No, I've never seen him before.

			LINDNER
	You know, I saw him sitting outside 
	your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm 
	forgetting my manners again!  I 
	haven't even introduced myself yet.  
	Hi, my name's Lindner. 
	Karl Lindner.

He offers her his hand through the window.

			ELLEN
	Ellen Straub.

			LINDNER
	It's a pleasure.  You're from the 
	city, right?

			ELLEN
	Do I look like it that much?

			LINDNER
	Village gossip.  You're a real 
	attraction here.

Ellen is still shook up by the radio announcement, but 
nevertheless tries to hold up a conversation.

			ELLEN
	You're from around here, aren't 
	you?  There's something I've been 
	wondering about the whole time:  
	This house, why has it been empty 
	all these years?  I mean, I doubt 
	if it was the price.

Lindner suddenly turns evasive and cool.

			LINDNER
	I guess it's too lonely for most 
	folks.
		(glances at his watch)
	It's time for me to get going. It's 
	been a pleasure meeting you.

			ELLEN
	Wait, won't you join me for a cup 
	of coffee?

He turns down the offer, a touch too vehemently.

			LINDNER
	No, thank you.  I need to get back 
	home.  My wife is waiting.

He leaves.  Ellen contemplatively watches him go.

Martin enters the kitchen and puts his arms around her.

			MARTIN
	Who was that?

			ELLEN
	Someone from the village.

She turns around to face him.

			ELLEN
	Martin, there's something I... 
	uh... need to tell you about.

CUT TO:

27.	LIVING ROOM - INT. / DAY

Martin is seated in the old armchair.  Ellen across from him.  
He is grinning.

			MARTIN
	Okay, now let me see if I've got 
	this straight.  First you get 
	warnings from a road sign and then 
	from the weather forecast.  Which 
	one of us two was the author again?

Ellen feels disappointed and misunderstood.

			ELLEN
	Martin, it's not funny!

			MARTIN
	You know, it's not always easy for 
	me, either.  But at least I try not 
	to give in to each and every 
	neurosis.

Now he's got her angry.

			ELLEN
	Well, apparently it was a big 
	mistake to try talking to you. 
	Don't you remember what we promised 
	to each other?  Honesty - trust!

			MARTIN
	Come on, this isn't about honesty.  
	You just need a good night's sleep.  
	The way you toss and turn all 
	night, even I hardly get any sleep.

Ellen realizes there is no use in discussing this any further.

			ELLEN
	Well, excuse me for having bothered 
	you with my problems.

She leaves the living room and walks out on Martin.

28.	HALLWAY - INT. / DAY

Ellen is using a spatula to scratch the old-fashioned, yellowed 
wallpaper off of the walls.  She is still upset, and really 
taking it out on the wallpaper.

Martin comes walking up the steps.  He is carrying a plate full 
of small, deformed cakes.

			MARTIN
	For you.

He holds out the plate to her.  Ellen throws a skeptical look 
at the mishap pastry.  She won't be bribed this easily.

			ELLEN
	Now, what did I do to deserve this?

			MARTIN
	Come on, at least try one.  It took 
	me two hours to make these.

Ellen goes back to scratching off the wallpaper.  Martin 
changes his tactic.

			MARTIN
	What I really meant to say was: I'm 
	sorry.  I'm a real bonehead 
	sometimes.  But it's just that I'm 
	worried about you.  I'm afraid you 
	might get carried away with 
	something like that.

Ellen interrupts her work and takes one of the cakes.  She 
tastes it.

			ELLEN
	Tastes awful.

She grins.  Martin returns a smile.

			MARTIN
	But baked with lots of love.

Martin helps himself to a small cake, too.  He bites off a 
piece, and makes a sour face.  Then, he takes Ellen's piece out 
of her hand.

			MARTIN
	I think I'd better get rid of this.  
	After all, I don't want to kill 
	you.

He turns to leave.

			ELLEN
	Martin...

Martin stops at the bottom of the staircase.

			ELLEN
	...Maybe you're right and I just 
	need to get some sleep.  Don't 
	worry.  I'll get settled in sooner 
	or later.

CUT TO:

29.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT. / NIGHT

The farmhouse lies in the loneliness of a starless night. 
Silhouettes of gnarled trees reach for the sky like black 
claws.

30.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

It's dark.  An eerie silence fills the house.

Suddenly, there is a CHILD'S VOICE calling in the distance.

			CHILD'S VOICE
	Mommy...

31.	BEDROOM - INT. / NIGHT

Martin and Ellen are asleep in their bed.

			CHILD'S VOICE
	Mommy!

Ellen wakes up out of her light slumber.  She opens her eyes 
and looks around, searching.

			ELLEN
	Tommi...?

The voice clearly echoes through the house.  (It sounds like 
Thomas' call before the accident.)

			CHILD'S VOICE
	Mommy...

Ellen silently sits up.  She is wide awake.  She tries to wake 
up Martin.

			ELLEN
		(whispering)
	Martin... did you hear that?

No chance - Martin only mumbles a few unintelligible words and 
continues to sleep.

Ellen gets out of bed.

CUT TO:

32.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

Almost mechanically, the child's calling repeats itself.

			CHILD'S VOICE
	Mommy...

Ellen carefully heads down the stairs, toward the entrance 
door.  The voice seems to be coming from outside.
Ellen opens the door, frightened.

33.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT. / NIGHT

The pale moonlight dips the landscape into a ghostly 
atmosphere.
Ellen's eyes search through the darkness.

There!  There is something in the distance.  A child!  The 
child is standing in the tall grass, looking toward Ellen.

			ELLEN
	Tommi?

She cannot believe her eyes.

It really is her little Thomas!  He smiles.  There is something 
about the way he moves that makes it look as if he's floating.

			ELLEN
		(louder)
	Tommi!

The little boy laughs.  He turns around and runs away in the 
grass; as if in play.

Ellen snaps out of her stiffness and chases after him.

The small figure slowly disappears in the increasingly tall 
grass.

34.	FOREST IN THE MOORS - EXT. / NIGHT

Ellen is running farther and farther away from the house.  She 
stops.

			ELLEN
	Tommi, wait!

But the little boy keeps running further.

Ellen follows him, but her path grows increasingly toilsome.  
Her feet sink deeper and deeper into the moor.

Now, the child is out of sight.

Ellen is devastated.  She trips and falls to the ground.  The 
swamp encloses her.  Ellen fights against the marsh that she is 
sinking into deeper and deeper.

Suddenly, the little boy steps back out of the darkness.  He 
stays a few feet away from Ellen.  He smiles as he watches 
Ellen sink into the deadly swamp.

With a sudden jerk, an unknown force pulls her down into the 
moor.  She is swallowed by the earth.

35.	BEDROOM - INT. / DAY

Ellen abruptly wakes up from her NIGHTMARE!

She looks around herself.  She is in her comfortable bedroom 
flooded with the warm rays of the morning sun.  Martin's side 
of the bed is already empty.

Then, she hesitates.  Something feels wrong.  Ellen throws back 
her sheets.  Horror - her bed is full of mud.

Ellen wants to scream.  She barely manages to suppress it.

CUT TO:

36.	STUDY / HALLWAY - INT. / DAY

Martin is sitting at his computer, busily typing.  He seems to 
be making progress on his book.

In the background, Ellen hurries past the study.  She is 
carrying the dirty sheets under her arm.  Without looking up 
from the monitor, Martin calls through the open door:

			MARTIN
	So, did you sleep good?

37.	KITCHEN - INT. / DAY

			ELLEN
		(calling to Martin)
	Yeah... I have to go to town.

Ellen enters the kitchen.  She hastily stuffs the bed-sheets 
into the washing machine.

			ELLEN
	Is there anything you need?

She turns the washing machine on and heads for the door.

38.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / DAY

Ellen is about to leave the house.  The door is already open.  
In the entrance area, she finds the dog (that Lindner had 
previously discovered in their garden) sitting in front of the 
cellar door.
Ellen pets him in passing.

			ELLEN
		(to the dog)
	Hey, you're still here.  I suppose 
	you like it here with us.

			MARTIN (O.S.)
		(calling from the study)
	No, thanks.  I have everything I 
	need.  Drive safely, you hear?

Ellen is already out the door.  She pulls it shut behind her.

CUT TO:

39.	CONSULTING ROOM OF PROF. ROTH - INT. / DAY

A pleasantly decorated consulting room.  Standing by a window 
is PROF. ULRICH ROTH (Professor of Psychiatry), a distinguished 
man around 50 years of age.

			PROF. ROTH
	You see, there are various 
	approaches to an explanation for 
	what you are currently going 
	through.

Ellen is hunched in a chair opposite of him.

Prof. Roth turns around to face her and takes a seat behind his 
desk.  The leather chair creaks.

			PROF. ROTH
	One of the latest theories claim 
	that at certain frequencies, air 
	conditioners create an oscillation 
	that can, in fact, cause 
	hallucinations.  They may also be 
	due to the interior pressure of 
	your eyes and so on and so forth.  
	Personally I believe that all of 
	this is nonsense.  The loss of a 
	child is a traumatic experience. 
	Subconsciously, you may still be 
	blaming yourself for it, and maybe 
	now believe that your son should 
	punish you...

Ellen impatiently cuts him short.

			ELLEN
	Listen, it's one thing to have a 
	guilt complex. But I know the 
	difference between when I'm 
	overstrung and when I'm seeing 
	things that are simply not there!  
	Besides, it only began after we 
	moved!

			PROF. ROTH
		(hesitantly)
	There is, of course, another 
	possible explanation which I dearly 
	hope is not the case.

Lost in thought, Prof. Roth taps his pen on his desktop.

			ELLEN
	And that is?

			PROF. ROTH
	A tumor - which could cause 
	pressure on certain parts of the 
	brain and, thus, influence your 
	perception.

Ellen stares at him, shocked.

			PROF. ROTH
	Just to be on the safe side, I 
	would like to have a few tests 
	done.

CUT TO:

40.	COMPUTER TOMOGRAPH - INT. / DAY

Ellen is lying on a stretcher, slowly being moved into the 
opening of the computer tomograph.  She is wearing a pale-green 
hospital garment.
The penetrating sound of the machines - technical coldness.

41.	DOCTOR'S OFFICE - INT. / DAY

Blood is filled into a cannula.

Ellen is sitting on a stretcher.  The NURSE pulls the needle 
out of her arm.

DR. SCHLETH, a man who makes a somewhat lethargic impression, 
enters the room and fastens the tomograph shots in front of an 
illuminated surface on the wall.

			DR. SCHLETH
	Congratulations.  You are 
	definitely the healthiest person 
	I've had in CT for years.

Ellen heaves a sigh of relief.

			DR. SCHLETH
	Dr. Roth gave me these for you.  
	Three times a day, after meals.

He hands her a box of tablets.

			ELLEN
	What is this?

			DR. SCHLETH
	Fluctin.  A pretty strong 
	antidepressive... If you asked me, 
	I'd try to do without them first.

He takes a look into her health records.

			DR. SCHLETH
	You come from Goldmoor?

Ellen answers absent-mindedly.

			ELLEN
	We just moved there.

			DR. SCHLETH
		(by-the-way)
	One time, when I was in college, we 
	examined a swamp corpse in 
	pathology.  They had excavated it 
	there.

Now he has Ellen's attention.

			DR. SCHLETH
	Three or four thousand years old.  
	But I didn't deal with the subject 
	any more than necessary.  You know, 
	I never liked pathology.  Somehow, 
	I always felt it reduced humans to 
	something they are not.

Suddenly, Dr. Schleth's beeper goes off.  He takes a quick 
glance at it and turns to leave.

			ELLEN
	Dr. Schleth.

The doctor stops at the door.

			ELLEN
	What do you believe happens to a 
	human after he dies?

The otherwise reserved Dr. Schleth suddenly seems very human.

			DR. SCHLETH
	You mean, do I believe in something 
	like a soul?

He smiles mischievously.

			DR. SCHLETH
	I haven't seen one on any of my x-
	ray pictures, yet.  But then again, 
	what would x-rays know?

He turns around and walks out.  Lost in thought, Ellen watches 
him leave.

42.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT. / NIGHT

Ellen steers the car into the driveway and climbs out.  The dog 
runs to greet her, wagging its tail.  Ellen kneels down in 
front of the dog and pets it.

			ELLEN
	Hey, girl!  Here, I brought you 
	something.

She takes a collar with a little bell on it out of her purse 
and puts it around the dog's neck.

			ELLEN
	Now all we need is a name for you.  
	How about Clara - okay, then: 
	Clara.

She walks to the house door.  The dog follows her inside as if 
it were the most natural thing to do.  The bell jingles.

43.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen enters the hallway.  At the same time, Martin comes 
upstairs from the cellar.

			ELLEN
	Hi, love.  Trouble with the fuses 
	again?

Martin locks the door behind him.

			MARTIN
	It's a real mess.  I think it'd be 
	better for you not to go down there 
	for a while.  It's just too 
	dangerous.

He drops the key for the cellar into his pocket.  Ellen watches 
this with irritation.  Martin's entire behavior seems odd.

Behind Ellen, the dog trots into the corridor.

			MARTIN
	Don't tell me you've made friends 
	with that wandering flea circus?

			ELLEN
	Why not?  She can guard the house.  
	By the way, I gave her a name: 
	Clara.

She pets the dog, not noticing the frown on Martin's face.

			MARTIN
	Where have you been all day?

			ELLEN
	I went to see Prof. Roth!  You 
	know, I had another one of those 
	dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!

Suddenly, the look on Martin's face softens again.  He takes 
Ellen into his arms to comfort her.

			MARTIN
	Ellen... our Tommi is dead.  And 
	there's nothing we can do about it.

Ellen rests her head against his shoulder.

			ELLEN
	You know, Martin, since we moved to 
	this house... sometimes I just get 
	the feeling that the past is 
	catching up to us again...

Martin interrupts her with unexpected ill temper and frees 
himself from the hug.

			MARTIN
	Oh!  Now we're getting to the 
	point!  So all of a sudden, it's 
	the house.  Yesterday, it was a 
	road sign.  And the first thing you 
	do is go and run to "Dr. Freud"! 

He heads for the study, leaving Ellen behind.  Ellen calls 
after him:

			ELLEN
	But that's not the point!  
	What if all these things are 
	somehow connected?

			MARTIN
	Oh, baloney.  You should just hear 
	yourself talk!

He treads up the staircase.

			MARTIN
	I'll be in the study, just in case 
	you decide to get reasonable, after 
	all.

Ellen watches him with consternation.  She goes into the 
kitchen, worried.

44.	KITCHEN - INT. / NIGHT

Lost in thought, Ellen takes out a cup and pours herself a cup 
of coffee from a thermos. 
She takes the pills that she got from Dr. Schleth out of her 
purse and studies them.

She looks out through the window, at the dreamlike landscape of 
the moors.  There is a warm evening breeze.

Suddenly, Ellen's eyes focus on the reflection of her face in 
the window.  She faintly discerns something strange on her 
forehead: "4"!

Startled, she touches her forehead.  There is nothing on it.

When she takes a second look at her reflection, everything is 
normal again.

The dog trots up to Ellen, whining balefully.

			ELLEN
		(to the dog)
	Either Martin is right or I am 
	really starting to lose my mind...

For a moment, she considers taking one of the tablets.  But 
then, she determinedly throws the whole package in the trash 
can.

CUT TO:

45.	IN THE VILLAGE - EXT. / DAY

Ellen parks her car in the center of the nearby village.  The 
small township is smothering in a humid summer's heat.

Ellen heads for a bookstore with Clara trotting in behind.

46.	AT THE BOOKSTORE - INT. / DAY

Ellen enters the shop.  It is unusually dark and quiet in here.  
She runs her fingers across the shelves, searching.

She passes by a stand with pocket books, also including several 
copies of "Cherry-red Tears" next to Stephen King's 
"Shining".  She stops for a moment.  Smiles.

Then, she finds the department for books on psychology.  She 
pulls out a book titled "The Inner Child - The Ghosts of the 
Past".  Leafs through it.  She stops at a certain page:

			ELLEN
		(quietly reads to herself)
	"...certain places arouse 
	recollections and links within 
	us..."

Suddenly, Ellen hears a voice behind her.

			SALES LADY (O.S.)
	First buy it, then read it!

Ellen looks up.  The sales lady is standing in front of her:  a 
skinny woman with small eyes suspiciously beaming at Ellen.

			ELLEN
	Yes, of course... I'll take it.

She places the book on the counter.  All of a sudden, the sales 
lady has turned into the world's most friendly person.  Ellen 
follows her to the cash register and gives her the book.

The sales lady skeptically eyes the psychology book while she 
notes the price.

Ellen puts the money on the counter and turns to leave the 
store, when the sales lady speaks up again.

			SALES LADY
	You're the wife of that author, 
	aren't you?

Ellen turns back to face her.

			ELLEN
	Martin Straub, yes.

			SALES LADY
	Used to write some nice books, your 
	husband.  But that last one was 
	awful.  A terrible book.  Didn't 
	sell, either.

Ellen really can't think of an answer to that.

			SALES LADY
	I read it - violent trash.  My 
	husband said so, too.

			ELLEN
	Well, I've got to get going... 
	'bye.

Ellen walks out of the shop.  The sales lady keeps talking.  
Her eyes are cold.

			SALES LADY
		(loud)
	It's bad and it's violent.  I don't 
	like that kind of stuff.  Tell that 
	to your husband.

47.	OUTSIDE BOOKSTORE - EXT. / DAY

Clara is still waiting in front of the bookstore when Ellen 
comes back outside.

			ELLEN
	Come on, Clara.  Let's get out of 
	here.

Just as she sets out for her car, she discovers Karl Lindner 
and his wife.  He seems to want to pass by her without saying 
hello.

			ELLEN
	Mr. Lindner!

Lindner realizes he has no way out of this situation.

			LINDNER
	Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce 
	you to my wife?

			MRS. LINDNER
	Just call me Elisabeth.

She seems like a truly honest person and very awake, despite 
her advanced age.  Ellen shakes hands with her.

			ELLEN
	Ellen.

			MRS. LINDNER
	You're doing fine, aren't you?  I 
	mean... the two of you alone in 
	that house, so far out in the moor.

Lindner nudges his wife with his elbow.

			ELLEN
	In the moor? What do you mean by 
	that?

Mrs. Lindner wants to answer something, but her husband heads 
her off.

			LINDNER
	Stop scaring people.  Let's go.  
	We need to be on our way.

			MRS. LINDNER
	Excuse us.  But do stop by for a 
	visit sometime!  You are welcome 
	anytime.

Lindner manages a smile and leads his wife away by the arm.

			LINDNER
	Have a nice day.

As soon as they are out of hearing distance, Mrs. Lindner tells 
her husband with obvious anger:

			MRS. LINDNER
		(quiet, reproachfully)
	You didn't tell her!

			LINDNER
	We should leave the past alone.

			MRS. LINDNER
	Well, it will never leave us alone 
	as long as you ignore it.

Back to Ellen:  She watches the two of them go for a moment.  
Then, she gets into her car and drives off.

CUT TO:

48.	STUDY - INT. / DUSK

Martin is in the study, working at his computer.  He is in a 
writing frenzy, typing in the words like a madman.  Ellen comes 
through the door.  She is carrying the book about Goldmoor in 
her hand.  At first, Martin does not react to her.  He keeps on 
typing.

			ELLEN
	It seems to be going well for you.

Martin continues to type as he speaks.

			MARTIN
	Where have you been?

			ELLEN
	In the village.  Look what I found.

She opens the book to a certain page and holds it under his 
nose.

Martin is annoyed for having to interrupt his work.

			MARTIN
	Psychology, huh?  So, what side of 
	the rainbow are we on today?

Ellen points out a certain passage in the book.

			ELLEN
		(reads out loud)
	"Events commonly interpreted as 
	haunting apparitions often result 
	from psychic disharmonies or 
	undigested traumatic ordeals..."

			MARTIN
		(impatient)
	Ellen, what are you trying to 
	prove, anyway?  That we've created 
	ourselves a ghost?  Come on!

Ellen persistently tries to get through to him.

			ELLEN
	It's just a feeling.  Don't you 
	sense it, too?

			MARTIN
	What? What am I supposed to sense?

			ELLEN
	The house - Tommi - something just 
	doesn't jive here...

Suddenly, Martin's voice gets disproportionately loud.

			MARTIN
	Now you go starting that again.  
	We decided together, to build up 
	something new here.  I, for my 
	part, am working on it very hard.  
	But oddly, you seem to have changed 
	your mind.

Ellen wants to reply something but just then, the doorbell 
RINGS.

			MARTIN
	Who's that?

			ELLEN
	I haven't the slightest idea.

When she sees that Martin does not intend to answer the door, 
Ellen goes downstairs herself.

49.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen opens the door.  Standing in the doorway are Paul and 
Claudia, both in the best of moods.

			PAUL AND CLAUDIA
	Surprise!

Ellen hugs them, her mind still halfway on Martin.

			ELLEN
	Well, this really is a surprise!  
	Come on in!

Martin comes downstairs.  He seems anything but pleased by the 
company.

Paul gives him a jovial pat on the shoulder.

			PAUL
	Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece 
	coming along?

			MARTIN
	Not so bad, if I could get some 
	peace and quiet around here.

Paul understands the side-swipe.

			PAUL
	Hey, hey, hey!  Say no more until 
	you've seen what we brought:

He puts a wide grin on his face.  Ellen and Martin exchange 
quick looks.  Paul pulls something out from behind his back.

			PAUL
	Scrabble!

CUT TO:

50.	LIVING ROOM - INT. / NIGHT

Martin looks annoyed.  The four friends are comfortably seated 
around the living room table.  Each of them has a glass of 
wine.
While they play Scrabble, Paul tells a dirty story.

			PAUL
	God, you should've seen him!  Elke 
	Schneider enters the room and 
	storms up to him.  She is 
	tremendous.  Her breasts are so big 
	that just recently, there was a 
	discussion about whether they 
	should be given country names of 
	their own.

Laughter all around the table. Martin is the only one who is 
not delighted.  But Ellen is clearly relieved by this moment of 
normality in the house.

			ELLEN
	Paul, you and your stories... I've 
	really missed you!

Claudia looks around the living room.  Apparently, she likes 
what she's seeing.

			CLAUDIA
	I'm impressed!  You two have really 
	gotten quite a bit done, already.

The sack with the Scrabble-letters is passed on to Ellen.  She 
reaches inside.

			ELLEN
	What do you think?  We worked our 
	fingers to the bone and now, we're 
	both about to have a nervous 
	breakdown.

Ellen places the letters on the table in front of her and 
begins to shuffle them back and forth.

			CLAUDIA
	I really wouldn't have thought you 
	two could stand it out here for 
	this long.  To tell the truth, we 
	even have some bets going with a 
	couple of people...

But Ellen isn't paying attention to Claudia's words any more.  
Terrified, she stares at her Scrabble-stones, which she has 
already put together.  The letters form the words:

T-H-R-E-E--D-A-Y-S

Everyone is waiting for her to make her turn.  Paul starts 
nagging.

			PAUL
	Well?  Are you going to play?

Ellen feverishly gathers up her letter stones and throws them 
back into the sack.  She shakes it with special thoroughness 
and draws anew.

			ELLEN
	I pass.

Paul is pleased.  He puts down his word.

			PAUL
	Triple word score, that makes 72 
	points.  Now what do you say to 
	that, honey-bunny?

			CLAUDIA
	My hero.

They kiss.

Ellen lines up her newly drawn stones in front of herself 
again.  Martin watches her.

Ellen cannot believe her eyes.  Again, her letter combination 
spells out:

T-H-R-E-E--D-A-Y-S

This time, the others notice the look on Ellen's face, too.

			CLAUDIA
	Ellen, what's wrong?

It takes Ellen a moment to answer.

			ELLEN
	I just got exactly the same letters 
	for the second time.

She gives Martin a significant look and shows him her letter-
board.  This time, she has proof!

			MARTIN
		(sarcastically)
	Oh, "three days".  A new message!

He turns to Paul and Claudia.

			MARTIN
	Because - you know - Ellen is 
	receiving messages from road signs, 
	radio broadcasters and now from 
	Scrabble game stones.

He turns Ellen's letter-board around for the others to see.

Martin's reaction hits Ellen like a fist.  She feels 
humiliated.  She is at a loss for words.

			MARTIN
	And the best part is:  She thinks 
	the messages are meant to announce 
	her death.
		(makes a "spooky" noise)
	Hooooo...

Claudia looks back and forth between Martin and Ellen.  She 
realizes how serious the situation is.  As opposed to Paul, who 
pulls out a news ARTICLE.

			PAUL
	Talk about spooky.  Martin, do you 
	remember that splintered door to 
	the study?  I guess there was more 
	to it than just a lost key.

The headline of the article reads: "Murder in Goldmoor - Many 
questions remain unanswered".

			ELLEN
	Let me see that!

Ellen takes the article.  The picture underneath shows Karl 
Lindner in police uniform, 23 years younger.
Before she even has a chance to read the article, Martin grabs 
the newspaper out of her hands.

He crumples up the paper and angrily turns to Paul.

			MARTIN
	Just perfect, Paul!  Well done!  
	Can't you tell that my wife is 
	upset enough already?  And then you 
	come up with this kind of a story?!

Ellen has regained her composure.  She is still outraged.

			ELLEN
	What do you think you're doing, 
	anyway?  Now give me back that 
	article!

Martin shows no sign of reaction.

			MARTIN
	Ellen, I just don't want you to get 
	upset for no reason.

He tries to conciliate by putting his arm on her shoulder.  But 
Ellen shakes him off.

			ELLEN
		(sarcastic)
	How thoughtful of you!

An unpleasant moment of silence.  Ellen looks at Claudia and 
Paul - she doesn't want to make a fool of herself.

			ELLEN
	Excuse me for a moment.

She storms out of the room.

Paul and Claudia both look a bit sheepish.

Martin holds the article to a candle and burns it in an 
ashtray. 

			MARTIN
	She shouldn't be worrying about 
	this stuff.  Lately, she's been 
	acting strange enough already.

51.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT. / NIGHT

Ellen is standing in front of the house.  Lost in thought, she 
takes a drag from her cigarette.
Claudia comes out of the house and joins her.

			CLAUDIA
	What's this going on between you 
	two?

			ELLEN
	Oh, I don't know.  I was hoping 
	things would get better once we 
	moved.

			CLAUDIA
	But nothing got any better?

Ellen's eyes wander over the vast landscape of moors which the 
darkness of the night has transformed into a surreal shadow 
painting.

			ELLEN
	Lately, Martin hasn't been his 
	normal self.  The work, the 
	relocation...

			CLAUDIA
	You have to give him some time, 
	Ellen.  He's under enormous 
	pressure right now.  He hasn't 
	written a single decent sentence 
	since the accident.

Ellen takes a last long drag from her cigarette, throws it on 
the ground and puts it out with her foot.

			ELLEN
	Yes, I know.  I try my best.  It's 
	just that... sometimes I wonder if 
	we made a mistake by moving here.

52.	LIVING ROOM - INT. / NIGHT

Martin and Paul are still seated opposite each other.  A 
strange atmosphere.  Paul is trying hard to keep up a 
conversation.

			PAUL
	So, work is going well, you say?

Martin makes a very calm impression.  In the background, the 
dog is barking at the cellar door.

			MARTIN
		(calmly)
	Yes.  Splendid.  I finally found a 
	story that's both:  thrilling and 
	true to life.

Now, Clara starts to bark at the cellar door.

			PAUL
	I'm glad to hear that.  You know...

Martin has a sudden outburst and yells:

			MARTIN
		(to the dog)
	NOW SHUT UP, YOU STUPID BITCH !

Paul is all confused now.  He throws a helpless look toward the 
entrance door.

			PAUL
	You know, I think I have to get up 
	early in the morning.  We ought to 
	get going.

53.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

Clara is still barking at the cellar door.  Then, she starts to 
claw at the crack below the door, as if she had discovered 
something behind it.

CUT TO:

54.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT. / DAY

The next morning:
The house is enclosed in a light curtain of early morning fog.  
Everything seems oddly quiet.  Not a single bird is chirping.

The calm before the storm.

55.	BEDROOM - INT. / DAY

Ellen wakes up out of her light sleep.  She looks around.  
Martin's side of the bed is empty and unused.  Martin did not 
spend the night by her side.

CUT TO:

56.	KITCHEN - INT. / DAY

Ellen enters the kitchen in her bathrobe.  She puts on a pot of 
coffee.  Martin comes in.

			MARTIN
	Hi, darling.

Ellen turns around to face him.  She is terror-stricken.

His hands are covered with blood.  He seems to be oblivious to 
it.  In the best of moods, he walks to the kitchen sink while 
he continues to speak.

			MARTIN
	At last, I'm back on top!  Seventy 
	pages in one night!  I'd say that 
	just about breaks the record...

He starts washing his hands with meticulous care.  The red-
stained water runs into the drain.

Ellen closes her eyes and fights the panic welling up inside of 
her.

			MARTIN
	Ellen?  Is everything alright?

She opens her eyes again.  She takes a second look and sees 
that what she thought to be blood is only wall paint.  She 
discovers a bucket with a paintbrush beside the kitchen door.

She tries to conceal her thoughts.

			ELLEN
	Oh, sure.  I'm just a little... 
	dizzy.

She hastily grabs the dog's food dish and fills it. - Simply to 
be doing something; anything.

			ELLEN
	I ought to give Clara something to 
	eat.

Ellen goes outside.

57.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT. / DAY

Ellen carries the dish outside and starts searching for Clara.

			ELLEN
	Clara!

Nothing stirs.

			ELLEN
	Come here, Clara!  I've got 
	something yummy for you.

Then, she catches sight of something dark lying a bit away in 
the grass.

Ellen puts down the dog food and runs toward the spot.

There, lying in the tall grass she finds the dog.  It's dead!  
It looks as if a wild animal had attacked Clara.

			ELLEN
	Oh, no!
		(loud)
	Martin!

She kneels down beside the animal's dead body.

			ELLEN
		(screams)
	Martin!

Martin comes out of the house and stops at the door.  He is 
calm - too calm.

			MARTIN
	What?

			ELLEN
	Look at this!  The dog!  She's 
	dead!

Martin shows no reaction.  He doesn't even seem to find it 
worth the trouble to go over to Ellen who is still kneeling in 
the grass.

			MARTIN
	She was old.

			ELLEN
	Old?!  Come look at this!  She has 
	wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like 
	thrashes.  Or bites.

			MARTIN
	Maybe an animal.

			ELLEN
		(furious)
	An animal?  What kind of animal?  
	A goddamned T-Rex, or what?

Martin is still apathetically standing in the doorway.

			MARTIN
	She spent a couple of pleasant days 
	with us, and now she's dead.  
	That's the way it is.  I'm sorry.  
	I have work to do.

He goes back inside.

Ellen watches him.

This very instant, she realizes that this is not the man she 
once married.  She knows that the time has come to take up 
action.

CUT TO:

58.	MOOR - EXT. / DAY

A short distance away from the house, Ellen has buried the dog.  
She sticks a small, self-built wooden crucifix into the soft 
earth.

She stands there for a moment.  She looks over at the house.  
Silence.  Loneliness.

Then, she hangs Clara's collar over the cross.  The little bell 
jingles.

CUT TO:

59.	COUNTRY ROAD - EXT. / DAY

Ellen speeds down the country road in her car.  She passes the 
town sign of Goldmoor.  She has a tense look on her face.

CUT TO:

60.	IN FRONT OF LINDNER'S HOUSE - EXT. / DAY

Ellen rings the doorbell.

She is standing in front of Lindner's house.  While she waits, 
she looks up and down the street.  There is no one in sight. 
The entire village seems deserted.

Elisabeth Lindner opens the door.  She doesn't seem very 
surprised to see Ellen.

			MRS. LINDNER
	Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering 
	when you'd come.  Why don't you 
	step in.

			ELLEN
	Thank you.

Ellen enters the house.

61.	HALLWAY IN LINDNER'S HOUSE - INT. / DAY

The hallway is dark.  The wood-paneled walls are decorated with 
pictures and certificates from Karl Lindner's years as a police 
officer.

			MRS. LINDNER
	My husband is in his study in the 
	back.

Mrs. Lindner leads Ellen through the corridor.

			ELLEN
	I really hate to bother him, but...

			MRS. LINDNER
	Oh no, no.  You're not bothering 
	him.
		(she winks an eye)
	He has lots of time since he's been 
	retired.

CUT TO:

62.	LINDNER'S STUDY - INT. / DAY

Ellen enters the spacious study.  Lindner is seated in front of 
an easel, dexterously painting lines onto a canvas.  He is 
working on a still life of flowers.

Without turning around to Ellen, he says:

			LINDNER
	Come in.

Ellen takes a look around the room.  It is also furnished in 
dark colors, and there are dozens of oil paintings standing 
around the room.  Every single one a still life of flowers.

			ELLEN
	You only draw flowers?  A little 
	unusual for a former policeman.

Lindner obstinately continues to work on his painting.

			LINDNER
	You know, after doing that job for 
	so many years, you learn to 
	appreciate the simple things in 
	life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty 
	that I always missed in life.  But 
	certainly, you're not here to chat 
	about my hobbies.

			ELLEN
	1976.  What happened back then?

With a heavy heart, he puts down his paintbrush and turns to 
face Ellen.

			LINDNER
	Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.

			ELLEN
	I appreciate your concern, but we 
	live in that house.  I need to know 
	what happened in there.

Lindner turns back to his painting and continues to draw.  He 
seems introverted, as if he were talking to himself.

			LINDNER
	We found the wife about a week 
	after she had died, hunched in her 
	TV-chair.  Her husband was sitting 
	in front of her; the whole time, he 
	sat in front of her dead body.  A 
	whole damn week.  Her death 
	certificate says that she drowned, 
	and her husband was convicted, but 
	God alone knows what really 
	happened back then.

Ellen is shocked.  Still, she persists.

			ELLEN
	What made him do it?

Lindner doesn't answer.

			ELLEN
	That man, is he still alive?  Where 
	is he?  Can I talk to him?

Lindner turns around to her again.  This time, he looks 
determined.

			LINDNER
	Why don't you just leave the past 
	alone and now go - please.

Ellen sees that it's no use.  She turns to leave.  But she 
stops at the door and turns back once more.

			ELLEN
	If there's one thing I've learned 
	lately, it's that you can not run 
	away from the past.  Believe me.

She leaves the old policeman behind.  Once alone, he lowers his 
eyes.

CUT TO:

63.	IN FRONT OF LINDNER'S HOUSE - EXT. / DAY

Ellen leaves the house, reflective.  Just as she heads through 
the gate, Mrs. Lindner catches up with her.

			MRS. LINDNER
	Ellen!  Wait!

She hands Ellen a small note.

			MRS. LINDNER
	Frank Kosinski.  Here's the 
	address.  Go see him.  Ask him.  

			ELLEN
	Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't 
	mean to...

Mrs. Lindner puts it off with a smile.

			MRS. LINDNER
	That's alright.  Don't 
	misunderstand my husband.  It's 
	only that he's already had enough 
	problems with this case.
	And who would believe him if he 
	told the truth?

			ELLEN
	But what is the truth?

			MRS. LINDNER
	I don't know all about what 
	happened back then.  But it always 
	stood between me and my husband.

Ellen nods and leaves.

CUT TO:

64.	PSYCHIATRY - EXT. / DAY

Ellen parks her car in front of the large, old building.  She 
opens the heavy double doors of the entrance.

65.	PSYCHIATRY - INT. / DAY

A long, wood-paneled hallway with small resting areas.  Some of 
the elderly people are sitting around, others are playing cards 
or staring at a television - a strange atmosphere.

Ellen approaches a SOCIAL WORKER, who is pushing an OLD LADY 
through the hallway in a wheelchair.
The old lady giggles, as if she were mentally disoriented.

			ELLEN
	Excuse me, I'm looking for Frank 
	Kosinski.

The young man is of the silly, bored type.

			SOCIAL WORKER
	Kosinski...
		(thinks for a moment)
	Oh - you mean K.K.!

			ELLEN
	Sorry?

The social worker grins.  He seems to think he's very funny.

			SOCIAL WORKER
	Killer-Kosinski, that's what they 
	call him around here.  He did away 
	with his wife.

Now, the old lady joins in on the conversation.

			OLD LADY
	I'm so glad you finally came.  
	We've all been waiting for you.

She gently touches Ellen's hand. - The old lady seems to be 
taking Ellen for someone else.

			ELLEN
		(softly, to the old lady)
	You must be mistaking me.
		(to the young man)
	Where can I find the man?

			SOCIAL WORKER
	He's in the closed psychiatry. This 
	here's the open section. Go down 
	the hall, third door to the left.

			ELLEN
	Thank you.

The old lady keeps on persisting.

			OLD LADY
	Are you doing better yet?

Ellen is too preoccupied to worry about the old lady.  She 
leaves them with a quick nod and hurries on.

The social worker starts pushing the wheelchair forward again.  
Walking away, Ellen still hears the old lady's voice.

			OLD LADY
		(to social worker)
	Poor girl.  She only has two more 
	days to live, you know.

Ellen stops.  She turns on her heels and runs back.

She excitedly stops the wheelchair and leans over to the old 
lady.

			ELLEN
	What was that?  What did you say?

The old lady doesn't seem to recognize her any more.

			OLD LADY
	What do you want from me?

			ELLEN
	What you just said, about the two 
	days...

			OLD LADY
	I didn't say anything!

Ellen looks at the social worker, hoping that he might help.

			SOCIAL WORKER
	I didn't hear anything.  Sorry.

Ellen doubtfully looks back and forth between the two of them.

			ELLEN
	I'm sorry...  I guess I was 
	mistaken.

She quickly turns her back to this embarrassing situation and 
leaves.

66.	HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF KOSINSKI'S CELL - INT. / DAY

The MALE NURSE turns the key.  Before opening the heavy door, 
he gives Ellen a questioning look.

			NURSE
	He has his clear moments every now 
	and then.  But I wouldn't get my 
	hopes up high.

They both enter the cell.

67.	KOSINSKI'S CELL - INT. / DAY

Frank Kosinski (approx. 70 years old now) is sitting at a desk.  
He is busy putting newspaper articles into clear plastic 
folders and carefully sorting them away.

Ellen enters the room.  The nurse closes the door from inside 
and stays standing next to it.  

The room looks more like an office archive than the cell of a 
closed psychiatric clinic.  There are several shelves filled 
with neatly lined up files.

			ELLEN
	Mr. Kosinski?

The old man takes no notice of her.  Ellen steps up to him, 
obviously feeling very uncomfortable about it.

			ELLEN
	Mr. Kosinski, my name is Ellen 
	Straub.  I live in your house out 
	in Goldmoor... I mean, the house 
	where you used to live.  There are 
	a few questions I would like to ask 
	you.

Kosinski does not react.  He seems so lost in his own world 
that he hasn't even registered her presence.  He stubbornly 
continues sorting his papers.

			ELLEN
	Mr. Kosinski!  Can you hear me?

She waves her hand in front of his face.  No reaction.
Ellen realizes that she'll have to come up with something else.

She walks to one of the shelves and pulls out a file titled 
"1976".  Leafs through it.  She finds the article that Paul 
had brought the other night.
She lays it on the desk, right in front of Kosinski's nose.

			ELLEN
	1976 - What happened back then?  
	You...

Now, she has his attention.  As if she had pushed the button of 
a tape recorder, Kosinski immediately begins to recite the 
article.  He seems to know it by heart.

			KOSINSKI
	"October 4, 1976.  To this day, the 
	cold-blooded murder at the remote 
	homestead continues to bring up 
	questions.  Investigations have 
	shown no satisfactory results.  As 
	was announced by a police spokesman 
	..."

Ellen gives the nurse a questioning look.

			NURSE
	Never mind, it's his usual number.

			ELLEN
	Yes.  That's right.  What happened 
	back then?

Although Kosinski has the news article right in front of him, 
he seems to be staring at the air.  Ellen tests him by taking 
away the news report.  Kosinski continues to recite.

			KOSINSKI
	"... another unsolved mystery is 
	the question, why doors and windows 
	had been nailed shut.  The murder 
	suspect and only witness is still 
	in a state of mental derangement. 
	..."

Again, Ellen tries to interrupt him.

			ELLEN
	Okay, fine.  I read that.  It's 
	written in the article.  What I 
	want to know is:  What really 
	happened back then?

Kosinski mechanically continues to speak.  Absolutely 
inanimate.

			KOSINSKI
	"... Friends and family describe 
	him as a friendly, reliable 
	husband.  He had been forced into 
	closing his small trades business 
	after bankruptcy.  It is uncertain 
	whether this might have been cause 
	for marital dispute..."

Ellen realizes that she cannot get through to him with words.  
She finds a page on the desk that was torn out of a chronicle 
about Goldmoor.

			ELLEN
	August 17, 1869.

			KOSINSKI
	"August 17, 1869.  A messenger 
	found Mr. and Mrs. Eugen and 
	Wilhelmine Meister dead in their 
	house."  

With both astonishment and dismay, Ellen listens to the old 
man's monotonous lecture.

			KOSINSKI
	"...The police constable in charge 
	found no traces.  The motive of the 
	crime remains a mystery..."

Ellen turns to the nurse.

			ELLEN
	Could I please speak with him alone 
	for a moment?

			NURSE
	Are you sure?

			ELLEN
	I'll be fine.  Thank you.

The nurse leaves the cell with a frown.

Ellen takes Kosinski's chair and turns him around.  She looks 
straight into his blank eyes.

			ELLEN
	I am starting to get the impression 
	that all of this is some kind of 
	bad joke:  I'm seeing things that 
	are not there, my own husband is 
	becoming a total stranger and your 
	old friend Lindner won't tell me 
	what he knows.  I have no idea what 
	you're trying to prove with this 
	performance of yours, but I am not 
	leaving this room before I hear the 
	truth.

No reaction.  Kosinski continues to stare at nothing in 
particular. 

Ellen gives up.  Shaking her head, she turns to the door.

			KOSINSKI
	It's a grave.

Ellen freezes and looks back at Kosinski.  She walks back over 
to him.

			ELLEN
	What?

Suddenly, Kosinski seems to have snapped out of his "autism".  
He is holding an old book in his hands.  The book contains 
clippings, notes and among others, a page that seems to have 
been torn out of another book.
It is an etching from the Middle Ages illustrating a man being 
pushed into the swamp by several villagers.
Ellen reads the text underneath the illustration:

			ELLEN
	"...Execution in the moor..."

All of a sudden, Kosinski grabs Ellen and pulls her close.  His 
eyes have a feverish glow.

			KOSINSKI
	The moor... it's one big grave.

CUT TO:

68.	ENTRANCE AREA / HALLWAY - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen enters the hallway.  She runs into Martin who is on his 
way up from the cellar.
When he sees Ellen, he shuts the cellar door and puts the key 
into his pocket again.  It seems as if he felt caught doing 
something.

			ELLEN
		(sarcastic)
	Let me guess:  Another short 
	circuit?

			MARTIN
	Hi, darling.

Martin ignores her comment and starts to head up the stairs to 
his study.

			ELLEN
	What is going on down there, 
	anyway?  Why am I not supposed to 
	go in the cellar?

Martin stops at the base of the stairway.

			MARTIN
	I told you:  It's too dangerous.  
	Besides, I have to work now.

He continues up the staircase.  Ellen follows him.

			ELLEN
	Martin, we need to talk.  I've done 
	some research.  This lovely house 
	of ours has a history of murder 
	cases.

Martin does not stop walking, but his eyes show alarm.

			ELLEN
	Anyone who ever lived in this house 
	either quickly moved back out, or 
	fell victim to strange accidents, 
	or ended up killing each other.

69.	STUDY - INT. / NIGHT

Martin sits down at his desk and immediately starts typing.  
Ellen won't give up so easy.

			ELLEN
	I know you don't believe me, but at 
	least hear me out.  Don't tell me 
	you haven't noticed that we've been 
	going through some strange changes 
	since we moved here!
	We hardly talk to each other any 
	more, you're writing like a madman 
	and I'm having these visions.

Martin does not interrupt his work.

Ellen slams the articles from Kosinski on his keyboard.

			ELLEN
	Here, look at this!  Did you know 
	that our house is built right on a 
	spot where during the Middle Ages 
	people were executed?  They simply 
	threw the convicts into the moors, 
	alive.

Martin shakes his head.  He smiles and shoves the articles 
aside.

			MARTIN
	During the Middle Ages people were 
	executed at every corner.  What's 
	your point?

			ELLEN
	This house, the whole damned area 
	around here is one mass grave...  
	Now you might call me crazy, but 
	there is something negative about 
	the place.

			MARTIN
	Okay, so the house has a history 
	and there might still be a couple 
	of corpses in the moors.
		(mocking)
	"There is something negative about 
	the place..."  What the hell are 
	you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit 
	it out!

Ellen twists around.

			ELLEN
	It's like... a sickness!  And it's 
	gotten into our heads.

Now Martin gets aggressive.

			MARTIN
	Will you finally cut it out?  Just 
	in case you haven't noticed, I am 
	trying to write a book here.  And 
	maybe - even with your birdbrains - 
	you can figure it's a pretty tough 
	job.
	So why can't you just leave me 
	alone?

			ELLEN
	Damn it, look at you!  Don't you 
	see what's happening with you?  We 
	need to get out of here, don't you 
	understand?  Out of this house!

Martin threatens her with his forefinger.

			MARTIN
	Now let me work!

Martin continues to write.

			ELLEN
		(hollers)
	To hell with your damned work!

In a rash action, she suddenly pushes his computer monitor off 
of the desk.

Martin jumps up from his chair.  He grabs Ellen by the throat 
and pushes her against the wall.  Throbbing veins on his 
forehead.

			MARTIN
	Don't you dare...

Ellen can hardly breathe.  She is about to choke.  Just in 
time, Martin lets go.

Ellen slides to the floor and gasps for air.

Martin doesn't seem to care.  He sets the monitor back onto the 
table and gets back to work.

Ellen is deeply shocked.  She drags herself out of the room.

Martin doesn't even deign to look up at her again.

70.	HALLWAY - INT. / NIGHT

The door to the study falls shut behind Ellen.

Slowly, she sinks to her knees and starts to cry.  Hopelessness 
and despair.

			ELLEN
		(sobbing)
	Martin... oh my God... what's 
	happening to us...

The house is dead-silent.  Only the sound of Martin typing on 
his computer keyboard in his study.

Suddenly, Ellen hears a noise - very quiet.  It is the RINGING 
of a bell.

Ellen looks up.

There it is again, very clearly:  It's the bell on the collar 
of the dead dog.

			ELLEN
		(quietly, to herself)
	Clara...?

She stands up and heads for the staircase.  Cautiously.

A shadow rushes through the entrance hall - the shadow of a 
dog.

Ellen sneaks down the steps.  Her eyes scan the darkness.

71.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

Again, the BELL RINGING.  The shadow.  The animal seems to have 
run into the cellar.

Now, Ellen notices that the door Martin had locked so carefully 
earlier, is open.

A dirty-yellow gleam shines into the hallway from below.

Ellen looks up - Martin seems to be working:  His steady typing 
resounds throughout the house.

It takes Ellen all the courage she has, but finally she makes 
herself go into the cellar...

72.	STUDY - INT. / NIGHT

Martin stops typing in mid-sentence.  He looks up.  There is a 
threatening gleam in his eyes...

73.	CELLAR - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen carefully walks down the stairs to the cellar.  It's 
cold.  The single light bulb at the ceiling hardly sheds any 
light.  An eerie and unsettling atmosphere.

No sign of the dog.

Ellen finds the fuse box.  No difference - the wires are still 
hanging out of the wall, tangled up and rotten.

All of a sudden, there is a voice coming from behind Ellen.

			THOMAS (O.S.)
	Mommy...

Ellen spins around.

There's something in the darkness - a figure:  Tommi!

Ellen freezes.  Her eyes are glued to the little boy, whose 
figure melts together with the shadows.  Like a tape recording, 
he repeats:

			THOMAS
	Mommy...

Ellen fights up against the image as if she knew that it is 
only a lie.

			ELLEN
	No...

The boy steps out of the shadow.

			THOMAS
	Mommy...

Ellen backs off.

			ELLEN
	My son is dead...

The little boy comes closer.  Now, he is standing right in 
front of Ellen.  He raises his hands as if he wanted to be 
hugged.  Again, his sad voice repeats:

			THOMAS
	Mommy!

Finally, Ellen's heart wins over reason.  She falls to her 
knees and takes the boy into her arms.

			ELLEN
	My God, Tommi.

Tears run down her cheeks.  She holds the child close.  But 
what she doesn't see: The boy's mean smile behind her back.

Suddenly, there is a strange transformation:  Running through 
Ellen's fingers - little at first, but then more and more:  
mud!

Thomas' body has turned into liquid in her arms.  Ellen is 
devastated.

Right before her eyes, the child dissolves into swamp mud.  It 
drains away and disappears in the floor.

Time seems to stand still.

Suddenly, Ellen is grabbed by the hair and torn around.
It's Martin!  He stares at her resentfully.

			MARTIN
	Didn't I tell you not to go in the 
	cellar?!

Ellen does not understand what's happening.

			ELLEN
	Martin, what-

			MARTIN
	It's simply too dangerous here!  
	But no, you always have to have it 
	your way.

She tries to squirm out of his grip - but it's no use.
Martin drags her up the stairs.

			MARTIN
	You know what I have to do now,  
	and believe me:  I don't enjoy 
	doing this.

			ELLEN
	Martin, damnit, what are you up to?  
	Let go of me!

74.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

Martin mercilessly drags Ellen along behind him.

			MARTIN
	Of course you'll give me the blame 
	again.  Like back then.  Just a 
	tiny cut and he could still be 
	alive today - isn't that right, 
	Ellen?

			ELLEN
	What are you talking about-

Ellen tries to find a way to free herself.  But she hardly 
stands a chance against Martin's strength.

			MARTIN
	Enough of that!  I know what I have 
	to do now.

Sliding by, Ellen bumps into a tool box.  She gets hold of a 
screwdriver. 
Panic-stricken, she thrusts it in Martin's direction.

A scream of pain.  He collapses.  Bleeds.

Ellen tears herself loose and runs out of the house.

75.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE / CAR - EXT. / NIGHT

Ellen races to the car and jumps in behind the steering wheel.

Martin staggers out in pursuit of her.  He is holding his 
stomach.

Inside the car:
Ellen hastily crams out the car key.  It slips out of her hand.

Martin is coming closer.

Inside the car:
Ellen gropes around in the darkness, trying to find the key.

Martin has almost reached the car.

Inside the car:
At last, Ellen has the key.  She pushes it into the ignition, 
turns it around.  The engine roars up.

Ellen careens off in the car.  She brushes Martin.  He spins 
away with a loud thud.

The car speeds off.

CUT TO:

76.	CONSULTING ROOM OF PROF. ROTH - INT. / DAWN

Prof. Roth is in the middle of a conference with two INTERNS.
The door flies open.  Ellen storms into the room with tears in 
her eyes; she is totally frantic.

Her appearance surprises him.

			PROF. ROTH
	Mrs. Straub!

			ELLEN
	I've killed my husband!

			PROF. ROTH
	What?

			ELLEN
	I think I've killed him.  Martin, 
	my husband, I've killed him!  That 
	is, I'm not sure, but...

Prof. Roth immediately takes her arm and leads her to a sofa.

			PROF. ROTH
	Mrs. Straub!  Now calm down first.

Ellen is totally distraught.

			ELLEN
		(hectic, loud)
	It all went so fast.  He was out of 
	his mind and then all of sudden 
	there was this screwdriver.  I only 
	wanted to defend myself.  You have 
	to call the police...

			PROF. ROTH
	We can do all of that later, but 
	first you need to calm down.

He stands up, fetches a glass of water and takes a tablet out 
of a package.

			PROF. ROTH
	Here, take this.

Ellen takes the pill without a moment's hesitation and swallows 
it with a drink of water.

			ELLEN
	I... I don't know which part of it 
	all really happened... It's all one 
	big nightmare...

Prof. Roth sees that she is not able to think clearly at the 
moment.

			PROF. ROTH
	You are going to sleep for a little 
	while, now.  And then, we'll talk 
	about it more calmly and sift 
	through all of this.

The tablet quickly begins to show an effect.  In Ellen's eyes, 
Prof. Roth's face gets blurry.

One of the interns speaks up.

			INTERN
	Should we inform the authorities?

Prof. Roth waves it off.

			PROF. ROTH
	Before everyone gets all nervous, 
	why don't you call her house.  
	Maybe that will clear things up.

Ellen only vaguely catches the last spoken sentences through a 
curtain of haze.  Then, she loses conscience.

FADE TO:

77.	HOSPITAL ROOM - INT. / DAY

Ellen drowsily wakes up in a hospital room.  She takes a 
careful look around herself.  The room is surprisingly nice and 
pleasantly furnished.

78.	HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - INT. / DAY

There is a lot going on in the hospital corridor.  
MALE and FEMALE NURSES busily take care of their duties.

A hand picks up a syringe and an ampoule from a trolley.

79.	HOSPITAL ROOM - INT. / DAY

The door is opened.

Ellen barely manages to lift her head in order to see who the 
visitor is.

A man pulls a wheelchair inside with his back turned to her, 
and closes the door.

			ELLEN
	Professor Roth?

The man turns around: It's Martin!
He is wearing his best suit.  He shows no signs of a wound.

Ellen wants to call for help, but Martin is already up next to 
her and holds her mouth shut with his hand.

			MARTIN
	Hello, darling.  Are you feeling 
	better?

He thrusts the syringe into her leg.

Ellen desperately searches for the emergency button for the 
nurses' room.

			MARTIN
		(whispers)
	Shh... everything will be fine.  
	Tomorrow, it will all be over.  
	Just don't try to fight it.

Ellen has found the button, but the medication is faster:  She 
doesn't have enough strength to push the button any more.

Her tired eyes blink and fall shut for a moment...

FADE TO:

80.	BEDROOM - INT. / NIGHT

... Ellen's eyes slowly open again.  She wakes up to a loud 
HAMMERING noise.

Only now does she realize that she is lying on the planking of 
her own bed, with her hands and feet roped tight.  Martin has 
put a gag in her mouth.  He is standing by the window, nailing 
several large boards in front of it.  
He is so preoccupied with his work that he hasn't yet noticed 
that Ellen is awake.  He quietly curses under his voice.

			MARTIN
	You stupid little bitch...  think 
	you can toy around with people any 
	old way you like.  But not me, no.

Ellen carefully tries to loosen the ropes.  The sound catches 
Martin's attention.  He turns around to her.  He is still 
holding a nail in the corner of his mouth.

			MARTIN
		(sweetly)
	Oh sweetheart, you're awake 
	already?

He takes the nail out of the corner of his mouth and opens his 
suit jacket.  Underneath, we see his blood-soaked shirt.  But 
he doesn't seem to feel any pain.

			MARTIN
	That really wasn't very nice of you 
	yesterday.  I always thought you 
	loved me.  You know, I bet any 
	other husband would be pretty upset 
	with you now.

He sits down on the bed next to her and begins to loosen her 
gag.

			MARTIN
	But I believe in our relationship.  
	What are such trifles compared to 
	that.

He takes the gag out of her mouth.  Ellen's voice is shaking.

			ELLEN
	Martin, for heaven's sake, tie me 
	loose!

Martin seriously shakes his head.

			MARTIN
	Believe me, I'd really like to.  
	But I have the feeling you're not 
	ready yet.

Ellen lies there, totally helpless.

			ELLEN
	Ready?  For what?  This is crazy!  
	Don't you see what's going on here?

He moves closer to her, caresses her cheek.

			MARTIN
	The last day, Ellen.  Today is the 
	last day.  The circle is closing.

Ellen suddenly understands.

			ELLEN
	You knew!

Martin slowly leans over and kisses her.  Ellen tries to turn 
her head away, but Martin holds it tight.  Barbaric - there is 
nothing tender about this kiss.

			MARTIN
	Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... 
	Of course I knew.

			ELLEN
	We loved each other once.  Have you 
	forgotten that?

Martin seems bitter.

			MARTIN
	Oh, yeah?  Did we really?  Think 
	about it, Ellen...

Just then, the DOORBELL rings.  They both look toward the door.
Quick as a flash, Martin presses his hand on Ellen's mouth, so 
she cannot scream.

			MARTIN
	Are you expecting company?

81.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT. / NIGHT

Karl Lindner is standing at the door.  He presses the doorbell 
button.  He is carrying one of his flower paintings under his 
arm.

82.	BEDROOM - INT. / NIGHT

Martin puts the gag back into Ellen's mouth.

			MARTIN
	Make yourself comfortable.  I'll be 
	right back.

He stands up and leaves the room.

Ellen hears him lock the door from outside.  She immediately 
begins to tear at her ropes.

83.	HALLWAY / ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

The doorbell RINGS again.  While Martin runs downstairs, he 
buttons up his suit jacket again in order to conceal the blood 
stains.
He is still holding the hammer in his hand.

He walks to the door and opens it to Lindner.

			LINDNER
	Good evening.  Karl Lindner.  I'm a 
	friend of your wife.  Is she in?

84.	BEDROOM - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen is still tied to the bed.  She faintly hears the two 
men's VOICES from downstairs.

She moves her head, trying to get rid of the gag - in vain.

Ellen screams, but only muffled sounds come out.

She doubles her efforts and tears at her ropes with all her 
might.

85.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE / ENTRANCE AREA - EXT. / NIGHT

Martin is standing across from Lindner.  He gives him a 
friendly smile.  He shows no apparent signs of the condition he 
is in.

			MARTIN
	Ellen is home.  But she isn't 
	feeling well.  Can I give her a 
	message?

Lindner takes the painting out from under his arm.

			LINDNER
	Oh, then I guess that makes my gift 
	all the more appropriate.  Maybe 
	I'll just give it to her real quick 
	and be on my way again.

Martin anxiously fingers the hammer in his hands.

			MARTIN
	Um, I don't think that's a good 
	idea.  She went to lie down.  I 
	think she's already asleep.  She's 
	been pretty busy lately and needs 
	to rest.

86.	BEDROOM - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen realizes that there is no way she can untie herself.  But 
slowly, she manages to loosen one of the bed planks that she is 
tied to - bit by tedious bit.

87.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE / ENTRANCE AREA - EXT. / NIGHT

Lindner peeks inside the house past Martin.  He casually asks:

			LINDNER
	So, what's wrong with her?

Martin is still playing around with the hammer.

			MARTIN
	Just nerves.  You know, the move 
	and all that...

Lindner realizes that it's no use asking further.  He hands 
over the picture.

			LINDNER
	Well, then.  Would you please give 
	this to her for me?  Tell her, I'd 
	like to talk to her when she's 
	feeling better.  And tell her I 
	don't want to run away anymore.  
	She'll understand what I mean.

			MARTIN
	Sure, I'll tell her.

The old policeman walks to his car and climbs inside.

Martin smiles and waves him good-bye.

88.	BEDROOM - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen has finally made it:  She manages to disconnect the 
plank.
She quickly tears the gag out of her mouth and yells as loud as 
she can:

			ELLEN
		(screams)
	Help!  Help, I'm in here!  Help me!

She listens if anyone heard her calling.

It's useless.  Lindner has already started his car, and drives 
off.  The sound of his car engine fades away in the distance.

Ellen is desperate.

89.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

Martin heard Ellen's calling.  He grins self-consciously and 
locks the house door.  Then, he reaches for a board leaning 
against the wall.  He takes a nail out of his pocket and starts 
to nail the door shut.

CUT TO:

90.	LINDNER'S CAR / COUNTRY ROAD - EXT. / NIGHT

Karl Lindner is driving towards Goldmoor.  He is lost in 
thought.  Something about the whole situation seemed strange to 
him, but he can't put his finger on it.

He brakes and looks back toward the house once more (a moment 
of hope for Ellen).

But then, he shakes his head and steps on the gas pedal again.

The car drives off into the distance.

CUT TO:

91.	BEDROOM - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen gets rid of the rest of her ropes, immediately jumps up 
and races to the door.

She checks the door: it's locked.  She peeks through the 
keyhole.

The key is sticking in the opposite side of the door.  We hear 
Martin hammering downstairs.

Ellen has an idea - an ancient trick from childhood days.  
There is a book on the bedside table.  She tears out a page and 
slides it underneath the door, below the door lock.

There is a can of nails on the floor which Martin left behind.  
Ellen takes out a nail and uses it to poke around in the 
keyhole.

She pushes the key out of the lock.  The key falls to the 
floor, but it lands next to the sheet of paper.

Ellen pulls the book page in under the door - no key!

			ELLEN
		(quietly)
	Damn.

She presses her face flat against the floor and looks 
underneath the door crack.
There, on the other side, is the key.

Suddenly, the hammering stops.

Ellen holds her breath...

92.	LIVING ROOM - INT. / NIGHT

...The living room windows are all nailed shut.  Martin 
prepares to attach the last board.  He reaches into his pocket 
- no more nails...!

93.	BEDROOM - INT. / NIGHT

...The box of nails is lying on the bedroom floor.  Ellen 
senses that she is running out of time.  She moves faster.

She pushes the book page under the door again and tries to 
maneuver it underneath the key...

94.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

...Martin comes out of the living room and heads for the 
hallway...

95.	BEDROOM - INT. / NIGHT

...Ellen has it!  She has managed to get the key on top of the 
sheet of paper.  Carefully, she pulls it in under the door.
She picks it up and pushes it into the lock...

96.	HALLWAY - INT. / NIGHT

...Martin comes up the stairs.  He heads for the bedroom.  When 
he sees the open door, he stops.

He hesitates for a moment, looks around.

Then, he carefully approaches the door.

			MARTIN
	Is somebody trying to run away 
	here?!  Darling, I'm really 
	disappointed.  How can we ever have 
	a trusting marriage if you keep 
	running away from every conflict?

Martin has reached the bedroom door.

			MARTIN
	You little hardhead, I...

At that moment, the door slams into him.  A loud crunch.  The 
wooden door hits him right in the head.  Martin is knocked to 
the floor.

Ellen comes running out of the bedroom.  She has a wooden plank 
in her hands.  She wants to make sure that the job is done 
right and clobbers Martin until he stops moving.

Then, she sprints to the staircase and runs down the steps.

97.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen runs to the barricaded house door.  She shakes at the 
boards, but they are down tight.  No matter how hard Ellen 
tries, it's impossible for her to loosen them.

Horrified, she searches for another way out.  She runs to the 
living room door and looks inside the room...:

98.	LIVING ROOM - INT. / NIGHT

...All of the windows are barricaded.  There is no chance to 
escape!

99.	HALLWAY - INT. / NIGHT

Martin regains conscience.  His head is wounded and bleeding.  
He scrambles to his feet.

			MARTIN
	No matter what you do, Ellen...  
	you don't stand a chance.  We're 
	not leaving this place anymore...

100.	LIVING ROOM - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen looks around, helpless.  We hear Martin's voice coming 
from upstairs.

			MARTIN (O.S.)
	... not today.  Not tomorrow.  
	Never again!

She discovers the remote control for the TV.  And gets an idea.  
She grabs it and runs out of the room.

101.	KITCHEN - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen flees into the kitchen.  The windows are all nailed shut 
here, too.  Ellen's heart is beating up to her neck.  She jerks 
open a drawer and takes out a big kitchen knife.

We hear Martin's footsteps coming down the staircase.

			MARTIN (O.S.)
	It's like you always wanted.  
	Us together.  We'll make it through 
	anything, no matter how rotten the 
	situation is.

Ellen squats next to the door frame.

102.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

Martin is walking down the last couple of steps.  Out of the 
corner of his eyes, he notices the open kitchen door.

			MARTIN
	Have you ever wondered why it 
	hasn't been working out between us 
	since it all happened?  I've asked 
	myself that question.  And you know 
	what the answer to that is?  It was 
	never real.  All just a big lie.

While he speaks, Martin slowly moves toward the kitchen.

103.	KITCHEN - INT. / NIGHT

Martin has almost reached the kitchen.
Quivering, Ellen pushes a button on the remote control...

104.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

...and the television jumps on in the living room, behind 
Martin.  The loud NOISE startles him; he spins around.

Martin smiles and taps the hammer in the palm of his hand.  
Then, he heads towards the living room.

			MARTIN
	What you loved, was something 
	totally different.  The successful 
	author, Martin Straub.  "Mr. 
	Cherry-red Tears" - you married a 
	goddamned book.

Martin disappears in the living room.

105.	KITCHEN - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen sees her chance, and takes it.  She runs out of the 
kitchen...

106.	ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

...and up the stairs.

Martin sprints out of the living room.  He is after her.

107.	HALLWAY - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen runs into the study.  Martin is right on her heels...

108.	STUDY - INT. / NIGHT

...Ellen slams the door shut behind her and locks it.  She 
reaches for the telephone next to the computer.

CUT TO:

109.	LINDNER'S BEDROOM - INT. / NIGHT

The lights are off in Lindner's bedroom.
Karl is lying in bed with his eyes open, staring at the 
ceiling.  His wife notices it.

			MRS. LINDNER
	You went to see the Straubs' today, 
	didn't you?

Lindner doesn't answer.  The look in his eyes says it all.

			MRS. LINDNER
	I know you have something on your 
	mind.  What is it?

He hesitates.  Sighs.  Finally, he says it:

			LINDNER
	I think it's starting again.  
	You know... there was something 
	peculiar.  If only I knew...

			MRS. LINDNER
	Peculiar?  You mean, like back 
	then?

			LINDNER
	Yes, something was...

Suddenly, it hits him.

			LINDNER
	My God, the hammer!

He jumps out of bed and into his clothes.

			MRS. LINDNER
	Hammer?

			LINDNER
	How could I fail to notice that!
	- I have to go...

He hesitates, looks back at his wife.

			LINDNER
	I'm sorry, honey.

It is hard for Mrs. Lindner to let her husband go.  But she 
understands.

			MRS. LINDNER
	Go ahead.  I know you have to do 
	this.

CUT TO:

110.	STUDY - INT. / DAY

Ellen dials the emergency number for the police and races to 
the window.  She looks down - it's quite a ways down, and at 
the bottom, hard stone pavement.

The phone RINGS at the other end of the line.

Martin rumbles against the door to the study.  He is trying to 
get inside.

111.	HALLWAY - INT. / NIGHT

Martin is standing in front of the closed door to the study, 
shaking the door handle.  He listens.

			MARTIN
	Come on...

112.	STUDY - INT. / NIGHT

Ellen still hasn't gotten through to the police.

			MARTIN (O.S.)
	... I know what you're up to.  You 
	don't think that's going to work, 
	do you?

Ellen desperately looks around the room, searching for a way 
out.  She catches sight of the activated computer.  There is a 
text flickering on the slightly demolished monitor.

Finally, someone answers the phone at the police station.

			TELEPHONE VOICE (O.S.)
	Police headquarters, Webber...

Ellen excitedly speaks into the phone.

			ELLEN
	Ellen Straub here.  You have to 
	help me...

113.	HALLWAY / ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

Martin runs down the stairs to the entrance area.  He heads 
straight for the distributor box next to the cellar door.
One well-aimed blow, and the gray telephone box is demolished.

114.	STUDY - INT. / NIGHT

			ELLEN
	... please come right away!  My 
	address is...

CLICK!  The conversation is cut off.  The line is dead.

But Ellen hardly notices it anymore.  Her eyes are glued to the 
monitor.  Something about it has drawn her full attention.

Her name is written on the monitor screen!  Ellen begins to 
read in disbelief.

			ELLEN
		(reads)
	"Ellen woke up from the sound of 
	the door.  She barely managed to 
	raise her head in order to see who 
	the visitor might be.  His back 
	turned to Ellen, the man pulled a 
	wheelchair into the hospital room.  
	When he turned around, she 
	recognized him with horror: 
	Martin!"

Ellen's eyes grow wider with every word she reads.  The text 
abruptly stops here.
Martin must have known everything!  Her whole story, everything 
that happened to her, is described in his new novel.

			ELLEN
	What the hell...

From outside, we hear Martin's voice loud and clear.  He 
finishes her sentence for her:

			MARTIN
	...is going on here?

Before Ellen has a chance to give the situation a thought, the 
door breaks open.  The door frame splinters.  Martin simply 
kicked the door in.

			MARTIN
	The final chapter will finish 
	tonight.  I bet you can't wait to 
	find out how the story ends!

Ellen grabs the knife and backs away.

			ELLEN
	My God, Martin.  I don't understand 
	all this.  How is it possible?

Slowly and threateningly, Martin comes closer.  In his hands, 
the hammer.

			MARTIN
	Do you like my new book?  A real 
	page-turner, isn't it?  I can just 
	see the critics:  Martin Straub is 
	back!  And better than ever.

Ellen is backed up against the wall.  She raises the knife 
against him.

			ELLEN
	Stay where you are!  Not one step 
	closer!

Martin isn't fazed that easily.

			MARTIN
	You still don't understand, do you?  
	Today is the last day.  Your day, 
	Ellen.

With this, he jumps up to her, quick as lightning.  He grabs 
the knife by the blade and twists it out of Ellen's hand - 
without the slightest feeling of pain.

He firmly pulls Ellen towards the door.  They pass by the desk 
with the computer.  Ellen sees the electric cord for the 
computer on the floor.
With a swift move of her foot, she tears at the cable, pulling 
the computer off of the desk.  It falls to the floor.

Martin screams in rage.  For a second, he is distracted.
Ellen takes the opportunity to tear herself loose.

115.	HALLWAY / ENTRANCE AREA - INT. / NIGHT

Terrified, Ellen races down the stairs.  She is looking for a 
way out.

Martin is close on her heels.  In the entrance hall, he gets 
hold of her.
But Ellen manages to break loose again.  But doing so, she 
slips.  Falls.

And trips through the open cellar door...

116.	CELLAR - INT. / NIGHT

... down the stairs.
Ellen crash-lands in brackish, brown water.  The cellar is 
flooded ankle-deep with swamp water.  It is seeping in through 
the crevices in the walls.

			ELLEN
	The moor...

Martin walks up to her, threateningly.  Ellen scrambles to her 
feet.  She is hurt.  But Martin walks past her and steps into 
the center of the dark cellar.

Ellen glances back at the cellar door which is still open.  
Suddenly, an invisible force slams it shut.

			MARTIN
	I told you, there is no way out.  
	He won't let you go.

			ELLEN
	'HE'?  Whom do you mean-

Instead of answering, he gently puts his finger on her mouth.

			MARTIN
		(quietly)
	Shh.  Don't you hear that?

She looks around.

Then she hears it:  The room is filled with quiet WHISPERS, 
growing louder and louder - countless voices - the voices of 
children!

			MARTIN
	It's important - he knows the last 
	chapter.

			ELLEN
	Your book - that's why you were 
	always in the cellar!

Just then, a figure steps out of the darkness.  It is their 
little son Thomas.  Although he does not move his lips, he 
seems to be the source of the whispers.
He stands next to Martin, who lays his arm around the boy's 
shoulder.

			MARTIN
	Now look at this young man:  He 
	supports me in what I do - quite 
	the opposite of you.

Terrified, Ellen stares at Thomas.  She watches a thin strand 
of mud flow out of the boy's shoulder, and - against the laws 
of gravity - it crawls up over Martin's hand.  Martin does not 
seem to notice it.

			MARTIN
	You know, Tommi wants me to become 
	the man I used to be.

			ELLEN
		(laughs bitterly)
	...So he's dictating you a new 
	bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's 
	not our son.

Martin leans down to the child's figure and brings his ear 
close to Thomas' mouth.  The boy seems to be whispering 
something in his ear.

			ELLEN
		(sharply)
	Martin, don't you understand?  
	Tommi is dead!  This... it knows 
	our weaknesses and it's using them 
	to bring us apart!

Martin stays leaned down to Thomas and listens.  He throws a 
stealthy glance at Ellen.

			MARTIN
	I'm afraid he doesn't like you very 
	much.

Martin smiles triumphantly.  He reaches into the water and 
pulls out a metal pipe.

He threateningly moves closer to Ellen.  She backs away, until 
she finds herself backed up against the wall.

Ellen looks around - there is no where to run.  But she tries 
anyway.  She wants to make a run for it.

But Martin is faster.  He grabs hold of her.  Ellen slips and 
lands in the water.

			MARTIN
	We've played this game long enough.

He mercilessly pushes Ellen's head under water.  She tries to 
put up a fight, but she doesn't stand a chance.

			MARTIN
	How sad.  Drowned, like all the 
	others.  But that's the way it's 
	got to be in a real horror novel.  
	I know what you're thinking:  No 
	happy end - it'll never sell.  But 
	to hell with commerce!

Ellen manages to fight her way above the water's surface.  She 
gasps for air.  Her eyes catch sight of the old shelf, crammed 
full with all sorts of junk, standing within reach of her feet.

			ELLEN
	It's lying, don't you see?  This is 
	all an illusion.  It lied to us and 
	to all of those who were here 
	before us...

Martin's eyes are beaming with hate.  He does not notice Ellen 
kicking for the shelf.  It slightly tips forward, then back 
against the wall again.

			MARTIN
	I'll tell you what really was an 
	illusion:  Romantic family life, by 
	the side of your successful author.  
	Sorry if I wasn't able to live up 
	to your high expectations, 
	princess.

Ellen tries to get through to whatever is left of Martin.

			ELLEN
	It wasn't your fault, you hear!

Ellen gets another good kick against the shelf - it tips over 
and collapses over Martin's head.  Ellen grabs the chance to 
free herself.
Martin furiously thrusts the shelf aside.  There is an ugly 
wound on his forehead.

			ELLEN
	Tommi is dead, you hear!
	But you and me, we're alive.

Again, Ellen is backed up against the wall.  Martin steps up to 
her.  He is still holding the metal pipe.

			MARTIN
	Be quiet.

Suddenly, he strikes her with the pipe.  He grabs Ellen by the 
throat and pushes her against the wall.

			ELLEN
	I love you, Martin!

For a short moment, something seems to break inside of Martin.  
But then, he tightens his grip on her neck again.
Ellen is dazed, but she is not afraid any more.

			ELLEN
	Then kill me, because... "With you, 
	my life began and with you shall it 
	end..."

All of a sudden, some of Martin's strength seems to fail.  His 
look freezes.  A single BLACK TEAR runs out of the corner of 
his eye.
Ellen grabs the metal pipe and shoves Martin away.

She jumps over to Thomas...

			ELLEN
	I love you!  Don't let a lie come 
	between us!  Look at this!

...and slashes the pipe at him.

The metal penetrates the figure's "body" and destroys the 
illusion:  The facade of the little boy dissipates into mud.
For a second, Ellen believes to have seen the hideous figure of 
a swamp corpse, but the creature instantly melts into the muddy 
water covering the cellar floor.

At this very instant, a loud roll of thunder echoes throughout 
the house.

Martin abruptly loses all of his strength.  More and more 
liquid begins to flow out of his eyes.  The strands of mud 
slither down his body like countless snakes and vanish into the 
swamp water. 

The house begins to quake.  More and more mud seeps in through 
the cracks.  The cellar slowly floods.  The walls quiver.

Ellen runs to the door:  It is shut tight - there is no way 
out.

The moor is rising.  Ellen grabs Martin, who is still 
unconscious and about to drown.  She tries to wake him up.

			ELLEN
	Martin!  We have to get out of 
	here!

There is a sudden noise.  Ellen jumps.

Something has started to move in the back corner of the cellar:  
A dark something arcs out of the water for a short moment.  It 
isn't over, yet!

			ELLEN
	My God...

She vigorously tries to wake Martin, but he does not react.

The "thing" is coming closer.  It languidly rolls forward.  
Its shape remains hidden underneath the water's surface.

Ellen feverishly searches for a way out.  She notices the small 
cellar hatch.

The house quakes more violently; dust flakes down from the 
ceiling.  Ellen realizes that the entire house is slowly 
sinking into the ground.  And at the same time, the moor is 
rising dangerously high.

She grabs Martin by the shoulders.  With all of her strength, 
she somehow manages to pull him up onto a pile of crates below 
the cellar hatch.

The black thing is coming closer.  It rises up out of the moor.

Ellen tries to heave Martin outside through the hatch - but she 
is not strong enough.  Still, she puts up a desperate fight 
against the odds.

The already small opening of the hatch is growing smaller and 
smaller:  The tremendous foundations of the house are sinking 
deeper and deeper into the ground.

Suddenly, a hand reaches in through the hatch and grabs a hold 
of Martin.

Ellen starts.  She looks outside.  It's Lindner!

			LINDNER
	Hurry, we don't have much time!  
	Lift him up higher!

Ellen pushes Martin a little bit higher.  Behind her, an 
amorphous, black mass is rising up out of the swamp water.  
Numerous strands of mud branch out of it and begin to grope for 
Ellen.

One of the "tentacles" wraps itself around Ellen's foot.

Ellen notices it, but can't do anything about it.

With one strong jerk, Lindner tugs Martin out of the cellar.

At the same time, Ellen loses hold on the crate.  She is torn 
downward and disappears under water.

Lindner sticks his head in through the hatch.

			LINDNER
		(shouts)
	Ellen!

A brief moment of hesitation - then the old policeman 
determinedly climbs down into the cellar.  By now, the moor has 
risen almost to his waist.

Lindner wades through the thick liquid.  The surface is smooth 
- no sign of Ellen.

Then, she suddenly dives back up, gasping for air.

Lindner immediately grabs her arm and helps her toward the 
hatch.

			ELLEN
	It's right behind me.

Lindner keeps calm.

			LINDNER
	Don't worry.  It only has power 
	over us if we run away.

He helps Ellen up onto the crates.  Carefully, she climbs out 
through the hatch.  She hears Tommi's voice behind her.

			THOMAS
	Mommy...

She is tempted to look back.  But Lindner stops her from doing 
it.

			LINDNER
	No.  Don't look back.

			THOMAS
	Mommy...

The hatch, the last possible exit into freedom, is slowly 
shrinking to a narrow slit.

Ellen reaches out her hand to Lindner.

			ELLEN
	Come!  Quick!

Lindner climbs onto the crates.  

Again, the house quakes.  Single bricks break out of the walls 
and ceiling.

Ellen's curiosity wins over reason.  She takes a last look into 
the cellar.

There - in the dark back corner of the cellar - she sees 
shriveled figures with hollow eyes, watching the two of them in 
silence.  Swamp corpses.

Lindner notices her horror, but still remains calm.  He starts 
to climb out through the window hatch.

117.	IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXT. / NIGHT

Once Lindner is safely outside, Ellen immediately rushes over 
to Martin.  

			ELLEN
	Martin!

Martin seems to be regaining conscience.  He opens his eyes.  

Ellen wants to say something, but the thunder in the background 
suddenly swells up to an infernal noise.

Walls collapse, bricks and rubble crash down - the entire house 
is swallowed by the depths of the moor.

The three watch with open-mouthed horror.

Then, silence.

Ellen leans over to her husband.

Martin is still totally worn out.  He moans.

			MARTIN
	Smog...

Ellen musters him, confused.

			ELLEN
	What?

			MARTIN
	I have a yearning for... smog, 
	cars and many, many people...
	A real dirty... big city.  
	What do you think?

Ellen gently strokes his cheek.

			ELLEN
	You're back.

Martin's eyes are still glued to the spot where the house used 
to be.  He is still a bit disoriented.

			MARTIN
	How did you get me out of there?

			ELLEN
	I wouldn't have made it by myself.

She looks at Lindner.

			LINDNER
	You were right:  You can never run 
	away from the past.  Especially if 
	it scares you.

Ellen nods her head.
Then, she turns back to Martin.  They look at each other for a 
long moment.  Then, she puts her arms around him and kisses 
him.  It's all over now.

There's something else Ellen wants to say to Lindner.  But when 
she turns around, she finds that he's already walked a bit 
away:  He is going to his car.

			ELLEN
	Mr. Lindner!

The old policeman stops by his car.

			ELLEN
	Thank you.

Lindner smiles.  Then, he steps into his car and drives away.

Ellen helps Martin to his feet.

			ELLEN
	Can you walk?

Martin is in pain, but brave.

			MARTIN
	No problem.

He takes a step, but then he flinches with pain.  The movement 
hurt.

			MARTIN
	For God's sake, what happened to 
	me?

			ELLEN
	You don't remember?

Martin shakes his head.

			ELLEN
	It's a long story.

Arm in arm, the two of them stagger to their car which is 
parked next to the entrance gate, the last remnant of the 
house.

They get into the car and drive off.

The car slowly vanishes in the distance, leaving behind the 
vast, swampy landscape where there was once a house.

FADE TO:

118.	APARTMENT HOUSE IN THE CITY - EXT. / DAY

A beautiful old building, located by a park in the city.  Ellen 
and Martin live in the penthouse.

Text chart: "1 year later"

119.	APARTMENT - INT. / DAY

Ellen is standing by the window, looking over the small city 
park.  She looks happy.
Martin joins her at the window and hugs her.

			MARTIN
	What a sight:  A few trees, a 
	couple of ducks in the pond.  
	That's all the nature I need.

Ellen laughs.  They are about to kiss, when suddenly the 
doorbell RINGS.

			ELLEN
	Are you expecting company?

Martin shrugs his shoulders and walks to the door.  He opens it 
to Paul and Claudia.

			PAUL AND CLAUDIA
	Surprise!

Paul is carrying a package under his arm.  He walks straight 
past Martin, to Ellen.  Martin and Claudia follow him.

			PAUL
	This baby is a dream come true, 
	I tell ya!  The third edition 
	within one year!

			ELLEN
	Wow! - Considering how it all came 
	about...

Paul tears open the box.  It contains several copies of "You 
have 7 Days to Live".  Above the title, it reads: Ellen and 
Martin Straub!

			PAUL
	You two are one hell of a team!  
	And as far as I'm concerned:  In 
	case you plan on moving back to the 
	countryside, I'll be glad to lend a 
	hand.

Martin and Ellen trade looks.

			MARTIN
	Have you already told him about our 
	idea for the new novel? 

Paul can't wait to find out.

			PAUL
	Yeah?  What's it about?

Ellen grins ambiguously.

			ELLEN
	It's about this publisher who 
	constantly gets on his authors' 
	nerves.

Martin plays the ball back to her.

			MARTIN
	...until one day, he goes too far 
	and the two of them get really 
	mad...

120.	APARTMENT HOUSE IN THE CITY - EXT. / DAY

We see the four of them standing behind the large window of 
Ellen and Martin's apartment.  The camera pans farther and 
farther away from them, over the park.

They keep the joke running:

			ELLEN
	...and we mean: really mad!

The voices slowly fade with the camera's growing distance.

			PAUL
	Okay, okay, I get the message!  
	I was only trying to make a 
	suggestion, you know.

The camera travels further away... over the big city and it's 
ever-busy activities.
