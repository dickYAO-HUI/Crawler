CUT TO INT.SCHOOL FRENCH CLASS – MORNINGClass
3A are in the midst of a French lesson. All the class have
name cards hanging around their necks denoting their chosen
"French name." MISS WALLERgestures at a
screed of subjugated verbs scrawled on the blackboard.


MISS WALLER: The imperfect subjunctive, like the
imperfect indicative, indicates action in the past. "II
voulait qu'elle lui donnat de l'argent." Translate,
somebody .. . quickly!

A SCHOOLGIRL – LAURA – blurts out from the
front of the class.


LAURA "He wanted her to give him some
money."

MISS WALLER (Angry) Put your hand up! I will not have
girls talking out of turn in my class!


The door opens and Miss Stewart brings Juliet into the
room.The presence of the headmistress causes the class
to stand up.


MISS STEWART Good morning, gels.

CLASS (In Unison) Good morning, Miss Stewart.


The class sit.


MISS STEWART Miss Waller... class... this is
Juliet Hulme. Juliet is joining us from St. Margaret's, and
prior to that she spent some time at Queenswood in
theHawkes Bay.


Juliet looks at Miss Stewart haughtily.


JULIET: I am actually from England, Miss
Stewart.

MISS STEWART :Of course... Juliet's father is Dr.
Hulme, the Rector of the University.


Miss Waller looks impressed. Pauline is quietly drawing
horses at the back of the class.


MISS STEWART :Juliet's travelled all over the world,
and I'm sure she’ll be very eager to share her
impressions of exotic lands across the seas with the gels of
3A. I'llleave you to it, Miss Waller. Juliet.


Miss Stewart leaves. Miss Waller smiles at Juliet.


MISS WALLER: You can sit over here, Juliet.


Miss Waller gestures to a desk at the front. She gives
Juliet a cardboard name card.


MISS WALLER We use French names in this class. You
can choose your own.


Miss Waller returns to the blackboard and starts
writing.


MISS WALLER Now, irregular verbs in the present
subjunctive. . . "qu'il vienne". . .

JULIET Excuse me, Miss Waller... you've made a
mistake.


Miss Waller turns to Juliet—who now has the name
"Antoinette" hanging around her neck.


JULIET "Je doutais qu'il vienne" is in fact
the spoken subjunctive.

MISS WALLER It is customary to stand when addressing
a teacher... "Antoinette."


Juliet stands.


JULIET You should have written "vint."


Miss Waller frowns, glances at the board, and hastily rubs
out the offending word.


MISS WALLER (Embarrassed mumble) Oh! I must have
copied it incorrectly from my notes.


Juliet stands again.


JULIET You don't have to apologise, Miss Waller. I
found it frightfully difficult myself... until I got the
hang of it.


Miss Waller turns to Juliet, her face clouded with anger.
The class looks terrified.


MISS WALLER (Icily) Thank you, Juliet. Open your
text-book to page 17.


Pauline is smirking.


CUT TO:INT. SCHOOL ART CLASS – DAY
The teacher, MRS. COLLINS, comes in, carrying a pile of
paper and a box of paints. She starts to distribute them
around the tables.


MRS. COLLINS: Right, I thought we'd do some life
drawing today. Pair off into twos and decide who wants to
model and who wants to draw.


The girls around Juliet turn to each other, seemingly eager
not to be partnered with her. They pair off and Juliet is
left alone.


MRS. COLLINS: Oh, Juliet. . . you haven't got a
partner.

JULIET That s all right, Mrs. Collins. I'm sure I can
manage without one.


Mrs. Collins scans the class.


MRS. COLLINS: Pauline... are you with anybody?


Pauline shakes her head.


MRS. COLLINS; Good! You can come here and pair up
with Juliet.


Pauline reluctantly comes up to Juliet’s table.


SERIES of SHOTS showing VARIOUS GIRLS sketching their
partners. Most of the posing girls are seated in contrived
positions with rigid grins on their faces. Mrs.Collins
patrols the class, commenting to different girls.


MRS. COLLINS: You might want to change the
colour— make it a bit darker... that's very nice,
Joan.


PULL BACK. . . to reveal Pauline's "pose"...
slumped in the chair, arms crossed, a sullen look on her
face. She stares intently at Juliet, who is drawing
furiously...but doesn't refer to Pauline at
all.


MRS. COLLINS: Good heavens, Juliet! What on earth is
this???


Mrs. Collins picks up Juliet's drawing. It features an
armoured knight on horseback, fighting a dragon.


JULIET St. George and the Dragon.


Mrs. Collins studies the detail in the drawing.


MRS. COLLINS Where's Pauline?

JULIET Oh, I haven't gotten around to drawing her
yet. I was going to pop her on a rock, but I seem to have
run out room.


Juliet glances at Pauline.


JULIET Sorry! I don't know if you've noticed, Mrs.
Collin but I've actually drawn St. George in the likeness of
world's greatest tenor—Mario Lanza!

MRS. COLLINS Yes, I know it's very clever, Juliet,
but when I set you a topic, I expect you to follow it. Now
put that down and start again!


Mrs. Collins moves on. Juliet looks up at Pauline rather
grumpily. Pauline leans forward, an intense look on her face
. . .


PAULINE (Whispers) I think your drawing's
fantastic!

and puts his hand on her bum.

HERBERT Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh,
Nora?


Honora playfully shoves his hand away.


HONORA I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not
keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.


Herbert sighs as Honora puts the frying pan on the
stove.Young student boarder, STEVE BAYLISS, appears in
doorway, nervously clutching a record.


STEVE Excuse me... would you mind if I put my
long-playing record on?

HERBERT You're partial to a nice bit of mackerel,
aren't you, Steve?

STEVE Well... actually, I'm not much of a fish
man, Mr. Rieper.


Honora glances at his album.


HONORA You have been splashing out!

STEVE Oh!... I've got my board money . .

Steve starts fishing in his pockets.At this moment . .
. Pauline comes into the kitchen, through back door. She
strides past Honora, Herbert and Steve.

PAULINE (annoyed) He's Italian, Dad! The world's
greatest tenor!


Mario Lanza starts singing... Herbert comes into the

Pauline and Juliet are sidelined on a bench. Pauline is
writing in a textbook. She notices Juliet glancing at her
leg. Juliet moves closer.


JULIET Can I have another look?


Pauline purses her lips and quickly pushes her left stocking
down... She has a large ugly scar running up her left
shin, from ankle to knee.


JULIET That's so impressive!


Pauline does not look convinced.

Lanza album out of her bicycle bag.Pauline is about to
approach the house when she glances across the garden, and
is transfixed by an enchanting sight:Juliet on a sunlit
bridge that spans the Ilam stream. She is wearing a shredded
chiffon dress, with a Christmas tinsel crown and a necklace
made from tinfoil. Sunlight filters through the trees,
lending Juliet a magical quality. She's casting flowers onto
the water. Pauline stands transfixed. Juliet sees her and
smiles.

JULIET Hi, Paul!


SUDDENLY!... an 8-year-old boy – JONATHON HULME
– comes charging out of the bushes and lays into Juliet
with a wooden sword. He is dressed in a
"prince's"costume.

JULIET 0www!


Jonathon runs away. Juliet gives chase, yelling to
Pauline.

JULIET The evil Prince Runnymeade is escaping! Get
him, Paul!

Jonathon. They pause in a clearing, catching their breath.


JULIET The blighter's gone to ground!

sprawling. He whacks her on the bottom with his wooden
sword.


JULIET God! Jonty! Jonty—stop it! Go away! We're

away.Juliet offers her hand and pulls Pauline up. She
pauses, a look of shock on her face...The Mario

JULIET Of course it matters! It's Mario!


I NT. ILAM/LOUNGE – DAYCLOSE ON... HENRY

HENRY What on earth are these?


HILDA HULME, elegant, 36 years old, is setting down a tray
of tea on a small table.


HILDA They're egg and salmon sandwiches... I gave
them to you several days ago.

HENRY I thought I could smell sulphur.

HILDA God, Henry! You're hopeless! You can't be
trusted with something as simple as lunch.

JULIET (O.S.) Mother!

Hilda looks up as Juliet bursts into the room from the
garden, followed by Pauline. Hilda smiles at Pauline.


HILDA Hello... 

JULIET Jonty broke Paul's record!

HILDA Oh, dear!

JULIET We must buy her another one!

Juliet drops to the floor, hauling records out of the
radiogram cabinet.Pauline looks around, taking in the
sumptuousness of her surroundings: ornate fireplace,
paintings, antique furniture.

HILDA Would you like a cup of tea...
Paul?

PAULINE No, thank you.

HILDA Well, Juliet's told us all about you. I hear
you're fond of opera.

Before Pauline can reply, Juliet fans Mario Lanza albums
across the floor.

JULIET Which one shall we play?

Pauline shrugs awkwardly. Henry looks up from his papers,
rather annoyed at this intrusion. Pauline notices a row of
beautifully sculpted Plasticine horsesadorning the
mantelpiece.Juliet puts a record on the turntable.


HILDA Juliet... your father's trying to
study.

JULIET Daddy can study while we're playing
records!

HENRY Why don't you go back outside, mmm? I'll be
finished soon.

Donkey Serenade" booms into the room.SWIRLING

up into treetops and blue sky. Juliet's face looms over,
looking concerned.

JULIET (Worried) Paul? Oh, God! Paul... are you
all right?

Pauline’s eyes are shut. She speaks with great
effort.


PAULINE (Gasping) I think I'm dying...

JULIET (Upset) Don't... please! Please, don't!


Dying breath escapes from Pauline's mouth... she goes
limp.

Juliet shrieks!

JULIET (Crying) Paul!!!

Juliet collapses over Pauline’s body, crying.
Pauline’s eyes flick open! She sniffs and pulls a
face.

PAULINE Urrrgh! You've been eating onions.


Before Juliet has time to react, Pauline pushes her off,
giggling maniacally. She leaps to her feet and attempts to
run. Juliet grabs Pauline’s cardigan, pulling her
backwards.

JULIET You toad!

Pauline sheds the cardigan and runs through the bushes,
with Juliet in hot pursuit!RRRRIP!... Juliet
tugs at Pauline’s blouse and the buttons pop off.
Pauline is laughing too hard to run anymore. She pulls off
her skirt and waves it around herhead as she dances
around the bushes, singing "The Donkey
Serenade."

PAULINE (Singing) "There's a light in her eye,
Though she may try to hide it, She cannot deny, There's a

and flee back into the bushes.ON THE SOUNDTRACK...

JULIET Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!


Pauline reacts with a degree of shock.

PAULINE But, we're all going to Heaven!


JULIET I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's
like Heaven, only better because there aren't any
Christians.

Pauline giggles.

JULIET It's an absolute Paradise of music, art and
enjoyment.

Pauline is entranced. Juliet plucks up some photos.

JULIET Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? Herbert
shakes his head.

HERBERT I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.


Muffled voices from the hallway.

PAULINE He's the manager!

Honora leads a young man—JOHN—into the dining
room.

HONORA (O.S.) This is the dining room...


She smiles at Juliet.

HONORA Do excuse us.

She leads John into the hallway.

HONORA (O.S.) Breakfast is between seven and nine . .
. the bedroom's small, but it's very clean and
comfortable.

Pauline scowls.

HERBERT This story of yours—maybe the school
newspaper will print it when it's finished.

JULIET Actually, Mr. Rieper... it's a novel, and
we’ll be sending it to New York. That's where all the
big publishing houses are based.

HERBERT (Laughs) Is that a fact! You'd better put me
name down for an advance copy!

Herbert chuckles. Pauline and Juliet look at each with
knowing smiles.

PAULINE (Diary V.O.) We have decided how sad it is
for other people that they cannot appreciate our genius .




CUT TO:EXT. COUNTRY ROAD – DAYTRACKING ALONG
. . . past trees – with sunlight streaming through the
branches.Pauline's V.O. continues...


PAULINE (Diary V.O.)... but we hope the book will
help them to do so a little, though no one could fully
appreciate us.

The Hulmes' car is driving along a narrow, winding road on
the way to Port Levy.

EXT. WHARF – DAYSUPER: "Port Levy, Easter
1953"Juliet, in her swimming costume, runs to the
end of the jetty and teeters nervously on the edge. Pauline
fearlessly barrels past her and jumps in.SERIES of

his face; Henry paddling with trousers and rolled up; Hilda
on deck chair.

the window.

PAULINE Deborah awaits his return in their private
boudoir at the very top of the tower.

TRACKING from sand castle courtyard, up steps into

JULIET He smells her scent from 50 paces and urges his steed
onward!

CAMERA rushes into... tower bedroom... PANS from
Pauline's to Juliet's face, peering in through windows.


PAULINE He flings open the door and launches himself
at the bed, ravishing her!

JULIET God, yes!

Juliet starts to giggle at a private thought.


JULIET (Giggling) I bet she gets up the duff on their
first night together!

Pauline guffaws with delight. Jonathon is sitting nearby,
digging a hole in the sand.


JONATHON What's "up the duff"?

JULIET Something you wouldn't understand.


Jonathon launches himself at Juliet, and they roll on the
sand, grappling.

JONATHON Tell me! I'm almost 10!

JULIET You're eight and a half and incredibly
stupid!

Pauline is laughing happily.


EXT. COTTAGE – DAYHilda sits on a deck chair in

HILDA What a splendid idea!

JULIET We're calling him Diello.

HILDA That's a good, dramatic name!

JULIET Paul thought it up.

Pauline beams.

HILDA Aren't you clever! There, all done.


Pauline stands. Juliet touches Pauline’s hair. Hilda
laughs.Henry is rifling through his briefcase.


HENRY Hilda! I can't find that letter from the High
Commission. They want our passport numbers.

JULIET (Surprised) Are you going abroad, Daddy?


Hilda scowls at Henry.

HILDA Your father's attending a university conference
in England, darling.

HENRY We'll only be away for a few weeks.


Juliet looks at Hilda, a trace of panic across her face.


JULIET (Worried) You're not going, are you,
Mummy?


Hilda hesitates.

HILDA Well... I thought I might. It's a long time
for your father and I to be apart.

JULIET But I should go, too!

HILDA Darling, you've got school. You've only just
settled in.

JULIET But—

Hilda suddenly stands.

HILDA Who's coming to the shops? I need some
cigarettes.

Jonathon barrels out of the cottage.

JONATHON Me! I'm coming.

HILDA (O.S.) Put on your shoes, Jonathon!


CAMERA MOVES IN... to Juliet's distraught face.


EXT. PORT LEVY HILLSIDE – EARLY EVENINGClouds
swirling about the sky.A grassy hillside overlooking
Port Levy bay. An island sits in the bay, bathed in the last
rays of sunlight.Juliet is a tiny figure against the
vast landscape. She runs blindly toward the edge of the
hill.Pauline appears over the brow... the hillside
is empty! She panics, running, calling out.


PAULINE (Worried) Julie! Julie!


Pauline finds Juliet curled up in a little ball. She is
motionless. Pauline gently takes Juliet in her arms. Juliet
is breathing heavily... she squeezes her eyes
shut,concentrating hard—a look of desperation on
her face.

JULIET Look, Paul!

Pauline looks about, but can see nothing but a scrubby
hillside. She looks mystified.


PAULINE What?

JULIET It's so beautiful!

PAULINE What???

Golden light streams on Pauline and Juliet. Pauline look up
as the clouds above them open. Juliet stands as if in
trance. She offers her hand to Pauline.


JULIET Come with me.


Juliet pulls Pauline up and hugs her as they walk forward.
The barren landscape around Pauline and Juliet morphs into a
beautiful garden... the Fourth World!


EXT. FOURTH WORLD – DAYPauline and Juliet are
amazed!... They stand, holding each other's hand tightly.
The world around them take on a new form.The grass
beneath their feet has become a well-kept lawn. They are
surrounded by fountains and waterfalls. Unicorns graze on
the hillside... gigantic butterflieshover in the
air.Pauline and Juliet walk about in wonderment.


PAULINE (Diary V.O.) Today Juliet and I discovered
the key to the Fourth World. We have had it in our
possession for about six months, but we only realised it
onthe day of the Death of Christ. We saw a gateway
through the clouds. Everything was full of peace and bliss.
We then realised we had the key...


CUT TO:INT. HULMES' CAR/COUNTRYSIDE – DAYAs
Pauline's V.O. continues... CAMERA TRACKS IN SLOWLY, past
Henry and Hilda, to a SHOT of Pauline and Juliet sitting
quietly, staring ahead, blissfully.


PAULINE (Diary V0.) We have an extra part of our
brain which can appreciate the Fourth World. Only about 10
people have it. On two days every year we may use 
the key and look into that beautiful world which we have
been lucky enough to be allowed to know of...


EXT. COUNTRYSIDE – DAYWIDE SHOT... the
Hulmes' car, a small speck at the BOTTOM OF FRAME, winding

PULL OUT... to reveal Juliet lying on her bed, in
childbirth pose. Her pregnant stomach is pushing at the
seams of her school dress.Juliet wails... Pauline
pulls out a pillow from between Juliet's legs, her face a
mixture of surprise and elation.

PAULINE It's a boy! Deborah... we've got a son and
heir!

Pauline hands Juliet the pillow. She cradles it in her
arms.

fending off her husband, who tries his way with her morning,
noon and night...

The class titters... they clearly want to Iaugh Stevens's
glare deters them.Pauline sits at the back,
smirking.

MRS. STEVENS (Icy) Thank you, Juliet!

JULIET... However, the Queen's biggest problem is
her renegade child, Diello. He has proven to be an
uncontrollable little brighter, who slaughters his
nannieswhenever the fancy takes him...

MRS. STEVENS That's enough, Juliet!

Juliet stops and stands quietly. Mrs. Stevens rips the essay
out of her hand and waves it under her nose. 


MRS. STEVENS I suppose this is your idea of a
joke?

JULIET No, Mrs. Stevens.

MRS. STEVENS I suppose you think it's witty and
clever to mock the Royal Family... to poke fun a the
Empire, with this... rubbish!

Pauline leaps to her feet.

PAULINE It's not rubbish!

MRS. STEVENS Sit down, Pauline!

JULIET I really don't understand why you are upset,
Mrs. Steven. I merely wrote an essay on the Royal Family as
requested.

Pauline points at the blackboard.

PAULINE It doesn't say it has to be the
Windsors!

MRS. STEVENS (Yelling) Sit down!

Pauline sits down, looking victorious.

MRS. STEVENS (To Juliet) A girl like you should be
setting an example! To your seat!

Juliet starts coughing. Mrs. Stevens’s face
darkens.

MRS. STEVENS Stop it, Juliet!

Juliet continues coughing. She sits heavily. Pauline snorts,
trying not to laugh.Juliet slumps over her desk,
coughing... globules of blood splatter her exercise
book.Pauline’s smile vanishes.

and toast.

HONORA Come on, sit up.

PAULINE I'm not hungry.

HONORA You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched
our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.

PAULINE I just want to be on my own for a while.


Honora starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to
Pauline.

HONORA You may have forgotten that you were once a
very sick little girl, but I haven't!


Honora holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes
it.

PAULINE Do you think Juliet could stay here while her
parents are away?

HONORA Juliet's infectious... she'll be going to
hospital.

PAULINE But she'll have no one to look after

Juliet tearfully shakes her head. Henry is standing at the
foot of the bed, hands behind his back.

HENRY I'm sure you'll like it here... it's very
tranquil.

HILDA I've spoken to the Matron, and she promises to
take special care of you.

HENRY And you can carry on with your studies while

hand?

Pauline remains silent.

HONORA You used to love making things with Dad,
Yvonne.

that Juliet and I should write to each other as Charles and
Deborah.


INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S SLEEPOUT –

writing a letter.


PAULINE (Diary V.O.) I wrote a six-page letter as

PAULINE (Diary V.O.) She has entered into the spirit
of the thing greatly!

As we listen to Juliet's V.O., we see SCENES of TB hospital
life... the meals brought around... the dayroom...
the DOCTORS.


JULIET (Letter V.O.) My dear Charles, I miss you and
adore you in equal amounts and long for the day we will be
reunited, but as I languish here, in this house
ofdisease and decrepitude, my mind turns—with
increasing frequency— to the problem of our son...

PAULINE (Letter V.O.) I have to report that the lower
classes are terrifically dull.

Pauline is sitting in the lounge, looking very boring during
a game of Lexicon with Herbert, John and a ROSS. Pauline is
waiting for her turn, unaware that John is studying her from

to execute several peasants just to alleviate the boredom .

onthe right path.

REVEREND NORRIS Hello again...

Juliet peers up at a DOG-COLLARED VICAR. She eyes him
coldly.

REVEREND NORRIS How are you getting along? It must be
awfully hard being away from your school chums...
I’ve got something here you might just like to
havea look at.

He hands Juliet a leaflet featuring a thin, withered figure
in a great deal of pain. "JESUS LOVES YOU" is
printed across the top.Juliet’s face hardens.


REVEREND NORRIS Unfortunately, modern medicine can
only go so far in combatting an illness like TB. And
that’s why I'm here... because with the power
ofGod, miracles can happen. The Lord has said that
those who have faith will be saved! Reach out, Juliet! Reach
out for Jesus!

During Reverend Norris's speech... CAMERA closes in to
BIG CLOSE-UP of Juliet's face. Reverend Norris's voice fades
away. . .SUDDENLY!!!A silhouetted figure rises up
behind Reverend Norris... a lumpy hand closes around his
throat!

to Juliet, who is seated by a window, knitting. They hug
tightly.


JULIET I'm so happy to see you!

Honora hurries over.

HONORA It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still
not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some
fruit.

JULIET Thank you so much!

Juliet sits back in her chair. She holds Pauline's hand.
Honora admires Juliet’s knitting—a red
cardigan.


HONORA That's coming along well!

JULIET (Pleased) I'm the Matron's favourite patient
and she's shown me her special stitch!

INT.JULIET'S ROOM – DAYHonora is looking at some
mail on a small table. Pauline is sitting at Juliet's
bedside.

HONORA Goodness me! What a lot of letters. Are your
parents enjoying their trip? Oh... there's a couple of
unopened ones, dear.


JULIET (Sarcastically) I'm saving them for a rainy
day.

Honora gives her a sympathetic look.

HONORA I know it's hard for you being in here, but it
is for the good of your health.

JULIET (Bitterly) They sent me off to the Bahamas
"for the good of my health." They sent me to the
Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my
health."

Honora looks startled at the outburst.

JULIET I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite
fatigued.

HONORA We don't want to tire you out, dear.


Honora stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and
Juliet grabs her hand.

JULIET Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?

Pauline hugs Juliet and reluctantly takes her leave.


CUT TO:INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S SLEEPOUT –
EVENINGCLOSE-UP... Plasticine figure of Nicholas.
John's hand comes into SHOT and picks the model up. Pauline
looks on anxiously... the face of Nicholas bears
morethan a passing resemblance to John, but he doesn't
seem to notice.

JOHN This is quite something... you're damn
clever.

Pauline beams.

JOHN So... Deborah is married to Charles, and this
chap Nicholas... is her tennis instructor?

PAULINE Yes, but there's nothing between them.
Deborah would never go for a commoner. Nicholas has got his
eye on Gina, an amazingly beautiful gypsy.

She gestures to a Plasticine GINA figure that is sitting or
the shelf.

JOHN Looks like you, Yvonne.

Pauline beams.

PAULINE Juliet made it!


John smiles.

JOHN This is really quite incredible. l bet you girls
know the entire royal lineage for the last five
centuries.

PAULINE Oh, yes! It's all worked out!

family of beautifully sculpted Plasticine figures. Pauline
self-consciously returns to her sculpting, aware
that John is watching her keenly.

JULIET What??

PAULINE John has fallen in love with me!

JULIET That idiot boarder?

Pauline beams.

JULIET How do you know? Did he tell you?


PAULINE Well... no. But it's so obvious.


Pauline giggles. Juliet turns away.

JULIET (Sullen) Is that why you haven't replied to my
last letter?

Pauline’s smile disappears.

stupid boy!

book?

PAULINE (Whispers) Shut the door.John
tiptoes across to the bookshelf He pulls a book out...
"Girls' Own Annual 1951."

JOHN This looks interesting.

Pauline gives him a dubious look from her bed.John
stands shivering, flicking through the annual.


JOHN These knitting patterns look damn complicated.
Have you tried the tea cosy?

Pauline shakes her head and looks on as John continues to
thumb awkwardly through the book, his shivers
increasing.He glances at Pauline nervously.


JOHN It's damn cold, isn't it? Do you think I could
hop into bed for a moment... just to warm up? My feet are
like iceblocks.

PAULINE You should have worn your
slippers.

JOHN Come on, Yvonne, I'll catch me death!

LAURIE Coming to Lancaster Park on Saturday, Mr.
Rieper?

Herbert shakes his head, sullenly.Wendy hurries into
the room, grabs a piece of toast, pulling on a coat.


WENDY Where's John? He said he'd walk with me.


Honora stands in the doorway.

HONORA John's no longer staying here.


Wendy looks surprised.

PAULINE (Diary V.O.) I had a nasty foreboding feeling
at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for
an ordinary lecture.

HONORA (Angry) From now on, you're sleeping in the
house, where we can keep an eye on you.


Pauline bangs a dish into the rack.

HONORA (Angry) If you think for one minute that your
father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've
got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're
achild! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne?
You know what can happen with boys... Don't you have any
self-respect?

Honora sighs.

PAULINE Can I go now?

HONORA You think you're such a clever little madam!
You had your father in tears last night!

Pauline flinches.

HONORA My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me,
you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little
tart!

PAULINE Well, I guess I take after you then!


Honora whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.


PAULINE You ran off with Dad when you were only 17!

DAYPauline finds herself pulled into the arms of a
fierce-looking PLASTICINE KNIGHT.

PAULINE (Breathless) Diello!

DIELLO (Orson Welles voice) Careful, Gina. . . we
almost lost you!

Diello suddenly steps back, draws his sword and expertly
runs a passing PEASANT through.He sweeps his hat off
and bows at Pauline.

DIELLO (Orson Welles voice) For you, my lady!


Pauline beams. Her eye is again caught by Deborah’s
Plasticine figure across the crowd... her back is still
turned.

PAULINE Deborah!

Deborah slowly turns around... she has a human
face—Juliet!Tears of joy trickle down
Pauline’s cheeks.Juliet is laughing and smiling,
looking beautiful.Diello gently wipes Pauline’s
tears.

and lie on the bed.Pauline runs into the room. Juliet
stands and they embrace hugging each other tightly.
Henry enters the room and frowns at the sight of the girls
hugging. Juliet reaches out for Henry and pulls him into the
embrace. He looks decidedly ill at ease asPauline's
black hair nuzzles against his neck.


EXT. STREETS – DAYTRACKING BACK... as the

Henry’s steely gaze in the rearview mirror.The
poem continues over a visual montage:

tram as it crawls along slowly.John is running
alongside, waving and calling, trying to get Pauline's
attention. He is clearly pleading with her, but to no
avail.

JOHN Yvonne! Stop! I still love you!

PAULINE (Poem V.O.) Compared with these two, every
man is a fool,/The world is most honoured that they should
deign to rule,/And I worship the power of theselovely
two,/ With that adoring love known to so few...


Pauline looks knowingly at Juliet, then down to John,

toward the castle gates.In an alcove beside the gate,
the Plasticine figure of Diello is lurking in the shadows,
dagger in hand. Beside him is the rope winch that operates
the portcullis.Footsteps approach...Diello presses
himself back into the corner...Nicholas walks
briskly. As he nears the portcullis, he espies something
twinkling on the ground.LOW ANGLE... Nicholas stops,
looks down. Directly above him are the jagged teeth of the
portcullis.He reaches down... for a silver ring, set
with a small pink stone. It is lying on the ground, as if
dropped by somebody.SUDDENLY!Diello slashes the
rope with his dagger. Before Nicholas can react, the
portcullis crashes down on him. His Plasticine body is
crushed.Nicholas's twitching fingers release the
brooch. It falls to the ground and breaks. The pink stone
pops out of its setting, rolls down the path and comes to
rest byPauline's and Juliet's feet.Juliet picks

PAULINE (Poem V.O.) The wisdom that is hidden behind
those strange eyes.


INT. ILAM/)ULIET'S BEDROOM – NIGHTPOEM

each other's arms in bed.

PAULINE (Poem V.O.) And these wonderful people
are you and I.

FAST TRACK IN... to the bedroom door.Henry is
silently observing the two sleeping girls, his face
stoney.Sound of a distant thunderclap...


CUT TO:INT. RIEPERS'HOUSE/HALLWAY –
NIGHTHenry is standing on the Riepers' doorstep.
Lightning flashes light up his face like something out of a
gothic horror.


HENRY Mrs. Rieper... may I come in?


Honora is standing, holding the door open, looking rather
surprised at the unexpected visitor.

HONORA (Surprised) Yes, of course.


INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/LOUNGE – NIGHTHenry and Honora
are sitting in the lounge. Henry looking rather
uncomfortable on the edge of a shabby armchair. Herbert is
at a drinks cabinet unscrewing the topoff a
bottle.

HENRY Your daughter's... an imaginative and a
spirited girl—


HONORA If she's spending too much time at your house,
you only need to say. All those nights she spends
over—she’s assured us that you don't mind . .
.

HENRY It's rather more complicated than that. Since
Mrs. Hulme and I have returned home, Juliet has been
behaving in a rather disturbed manner...
surliness,short temper... general
irritability—most uncharacteristic.


Herbert is pouring a drink.

HERBERT Sure I can't tempt you to a nice sherry, Dr.
Hulme?

HENRY No, thank you. The thing is...


HONORA Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking
herself away in her room... endlessly writing.


Herbert sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in
hand.

HENRY My wife and I feel the friendship is...
unhealthy.

HERBERT No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time
inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get
fresh air or exercise!

Honora frowns at Henry.

HONORA (Concerned) I'm not sure what you mean, Dr.
Hulme.

Henry pauses for a moment.

HENRY Your daughter appears to have formed a rather .
. . unwholesome attachment to Juliet.

HONORA (Worried) What's she done???

HENRY She hasn't done anything... it's the intensity of
the friendship that concerns me. I think we should avert
trouble before it starts.

Henry hands a business card to Honora.


HENRY Dr. Bennett is a very good friend. He's a
general physician, but has some expertise in child
psychology. If Pauline is indeed developing in a rather . .
. er . .. wayward fashion, Dr. Bennett is the ideal
man to set her back on track.


CUT TO:INT. DR. BENNETT'S SURGERY – DAY
Pauline is slouched in a chair, looking very sullen.


DR. BENNETT (O.S.) What about your studies... are you
enjoying school?


DR. BENNETT is seated behind his desk. Pauline is silent.
She looks at the ceiling. Honora is sitting next to
Pauline.


DR. BENNETT Are you happy at home? Pauline is
silent.

HONORA Answer Dr. Bennett, Yvonne.

Pauline remains silent.


HONORA (Annoyed) Yvonne!

DR. BENNETT Mrs. Rieper... perhaps you wouldn't
mind waiting outside.

Honora leaves the room.

DR. BENNETT Do you like your mother?

Pauline hesitates for a moment.

PAULINE No.

DR. BENNETT And why is that?

PAULINE She nags me.

DR. BENNETT And that's why you like to stay with the
Hulmes?

Pauline looks wary. She doesn't answer.


DR. BENNETT Or is it because you want to be with
Juliet?

No answer.

DR. BENNETT Do you... like girls?

PAULINE No.

DR. BENNETT Why not?

PAULINE They're silly.

DR. BENNETT But Juliet's not silly?

PAULINE (Emphatic) No!

DR. BENNETT Yvonne... there's nothing wrong with
having a close friend, but sometimes things can get...
too friendly. Such associations can lead to trouble.
Itisn't good to have just one friend... my wife and
I have several friend and we enjoy seeing them on a regular
basis, and it's all perfectly healthy. Perhaps you
could think about spending time with...
boys—

Dr. Bennett stops in mid-sentence, a look of surprise face.
He looks down at his chest...A red bloodstain is
slowly spreading across his shirt. Dr. Bennett twitches
slightly as the blade of a sword work its way out of his
chest!Pauline’s face lights up as...Diello
rises up behind Dr. Bennett.

DIELLO (Orson Welles voice) Bloody fool!


CRASH CUT TO:INT. DR. BENNETT'S WAITING ROOM –
DAYThe surgery door opens and Pauline steps out,
looking elated.Honora looks up from her chair.Dr.
Bennett appears in the doorway behind Pauline. He casts a
wary glance in her direction.

DR. BENNETT Mrs. Rieper...

Honora bustles in, and Dr. Bennett closes the door. Pauline
sits down, folds her arms and stares blankly at a COUPLE OF
SICK PATIENTS.


INT. DR. BENNETT'S SURGERY – DAYCLOSE-UP . .
. Dr. Bennett's mouth.

DR. BENNETT Homosexuality...

Honora looks horrified.

DR. BENNETT I agree, Mrs. Rieper, it's not a pleasant
word. But let us not panic unduly. This condition is often a
passing phase with girls of Yvonne's age.

HONORA But she's always been such a normal, happy
child.

DR. BENNETT It can strike at any time, and adolescent
are particularly vulnerable.

HONORA But what about the vomiting? She's lost a lot
of weight...

Dr. Bennett shrugs.


DR. BENNETT Physically, I can find nothing wrong.
I’ve checked for TB and she's clear. I can only
attribute her weight loss to her mental
disorder.

HONORA (Shocked) Oh...

DR. BENNETT Look, Mrs. Rieper... try not to worry
too much. Yvonne's young and strong, and she's got a loving
family behind her. Chances are she'll grow out ofit.
If not... well, medical science is progressing in leaps
and bounds. There could be a breakthrough at any time!


INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/HALLWAY – NIGHTSLOW
TRACKING... down the hallway corridor. As the CAMERA

opens the paper. Wendy is attempting to t the fire. The
family are chatting to each other,but we do not hear
their conversation because.... . . we are listening
to Pauline's V.O.

PAULINE (Diary V.O.) Mother woke me this morning and
started lecturing me before I was properly awake, which I
thought was somewhat unfair. She has brought upthe
worst possible threat now. She said that if my health did
not prove I could never see the Hulmes again. The thought is
too dreadful. Life would be unbearable without
Deborah...


CAMERA CRANES UP... through the ceiling and into...


INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT. . .
Pauline's bedroom. The room is filled with the sad strains
of "E Lucevan le Stelle," an aria from Puccini's

portablerecord player.CAMERA CRANES UP past the
foot of the bed to reveal Pauline lying on her back, looking
very morose.TRACK IN TO her intense face as her V.O.
continues...

PAULINE (Diary V.O.) l wish I could die. This is not

two or three weeks that it would be the best thing
thatcould happen together, and the thought of death is
not fearsome.

Pauline shakes her head. She rips open a present... a new
diary.



INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT
CLOSE-UP of the Jan. 1st page. Pauline's pen starts to write

PAULINE (Diary V.O.) My New Year's resolution is a
far more selfish one than last year, so there is more
probability of my keeping it. It is to make my motto:
"Eat,drink and be merry, for tomorrow you may be
dead."

Pauline looks up from her diary as the CAMERA RUSHES IN

Pauline looks at her mother with distaste.

PAULINE My name is Gina!

HONORA It's a letter from the school... from Miss
Stewart.

PAULINE What does old Stew want?

HONORA She says the standard of your work is
slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School
Certificate.

PAULINE Who cares!

HONORA I care... your father cares... we want
you to have a good education.

PAULINE I'm educating myself!

HONORA You're failing English... you used to be
top of the class—

PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!

Honora snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.


HONORA These stories are not going to get you School
Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to
publish them?

PAULINE (Scornful) What do you know? You wouldn't
know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant
person I've ever met!

Honora is very angry.

HONORA You're rude... rude and insolent! I don't
see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a
minute longer.

PAULINE (Shouting) I don't wanna be in bloody
school!

HONORA (Shouting) All right! You go out there and get
a job and you damn well pay your own way!

Honora storms out of the room and slams the
door.

JULIET (O.S.) I know... I'll lean back and put my
hair on my shoulders—then I'll look just like Veronica
Lake!

Sound of a camera clicking.

PAULINE (O.S.) Stay still or they'll be blurry . .
. 

JULIET (O.S.) Hurry up! I'm freezing!

PAULINE (O.S.) Just a couple more...

between Henry and the two girls. The large lounge at Ilam is
dark and cold. The mood is bleak.

JULIET (Worried) Is Gina coming, too?

HENRY (Annoyed) Of course not!

JULIET (Angry) I'm not going to England without
Gina!

Hilda and Henry exchange an awkward glance.

HILDA You're not going to England, darling.

Juliet looks confused. 


HENRY I'm leaving you in South Africa with Auntie
Ina. 


Juliet starts to tremble.


HILDA That chest of yours isn't getting any better.
The warmer climate is just what you need...

HENRY For the good of your health. 


Juliet opens her mouth and screams.


CRASH CUT TO: INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S
BEDROOM – NIGHTPauline is crouched on her bed,
hugging her knees. She stares intensely ahead.


PAULINE (Intense) The Hulmes will look after me. They
want me to live with them!

HONORA Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter,
you belong here with us.

PAULINE I belong with Deborah! We're going to South
Africa!

HONORA You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years
old!!

PAULINE (Intense) You have to let me go! 


Honora stands and walks toward the door.

HONORA We'll talk about this when you've calmed
down.

Honora pauses at the door. Pauline is slowly rocking on
the bed, staring at the wall. CLOSE-UP...
Pauline's face as we hear her diary V.O.:


PAULINE (Diary V.O.) I felt thoroughly depressed and
even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life
seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy
way out.

HONORA Love, you can still write to each other.

Honora softly touches Pauline’s cheek. Pauline
winces, averting her face.MOVE IN... to EXTREME
CLOSE-UP of Pauline's eyes.

PAULINE (Diary V.O.) Anger against Mother boiled up
inside me as it is she who is one of the main obstacle in my
path. Suddenly a means of ridding myself of this 
obstacle occurred to me. If she were to die...

sitting amongst various dignitaries on the stage. 
PROFESSOR 1 is at the podium. 

PROFESSOR 1 I can not begin to attempt to measure the
inestimable value of Dr. Hulme's contributions to Canterbury
College, both social and official. We wishboth him and
Mrs. Hulme all the best for the future. 


On sound of large audience clapping:

be okay, Gina. Mr. Perry's promised to give me 50 pounds for
my horse...


INT. ILAM/HALLWAY – DAYJuliet is in the Ilam

INTERCUT WITH:INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/HALLWAY –

PAULINE (Upset) It's no bloody good... I went

I'm 20.

CUT between Pauline and Juliet...

JULIET But that's not true! I've got one.

PAULINE (Choked up) I need my sodding parents'
consent.

Tears well in Juliet’s eyes.

JULIET (Sobbing) Don’t cry, Gina...
We’re not going to be separated. They can't make us . .
. they can't!

Hilda quietly looms up behind Juliet. She gently takes
the phone out of Juliet’s hand and puts it back on the
receiver. Juliet struggles in Hilda’s arms, pushing
hermother away, screaming.Pauline stands
holding the dead phone.


HONORA Yvonne.

Pauline turns and faces her mother.

HONORA Please don't be like this, love.

Pauline gives Honora a cursory glance and walks past
her, up the stairs. Honora looks after her, a hurt
expression on her face. 

PAULINE (Diary V.O.) I did not tell Deborah of my
plans for removing Mother. I have made no decision yet as
the last fate I wish to meet is one in a borstal. I
amtrying to think of some way.


CUT TO:EXT. RIEPERS' BACK GARDEN – DAYTHWACK!

HERBERT What now?

HONORA She says Juliet's in a terrible state . .
.


CUT TOINT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/LOUNGE – DAYHonora
and Herbert are sitting with Hilda in the lounge.

HILDA She's uncontrollable. I've told her that
Pauline is not going to South Africa, but she refuses to
accept it.

Herbert and Honora exchange a glance.

HILDA I expect you've heard the same from your
own daughter.

Honora shakes her head.

HONORA (Upset) Yvonne hasn't spoken to me for
nearly two weeks.

HILDA Yes... well, it hasn't been an easy time for
any of us, Mrs. Rieper.

HERBERT She's cut us out of her life... it's been
causing her mother and I a lot of worry.

HILDA What I'm suggesting is that we let the girls
spend these last three weeks together. We'd like Pauline to
come and stay with Juliet, until she leaves.

HERBERT Is that a good idea?

Herbert looks at Honora... tears are running down
her cheeks. He stands and ushers Hilda toward the
door.

HERBERT Why don't I telephone you tonight, Mrs.
Hulme?

HILDA Yes, of course.

Herbert accompanies Hilda into the hallway. 
Honora breaks down into heavy sobs.

step, framed by the doorway, suitcase in hand. 
SUPER: "11th June 1954"Mario Lanza's

continues over the next few scenes. Pauline walks
into the empty hallway... SUDDENLY! Juliet

dressed in her mother's glittering ballgown. 
Juliet takes Pauline's hand, and together they sweep into .

INT. ILAM/LOUNGE – DAY... . . the
LOUNGE. Pauline's drab clothes transform into a
ballgown as she passes through the doorway. The

faces all around. Pauline gasps as Diello takes
her by the waist and waltzes around the room. Characters
from Borovnia fill the room. Juliet dances with
Charles. A man in a dark suit turns around...
MARIO! He launches into the second verse! Pauline
laughs happily as she is swept around and around.


PAULINE (Diary V.O.) We realised why Deborah and I
have such extraordinary telepathy and why people treat us
and look at us the way they do. It is because we are
MAD. We are both stark raving MAD!


They are no longer in the lounge – at some point the
waltz has dissolved into...


EXT. BOROVNIA CASTLE COURTYARD – NIGHT 
. . . the courtyard in Borovnia Castle. The
crowds continue dancing to "The Loveliest Night of the
Year." A doorway in the courtyard...

IN... to a distorted FISHEYE SHOT of Henry.

.

PAULINE (Diary V.O.) Dr. Hulme is MAD, as MAD as
a March hare!

At the conclusion of the song... TWO BURLY BOROVNIAN
EXECUTIONERS swing their axes down, chopping a couple of
ropes. A huge banner unfurls down the side of the
castle tower. In embroidered letters three stories tall is
the word... MAD!

light.BANG!... CLOSE ON... Juliet flinching.

ever seen It. Deborah had always told me how hideous he
was!

them.MUSIC SWELLS UP...Pauline comes down on
top of Juliet, kissing her on the lips... Pauline's hands
slipping Juliet's blouse off her shoulders.

And ours! We felt satisfied indeed. We have nowlearned
the peace of the thing called Bliss, the joy of the thing
called Sin.


INT. ILAM/BATHROOM – NIGHTBATHWATERPauline
and Juliet are soaking in opposite ends of a steaming
bathtub. A few moments silence. Juliet looks

was to moider mother.

REVERSE ANGLE... Pauline and Juliet walk toward the
house. Unicorns are grazing in the Ilam garden. Fairies
dance in the air. Large dragonflies hover around the
girls.


PAULINE (Diary V.O.) This notion is not a new one but
this time it is a definite plan which we intend to carry
out. We have worked it out carefully and are
boththrilled by the idea. Naturally we feel a trifle
nervous, but the pleasure of anticipation is great.


EXT. ILAM GROUNDS – NIGHTCLOSE-UP... James
Mason’s photo lands in a roaring fire and is
immediately consumed by the flames. Photos of Mel Ferrer,

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE – DAYHonora is bustling about
the house, working. Every time she bends down, or leans
over, Pauline is revealed behind her. She is helping, but
the mood is one of ahunter closing in on its
prey.


PAULINE (Diary V.O.) I rose late and helped Mother
vigorously this morning. Deborah rang and we decided to use
a rock in a stocking rather than a sandbag. We
discussed the moider fully. I feel very keyed up as though I
were planning a surprise party. Mother has fallen in with
everything beautifully and the happy event is totake
place tomorrow afternoon. So next time I write in this diary
Mother will be dead. How odd—yet how pleasing.

Pauline puts the brick in the stocking and ties a knot
in the foot.

A SERIES OF CARDS explains what happened
subsequently:


"In the hours following Honora's murder, a police
search of the Rieper house unearthed Pauline's dairies. This
resulted in her immediate arrest for the murder her
mother."

"Juliet was arrested and charged with murder the
following day."

"After Pauline's arrest it was discovered that Honor,
Herbert Rieper had never married. Pauline was therefore
charged under her mother's maiden name of
Parker."

"In August 1954, a plea of insanity was rejected by the
jury in the Christchurch Supreme Court trial and Pauline
Parker and Juliet Hulme were found guilty of 
murder."

"Too young for the death penalty, they were sent to
separate prisons to be 'Detained at Her Majesty's
Pleasure.’"

"Juliet was released in November 1959 and immediately
left New Zealand to join her mother
overseas."

"Pauline was released two weeks later, but remain New
Zealand on parole until 1965.""It was a
condition of their release that they never meet
again."
