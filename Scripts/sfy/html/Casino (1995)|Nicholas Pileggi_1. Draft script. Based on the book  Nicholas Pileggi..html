<font face=arial><b>1983</b>
<p><b>EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS, 1983 - DAY</b> <p>
SAM 'ACE' ROTHSTEIN, a tall, lean, immaculately dressed man approaches his car, opens
the door, and gets inside to turn on the ignition.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's
no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise,
what's the point? And, for a while . . . I believed that's the kind of love I had. <p>
(Suddenly, the car explodes. Flames, smoke and metal rise into the sky covering the
view of the Las Vegas casinos and their signs.<br>
Music in: J.S. Bach - 'St Matthew Passion'. <br>
Ace's body comes flying in - extreme slow motion. His body twists and turns through the
frame like a soul about to tumble into the flames of damnation.)<br>

</blockquote>

<p>MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE.<p>
<b>INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT</b> <p>
Vignette of ACE: through rippling flames, we move in on ACE ROTHSTEIN overseeing
the casino. He lights a cigarette.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) Before I ever ran a casino or got myself blown up, Ace
Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper, I can tell you that. I was so good, that whenever I
bet, I could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country. I'm serious. I had it
down so cold that I was given paradise on earth. I was given one of the biggest casinos in
Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers . . .
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT</b> <p>
Vignette of MOB BOSSES: sitting at a table surrounded by food and wine like the
gods of Olympus.

<blockquote>
<p><b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) . . . by the only kind of guys that can actually get
you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know
all the details. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) Matter of fact . . .
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>INT. BAR, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT</b> <p>
Vignette of NICKY SANTORO: standing at a bar with DOMINICK SANTORO, his
brother, and FRANK MARINO, his right-hand man.

<blockquote>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) . . . nobody knew all the details, but it should'a
been perfect. I mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend, watching his ass . . .
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT</b> <p>
Vignette of GINGER MCKENNA: a dazzling thirty-one-year-old blonde seated by a
small fiery pool.

<blockquote>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) . . . and he had Ginger, the woman he loved, on his
arm. But in the end . . .
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>INT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK/ACE'S OFFICE - NIGHT</b> <p>
ACE looks over the casino he rules.

<blockquote>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) . . . we fucked it all up. It should'a been so sweet,
too. But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us were ever given
anything that fuckin' valuable again.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT</b> <p>
Aerial shot coming down out of the clouds over the brightly lit Vegas Strip and off
into the blackness of the desert night.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) At that time, Vegas was a place where millions of
suckers flew in every year on their own nickel, and left behind about a billion dollars.
But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas . . .
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>EXT. DESERT - DAWN</b> <p>
Aerial shot swooping along the desert floor, then rising above the mist to reveal
mountains in the distance.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) But it's in the desert where lots of the town's
problems are solved. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems
are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole
already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about
a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in
that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all
fuckin' night.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP, 1973 - NIGHT</b> <p>
TITLE IN: 'THE STRIP', 'LAS VEGAS', 'TEN YEARS EARLIER' <p>
ACE is greeted by a casino exec and walked through the brightly lit entrance to the
Tangiers Casino.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) Who could resist? Anywhere else in the country, I was a
bookie, a gambler, always lookin' over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night. But
here, I'm 'Mr Sam Rothstein'. I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino. And that's
like selling dreams for cash.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT</b> <p>
We see ACE enter alone. He is greeted by BILLY SHERBERT. They are joined
by top executives RICHIE and RONNIE in suits and ties. They walk through the
casino, past crowded and noisy craps tables, spinning roulette wheels, blackjack tables,
poker-faced players at poker tables, and elegant, cordoned-off, black-tie, baccarat
tables.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my
manager and I went to work. <p>
<b>SHERBERT:</b> (Introducing the EXECS to ACE) . . . And this is Ronnie,
who takes care of the card room . . . <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a
morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along
with making us legit . . .
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>INT. TANGIERS/HARD COUNT ROOM - NIGHT</b> <p>
Dolly back from a wall of money. An employee pours a bucket full of coins into a
trough. Camera follows progress as numerous coins move on a conveyor system, through a
sorting machine. Camera reveals several rolls of coins on a lower conveyor as they move up
a ladder towards an employee's hands, who then places the rolls on a rack.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) . . . comes cash. Tons of it. I mean, what do you think
we're doing out here in the middle of the desert? It's all this money. This is the end
result of all the bright lights and the comped trips, of all the champagne and free hotel
suites, and all the broads and all the booze. It's all been arranged just for us to get your
money. That's the truth about Las Vegas.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>INT. TANGIERS/FLOOR/SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY</b> <p>
Camera follows JOHN NANCE carrying a small suitcase and walking through the
casino to a door leading to the cashier's cage. The sign on the door reads 'Authorized
Personnel Only'. He walks through the cage, to another door: 'Notice - Keep Out'.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) We're the only winners. The players don't stand a
chance. And their cash flows from the tables to our boxes . . . through the cage and into
the most sacred room in the casino . . . the place where they add up all the money . . .
the holy of holies . . . the count room. <br>
(He opens the door. We see inside the count room from NANCE'S point of view. It
looks like the area behind a teller's cage in a bank. A large room, windowless,
decor-free. One side is a mesh cage, opened to reveal stacks of cash boxes. Several COUNTERS
in white shirts are gathered around a glass table counting and sorting paper money.)
<br>
Now this place was off limits.<p>
<b>COUNTER #1:</b> Verify two thousand. <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) Even I couldn't get inside, but it was my job to keep it
filled with cash. That's for sure. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) They had so much fuckin' money in there, you could build
a house out of stacks of $100 bills. And the best part was that upstairs, the board of
directors didn't know what the fuck was going on. <p>
(At one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes and rapidly count the cash at
a counting table. The camera follows a cash 'drop box' being lifted from the stack by a
clerk. He pours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to a video camera.
COUNTER #2 rapidly counts the cash and announces:) <p>
<b>COUNTER #2:</b> Five thousand. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) I mean, to them everything looked on the up and up.
Right? Wrong. <p>

<b>COUNTER #1:</b> Verify five thousand. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) The guys inside the counting room . . . <p>
(Stacks of bills lie nearby. The camera pans across the room to another table manned by
a COUNT ROOM EXECUTIVE who repeats the figure and writes it down on a master list.)
<p>
<b>COUNT ROOM EXEC:</b> Five thousand. <br>
(We move back to NANCE opening a cabinet full of stacks of $100 bills. He opens
his suitcase and begins to fill it with cash. As he does this, the workers studiously look
in other directions.) <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) . . . were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry.
They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips. They'd even take cash right out of the
drop boxes. And it was up to this guy right here [NANCE], standin' in front of about two
million dollars, to skim the cash off the top without anybody gettin' wise . . . the IRS
or anybody. <p>
<b>COUNTER #1:</b> Verify two hundred.<br>
(NANCE closes the case and walks out. One of the counters dumps another container of
money on the table.) <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) Now, notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to
see anything. Somehow, somebody's always lookin' the other way. Now, look at these guys
[COUNTERS]. They look busy, right? They're countin' money. Who wants to bother them? I
mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal. Meanwhile, you're in and
you're out.<br>
(NANCE exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby of the casino, passing ACE
and SHERBERT, to a side exit door.) <br>
Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra c-note a week just to watch the door. I mean,
it's routine. Business as usual: in, out, hello, goodbye. And that's all there is to it.
Just another fat fuck walkin' out of the casino with a suitcase. Now, that suitcase was
goin' straight to one place: right to Kansas City . . . which was as close to Las Vegas as
the Midwest bosses could go without gettin' themselves arrested. <p>
(NANCE leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the curb.)

NANCE and PISCANO walk through the grocery store, through the warehouse, past
various employees to a doorway leading into the back room, where they are greeted by five
older men around a large wooden table with bowls of macaroni and old jelly glasses filled
with red wine.

<blockquote>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) . . . he had to fly in with suitcases once a month,
nice and easy. <p>
<b>NANCE:</b> Somethin' smells good. <p>
<b>PISCANO:</b> Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) The bosses would come from all over the place: Detroit,
Cleveland, Milwaukee. All over the Midwest. And they would meet in the back of this
produce market in Kansas City. I mean, nobody even knew. <br>
(NANCE shakes hands with AMERICO CAPELLI, sixty-eight, a bald, affable Milwaukee
entrepreneur and ARTHUR CAPP, his thirty-year-old yuppie lawyer son. Camera
continues to pan around the room.) <br>
One of the guys made his mother do all the cooking. <p>
(On VINCENT BORELLI, seventy-year-old Kansas City boss.) <br>
<b>BORELLI:</b> Did you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano? <p>
(On VINNIE FORLANO, mid-seventies, an old-timer who once drove for Capone and is
now Remo Gaggi's right-hand man.) <br>
<b>FORLANO:</b> Jerry Steriano? <br>
<b>BORELLI:</b> Yeah. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) Now, these old greaseballs might not look it, but
believe me, these are the guys who secretly controlled Las Vegas. <br>
(PISCANO joins his MOTHER and DAUGHTER by a stove.)<p>
<b>PISCANO'S MOTHER:</b> That man's here again. <br>
(Piscano dips a piece of bread into a pot of tomato sauce). <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) Because they controlled the Teamsters' Union, and that's
where you had to go if you wanted to borrow money to buy a casino. <p>
<b>BORELLI:</b> (Off-screen) When you've finished with him, I want him. <br>
<b>PISCANO'S MOTHER:</b> (Carrying a plate of food to the table where BORELLI and
FORLANO are seated.) Here you are, gentlemen. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) And nobody got a Teamsters' loan, unless the guys in
this room knew they were gonna get their little suitcases. <br>
(FORLANO gets up from the table and walks toward NANCE.) <br>
Guys like this antique here [FORLANO], out of Detroit. Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi,
the outfit's top boss. <br>
(NANCE embraces REMO GAGGI who's seated on a couch, and sits across from him.)
<p>
<b>GAGGI:</b> You got a round figure on it? <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) Definitely the most important guy in this room. <p>
<b>NANCE:</b> (Picking up the suitcase) About twenty pounds.<br>
<b>GAGGI:</b> So? <br>
<b>NANCE:</b> That's around seven hundred thousand. <br>
<b>GAGGI:</b> Uh-huh, good. <br>

<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of
the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy. <p>
<b>STONE:</b> This is a very auspicious occasion. <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) A powerful man. <p>
<b>STONE:</b> Philip, if you would rise. <br>
(GREEN stands up.) <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) He even played golf with the President. <p>
<b>STONE:</b> On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to
you . . . <p>

(PHILIP GREEN, who is now the head of the Tangiers Hotel and Casino Corporation, is
standing at the podium giving a speech.) <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) Now here was the perfect front man. I mean, what the
fuck else could he be? He didn't know too much. He didn't want to know too much,
especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him the money. He wanted to believe the
Teamsters gave him all that fuckin' money 'cause he was smart. <p>
(An exploding flash bulb fills the screen.) <br>
<b>GREEN:</b> . . . I say that, knowing full well just how much competition we have in
this great city.

All I know is that Green was an Arizona real estate hustler, who barely had enough gas

and several other men, past SHERBERT, to ACE.

<blockquote>

sports clothes, sits on another chair.

<blockquote>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) . . . give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he
tries to talk you out of it. <p>
<b>ACE:</b> You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming
Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and
bookmaking pinches on me. <br>
<b>STONE:</b> You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is
apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your
application. They got a ten-year backlog. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> But what happens when they do find out? <br>
<b>STONE:</b> Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this
desert here. Why would they want to lock us out? And besides, they'll never find out. All
you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and
Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the
bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> (Exhales) It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it,
I'd have to run it my way. <br>

They wanted him because Ace ate, slept and breathed gambling. <br>

watching him, trying to act calm.) <br>
They worked out a real cute job title too. <br>

Tangiers Public Relations Director. <br>
(Satisfied the die is not loaded ACE sets it on the craps table, the camera
cranes up to reveal the Tangiers Casino floor.) <br>
But the only thing he ever directed was the casino. He made his first bet when he was
fifteen years old, and he always made money. But he didn't bet like you or me. <br>
(A DEALER is sliding chips, tossing them on to a craps table.) <br>
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that. <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Approaching the DEALER) Where the hell did you learn how to deal? (He
reaches down, stacking and arranging the chips.) <p>

<b>ACE:</b> (To the chastised DEALER) Place the checks properly. That's the way you
do it. <br>
<b>DEALER:</b> Yes, sir. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) He had to know everything, this guy. <br>

(As soon as ACE bets, a man erases a number from the chalkboard and replaces it
was a '6', changing the odds. Two GAMBLERS saunter from the room.) <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) He'd get the wind velocity so he could judge the field

they used on college basketball courts, you know?

<b>INT. MOB SOCIAL CLUB BACK ROOM - NIGHT</b> <p>
The room has an espresso machine and a saint's day calendar. Assorted hoods are
listening to NICKY at the bar. Camera dollies to REMO GAGGI, at the rear
table playing gin rummy with OLD MAN CAPO and losing. Every time the CAPO picks
up a card, he's able to knock or get gin, sending GAGGI into a fit bemoaning his
bad luck.

<blockquote>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about
whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was
ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler
who always lost. <p>
<b>GAGGI:</b> (Slams down his cards and curses at his losing hands) Ma che

<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) I mean, unless Ace made his bet. <p>
<b>GAGGI:</b> That's enough now! <br>

<b>GAGGI:</b> Va fa 'n culo! [Italian-American slang for 'Fuck off'] (Summoning
a young man.) Johnny! <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) Ace made more money for them on a weekend than I could
do heisting joints for a month. <br>

Whatever Ace picked up on the street he told Remo. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Walks over to ACE and whispers) Hey, did you bring that
thing? <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) You know, I mean fixed fights, doped horses, crooked
fuckin' zebras . . . locked-in point spreads. He told fuckin' Remo everything. And to tell
you the truth. I don't blame him. <p>
(GAGGI stands up and shakes ACE's hand.) <br>
<b>GAGGI:</b> Ace. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance
policy in the world. <p>
(GAGGI beams as ACE takes out an envelope filled with cash and hands it over to
him. GAGGI sits back down and ACE, knowing his place, smiles and is about to
leave. ) <br>
<b>GAGGI:</b> Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan? Nobody ever had
Oklahoma-Mi . . . How the hell'd you do it? <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Well, that's why they paid so well. <br>
<b>GAGGI:</b> You see? (Chuckles.) Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on
for next week? <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by

the neck with the pen.) <br>
- Joe! Look out, Joe! Look out! <br>
(NICKY grunts while JOE gasps and groans. The BLONDE screams while
NICKY's hand continues to plunge the pen into JOE's throat. JOE tumbles
to the floor. NICKY pounces on him, still stabbing and now kicking. JOE whimpers.)
<br>

<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin'
what he was sayin', Nicky just hit me. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take
him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he

<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) It's a whale like K. K. Ichikawa, who plays thirty
thousand dollars a hand in baccarat. That's the one you really gotta watch. <br>
(ICHIKAWA and his associate walk into the the suite's living-room and join a Japanese
woman seated on a couch.)<br>
He plays fast and big and he has the cash and the credit to turn out your lights. About a
year ago, he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands. <br>
(They begin to stuff Tangiers soap and towels into their luggage.) <br>
Downstairs, he takes us for two million . . . and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and
towels. Another billionaire cheapskate who loves his free rooms . . .

ICHIKAWA, with the Japanese woman, picks up some chips and places them on the table.
ACE and SHERBERT watch from behind a barrier.

<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) He bet one thousand a hand instead of his usual thirty
thousand a hand. <p>
(A dealer's hands slide two cards on the table.) <p>
<b>DEALER:</b> The bank wins a natural eight over a five. <br>
(Another dealer's hands place two chips on a table. ICHIKAWA looks on.) <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) But I knew, the trick with whales like Ichikawa was that
they can't bet small for long. He didn't think of it as winning ten thousand, he thought
of it as losing ninety thousand. <br>
(ICHIKAWA places a larger bet.)<br>
So, he upped his bets . . . <br>
(A dealer picks up some chips from a rack and places them on the table. ICHIKAWA is
now seated with stacks of chips in front of him.)<br>
. . . until he dropped his winnings back and gave up a million of his own cash. <p>
DISSOLVE TO: <p>
(ICHIKAWA, hours later, his chips depleted. ACE and SHERBERT still watch
from behind the barrier as millions in chips are back in the dealer's racks.) <br>
In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing . . . <br>
(Move in on ACE as he smokes a cigarette.)<br>
. . . and keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose. In the end, we
get it all.

A craps stick pushes some dice towards GINGER. She rolls again, only this time
she craps out. Gamblers groan, then applaud her. She's made so much money for the table

hand in return.

<blockquote>
<b>GINGER:</b> Okay, thank you for asking. <p>

<b>GINGER:</b> I got some lucky pills for you, honey. <br>
<b>HIGH ROLLER #2:</b> Oh, yeah? <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) Who didn't want Ginger? She was one of the best-known,
best-liked and most respected hustlers in town. Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy
awake for two or three days before sending him home broke to the little woman and his bank
examiners.

GINGER comes back from the ladies room. She kisses ACE.

<b>CASHIER:</b> Okay. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> Take one for you. <br>

<p>
<b>EXT. TANGIERS ENTRANCE - NIGHT </b><p>
GINGER exits and gets into her car, slipping a VALET PARKER a $100 bill.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) Ginger took care of the parkers because they took care
of the security guards, who took care of the metro cops, who let her operate. <p>
<b>VALET PARKER #3:</b> Thank you, Ginger. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> (Getting into her car) I need that stuff tonight. <br>
<b>VALET PARKER #3:</b> No problem. <br>

to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession.

<b>INT. GINGER'S APARTMENT - DAY</b> <p>
GINGER enters the room with $25,000 in her hands. She taps LESTER DIAMOND's leg
with it and he turns to her.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) But one thing I could never understand, was that she
could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond. <p>
<b>LESTER:</b> Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want
you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing. Okay? You're going to get
yours back . . . and you're gonna get it back first. Okay? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> All right. <br>
<b>LESTER:</b> Okay? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> Yeah. <br>
<b>LESTER:</b> Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> I'm here. <br>
<b>LESTER:</b> No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> I'm always here for you. <br>
<b>LESTER:</b> You are. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> I am. <br>
(He hastily kisses GINGER and slips out the door.) <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep. <p>
<b>GINGER:</b> Good luck. <br>
<b>LESTER:</b> Yeah. <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf
hustler. A scumbag . . . chasing dentists for a few bucks. <p>
<b>GINGER:</b> Careful. <br>
(GINGER looks out of the window and sees LESTER get into a convertible and drive
off.) <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) I mean, the guy was always broke, he always had a story.
And somehow, she could never turn him down. The way Ginger saw it, I guess, was that
Lester was just an unlucky guy. Somebody had to take care of him.

SHERBERT.

<blockquote>

<b>INT. TANGIERS CASINO/BLACKJACK TABLES - DAY</b> <p>
A blackjack WINNER, who looks like a school teacher, with over $100,000 in chips
before him has gathered a crowd.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) Like these yokels here who never heard of Nicky or the
bosses back home, 'cause they're the morons who give you the most trouble. Even after we'd
catch 'em, they'd try sneakin' back with beards and wigs and fake noses. <br>
(ACE and SHERBERT walk up to watch the WINNER who is playing all six
hands at the blackjack table.) <br>
You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet. Like this guy. He's bettin'
lavender chips at five hundred each with only one little problem. He's always guessed
right. If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot. But in the end,
they're all greedy. <br>
(ACE walks around the WINNER's table, past the crowd, to the pit. Behind him are
more blackjack tables, dealers and players. ACE bends down and ties his shoelace.)
<br>
I saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn't in on it. <br>
(The DEALER's hands lift the corner of his hole card a half an inch to determine
the casino's hand against the WINNER. The slightly exposed hole card is a six of
clubs.) <br>
He just wasn't protecting his hand. He was lifting his hole card way to high. <br>
(On ACE's face then to his POV of the card, past a PIT BOSS, panning to
the SIGNALLER at the blackjack table to the right. The SIGNALLER is slumped
down in his seat, tossing down some cards and sneaking looks at the DEALER's hand
at the WINNER's table.) <br>
Now, here's this guy . . . <br>
(Overhead pan from the SIGNALLER slumped in his seat.) <br>
. . . reading the dealer's hole card . . . <br>
(Pan continues past ACE to reveal the WINNER's table.) <br>
. . . and signalling his buddy [the WINNER] at this table. <br>
(Overhead dolly in on SIGNALLER who appears to be nervously tapping his thigh.
We see through his trousers, that he is tapping a copper transmitter with a battery pack
attached.<br>
Back at the WINNER's table we see inside his pant leg where a device strapped to
his leg is receiving the impulse signal - buzz - buzz - buzz - from the SIGNALLER.) <br>
And that's just what these hustlers look for. They cruise from casino to casino, lookin'
for weak dealers the way lions look for weak antelope. <br>

<b>INT. TANGIERS BLACKJACK TABLES/TELEPHONE - DAY</b> <p>
ACE is on the house phone right near the SIGNALLER's table.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> This is Mr R. Get me Armstrong and Friday over at pit two right away. (He
hangs up, and fixes his tie in the mirrored panel above the phone.) <br>
(Overhead view of the SIGNALLER's table. Various security guards slowly begin to
gather around it. <br>
ACE, waiting, lights a cigarette. ARMSTRONG joins ACE. They look towards
the SIGNALLER's table.) <br>
(To ARMSTRONG) BJ nineteen, second base, the beard [Blackjack table number 19,
second position, man with the beard] <br>
(ACE picks up the phone again.) Operator . . . I need Mr Happy, loud. <br>
(On ACE's signal, WAITRESSES, one carrying a cake with a sparkling candle, start
singing 'Happy Birthday', attracting the crowd's attention.) <br>
<b>WAITRESSES:</b> (In unison) 'Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy
Birthday, dear Jeff. Happy Birthday to you.' <br>
(Gamblers cheer and applaud. <br>
ACE nods and ARMSTRONG lets a long metal object drop out from under his jacket
sleeve and moves in close behind the SIGNALLER, as though looking at the game. He
presses the object - a cattle prod - under the SIGNALLER's arm near his heart. The
SIGNALLER instantly goes into convulsions, falling to the floor gasping and groaning.
Several SECURITY GUARDS grab the SIGNALLER as he falls. ARMSTRONG walks
away.) <br>
<b>SECURITY GUARD #1:</b> Man down! <br>
(The WINNER sees what happened to his partner.) <br>
Notify medical! We got a cardiac arrest here! <br>
<b>SECURITY GUARD #2:</b> He's fine, folks. Just give us some room, please! <br>
(ACE watches the scene. The guards lift the stunned SIGNALLER to his feet and
help him away from the table. Play is immediately resumed.) <br>
Watch it now. <br>
(The WINNER hurriedly places his chips into racks.) <br>
<b>SECURITY GUARD #1:</b> (Off-screen) Stand back! <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) They never know what hit them. And if and when . . . <br>
(SECURITY GUARDS drag the SIGNALLER out.) <br>
. . . they do find out they just got zapped by a cattle prod . . . <br>
(SHERBERT follows the WINNER as he rushes away.) <br>
. . . they wish they really did have a heart attack. <p>

chairs, and a workbench table.

<blockquote>

knockin' this place dead for years. <p>
<b>SECURITY GUARD #1:</b> He's got a wire on him. <br>
(The SIGNALLER is roughly shoved into the room. A SECURITY GUARD tears
his trousers down revealing the signalling device strapped to his leg.) <br>
<b>SIGNALLER:</b> Hey, hey, what are you doin', man? <br>
<b>SECURITY GUARD #2:</b> (Exposing the device) There it is! On the table! <br>
<b>SECURITY GUARD #1:</b> Cheater's justice! <br>
(The SIGNALLER is slammed down face first on the bench and the two GUARDS spread
his arms out on the table.) <br>
<b>SIGNALLER:</b> (In pain) Oh, God! Oh! <br>
(Another GUARD starts up a power saw and approaches the SIGNALLER who is
now pinned to the table. He starts to scream.) <br>
Hey, no! No! No! <br>
(ACE walks toward the table, gesturing for the GUARD to turn off the saw.) <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) We had to make an example of these pricks that the party
was over. <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (To relieved SIGNALLER) I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your
checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands? <br>
<b>SIGNALLER:</b> No. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Can't do it with both hands? <br>
<b>SIGNALLER:</b> No, Sir. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Can you do it with your left hand? <br>
<b>SIGNALLER:</b> Well, I . . . I never tried. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> So, you're a righty? <br>
<b>SIGNALLER:</b> Ye-yeah. <br>
(ACE nods to one of the GUARDS. Instantly a large rubber mallet smashes onto the
man's right hand four times to the sound of screams. ACE watches.) <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand. <br>

respect . . . that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you
know, what is . . . what is love anyway? It's a . . . it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a
devotion. It's a . . . it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up
some kind of foundation . . . based on that mutual respect . . . I feel that eventually
you would care enough about me . . . that I could live with that. <br>

<b>INT. BEVERLEY HILLS BANK/VAULT - DAY</b> <p>
There are several safe deposit boxes filled with cash. ACE and GINGER are
closing a large box so crammed with cash that ACE has to lean on it for the clasp
to lock.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks. <p>
<b>GINGER:</b> Need a little help with that, Mr Collins? <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under
the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money. <br>
(ACE and GINGER struggle to push the crammed box into a slot in the wall.) <br>
And, since I'd either be in jail or locked in a closet when I needed the money the most .
. . <br>
(The BANK PRESIDENT joins them, and he and ACE simultaneously double-lock
the outer safe box door with two separate keys, after which, ACE gives GINGER his
key.) <br>

GINGER is on the other side of a glass wall, signing papers.

<blockquote>
<b>BANKER:</b> Now this is just a signature card. <br>

access to the box? No one else, including myself? <br>
<b>BANKER:</b> That's right. <br>
(We see GINGER looking at ACE.) <br>
That's the way you wanted it, right? <br>
(ACE nods) <br>
(Quietly.) Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> (Quietly) Yeah, sure I do. Why? <br>
<b>BANKER:</b> No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of

Director. This way nobody would bother me about a license. I mean, Vegas was like a dream
for me. Trouble was . . . <br>

NICKY is at a table with his gang of card sharks: SLIM, ROCKY, MOOSH and
COWBOY, all secretly signalling each other, sandbagging a mark. MIKE, the
crooked dealer from the previous scene, deals NICKY a winning hand.

<blockquote>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) . . . the next thing I did, I started bustin' out
high-stakes poker players. <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed

<b>MOOSH:</b> (Scratching his arm) I'm gonna open for five hundred. <br>
<b>ROCKY:</b> Moosh, you open? (Taps his fingers on some chips before picking them up.)

(Another shark pulls on his ear.) <br>
<b>ROCKY:</b> Oh, why're you crying, with three loaves of bread under your arm? <br>
(ACE watches their signals with concern.) <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) Nicky thought nobody was watching him. But he was wrong. <br>
(We see two undercover gaming agents, looking like tourists, sneaking looks at
NICKY's table.) <br>
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> Four aces, Doc. (His hands spread five cards on the table, showing four
aces.) What do you got? <br>
<b>DOCTOR DAN:</b> (Getting up in disgust) Jesus Christ. I can't believe it. <br>
(COWBOY, the card shark with the cowboy hat, rakes in a large pot toward his side of
the table.) <br>
If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck. I'm out of here, you understand? <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) I mean, I wished to God Nicky and his whole crew would
just get lost. <br>
(He walks towards NICKY's table.) <br>
What am I gonna do? Go back home and start a war? <br>
(ACE leans down to talk to NICKY.) <br>
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that. <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Whispering in NICKY's ear) Be careful. Gaming agents are all
over the place. <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place? <br>
<b>ACE:</b> You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya. <br>

<b>ACE:</b> (To GUARDS) I want you to exit this guy off the premises, and I want
you to exit him off his feet and use his head to open the fuckin' door. <br>

reporters rush in to photograph the moment.

ACE and SHERBERT watch as a STAGE MANAGER weighs in the 'Femme Fatale'

<blockquote>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the
crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from
Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to
weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.<p>

What's the reason for this? <br>

<b>STAGE MANAGER:</b> But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's
frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to
Paris. <br>
<b>STAGE MANAGER:</b> It's always been our policy - <br>

obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why
not take advantage, right? So . . . he took bookie joints off the street and then opened
them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every

<b>ACE:</b> Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it
is. <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> In other words, I'm fucked. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> In so many words, yes. <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and
what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this
book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean,
you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me.
They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.

<b>EXT. GOLD RUSH JEWELER'S - DAY</b> <p>
We move past the skull of a steer mounted on an exterior wall and a wooden cigar store
Indian statue, to reveal DOMINICK SANTORO (who looks a little like his brother
NICKY) and MARINO who are waiting inside the Gold Rush. Camera comes to rest on
extreme close-up of NICKY's eyes as he stands on the outside porch.

<blockquote>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) So, once they pulled that shit, I started doin' my
own things in Vegas nobody ever thought of doin'. To keep an eye on things, I brought in
my kid brother Dominick . . . and some desperados from back home and started knockin' over
high rollers, casino bosses, bookmakers, anybody, right here in town. I had a good fuckin'
crew goin' for me, I'll tell you that. <br>
(SAL FUSCO, JACK HARDY and BERNIE BLUE are getting out of a car and walking into
the jewelry store which is designed to replicate an old-fashioned Western town with peaked
roofs, wooden planked sidewalks and hitching posts. The camera tracks by each man as
they're introduced.) <br>
I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy. Jack Hardy, he worked for a safe company after
he did a six-year bit. And then there was Bernie Blue. This guy could bypass any alarm for
me. And I opened up my own jewelry store, too: 'The Gold Rush'.

<b>NICKY:</b> (To MARINO and HARDY) What's takin' so long over there? <br>
<b>MARINO:</b> This peter's a motherfucker.<br>

(NICKY opens the closet door. He and MARINO walk in and bend down to lift up a
small square of carpet to reveal a floor safe.) <br>
Actually, I couldn't because I wasn't even supposed to be doin' it. The bosses were makin'
so much fuckin' money with the casinos (unlocking the safe) that they didn't want
anybody makin' any waves for them. <p>
(In the floor safe, there are several handguns and silencers. <br>
FRANK hands NICKY a roll of money.) <br>

<blockquote>

<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right? <p>
<b>CHARLIE CLARK:</b> You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do . . . that in a
venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss. <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk . . . you know, I might
have to take a loss somewhere. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with
Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker. <p>

<b>DOMINICK:</b> Hey, how you doin'? <br>
(DOMINICK walks over to some patrons in the bar area. NICKY enters, kissing his
brother.) <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant
buff. And over the years, he always made money with them. <p>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Looking at one of the patrons) Hey, Rich. <br>
(The camera follows NICKY around the restaurant past Las Vegas types - dealers,
lounge acts, showgirls, TV and movie celebrities, waitresses and barmen - who use the
jammed place as their hangout.) <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) In Vegas, he had The Leaning Tower. It was a very popular
spot. He had politicians, showgirls and movies stars hangin' out all over the place. <p>
(NICKY walks up to STEVE ALLEN and JAYNE MEADOWS seated at a table, he
whistles their theme tune as he approaches from behind.) <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> Listen, that show over at the Flamingo gets better and better. <br>
<b>STEVE ALLEN:</b> By the way, Sammy said whenever you have a minute, give him a call. <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> Made a messenger out of you too, huh? <br>

<b>JAYNE MEADOWS:</b> (Chuckles) Thanks. <br>
<b>STEVE ALLEN:</b> Okay, thanks. <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky liked the most was
the showgirls, naturally. I mean, to them, Nicky was the movie star. <p>

STACY.) <br>

See, milk-fed veal is pure white. Out here, they got that pink veal. Slide over, honey. <br>

<b>WARD:</b> Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Hey . . . Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence.
What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into
those machines and set those fuckin' reels. <br>
(SHERBERT enters, stands next to ACE.) <br>
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines
in a row, it's in the billions. It cannot happen . . . would not happen, you fuckin' momo!
What's the matter with you! Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win? <br>
<b>WARD:</b> I really think you're - <br>
<b>ACE:</b> (Interrupts) You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on
the second win? <br>
<b>WARD:</b> I really think you're overreacting in this whole - <br>
<b>ACE:</b> (Interrupts) Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been
carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things
and get out of here. <br>

<b>ACE:</b> I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin' (mocking WARD), I'm firin' you, you

<b>WARD:</b> You might regret this, Mr Rothstein. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> I'll regret it even more if I keep you on. <br>
<b>WARD:</b> This is not the way to treat people. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to
keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out! Get out! Go on.

<b>ACE:</b> I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History. <br>
<b>GREEN:</b> But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County
Commissioner. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner
or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it. <br>
<b>GREEN:</b> This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the
County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town. There's gotta
be a way to work him back in. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are
not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers. They're all
lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all

yours. <br>
<b>GREEN:</b> What? <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin' . . . look how many blueberries
your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing. <br>

<b>GINGER:</b> Well, what's the difference? I just need it. <br>

not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean . . . <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal. (Getting
up to the refrigerator.) Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me.
But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself. <br>

Why can't you tell me what it's for? <br>
(She stirs her coffee.) <br>

to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> No. <br>

just why do you want it? That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody
for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> What are you talkin' a- ? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> (Interrupting) Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make
me feel so bad? <br>
<b>ACE:</b> You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I
want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust
you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you? (She doesn't answer.) Can I
trust you? . . . Can I trust you? . . . Answer me. Can I trust you? <br>

with LESTER and GINGER.) <br>

(Extends his hand to LESTER, who shakes it.) <br>
From my recollection, aren't you the card shark . . . the golf hustler . . . the pimp from
Beverly Hills? <br>
(LESTER gives GINGER a 'how did you fuck this up?' look.) <br>
If I'm wrong, please correct me, 'cause I never knew you to be a heist man. <br>
(LESTER sighs.) <br>
But if you are, you know what . . . here, take mine too. <br>
(ACE takes some money out of his coat and puts the thick wad of bills on the table.)
<br>
Go ahead, take it. 'Cause you already have hers. <br>
(LESTER turns and sees two HOODS standing by the front and back doors of the
diner.) <br>
She's my wife. (To LESTER.) Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew
that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me. <br>
<b>LESTER:</b> Yeah, yeah. I know that. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again . . . ever . . . to take her
money . . . next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a

(The thugs follow him out of the back door. GINGER freezes.) <br>
<b>ACE:</b> You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him? He
didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.' He didn't say that
to you, did he? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> (Whispering) No, he didn't. <br>

through the doors, trying to get to LESTER. ACE holds her back. They struggle.
LESTER groans and gasps as the HOODS start to beat him up.

<blockquote>

The HOODS punch LESTER in the face and stomach.) <br>
Make them stop it! (Sobbing.) No! No! No! It's not his fault! It's my fault! <br>

GINGER and NICKY are in the back room. NICKY is sitting on a couch while
GINGER stands by a mirror with a curling iron.

<blockquote>
<b>GINGER:</b> (Throwing the iron on the counter) He's such a prick. He had some
guy from the hotel beat him up. He didn't want to do it himself. Oh, no, he didn't want to
get his own hands dirty. (She takes a pill with a drink.) So, why'd he have to do
that, huh? (She walks towards NICKY, who is sitting on a couch across the room.)
Tell me. <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but - <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> (Interrupts) Yeah, no shit. (She sits down next to NICKY.) <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you
down or taking advantage of you. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no
fuckin' surprise. <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> Oh, you did? I didn't know that. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so . . . so what? <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> You know . . . the first time I ever saw your guys together . . . I never
saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but . . . <br>
(She smiles.) <br>
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's
crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the
bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right? You don't think I'm gonna go
into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end. <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> Sure. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> Am I right? <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> I can see that. Sure. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry. <br>
<b>NICKY:</b>You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> Mm, you want to steal it? (Cracking a smile.) <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put
into a thing like that. That's all. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. (Sniffs.) <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in
jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini . . .
Duality. (Breaking down.) Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake. (Sniffs.)
I mean it. <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> I know what you mean. <br>
(He moves closer to her.) <br>
Listen, Ginger . . . you know, this is probably not . . . I don't have the answers anyway
. . . and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little
upset with Ace. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> I do. <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of
it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him. (She gets up
and walks to the counter by the mirror.) He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly
like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What
the fuck is that all about? <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> (Sighs, her voice starts to crack) He gives a fuck what I do? <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Getting up) Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on.
When I see him I'll talk to him. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> Okay. <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> All right? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> Yeah. (Walking over to him, smiling.) Thanks. <br>
(Towering over NICKY, holding a drink in one hand and his shoulder in the other,
she leans down and kisses him.) <br>
Thanks for puttin' up with me. <br>
(NICKY takes the drink out of her hand.) <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make
matters worse. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> Oh, come on. <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot
of girls get shot to hell from this stuff. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> (Fidgeting with his jacket, then holding his face in her hands, smiling.)
You're so nice. (She begins to cry.) <br>

Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See,
uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town.
He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years.
Now, friends vote . . . family and money votes. That's important to me . . . and you. And
if you'll think about our little problem along them lines . . . and you forgive me for
sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row
and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying
this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that
workin' here. <br>
<b>WEBB:</b> Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure
we can prove them charges. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest. <br>
<b>WEBB:</b> Are, uh - (Clears throat.) - are we certain that you want the Gamin'
Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro? <br>
<b>ACE:</b> I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is
libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to
be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the
whole place. There's not much more I can do for him. <br>
<b>WEBB:</b> (Chuckling) You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a

personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in-law, and
I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do
that. <br>
<b>WEBB:</b> Well, could there be any position . . . further down the trough? <br>

(Into telephone) Okay, thanks. (To WEBB.) Um . . . you know, that's it. I'm
sorry. <br>

have to worry about any of that stuff. <br>

don't care about me at all. <br>

<b>GINGER:</b> No, you don't. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> How could you say that? You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself.
You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you
better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set
your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody. (Strokes her hair. Then,
quietly:) You can do it. (Kissing her.) You can do it. <br>

<blockquote>
<b>BORELLI:</b> Aspett'. [Italian-American slang for 'Wait'] Wait a minute. You
mean to tell me that the money we're robbing is bein' robbed? That somebody's robbing from

NANCE enters through a door and walks past a man picking up a bucket of coins and
dumping them into a trough. A clerk, seated at a coin weighing scale, places a ticket into
a small tray. NANCE reads the printout of the machine.

<blockquote>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Voice-over) Even John Nance, that's the guy who ran the skim, he
knew there wasn't much you could do about it. You gotta know that a guy who helps you
steal, even if you take care of him real well, I mean, he's gonna steal a little bit extra
for himself. Makes sense, don't it? Right? Well, you go try and make these hard-headed old

and see you, and, uh . . . if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head
wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin'
out of jail - hopefully - you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what? I'll split
your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.

<b>NICKY:</b> Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put
somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know! If

out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin'

for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand? <br>

<b>ACE:</b> All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her
about your little role in that whole situation? <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point. <br>

<b>NICKY:</b> It's none of my business? <br>

<b>NICKY:</b> A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words,
when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get
you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this

This guy is gonna run to the FBI. <br>

says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run! <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these

brought down is murder! We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them
off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that? <br>
<b>STONE:</b> What do you propose? <br>
<b>ACE:</b> I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should . . . get lost for a
while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad? <br>
<b>STONE:</b> They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to
maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying. <br>

<b>INT. VEGAS RESTAURANT - NIGHT</b> <p>
ACE and GINGER, dressed for dinner just like any other couple, walk towards a
table overlooking the colorful lights of downtown Vegas.

<blockquote>
<b>MAITRE D':</b> . . . good evening. Signora. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> Gino. <br>
<b>MAITRE D':</b> This way. <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over, as they are led to their table) The good part was, I had
Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed
myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know. But .
. . hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense. <p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Seated across from GINGER at a booth) First of all, he's not
gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna
get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days? I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted
that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> I bought him a watch too. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Yeah. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> Yeah. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought
was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten,
twelve grand? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> Yeah. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> At the most, which is impossible for him. <br>
(She glances to the table behind them.) <br>
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what? Around ten
thousand? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> (Staring down at her plate, trying to restrain herself) Would you
knock it off, Sam? <br>
<b>ACE:</b> I'm just tryin' to figure it out. <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home . . . we're workin' it out. (She
lights a cigarette.) <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Yeah, but I've been told that before, 'We're workin' it out.' You think that
you're home . . . after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favor to me? <br>
(She looks at ACE.) <br>
(Pause) So, counting the watch, let's say another four thousand for expenses over
the weekend . . . of which you must have had a good time. I know he did. That's for sure.
I know that . . . fuckin' piece of shit had a good fuckin' time. On my money. You might as
well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway. <br>
(GINGER glares at him.) <br>
You're lookin' at me a certain way. You - you're teary-eyed, huh? You're upset. You're a
good actress, you know that? Good fuckin' actress. You can fuckin' get that pity out of
people. I'm not a john, you understand? You always thought I was, but I'm not. And I'm not
a sucker. That fuckin' pimp cocksucker. He's lucky I didn't kill him last time. Lucky he's
fuckin' livin'. And if you would've stayed with Amy . . . and you would've ran away . . .
you would've been fuckin' dead. <br>
(GINGER scoots out of the booth and leaves.) <br>
Both of you. Dead. Dead.

frame and stops to listen.) <br>
(Off-screen) What are you? Yes, of course - He doesn't come home at night. What is
the big fuckin' deal? I go - Yes, and I just - I can't fuckin' take it. Why should I
fucking take it? That wasn't the deal. He acts like . . . like I'm the only one around
here with a fuckin' past. He'll never let me live it down. Well . . . well, I mean, I
tried. What the fuck do you think I came back here for? No, I'm not! <br>

Racks and racks of her clothes are still hanging.) <br>

(She tosses a pair of red shoes at him.) <br>
How could I love you?! How can I love you?! You treat me like I'm your fucking dog! <br>

hold.) <br>

ACE is lying awake in bed smoking a cigarette, watching the casino's Eye in the Sky
surveillance monitors. He hears a car turn into his driveway. He sees the car's headlight
beams on the bedroom ceiling. The door opens. GINGER, wearing her long fur coat,
enters and slowly walks towards the bed to lie down beside ACE.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) The funny thing was, that after all that . . . I didn't
want her to go. She was the mother of my kid. I loved her. And later . . . I realized I
didn't want to give her the money, because if I did . . . I knew I'd never see her again. <br>

(Clears throat.) From now on, I have to know where you and Amy are at all times. <br>
(He takes a beeper out of his coat pocket and holds it up to GINGER.) <br>
(Gently) Now, here's a beeper. I want you to keep it on you. It's very light. So I
can call you whenever I have to. <br>
(GINGER reluctantly takes the beeper.) <br>
(Pause.) Okay? <br>
(She nods silently. He looks at her and turns, leaving her alone in the kitchen.)

She . . .. she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch. <br>
<b>NICKY:</b> (Menacing) Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in

(ACE pauses for a beat, realizing that NICKY is standing in his way and could be
dangerous. ACE gives him a wide berth. <br>
We follow ACE through the crowd to GINGER, seated in a booth. He sits down
angrily across from her.) <br>

up. <br>

<b>ACE:</b> You fuckin' whore! <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay? <br>
<b>ACE:</b> You understand? What? Let you go? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> You want your jewelry? <br>
<b>GINGER:</b> I want you to let me go. <br>
<b>ACE:</b> And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?
Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house . . . <br>
(GINGER darts a look to NICKY who is at the bar, watching anxiously. He gestures
with his head for her to leave.) <br>
. . . right now. Get up and - <br>
(ACE notices her look at NICKY but when he turns to see what she's looking at,
he just misses NICKY's gesture. ACE grabs GINGER by her collar.) <br>

<b>GINGER:</b> I wouldn't do that . . . <br>

runs along a verandah to another door. He breaks a pane of glass, unlocks another door and
runs in. BEEPER emerges from the first door and follows him back into the house.
Several more shots are heard. NANCE emerges from yet another door, only this time
he's been shot in the stomach. He painfully staggers away from the hitmen.) <br>
But, then, his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs, and so naturally the bosses were
afraid he'd come out of hidin' just to save his kid and give 'em all up. So . . . <p>

school kid is gonna want his Social Security Number.

<p>
<b>EXT. THE DUNES HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT</b> <p>
The casino collapses into smoke and dust.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) After the Teamsters got . . .
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>EXT. THE MIRAGE HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT</b> <p>
A 4,000 room hotel with a 60-foot volcano out front. Tourists watch it belch smoke and
flames.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) . . . knocked out of the box, the corporations tore
down practically every one of the old casinos. And where did the money come from . . .
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>EXT. THE LUXOR HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT</b> <p>
A giant glass pyramid 30 storeys high with a huge sphinx outside.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) . . . to rebuild the pyramids? . . . Junk bonds.

<p>
<b>EXT. ACE'S SAN DIEGO LUXURY HOME - DAY</b> <p>
TITLE IN: SAN DIEGO <p>
A house very much like ACE's house in Vegas, including the fact that it backs up
on a golf course. We see ACE inside talking on the phone with a bookie.

<blockquote>
<b>ACE:</b> (Into telephone) Still not sure?
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>INT. ACE'S SAN DIEGO LUXURY HOME - DAY</b> <p>
An older, grayer ACE is alone in his living-room with TV sets, fax machines and
multiple phone lines. He is surrounded by newspapers and files. He is very much the way we
saw him during his earlier handicapping days.

<blockquote>
<b>RACE ANNOUNCER:</b> (From a television set) They're off and running . . . <br>
<b>ACE:</b> (Into telephone) Probable, but may be questionable. All right. Well,
let me know as soon as you can find out. (ACE sets his cordless phone down and jots a
few notes on a racing form. A television set shows a football game in the background.)
<p>
<b>ACE:</b> (Voice-over) But in the end, I wound up right back where I started. I
could still pick winners, and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home.
And why mess up a good thing? And that's that. <p>
(He takes off his glasses, and gazes ahead.) <p>
(Fade to black.) <br>
