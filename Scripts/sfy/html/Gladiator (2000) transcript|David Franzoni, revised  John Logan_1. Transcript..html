  - Close up - a rough weathered hand lightly brushes the tops of wheat as the
  man walks through the tall wheat towards a woman (his wife) and child (his son).
  In the background can be heard the faint laughter of a child. The man dressed
  in Roman soldier uniform, is General Maximus.</strong> He quickly leaves this
  pleasant vision to return to Germania where the armour-suited General stands
  amidst the mud and burned forest, cloaked in a fur cape that protects him from
  the cold winter air. The General contemplates the battle that is to take place.
  Turning to join the troops, a small Robin catches his eye as it sits on a bare
  twig and then flies away. The General Maximus smiles, watching as though a remembrance
  of his life as a farmer when life was peaceful and innocent, but he is quickly
  brought back to the reality of the cold day...and to the soldiers who await
  his signal to begin the battle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1"><em>[SCENE: Germania - prebattle. As the cavalry rides past Maximus, soldiers are lining up for battle. Maximus walks along
the ranks of the army. The soldiers rise as he approaches, looking at him with great respect and admiration. At the top of
the hill, overlooking the battle field, sits Caesar Marcus Aurelius atop his horse, surrounded by the Roman Praetorian
guards. Back on the battle field, Maximus approaches and addresses Quintus and Valerius.]<br>
</em><br>
<strong>MAXIMUS: Lean and hungry. Still nothing? <br>
QUINTUS: Not a sign. <br>
MAXIMUS: How long has he been gone? <br>
VALERIUS: Nearly 2 hours. <br>
VALERIUS: Will they fight, sir? <br>
MAXIMUS: We shall know soon enough.</strong> </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1"><em>[Quintus looks over at the soldiers readying the catapults.]</em> </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1"><strong>QUINTUS: Soldier, I ordered you to move those catapults forward, they're out of range. <br>
MAXIMUS: Range is good. <br>
QUINTUS: The danger to the cavalry...</strong> <br>
<strong>MAXIMUS</strong> <em>[interrupts]</em>: <strong>It is acceptable, agreed?</strong> </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1"><em>[In the distant, the cries of the barbarians can be heard - <strong>"ihr seid hunde"</strong> (you are dogs!). A horse rides towards them
