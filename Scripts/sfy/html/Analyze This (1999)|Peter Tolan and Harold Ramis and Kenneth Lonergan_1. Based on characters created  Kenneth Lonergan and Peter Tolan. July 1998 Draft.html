<b>1   CREDITS BEGIN OVER BLACK.                                    1</b>

<b>    DOMINIC MANETTA</b>

    a man in his 70s, narrates nostalgically OVER a MONTAGE
    of related news photos.

<b>                            MANETTA (V.O.)</b>
              1957 was a big year. The Russians
              put that Sputnik into outer space,
              the Dodgers played their last game
              at Ebbets Field, 'that guy' shot
              Frank Costello in the head, and
              missed, and the Gallo brothers
              whacked Albert Anastasia in that
              barber shop in the Park Sheraton
              Hotel. It was total chaos. With
              Anastasia gone, Vito Genovese
              figures he's king shit, but Carlo
              Gambino and 'Joe Bananas' both
              want to be boss of all bosses. So
              they call a meeting -- a big
              meeting.


<b>2   EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY                                  2</b>

    CREDITS CONTINUE. In FADED 16mm documentary-style, we
    see a country road winding through rolling hills. At the
    top of the hill, a black '57 Cadillac appears and sweeps
    through the peaceful landscape.

<b>                            MANETTA (V.O.)</b>
              It was the first time the whole
              commission was ever gonna meet
              face to face. Bosses and wiseguys
              were comin' in from all over the
              country, and all the New York
              families, too -- maybe sixty
              bosses, the whole wiseguy world --
              all headin' toward this little
              town upstate to figure out what's
              what.


<b>3   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          3</b>

    A sign reads, "Entering Apalachin - pop. 342." The black
    Cadillac speeds past the sign, then another black Caddy,
    then a black Lincoln, then another Caddy, a Lincoln, etc.

<b>                            MANETTA (V.O.)</b>
              Your father and me, we were goin'
              up with Tommy D., Fat Tommy.
<b>                            (MORE)</b>

<b>                                                   (CONTINUED)</b>

<b>                                                             2.</b>

<b>3   CONTINUED:                                                    3</b>


<b>                               MANETTA (V.O.CONT'D)</b>
                 He was running the family at the
                 time. Anyway, I don't know what
                 anybody was thinking, but some
                 asshole thought it would be a good
                 idea to have this meeting at Joe
                 Babara's farm in the country where
                 nobody would notice.


<b>4   EXT. RURAL GAS STATION - DAY                                  4</b>

    A local state police deputy is gassing up his motorcycle
    when the parade of shiny black cars rolls by. He looks
    up and scratches his head at the unusual sight.

<b>                               MANETTA (V.O.)</b>
                 Turns out the local cops were
                 watching Joe Babara like a hawk.
                 So now you got about fifty Caddies
                 and Lincolns pullin' into Apalachin
                 and some deputy sheriff with cow
                 shit on his shoes notices all the
                 traffic and calls the Feds.


<b>5   EXT. JOE BABARA'S ESTATE - DAY                                5</b>

    The Caddies and Lincolns are all parked around a rambling
    country manor. Bosses and wiseguys are meeting and
    greeting each other on the big front porch.

    One WISEGUY is trying to shoo a cow away from his car.

<b>                               WISEGUY</b>
                 You wanna be a ribeye?   Get away
                 from the fuckin' car.


<b>6   EXT. WOODS - SAME TIME                                        6</b>

    Federal agents start moving in quietly, heavily-armed,

                  The '57 meeting was about how we
                  were going to divide up the whole
                  country. This meeting is about
                  how we're gonna survive. You got

                  Feds; bosses going to jail;
                  everybody's dealing drugs; people
                  are getting whacked without
                  permission. And on top of
                  everything, now we got the Chinese
                  Triads and these crazy Russians to
                  deal with. Everything's changing.
                  We need a leader. Someone with
                  fresh ideas. Someone like you.
                  It's gonna be a new century, Paul.
                  We gotta change with the times.

     They get up to leave. Vitti drops some money on the
     table. Bodyguards follow them to the door. The waiters
     and the owner bow to them as they pass. They are almost
     out the door when Vitti hesitates.

                  Wait a second. I'm just gonna

     The instant he steps back inside, Manetta and his
     bodyguard are struck by an incredible VOLLEY of GUNFIRE,
     which BLOWS OUT all the GLASS in the DOOR and WINDOWS.

     Vitti's bodyguard, JELLY, grabs him and throws him behind
     the counter, shielding him with his body.

     Outside, the shooting has stopped and curious bystanders
     are looking in the broken windows. Vitti's eyes well up
     with tears.

<b>                                VITTI</b>
                  If anyone asks you, you never saw
                  me, and I was never here. Is that
                  clear?

                  Take the chart.

     Jelly releases the Doctor, grabs all the papers and
     follows Vitti out the door.

     Ben is with a patient, CARL ANDERSON, a high-strung
     milquetoast in his late forties.

                  Carl, I'm detecting a pattern
                  here. You seem to settle too
                  easily for things.

<b>                                  CARL</b>
                  You're right.    I do.

                  No, well, there you go. You

                  Well, sometimes people do it
                  because they fear rejection or
                  disapproval, but you can't let
                  that worry you, Carl. And you

     Jelly pulls a big roll of bills out of his pocket,
     removes the rubber band, and peels off a couple of
     fifties.

     look.

     Carl takes the money, gives Ben the thumbs up and
     exits. Jelly follows him to the door and waves for
     someone to come in.

     everything in. He picks up the phone and listens.          Hangs
     up.

     Ben sits quickly on the coffee table. He crushes a box
     of tissues, then moves them out from under his ass.
     Vitti picks up a stack of CDS and looks through them.

     Ben starts for his chair, but Vitti sits in it first.
     Ben sits on the couch. Vitti adjusts the cuffs of his
     shirt, and runs a hand down the crease in his slacks.

     Ben looks to Vitti for a response.    Vitti stares at him
     for a long, uncomfortable beat.

                  you know? Now all of a sudden,
                  he's falling apart. He cries
                  for no reason. He's having
                  trouble sleeping. And then he
                  started having these attacks. You
                  know, can't breathe, dizzy, chest
                  pains -- like you think you're
                  gonna die.

                  Right. So the question is, what
                  can he do to make it stop?

     Ben decides to go for it.

                   So judging from the mob scene
                   around the pool here today, I
                   think you'd have to say that
                   there's nothing 'off' about the
                   'off-season' in Miami Beach this
                   summer. Now, on a personal note,
                   this is my last report for
                   W.V.B.F. I'm getting married

                  mistake about it, Doctor, animals
                  are very cunning. And they sense
                  weakness. Right now I'm an

               Vitti. Vitti. The whole time we
               were growing up, he was the smart
               guy; I was the dope. My father
               was a nickel-and-dime shitheel;
               his father had it all. Vito
               Genovese blew it at Apalachin
               because he forgot to kill Gambino
               before the meeting.

      SHOTS from a PISTOL with a SILENCER strike him in the
      chest and he falls to the floor dead. Tino steps out and
      drags the body to the stairwell.

      Using a stolen pass key, Tino quietly opens the door and
      enters. He steps into the living room and hears WATER
      RUNNING in the bathroom. He stealthily approaches the
      bathroom door and draws his pistol with a silencer on it
      from under his jacket.

      Vitti stares at his reflection in the mirror, then starts
      washing his face. In the mirror we can see the door
      starting to open behind him, and the long barrel of
      Tino's pistol through the crack. Vitti blindly gropes
      for a towel and starts drying his face.

      Tino is about to shoot when Jelly comes up behind him,
      throws one strong arm around his neck in a powerful
      choke-hold, and grabs Tino's gun-hand with his free hand.

      Vitti hears the sounds of a scuffle, steps out of the
      bathroom, and sees Jelly struggling with Tino.

      Tino gets off a couple of wild SHOTS, but Jelly finally
      shakes the GUN loose from Tino's hand.

      Vitti picks up the gun and puts it to Tino's head. Tino
      shuts his eyes and turns away, expecting the shot, but
      then Vitti's hand starts to shake and he breaks into a
      cold sweat.

      Tino opens his eyes, sees Vitti frozen, and starts
      fighting with renewed strength. Jelly hangs on, looks at
      Vitti with concern, then wrestles Tino out onto the
      balcony.

                  That was a gift to celebrate the
                  completion of his therapy. We
                  got our television from an

                  unusual -- you know, maybe you

     Vitti is conferring with Sal Masiello, his consigliere.

<b>                                 MASIELLO</b>
                  Paul, I don't mean this in a
                  disrespectful way. You know I was
                  a good friend to your father and I
                  will always be a good friend to
                  you. But the word is out that
                  you've been talking to a shrink.
                  Is that right?

     Vitti shoots Jelly a sharp look.      Jelly looks away.

<b>                                VITTI</b>
                  What's the point here?

                  This concerns the whole family.
                  Right now, we're the only ones who
                  know about it, but if it gets out
                  on the street -- what then? Who
                  knows what you've been saying in
                  there?

<b>                                VITTI</b>
                  It's none of anybody's business
                  what I say in there.

<b>                                MASIELLO</b>
                  Paul, I beg to differ. If you're
                  doing this to establish some kind
                  of insanity defense later, that's
                  one thing. But everybody's gonna
                  think you're falling apart, and
                  that ain't good. They'll take it
                  as a sign of weakness, and that
                  makes us all vulnerable. Sindone
                  would take over everything.

<b>                                VITTI</b>
                  So what do you want me to do?

<b>                                MASIELLO</b>
                  It's time to end it.

<b>                                VITTI</b>
                  What do you mean, end it?

<b>                                MASIELLO</b>
                  Get rid of this shrink.   He knows
                  too much already.

<b>                                VITTI</b>
                  You want me to whack my doctor?

<b>                                MASIELLO</b>
                  If you don't do it, somebody else
                  will. It's the only way.

<b>                                VITTI</b>
                  No. Nobody touches him. You hear

                  I'll kill 'em. Is that clear?

<b>64A   FLASHBACK - EXT. STREET ON LOWER EAST SIDE - DAY              64A</b>

      Vitti and Ben are walking down the street.   For some
      reason, Vitti is wearing a hat.

<b>                              BEN</b>
                I'm going to buy some fruit.
                You want anything?

<b>                                VITTI</b>
                No, go ahead.

      Ben crosses to a sidewalk fruit stand and starts picking
      out oranges. Vitti leans up against a car waiting for
      him to finish. SHOTS are FIRED. He runs toward the car.
      More SHOTS are FIRED. Ben is hit. Vitti pulls out his
      gun but he fumbles and drops it. The gunmen run off.
      Ben sinks to the pavement, mortally wounded. Vitti kneels
      next to him and sobs loudly. He puts his hand to his
      head, knocking off his hat.

<b>                                VITTI</b>
                Papa!   Papa!


<b>64B   INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    64B</b>

      Ben jerks upright in bed, knocked awake by the nightmare.

      Someone dips their fingers in.


<b>      INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - NEXT DAY</b>

      It's Vitti. He goes down on one knee and genuflects in
      front of a big crucifix. Ben wiggles his finger in the
      holy water, just kind of curtsies and waves at Jesus on
      the cross.

<b>                              VITTI</b>
                You look lousy. You all right.

                  That's not the point.   It's a

<b>                                 VITTI</b>
                  Boundary issue? I say if more

                  all be better off. Let's see your

                         (as Ben shows his
                          wrist)
                  Piece of junk. You're getting a
                  Rolex.

<b>                                BEN</b>
                  Don't buy me a Rolex.

<b>                                VITTI</b>
                  Who said anything about buying it?

     They cross to the main aisle of the church.

<b>                                BEN</b>
                  Listen, I really need to talk
                  to you.

     Ben stops cold. A casket sits in front of the altar.
     A funeral service is in progress.

<b>                                VITTI</b>
                  Tommy Angels. We grew up together.
                  Worked for a crew out of Jersey
                  City.

<b>                                BEN</b>
                  How did he die?

<b>                                VITTI</b>
                  He was on his way to talk to a
                  federal prosecutor. Got hit by
                  a truck -- twice.

<b>                                BEN</b>
                  Do I need to know that? I'm
                  having nightmares as it is.

     The funeral procession comes down the aisle.

<b>                                BEN</b>
                  Last night I dreamed we were
                  walking down the street, I stopped
                  to buy some fruit, and they shot
                  me -- like Brando in The Godfather.

                   Good scene.    Was I there?

      A mourner walks up to Vitti, bows his head in respect and
      kisses Vitti on both cheeks. Vitti on both cheeks. Vitti
      gives him a consoling pat on the shoulder, then the man
      kisses Ben and walks off.

<b>                                 BEN</b>
                   You dropped your gun, then you ran
                   over to me and started yelling,
                   'Papa, Papa!'

<b>                                   VITTI</b>
                   I was Fredo.    I don't think so.

      An older woman kisses Vitti's hand, then both his cheeks.
      Vitti whispers a few words to her, then she kisses Ben's
      hand and moves on. More old ladies kiss their hands as
      they walk by.

<b>                                 VITTI</b>
                   You're losing it, Doc.   You may
                   need therapy yourself.

      A man comes up to Vitti, kisses him on both cheeks,
      embraces him with excessive energy, then repeats the
      whole scene with Ben and exits. Ben looks at Vitti.

                  Let me suggest something, Elaine.
                  If the man wants you to say things
                  ... damn it, you should get down
                  on all fours and bark like a dog

                  done. Break out the wine, baby.
                  Smoke a joint. Do what you have
                  to do, because life is too short.

                    Correction. Mr. Vitti couldn't
                    shoot you. But here's something
                    about me you should know. I never
                    got married, Doctor Sobol. I
                    don't have a hobby. I never got a
                    dog or a cat. I don't even have a
                    goldfish. I live for one reason
                    only, and that's to serve Mr. Paul
                    Vitti. He's what I'm thinking about
                    when I wake up, and he's what I'm
                    thinking about when I close my eyes
                    to sleep. If he told me to jump off
                    a tall building, not only would I do
                    it, I would hope to survive so I could
                    do it again and again until he told me
                    to stop. This is all I know. This is
                    all I got. So please don't think I
                    won't kill you, because I'd hate for
                    your last thought to be a wrong one.
                    You're going to that meeting.

                   Detained? What kind of bullshit
                   is that? What's more important
                   than this? As the host of this

                   as a sign of disrespect to me and
                   to all these other men, too, who

                   Mr. Vitti meant no disrespect.
                   The thing is, he's not feeling

      He's standing there, staring at Sindone, cool, clear, and
      unafraid. He looks like a king. The room goes silent.

                   Carlo Mangano would like to be the

                   me to our enemies and sent his own
                   man to kill me in Miami.
