</p><p><p ID="act">...and join hundreds of journalists in the audience.  Lights dim.  In front, face lit from below at a podium, Senior Scientist HAROLD ERNEST, 60s, head of the Space Exploration Office.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ERNEST
<P ID="dia">As many of you may know, in 2032 the Space Exploration Office began a series of unmanned flights to Mars.
</p><p><p ID="act">The entire wall behind him, 40 feet by 100 feet, is a vid screen.  As he speaks the images appear.  Not as if he's narrating to the footage, but as if it's voice activated.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ERNEST
<P ID="dia">It had been determined by 2020 that Mars harbored no life.  Although beginning with the same resources as Earth four billion years ago, Mars didn't support any life beyond the microbial stage in the last 300 million years.  Nor did it have an atmosphere or climate supportive of human life.
</p><p><p ID="act">Exactly as he describes it, it occurs.  (Icecaps melt, temperature gradients rise, etc.).  In the audience are hundreds of journalists watching.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ERNEST
<P ID="dia">It was, however, concluded that Mars was receptive to terraforming.  If we could raise the temperature of the planet by only four degrees, the resultant melting of the ice caps would increase the density of the atmosphere, thus holding greater heat, melting the icecaps further.  We could use the greenhouse effect to our benefit.  To do this, we needed to increase the oxygen content of the atmosphere.  Resultingly, a series of probes were sent, each releasing further and further genetically manipulated lichen and algaes designed to stand the rigors of the Martian environment while augmenting the oxygen content of the Martian atmosphere.  In the last 28 years, we have sent 2200 probes.  The terraforming was initially successful.
</p><p><p ID="act">We see the probes launching and bursting in aerosol deployments over the Martian surface.  Algae blooms.  Red, orange, green, black, burnt sienna.  Every color you can imagine.  Valleys covered with color.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ERNEST
<P ID="dia">The average temperature on Mars has increased two and a half degrees over the last three decades.  The oxygen content began to increase as well.  And then eleven months ago, the O2 on Mars suddenly began to decline.  Soon after, all the remote sensors on the planet ceased functioning.  We have no idea what's gone wrong.  We need to know why.  Man's very destiny may lie in the answer.
</p><p><p ID="act">The color on Mars ebbs away.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">We've got every other mission variable in here, we ought to be able to figure aerobrake friction and the speed and orbit of the Ares when we exited.  We should be able to close in on the downrange variables.  Tighten up the ellipse.  It's about the math.
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher can't believe it.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">This is it.  This is that moment they told us about in high school.  Where one day again we'd use algebra.  And it would save our lives.  And I thought they were fucking kidding.

<P ID="dia">Right, I wouldn't want to get lost.

</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher stares out at the Martian plain.  It would be kinda cool.  Except for the fact he's gonna die here.  He's pissed and frightened.  Yanks his HHC out.  Mutters, images appear.  All the Hab details.  Stares at the map and then the 360 degree panorama.  Back at the map.  Back at the panorama.  Something about it strikes him.  Looks at it some more.  He gets up, looks around.  Looks around some more.  Heads back to the guys...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">I don't think it's about math.  I don't like math, so I'm biased.  I think it's about the picture.
</p><p><p ID="act">He holds out the picture of the panorama.  Santen dismisses him - he's not a scientist, he's not a pilot, he should leave them alone.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SANTEN
<P ID="dia">We're not in that picture.  If we were, we'd know where the Hab was.  We're trying to figure this out.
</p><p><p ID="act">Robby ignores him, tosses a rock in the sand, wraps the the 360 degree panorama around it.  Screen bends and turns translucent as he does.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Look, say that's the lander.  At about 30 degrees in the distance, it sees this mountain with the funny top.  And at about 180 degrees it sees this funny set of twin peaks.  (points)
<P ID="dia">Now I see this mountain over there.  And these peaks over there behind me almost on a straight line.  And then there's this other peak maybe, which would put us on the line, say here.  Which leaves the angle to the Hab at about there...
</p><p><p ID="act">Santen and Chantilas start to manipulate their HHCs faster than you can follow.  Muttering to them, hand-gesturing, cross-referencing back and forth to the map, as the ellipse shrinks and their landing location is...determined.

<P ID="dia">Garden's good.

<P ID="dia">Didn't lose a plant.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">Anything else?
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher holds back here a little.  Not a scientist, not an astronaut.  Suddenly feels like the most junior member of the crew.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Ahh, Commander...Bunch of the HVACs jammed from the lift-off.  Reset 'em.  They're fine now.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">I'll tell you what, unless we pass a recruiting station on an asteroid and you sign up for the military, you can call me Kate for the next six months, okay?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Okay.
<P ID="spkdir">(as she waits; he relents)
<P ID="dia">Kate.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">Why'd you come, Gallagher?
</p><p><p ID="act">Not expecting this one.  Takes a sec -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">I did two years as a mechanic at NASCAR.  A year and a half at McMurdo in the South Pole.  Three years on subs.  I had the highest military tech ratings you can get.  And I went cross-country once with my cousins in a  motor home.  This didn't seem so bad.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">That's why they called.  Why'd you come?
</p><p><p ID="act">A beat, then -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">You ever been to Europe?  Europe's horrible.  It's full of stodgy people whose ancestors didn't have the balls to go to America and try something new.  Earth is gonna be like Europe.  You might visit there and admire some old buildings and crap, but you wouldn't want to live there.  This was like getting a call to go with Columbus to America the first time.  But harder.  How could you not go?
</p><p><p ID="act">Damn.  Burchenal grins.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">I don't like Europe much either, son.  Didn't quite figure it the same way, but damnation, you don't turn down a phone call like that, do ya?
<P ID="spkdir">(to Kate)
<P ID="dia">You?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">I spent my entire life training to fly the biggest, fastest thing you can fly.  This is it.  It's the best job in the world.
<P ID="spkdir">(points to Santen)
<P ID="dia">He's going 'cause he got the second best job in space.  He's a little pissed about it, but he still came.
</p><p><p ID="act">She's nailed him so precisely, Santen can only wince and look away.  Pettengill just pipes up.  Maybe no one's gonna ask and he wants to get it out in the open -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">I was never supposed to come.  I came 'cause my boss couldn't.  He failed the medical.  Heart arrhythmia.  So here I am.  They tapped me on the shoulder, told me I was going to Mars.  I was supposed to be second in charge of the Terraforming office till I died.
</p><p><p ID="act">Chantilas's the last.  They turn to him.  His reason's a little different.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHANTILAS
<P ID="dia">Psalm 107, verse 23
<P ID="dia">They that go down to the Sea in Ships, that do business in great waters, these see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep.'  So I figured how much wonder for those in space?
</p><p><p ID="act">Beat.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SANTEN
<P ID="dia">You're going to Mars because of a poem??
</p><p><p ID="act">Chantilas thinks about it.  He could go on about it, but...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHANTILAS
<P ID="dia">Basically.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ARES - EXERCISE SPHERE - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">SUPERIMPOSE: MISSION TIME: DAY 13
</p><p><p ID="act">There's no up here, equipment is attached to the floor, ceiling and walls.  Santen and Bowman are on a large spinning bicycle-driven centrifuge.  Santen's pedaling.  By keeping up the speed, he's able to provide enough extra gravity for Bowman, on the other side, to lift free-weights.  They're both dripping sweat so it must work.  TIMER goes off, they slow to a stop.  Pettengill comes in.  He looks a bit uncomfortable.  Certainly out of his element.  A little, well, puny.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">So...required exercise.  Haven't had this since grade school.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SANTEN
<P ID="dia">Yeah, you musta been doing some kind of reverse thing where you get small...
</p><p><p ID="act">Santen's got years in the gym.  Muscles on muscles.  Bowman takes a two-second evaluation of the situation.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">You're done.  You can shower.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SANTEN
<P ID="dia">I'm not done.  I was gonna...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">No.  You're done.
</p><p><p ID="act">Santen can't believe he's being thrown out.  But he's also a product of the military and couldn't argue if he tried.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SANTEN
<P ID="dia">Yes, ma'am.
</p><p><p ID="act">He leaves.  Pettengill feels stupid.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">You didn't have to do that.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">No.  I did.  If I didn't nip that in the bud, I wouldn't be doing my job.
<P ID="spkdir">(then)
<P ID="dia">Flying this beast is only half the job.  The whole job's to get the crew in place in shape to do what they have to do.  And the funny thing is, flying's the easy part.
</p><p><p ID="act">Pettengill stands abashed for a moment and then his resentment just bubbles out...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">I just hate all those fucking guys.  I feel like I've spent my entire life being the guy who was hassled in phys ed.  I lost the first girl I ever cared about to some thug who could throw a football farther than I could.  It's like women are hardwired to think that guys who are proficient at sports are going to be better providers.  It's not like we hunt and kill our own food anymore.
<P ID="spkdir">(then)
<P ID="dia">He sells cars for a living now.  Cars.  I end up working on a project that may save the existence of mankind and he sells cars.
</p><p><p ID="act">This is impressively obsessive.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">You kept track of him.  What happened to her?

<P ID="dia">The girl.
</p><p><p ID="act">He has no idea.  She grins at him -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">Little competitive?  Who's hardwired for what, Cro-Magnon guy?
</p><p><p ID="act">He can't help it, he grins, a little abashed.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">We're gonna start with the bungees.  Try to quit being pissed off you weren't chosen for dodgeball, willya?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">I'll try.  Twenty years of hating the bullying motherfuckers is a hard habit to break.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">How you doing?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">Little tired.  I'm okay.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">Guys...
</p><p><p ID="act">Burchenal reaches out, checks their wrist monitors.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">We're doing fine.  In point of fact, he's using less O2 than you are.  We can stop a minute.  Unless you two want to shout at each other and use up your air.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">Sorry.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SANTEN
<P ID="dia">Fine.  I'm sorry, too.
</p><p><p ID="act">No one's sorry.  They rest.  Use the moment to look around.  It's pretty astounding.  Chantilas uses the respite to re-scan his abdomen.  Puts the device away again.  He's in pain but refuses to acknowledge it.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">How you doing?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHANTILAS
<P ID="dia">Things are as they are.

<P ID="dia">Lord.  Look at it, we're on Mars.  Pretty damn amazing.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">It' weird.  There's nothing here.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">It's Mars.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">No, I mean there's not even a trace of the algae.
</p><p><p ID="act">He kneels down, examines a rock.  Nada.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">Even if it all died, there'd be something - a dried algal mat, traces on the lee sides, something.  Nothing.  Nada.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">He's right.  We sent up fifty-two varietals.  Blue-green, black, orange.  Anhydriobiosics, chemotrauphs, even a thibacillus that could grow autotrophically on elemental sulfur.  Not only are they dead, they're all just gone.  I don't get it.  It's like they were scoured off the rock.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Maybe there was never anything in this valley.
</p><p><p ID="act">As they walk, Burchenal checks his HCC.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">If we are where we think we are -
</p><p><p ID="act">Map appears on a small screen, he mutters to it, overlays of all the algae and lichen that were on Mars appear.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">This valley was covered with blue algae a month ago.  Valley back one should have been covered in an orange-red chloroflectic.  He's right.  It's weird.  There should be something.
</p><p><p ID="act">They crest a small rise.  Below lies a valley that closes down quickly into an extremely narrow canyon.  Burchenal and Santen check their HHC maps.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">This, however, makes sense.

<P ID="dia">Debris apron.  Delineated valley fill.  Depositional fan...
</p><p><p ID="act">He double-checks with Chantilas.  Seems they're going the right way.  Chantilas leans back heavily against a rock.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHANTILAS
<P ID="dia">Good.  You gotta keep moving...
</p><p><p ID="act">Chantilas doesn't get up.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">And what're you gonna do, sit here and watch?  You getting old and lazy?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHANTILAS
<P ID="dia">My spleen's ruptured.  There's significant internal bleeding.  I'm not going any further.  And trying to carry me will slow you down just enough that we can all die.
</p><p><p ID="act">Robby's stunned, frantic.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">We'll get you to the Hab.  Lock out the spine impulse and you can walk one of us through it.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHANTILAS
<P ID="dia">No. You won't.
</p><p><p ID="act">Santen takes charge.  It's his mission now.

</p><p><p ID="act">They lift him to the other side of the rock.  Gallagher stays with Chantilas a moment.  Stricken, speechless.  Inside Gallagher's helmet, we can see as the tears roll down.  Then -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHANTILAS
<P ID="dia">It's okay.  I'm not sorry I came.

</p><p><p ID="act">Then the severity of the damage comes clear.  Bowman tries not to react.  Nothing else is there.  No sign of activity or escape.  The footprints are beyond the resolution of the camera.  There's no reason to believe anything but they're all dead.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Nah, you can keep talking.  It's kinda peaceful.
</p><p><p ID="act">In the b.g., headed towards a ridge of rocks, we can see a lone figure making its way along.
</p><p><p ID="act">It's Pettengill.  He steps around the ridge.  We can hear his RADIO WHOOOSH TO STATIC as he loses line of sight communication with the others.
</p><p><p ID="act">Up ahead of him, standing on the edge of an enormous drop-off, just staring out into space, is Santen.  His back is to us.  Pettengill walks towards him.  Santen still doesn't hear.
</p><p><p ID="act">Santen's radio is off.  BEETHOVEN BLARES in his helmet.  A 3000 foot drop at his feet.  It is magnificent.  As Pettengill approaches and Santen remains unaware, the scene seems less and less innocuous.  We fear for him.  Until...
</p><p><p ID="act">Pettengill just walks right up beside him and stares out at the chasm as well.  Santen LOWERS his MUSIC.  They stand there silently for a moment.  Santen has some kind of weak-ass epiphany...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SANTEN
<P ID="dia">Look, I'm sorry.  I owe you an apology.  I've been a dick. I pick on people who are weaker than I am.
</p><p><p ID="act">It's way too little, way too late.  But Pettengill doesn't let on.  Just nods.  As if he's forgiven him.  Steps away and OUT OF FRAME.  We HOLD ON  Santen a moment and...Pettengill has picked up what would be a 250-pound rock back on Earth and is heaving it with all his might into Santen from behind.  It slams into him, bending him in half, knocking his feet out from under him.
</p><p><p ID="act">For half-a-moment we think Santen might regain his footing.  But he doesn't.  He starts to fall past the edge of the cliff.  Slowly.  In .38 grav SLOW MOTION.  Flailing.  Twisting in the air.  As he falls, looking up, he slaps OFF the MUSIC, the RADIO COMES BACK ON.  Pettengill leans over the edge.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL

<P ID="dia">No, you won't, because...

<P ID="dia">Gonna hurt?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">Yeah.
</p><p><p ID="act">A WARNING TONE GOES OFF on Gallagher's SENSOR.  He starts to gasp.  Opens his mouth wide.  Sucking in and out air that's worth less and less to his body.
</p><p><p ID="act">He begins to claw at the air.  It's not pretty to watch.  Spins about seeking some release.  None forthcoming.  Claws some more.  Falls to his knees.  The others can barely watch.  They know they're next.
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher's growing more claustrophobic and crazed.  Falls the rest of the way to the ground.  Still clawing at the air.  It's horrible to see.  And in one last desperate, angry, trapped-feeling move, reaches up and unhooks the front of his helmet and throws it back.  Croaks out a faint epitaph as he collapses.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Fuck this planet.
</p><p><p ID="act">And he's still.  Still.  And then in a last reflexive shudder.  Gasps.  Gasps again.  Takes in the worthless Mars atmosphere.  And right when we think it's entirely over...Takes in some more.  Breathes again.  And again.  Opens his eyes.

<P ID="dia">There are values that are fundamental to an adequate apprehension of the world in which we live that can't be expressed by equations or experiments.  In that, you see the hand of God.
<P ID="spkdir">(explaining)
<P ID="dia">Acknowledgment of basic values.  Love, kindness, joy.  Science doesn't have much use for these.  Look, ugly theories are wrong.  We know it by insight.  Science doesn't want to accept that.  We live in a moral world and have moral knowledge that tells us that love and truth are better than hatred and lies.  But it's modern to think this is little more than genetic imprinting or a tacit communal cultural agreement.  That's not a world I cared to live in anymore.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHANTILAS
<P ID="spkdir">(unconcerned)
<P ID="dia">If so, it's because we're supposed to find something out.  (then)
<P ID="dia">Let's say we didn't.  And we finished poisoning off the Earth and everyone was dead in a hundred years.  Then what was the point of any of it?  Music, art, beauty, love?  All gone.  The Greeks, the Romans, the Enlightenment, the Constitution, people dying for freedom, ideas?  None of that meant anything?  I'd rather go out and make a mistake than live in a world that bleak.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">No one said jack to me about the Greeks and Romans.  Shit, I just came along to fix stuff.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHANTILAS
<P ID="dia">Fooled ya, didn't we.  It's okay.  No one told the others either.
</p><p><p ID="act">There's a quiet moment.  Robby just came up to stare at the stars.  Wasn't expecting all this.  Then -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">CHANTILAS
<P ID="dia">There's a reason the planets go around the stars in exactly the same way electrons go around the nucleus of the atom.  It's not an accident.  There's a design at the bottom of all this.  God's watching over you.

<P ID="dia">Son, I'm a scientist.  A geneticist, as good as they come.  I write code, just like a hacker.  Four elements, A.G.T.P., in different orders, back the genome.  And your kidneys work or you grow a sixth finger.  I line up unconscious atoms and they give rise to conscious beings.  It's like if I stacked up a bunch of rocks in the right order and they become a dog.  I do that.  I chose when, I chose where, I chose how many fingers.   I just don't hold with mystical explanations for science, with organized religion, buildings with different symbols on 'em.  You spot God, you lemme know.  Till then, I put my trust in my three Ph.D's.

<P ID="dia">How long can a man go without food or water?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">How long can you go without singing that dumb song?

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">There's two of us.  And we can stop him from singing.
</p><p><p ID="act">Pettengill considers.  Then sings along instead.  They only know the one line.  It's really annoying.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">What is that?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">I have no idea.  It's old, though.  It's classic music.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">I don't know the classics.

<P ID="dia">Mars ain't a place to raise your kids

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">Never mind.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Sing the one about the dogs again.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">It's about cows.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Then why does it say doggies?
</p><p><p ID="act">All this time, they've been walking across a landscape pigmented with color - steel blue, alizarin crimson, malachite green - the algae varietals everywhere.  And then off to the left, the algae stops.  Erased, like it was never there, extirpated in a long crooked line.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">What the fuck?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Yeah, what the fuck?  You said doggies.
</p><p><p ID="act">Then he sees as well.  They all see.  Can't help themselves.  They're drawn towards it.  Gallagher and Burchenal check their course in  the distance before veering off.  Pettengill is already heading towards it.
</p><p><p ID="act">It's maybe 100 yards away.  At 50, something indistinct can be seen.  Sort of.  It's like the line, and the surrounding terrain is out of focus, blurry.  At 30, the blurriness comes into focus.  It's alive.  It moves slightly.  You can see through it.  At ten, you can see it undulating.  Slowly, TOWARDS us.  Erasing the algae, the color slowly spreading outwards behind and diffusing.  And then we can see...
</p><p><p ID="act">A billion, a hundred billion...nematodes.  Little tiny translucent worms.  Eating the algae.  Slowly, irrevocably.  Advancing.
</p><p><p ID="act">Pettengill pulls out his entrenching tool.  Carefully separates one out.  Lifts it up to the light to see.  Maybe three inches long, skinnier than an earthworm.  One end lifts in the air, a tri-part mouth with little crystalline teeth opening and closing, searching for something to eat.
</p><p><p ID="act">It's fucking scary.  It gets worse when you realize how many of them there are.  The line's moved three or four inches closer as they stand there.  They take a step back.  No one can really speak yet.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">What...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">It's a nematode.   Or something like one.  It's probably this skinny so it defrosts each morning when the sun hits them.  Or they'r enot water-based at all.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Is it something we sent up by accident with the probes?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">No.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">I thought we said there wasn't any life on this planet.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">We did.  We were wrong.  Maybe there wasn't when we checked.  I don't know.  It's not from Earth.
<P ID="spkdir">(beat; yow)
<P ID="dia">And it's not from here.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">This can't be.  This can't be.
</p><p><p ID="act">Burchenal actually seems kind of upset about it.  Gallagher looks at him.  Say what?  Burch is upset.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">It can't be here.  You don't understand.  The odds of there being any other life in the universe are infinitesimally small.  The odds that it could survive on something other than its home planet are equally astronomical.  The odds that it could travel to another solar system, let alone one where life already existed are...impossible.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">But it's here.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">Yeah.
</p><p><p ID="act">Burchenal seems almost unhappy about this.  It rocks his world.  In a bad way.  Gallagher turns to Pettengill happily and untroubled....
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Well, it looks like we're not alone in the universe.  You just discovered life on another planet, pal.
</p><p><p ID="act">It takes a moment for this to sink in.  Then something hits Robby.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Made by God.  That's what's stamped on the bottom.  That's what Bud would have said.  He woulda loved this.
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher gets down on one knee and looks at them.  They're kinda horrible, but as he turns to Pettengill -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">You know what this means?  You're gonna be more famous than Darwin.  They're gonna name buildings after you.  Spacecrafts, cities on Mars...
</p><p><p ID="act">The enormity of how badly Pettengill has screwed up - that in the space of one day, he's committed murder and discovered life on another planet - begins to dawn on him.  He doesn't handle it well.  He's fucked up like few people can imagine.  He tries to reset, it doesn't work.  The worm twists about, starts to eat the metal right off the entrenching tool.  He flicks it back to its relatives.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">Right.  Right.  Motherfuck.  Motherfuck.
</p><p><p ID="act">And then he says something really odd -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">Name them after Santen.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">You hated Santen.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">Yeah.
</p><p><p ID="act">He storms away.  They're both confused by this.  Pettengill finds a rock, sits down behind it.  He's obscured except for his head and shoulders.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="dia">I need a minute or two.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER

</p><p><P ID="speaker">PETTENGILL
<P ID="spkdir">(calling out from behind the rock)
<P ID="dia">No, that there's life on Mars.  We're not saying where it came from.  But not Earth.  Fuck.
</p><p><p ID="act">They all disregard that last bit.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">They're like some kind of translucent worms.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SKAVLEM
<P ID="dia">You're all seeing these?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">Oh yeah.  They're here.  What did you think this was, hypoxia?
</p><p><p ID="act">They did.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">Conversation's over.  Gallagher walks towards the rock -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">We should get outta here.
</p><p><p ID="act">Pettengill doesn't respond.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">Really.  We should get going...
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher walks over.  We hear a familiar WHINE.  Don't recognize what it is at first.  Until Gallagher around the rock and sees...
</p><p><p ID="act">Pettengill's flicked on the WHIZZING CUTTING EDGE of the entrenching TOOL.  Shreds his left wrist.  Lifts it and rips through his carotid arteries.  All but cuts off his head as he falls to the ground.  Suit's awash with BLOOD.  Overflowing onto the ground and him.  BURBLING in spurts.  Some hits the worms.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">Jesus...Jesus God...
</p><p><p ID="act">Burchenal's joined him.  There's nothing they could do.  Only watch in shock.  It gets worse.  The worms come.  Pulsating and undulating towards Pettengill.  As if some secret message the food is here has spread through the billions of them in burst of knowledge.
</p><p><p ID="act">A diaphanous, hungry wave crests onto Pettengill and engulfs him.  He's covered in translucence as they devour him.  Gallagher and Burchenal stagger backwards in horror as a red aureole grows around him as he's eaten.  Color spreads out around him in a perfect ever-growing circle.  It's a feast.
</p><p><p ID="act">WIDE
</p><p><p ID="act">The two of them walk along.  Can't tell if they're hurrying towards something or away.  They've both figured out what's up.  A beat, then -

</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. MARTIAN HORIZON
</p><p><p ID="act">The sun begins to set.  30 miles away, the terminus, the line where night turns to day, begins to advance across the planet towards them.  In the dark of the shadow, the FROST forms a dozen feet behind and follows growing, GROWLING - the cold advancing TOWARDS us with a CRACKLING CRUNCHING FREEZING WHINE.  It's as if the cold has a sound...
</p><p><p ID="act">BACK AT HILLOCK
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher and Burchenal can see the darkness approaching.  Digging madly.   Cackling.  Losing their minds.  Can't tell who is who as they're silhouetted against the sun, one now inside the hillock throwing rock back as the other clears.
</p><p><p ID="act">The sun continues to drop.  Terminus continues its pernicious HISSING and freezing approach.
</p><p><p ID="act">Halfway inside now.  On his knees, suit light on, Gallagher chops away at the rock.  When he's thigh-deep in debris, he backs out, dragging the leavings with him.  Burchenal leaps in, replacing him.  Dripping in sweat, nutty, but at least they're doing something.
</p><p><p ID="act">The last of the sun disappears.  Their breath is in the air.  The darkness and frost reaches them now.  The sweat begins to freeze, ice in their hair and eyebrows and stubble.

</p><p><p ID="act">A moment, then -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">You're talking about faith, son.  Faith is another way of saying I know something you don't know but I can't tell you 'cause it's a secret.  But I don't know why I know it.

</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher and Burchenal breathe shallowly.  The inside of the cave is covered in white flaking hoarfrost.  Lips are blue.  Skin is pale.  Gallagher's eyes open.  Something's wrong.  Doesn't know what.  And then he realizes the air moving in and out of his lungs isn't doing him any good at all.  The door is caked shut with ice.  There's no air.
</p><p><p ID="act">He moves badly, uncoordinated, but manages to chop and shove it open.  Fresh ice cold air rushes in.  Burchenal awakes.  Only half-responsive.  Gallagher grabs him, drags him out.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">We gotta keep moving.
</p><p><p ID="act">He yanks out his HCC.  Mutters rapidly into it.  We see the map appear.  Hab/Cosmos line marked.  Then a star chart for Mars on this day and time.  He calls for it to change to a horizon projection.  The machine freezes, computes.  Brings up a horizon.  It matches what Robby sees.  And highlights a star sitting just above the horizon that will lead them on their way.  Canis Minor.  They start to run...
</p><p><p ID="act">A beat.  AMEE rises up silently from behind a rock and watches them go.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. MARS - SURFACE - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">The two men run.  Lit by the two moons Phobos and Deimos - Fear and Terror.  It's unbelievably cold.  Plumes of breath light up around them as they go.  Following the star on the horizon.  Across a valley, over a ridge.  Over a dune.  Scrambling.
</p><p><p ID="act">Up and over the next long, long gradient.  They lose the star over this false horizon as they climb.  There's something odd, however.  A faint broad wash of light coming over the lip.  They crest the rise to reveal -
</p><p><p ID="act">VALLEY
</p><p><p ID="act">Completely covered in phosphorescent algae.  Pale green and glowing.  A mile across, a mile wide.  If they weren't rushing for their lives, it would be worth stopping to stare.
</p><p><p ID="act">Across the vale Canis Minor sits directly in the center of a small mountain pass.  They're about to dash onward when something - intuition, it's hard to say what - hits Burchenal.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">Stop.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">What?
</p><p><p ID="act">Burchenals' not quite sure at first.  But won't enter the algae.  Walks left, walks right.  Kneels down.
</p><p><p ID="act">The algae glows.  Otherworldly.  And then movement.  In the f.g. a worm, green, glowing and filled with algae, slithers through.  And then another.  And another, indistinguishable from the plants around them they've imbibed.
</p><p><p ID="act">And then as Burchenal plays his light out across the valley we realize it's entirely full of worms.  Gallagher takes an appalled step back.  They're fucked.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">We're fucked.
</p><p><p ID="act">Burchenal considers for a moment.  And yeah, probably has that epiphany.  Then-
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="spkdir">(re the pass)
<P ID="dia">Get to the closest point you can safely.  I'm gonna go down to that end.
</p><p><p ID="act">He starts to run to the far end.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">What are you gonna do?
</p><p><p ID="act">Burchenal's far enough away now that his voice comes over the SUIT RADIO.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">I'm gonna distract them.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">You're gonna distract the worms??
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Yeah.
</p><p><p ID="act">Perhaps Gallagher ought to give this more thought.  But he doesn't.  Maybe it's the exhaustion.  Maybe it just never would have occurred to him.  Burchenal disapears into the darkness and the distance.  Gallagher waits.  Then -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">You ready?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Yeah.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Good.  Lemme know when it starts to clear.
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher doesn't get it.  But a moment later, a shiver runs through the worms.  And they start to undulate away.  Towards Burchenal.  Pulsing faster and faster until it's clear in a moment or two, like a giant amoebae withdrawing, he will have clear access to the pass.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
</p><p><p ID="act">at the far end, is five hundred yards into the worms.  They know.  They've told each other.  And they're coming in pulsating waves.  Towards him.  At the epicenter.  He gags.  And hears -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER (V.O.)
<P ID="spkdir">(stunned)
<P ID="dia">It's clear.
</p><p><p ID="act">Burchenal tries to turn around.  He's mired now.  And they're up to his waist.  It's a fucking nematode feeding frenzy.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">Good.
</p><p><p ID="act">He can't even lift his feet.  They're beginning to cover him now.  He can see the color of his suit spreading around him as they devour it.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="spkdir">(then; oddly calm)
<P ID="dia">You were right, son.  There's gotta be a reason.  This can't just be an accident.  I don't know what the worms're doing here or how they got here.  But science don't explain it.  And it pisses me off to no end.
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher turns.  He can see now what Burchenal has done.  A tiny glowing figure can be seen 1000 yards away.  Gallagher's speechless at first...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">I'm gonna have to turn off my radio in a sec.  So you don't have to hear me screaming like a girl.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">What have you done??
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL
<P ID="dia">Finding out there's things I don't understand.  That science don't know squat about.  Maybe even the damn Earth's worth saving.  Someone's gotta give it a try.  Gotta find out about these worms.  Go, get off this fucking planet.
</p><p><p ID="act">During which we've CUT TO Gallagher, 'cause you don't want to see this.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BURCHENAL (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">There's two women in Missoula, one in Bozeman.  Tell them each they were my last words.  And make sure my horse gets sold to someone who knows how to ride.
<P ID="spkdir">(then)
<P ID="dia">Oh, my Lord...
</p><p><p ID="act">RADIO GOES SILENT.  Across the distance we can see a figure, now entirely coated in luminous worms, writhing wildly.  Gallagher leaves his light on, starts to run.  As Robby flees, we PULL BACK, FURTHER and FURTHER until he's just a tiny figure in the landscape - until we are AT what was Burchenal.  The frenzy is all but over.
</p><p><p ID="act">The phosphorescence is gone in the center of the circle.  The edges are the color of his suit.  Then blood red for forty yards.  Bits of bone white.  And then right in the dead center, as we watch; gray, spreading, spreading as what was once Burchenal's brain is food for worms.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. MARS SURFACE - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher scrambles up, steeper and steeper, to the edge of the valley and the ridge line.  From the top he can see the way below is his prize - the Cosmos.  Checks his watch, hopefully, desperately triggers the radio.

<P ID="spkdir">(then)
<P ID="dia">The maintenance port has a cover.  It should be marked.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Yeah.   In Cyrillic.
</p><p><p ID="act">Finds it anyhow.  He flexes his unresponsive fingers, and after a try or two, unscrews the cover, reveals an IR port.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Got it.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">All right, I'm gonna download this to you.
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher yanks out his HHC.  Dozen adapters in the back.  Finds the one that fits the old modem port on the jerry-rigged radio.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Go.
</p><p><p ID="act">Plugs it in.  Stuff flashes.  On the HHC, Windows comes up, the Cosmos LaunchMaster program, Cyrillic crudely relabeled in English.  Unplugs the modem so he can speak again.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">It's still got power.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">You should be able to run diagnostics.

</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher, using the few tools he has left, has unbolted the sample return container.  Measures its width -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Launch diagnostics.  Avoid pressing anything that says ignition.
</p><p><p ID="act">He runs it - seals are good, pumps are good, engine's ready.  And the ignition power force, all 300 volts of it, is dead as a doornail.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Gallagher?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">No.  No go.  There's enough power to run the computer, but not enough to launch.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">How much do you need?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAHER
<P ID="dia">I need 300 volts at six amps.  And I've 28 volts running the computer system.  Ignition battery's stone cold.
</p><p><p ID="act">Beat.

<P ID="dia">Is there anything you can use?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Let me look around and see if I see a high voltage source....No, just rocks.  In fact, everywhere I look, there's just fucking rocks.  And more fucking rocks.
</p><p><p ID="act">Then, as he tries not to break down -

<P ID="dia">Forgive me if I don't feel like getting eaten before I die!
</p><p><p ID="act">They don't really respond.  Except the ones in the front who rear up, and seem to listen or sniff for him.  And gnash their little crystalline teeth.  They split now to come at him from two sides.  Gallagher gets caught in a dry-heave.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Oh, man...
</p><p><p ID="act">Sees the bucket of rocket fuel.  Lot closer to them than it is to him.  Gathers his nerve, runs, grabs the bucket.  Drags it twenty feet back.  Then tilts it, carefully pouring it out in a ring around himself and the Cosmos.  Worms closing in as he goes.  Leads a fuse of fuel back towards him.  Lights it.
</p><p><p ID="act">It burns low and yellow in the oxygen-depleted atmosphere.  Doesn't look like much.  Certainly not a defence.  First worm gets near it.  Unsure.  Bewildered.  Pulls back.  But his compatriots are behind him, still coming.  No choice.  He advances.  And...POOF.  VAPORIZES in burst of red-orange as he touches the flame.
</p><p><p ID="act">And the next...And the next.  Like little sparks.  Gallagher watches, puzzled by this...And then it hits.  Right as the ring of flame is about to die out.  The main wave touches the ring of fire.  And...they do burn.  And SCREAM.  Little WORM SCREAMS that multiplied by tens and hundreds of thousands begin to pierce the air.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">That's for eating the Hab!  And killing Cooper, you slimy worm fuckers!
</p><p><p ID="act">Rolling waves of flame.  Half plasma.  Flying blobs of burning worms rain down like napalm.  One lands on and torches the cobbled-together radio.  It's so damn hot for a moment Gallagher panics, thinking everything might explode.  Then it drops to embers and the wave burns over the hill like a wild fire.
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher does a dance of triumph.  However short-lived.  Then it hits him -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">How do you burn like that without oxygen??
</p><p><p ID="act">There's a BLAST of flame from the far side of the ridge that rattles rocks and Cosmos.  Knocks him to the ground.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Holy shit...Holy shit!
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher stares with wonder over the hill.  He figured it out.  There's a couple of dozen worms, unburnt and thrown free.  He picks one up, looks at it.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">You motherfuckers stole all the oxygen.
<P ID="spkdir">(realizes)
<P ID="dia">And you can give it back.  Motherfuckers.  I gotta tell someone.  It could work.  It could work here...
</p><p><p ID="act">He turns, looks - the radio is still burning.  He snatches it up, scorches him.  Tries to put it out.  It's cooked.  Deceased.  He's devastated.  Drops to his knees.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">No!!  Not after all this.  No!!!
</p><p><p ID="act">It ain't gonna work ever again.  All the shouting isn't gonna make a difference.  He knows the answer, he knows how to save the species and there's no one he can tell.
</p><p><p ID="act">As he stumbles back onto his feet, he's jarred the switch that links to AMEE's display.  it comes on, shows:
</p><p><p ID="act">AMEE'S POV
</p><p><p ID="act">The fire on the far side of the ridge.  She's approaching it.  And fast.
</p><p><p ID="act">BACK TO SCENE
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher stares at it for a moment...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">My day is not getting better, is it.
</p><p><p ID="act">There's a look on his face somewhere between inspiration and fear.  Like he's got an idea.  But it might be a really, really bad one...
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. MARS SURFACE - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">AMEE skitters along.  Moving fast.  Climbs up and ever so carefully peers over the ridgeline.
</p><p><p ID="act">AMEE'S POV
</p><p><p ID="act">The Cosmos down below.  And beneath it, his feet sticking out as he works on something, Gallagher.  He messed with her once; she recognizes him.  If she could bare her teeth like an angry dog, she would.  AMEE considers for a moment.  Makes her move.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. COSMOS SITE - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">She comes down the hill.  Twelve, sixteen, twenty-foot strides.  Doing forty or fifty miles an hour easy.  And all but silently.  Gallagher hasn't yet responded.  And then she's all the way to him.  She rears up to strike and -
</p><p><p ID="act">And Gallagher, in his skivvies, bursts up from where he's buried himself in the sand, avenging, entrenching tool high over his head, already swinging as AMEE wheels back around and...He chops off both her eyes.  Sidesteps as she rushes him blindly and backhands her in her electronic Marine cranium from behind.
</p><p><p ID="act">Whatever he's hit, the jolt stiffens his arm, throws him off.  The tool stays embedded.  She runs headlong into the Cosmos.  Smashes, stumbles, falls.  And before she can get back up to her feet...He wraps the sleeve of his shirt around his hand, rescues the entrenching tool and deals a death stroke to the silver arachnid.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Robust real-time response to the environment, my butt.
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher grabs his satchel of tools and begins to unbolt her as fast as he can.  Checks his watch.  Whatever he's racing, there's only minutes to go.
</p><p><p ID="act">Deep within the electronic entrails of AMEE, he dredges up her Esource.  Size of a soda can.  POWER CELL that runs her for year and a half.  HUMS as he removes it from its shielded container.  It's 280 volts.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Work.
</p><p><p ID="act">He rips open a panel on the Cosmos, yanks out the dead cell and hooks the new one in.  It doesn't fit.  He's got nothing left but a couple of wrenches and a tube of epoxy.  Glues it in place.
</p><p><p ID="act">Runs the launch Diagnostics on his HCC.  It flickers, goes to yellow, flashes on and off to green.  He yanks back on his suit.  Grabs a handful of the uncharred worms and seals them in the container that held the Esource.
</p><p><p ID="act">Stuffs it in a side pocket.  Looks at the top of SRV.  Wedges himself under some cables and wiring on the top.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">This oughta be interesting.
</p><p><p ID="act">Checks his watch.  It's now or never.

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">Bowman's got her suit on.  Screens show the apogee launch and a slingshot around the backside.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SKAVLEM (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Copy that, Ares, you are go for return.
</p><p><p ID="act">She slides into the darkness.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. COSMOS SITE - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher watches the second hand come around, takes a deep breath, and...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Fuck you, Mars.
</p><p><p ID="act">...slaps the helmet shut.  Hits ignition.  Nothing happens.  Then the GRINDING of thirty-year-old PUMPS.  And then a GIANT flaming ROAR.  And it launches.
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher, epoxied to the top, is pinned flat.  Face squashes, eyes bulge.  Ship starts to glow friction.  Thirty-year-old paint chips off like tiny shooting stars burning away as this reverse comet leaves the atmosphere.
</p><p><p ID="act">We can hear him roaring at the top of his lungs as the ROCKET BLOWS by and...
</p><p><p ID="act">MARS
</p><p><p ID="act">pulls away in the b.g.  Rapidly contracting.  FROM FILLING the FRAME, TO a red circle below.  Atmosphere thins, the friction and flame decrease and disappear.
</p><p><p ID="act">SKY
</p><p><p ID="act">turns from deep red to maroon to black as he blows through the clouds into the outer reaches of the Mars atmosphere and beyond.  The ENGINES STOP.  Fuel's expended.  And...
</p><p><p ID="act">Quiet.  He comes skittering back from the edge of blacking out.  He floats silently, orbiting the planet, slowing receding into the distance.  Until he's...gone.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. ARES - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">We see Bowman THROUGH the front viewport.  Unhurried.  Making the last of her preparations.  Downhearted and slow.  Then -
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">She's strapped in now.  Counter on a screen is ticking down.  13, 12, 11...She tries to allay her horror at what she's doing.  Reaches for the mike.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">Countdown continues.  Nine, eight, seven...Then just breaking the horizon way out in front of her, a shiny metallic speck breaches into the light.  It's a man, glued to thirty-year-old spacecraft.  Four, three...She slams down an abort button, as with the other hand she twists the radio over to the suit-to-suit frequency.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">Gallagher...
</p><p><p ID="act">No response.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. COSMOS

</p><p><P ID="speaker">SCHLISSEL
<P ID="dia">There's secondary object in orbit.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK
</p><p><p ID="act">Bowman has flipped a set of joysticks/collectives out from underneath the dash in front of her.  She's shouting at the computer.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">Reroute.  Orbital maneuvering.  Power the OMS, power the R.C.S.  I need roll, pitch, yaw, X, Y, Z.  Now.  Goddammit now!

</p><p><P ID="speaker">LOWENTHAL
<P ID="dia">No!  No, there's no fuel for maneuvering.  Stop her!
</p><p><p ID="act">Skavlem shakes his head.  Not a chance.  Nor would she listen to him.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOROKOVSKI
<P ID="dia">She is going to burn fuel to rescue this man without enough to come home?
<P ID="spkdir">(very Russian of her)
<P ID="dia">I like this girl.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK
</p><p><p ID="act">Which is exactly what she does.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">I want ten milliliter bursts.  Now!
</p><p><p ID="act">And puff, puff, puff...
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. MARS ORBIT - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">Ares, bit by bit, dives down into a smaller orbit to catch up with the Cosmos.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK
</p><p><p ID="act">Bowman grabs the whole orbital maneuvering assembly, yanks it out of the flight deck, turns and rushes from the sphere.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. COSMOS - ORBIT - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">As he watches it come closer, he's depleted what little air there was in the suit.  And starts to die.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ARES - MEV DECK - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">It's now an empty docking port.  Bowman careens in.  No artificial gravity here.  Floats as she shouts at the computer.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">I want a 180 degree.  Now!

</p><p><p ID="slug">INT ARES - MEV DECK
</p><p><p ID="act">Kate plugs the maneuvering deck in with one hand, slaps an oxygen bottle on and her helmet shut.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">Seal this level!  Open the dock.
</p><p><p ID="act">Clips herself in just in time as the DOORS  behind her SLAM shut and the giant doors in front of her open.  Air purges.  And in front of her, 300 yards away, is the Cosmos.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">Gallagher!  Gallagher!
</p><p><p ID="act">He doesn't respond.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. COSMOS - CLOSE ON HIM
</p><p><p ID="act">Because he's unconscious or dead.  His head lolls there.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ARES - MEV DECK
</p><p><p ID="act">There's no time left for subtlety.  Bowman yanks a device off the wall.  It looks like a 40mm rifle with a power cable.  Points it at him.  Triggers it.  It's a huge laser pointer.  Lights him up.  Shouts to the computer.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">Hard Dock!
</p><p><p ID="act">The ship pauses, like it's thinking.  And refuses.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">ANNUNCIATOR (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Object out of range.  Emergency braking will commence in seven seconds.
</p><p><p ID="act">Ares turns off the pointer.  Kate throws it angrily aside.  There's a linear acceleration track on the side of the wall with a line thrower attached.  She clips in.  Grabs something the size of a medicine ball with seventy nozzles sticking out of it in her free hand.   And shouts -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">Last acquisition.  Line release.  Full velocity.
</p><p><p ID="act">And it does.  The linear accelerator wrenches her violently along the track and hurls her into space.  REEL and a line behind her WHIR.  It's like the world's largest angler has cast her into the void.
</p><p><p ID="slug">EXT. ORBIT - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">Tumbling, she half-regains her bearing, holds out the mini-thrust ball.  Shouts something at it.  FIRES.  Drags her by the arm towards Cosmos.  She hits it.  Twisting, flailing, way too hard.  Half knocks herself out.  Recovers, clips in with the tether on her suit.  Gallagher is completely insensate.
</p><p><p ID="act">She shouts something in the silence we can't hear.  The reel in the ship starts to spin.  So damn fast it's smoking.
</p><p><p ID="act">The Cosmos is reeled in, oscillating wildly at the end of the line.  The Ares, giant by comparison, is about to swallow up the tiny SRM and its two passengers.  At 45 mph.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT./EXT. ARES - MEV DECK
</p><p><p ID="act">Dock comes careening at them.  They're both going to be squashed like bugs.
</p><p><p ID="act">Bowman slashes loose the line.  And fires everything left in the portable thrust engine at once.  Blue plasma flares.  Her arm is wrenched wildly, pulled from its socket.  But...
</p><p><p ID="act">The Cosmos spins 180 degrees as they plunge through the opening of the port into the Ares.  They're on the lee side as the Cosmos hits the far side of the dock like a freight train.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">Seal!  Emergency atmosphere.  Now!
</p><p><p ID="act">The DOCKING DOORS SLAM SHUT.  The room is buffeted in white mist.  She grabs an emergency cutting tool, hooks it into the front of Gallagher's suit.  Rips it open from stem to stern.  He's limp, unresponsive.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">No.  Not after all that, dammit.  No.
</p><p><p ID="act">She checks, he has no pulse.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">Dammit, no!
</p><p><p ID="act">A first aid station is bolted into the wall.   She grabs him by the shirtfront, launches them over there.  Takes out a pair of pre-gummed HEART PADDLES, slaps them onto his chest and FIRES them.
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher is thrown entirely across the room by the current.  Slams into the far wall.  Opens his eyes.  Starts to breathe.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Hey, I knew you wouldn't leave without me.
<P ID="spkdir">(beat)
<P ID="dia">You promised.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT

</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">Mission Control.  This is Ares.  Recovered ground crew.  Request recalc and reconfiguration for return flight.  Orbit is stable but diminished.
</p><p><p ID="act">The scientists have been figuring madly.  And they don't like what they're coming up with.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">LOWENTHAL
<P ID="dia">We can get 'em back.  Slowly.  Fifty extra days.  And we're not going to be able to support food and and air for two people.
</p><p><p ID="act">Russert nods.  Motions to Skavlem.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">Bowman and Gallagher listen as -
</p><p><P ID="speaker">SKAVLEM (V.O.)
<P ID="dia">...that travel has been increased by approximate two months.  Concern is that available life support is untenable for duration and current crew strength.
</p><p><p ID="act">Gallagher's unimpressed.  Worms tried to eat him, robots tried to kill him and they're worried about this?  Feh.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Scientists.  Scientists sent us here.  Scientists figured the whole thing out with Mars.  I hate to bring this up, but they got us into this whole mess in the first place.  Hell, they shouldn't be allowed to drive 'cause they miss the turnoff as they consider the ramifications of the internal combustion engine.
</p><p><p ID="act">He picks up the mike.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Hey, guys.  How 'bout we come about halfway home and you send a ship with air and food and stuff to meet us?  In the middle.  And we don't have to get all the way back.  Huh?
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT
</p><p><p ID="act">Schlissel nods.  That'd work.  As Russert, Lowenthal and the big guys start to talk this over, Borokovski motions to Schlissel and his new friend the Tech.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOROKOVSKI
<P ID="dia">I know where there is a rocket in Uzbeckistan.  For cheap.  A friend of mine has kept it.
</p><p><p ID="slug">INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY
</p><p><p ID="act">OUT the window, Mars drifts by in the view port.  Bowman looks at it kinda sadly.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">So much for saving humankind and living on Mars.  I guess the worms took care of that.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">The worms are not our enemy.  They're our friends.
</p><p><p ID="act">He's pulled the container out of his pocket.  Unscrews it to show her the little slimy monsters.  She recoils in horror.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">You brought them back?  Are you insane??
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">It's okay, I'm pretty sure they don't like titanium.
<P ID="spkdir">(then)
<P ID="dia">We're gonna live.  On Mars.  Hell, maybe even back on Earth. Maybe anywhere we want.  And the reason we're gonna live, is the damn worms.  Yeah, they ate all the algae, and damn near everything else, but they store and excrete oxygen.
</p><p><p ID="act">She finds this hard to believe.  But he explains.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">That's why we could breathe.  You should have seen these suckers burn when they went up.  I had some time to think about this.  I was in orbit for six minutes before you found me.  I shoulda been dead.  But the air locked in the suit was almost pure O2.  'Cause of the worms.  We didn't just find a new place to live on, we may have saved our old one.  Toxic waste, they'll eat it.  Poisonous landfills, they'll eat it.
</p><p><p ID="act">She's still trying to absorb all this.  It's been a long couple of days.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">God's got a sense of humor.  He's giving us another chance.  If we can all get along this time.  Burchenal knew somewhere that it wasn't the science, it was about having something to believe in.  Bud always knew.  Wonders of the deep.  We just had to go to Mars to remind ourselves of what we should have been able to see back on Earth.  It's not all about us.  We can't kill everything and survive.
</p><p><p ID="act">Bowman looks back at Mars.  Astounded.  Believes.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">You wanna tell them back on Earth the species is saved and we're gonna live?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">How should I know, I'm the janitor.
<P ID="spkdir">(then)
<P ID="dia">Look, Commander...I just fought off half a million screaming nematodes, and a killer robot and glued myself onto a rocket to get offa Mars, and I was wondering...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">If you could kiss me?
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Yeah.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">Yeah.
</p><p><p ID="act">He does.  She kisses him back.  They continue for a long damn time.  Finally, they break apart and...
</p><p><P ID="speaker">BOWMAN
<P ID="dia">It's an extra fifty days back.
</p><p><P ID="speaker">GALLAGHER
<P ID="dia">Gee, wonder what we'll find to do with ourselves.
</p><p><p ID="act">As she starts to laugh...
