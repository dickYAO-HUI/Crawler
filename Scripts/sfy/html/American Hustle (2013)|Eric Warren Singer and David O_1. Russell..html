<b>    TITLE CARD: SOME OF THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED
</b>
<b>    OVER BLACK: APRIL 26, 1978, PLAZA HOTEL, NEW YORK
</b>
<b>1   FADE IN:                                                        
</b>

<b>2   INT. PLAZA HOTEL WINDOW NYC - DAY                               
</b>
    IRVING ROSENFELD, not a small man, gets dressed and
    meticulously constructs his combover. Camera WRAPS AROUND,
    see his hands with rings adjust his dark velvet suit, up to
    his face, serious, concentrated, intense, he is composing
    himself before a performance.

    Irving is now dressed, ready, and walks down the hall to
    another room.

<b>3   SECOND PLAZA HOTEL ROOM
</b>
    Irving composes himself -- looks     
    into cramped surveillance closet, there are FBI Agents -- we
    only see their hands and arms -- he looks at monitors -- sees
    a BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE OF ANOTHER ROOM ON MONITOR: MAYOR
    CARMINE POLITO, swath of salt and pepper hair, cream suit,
    pinky ring, Rotary Club pin -- ALONG WITH CARL ELWAY, preppie
    shady businessman.

    He exhales pressure, turns as CAMERA PANS TO: SYDNEY PROSSER
    (who will also be known for some time as EDITH GREENSLY),
    stylish crafty smart. They stare at each other intensely --
    they have a deep and emotional relationship. A DOOR BANGS
    OPEN, and in walks RICHIE DIMASO, Bronx-born. He stands
    there.

<b>                         RICHIE DIMASO
</b>               What are you doing, going behind my
               back? Telling people I'm screwing
               up this operation? I got you a
               suite at the fuckin' Plaza Hotel!

<b>                         IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>               The shittiest suite at the Plaza
               Hotel.

<b>                         RICHIE DIMASO
</b>
               What?!

<b>                         IRV ROSENFELD
</b>               The shittiest fuckin' suite.

<b>                         RICHIE DIMASO
</b>               Based on what--?
<b>                                       2.
</b>
<b>                         IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>
               And the food is wrong, and--What is
               this? You, like, went in my closet
               or something?

<b>                         EDITH GREENSLY
</b>               No

<b>                         IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>               Are you dressing him like you're
               dressing me now?

<b>                         EDITH GREENSLY
</b>                   (shakes her head)
               No, what are you thinking? This
               isn't all about you, you know that.

<b>                         RICHIE DIMASO
</b>               What, did you try to dress me so I
               would look like him?

<b>                         EDITH GREENSLY
</b>               No, you're not dressed like him,
               all right?

<b>                         RICHIE DIMASO
</b>               But I do, I look like him.

<b>                         EDITH GREENSLY
</b>               No, he's in like, velvet. Come on.

<b>                         IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>               You asked me to show you how this
               was done, you wanna fuck it up be
               my guest.

<b>                         EDITH GREENSLY
</b>               What is your problem?


<b>                         RICHIE DIMASO
</b>               Hey, look, I never laid a hand on
               her, all right? Is that what this
               is about?

<b>                         EDITH GREENSLY
</b>                        (British accent)
               Well technically, that's not true.

<b>                         RICHIE DIMASO
</b>               Look, we never had sex ok? I just --
<b>                                                            3.
</b>

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
</b>               What'd I do? I put my hand like
               this --

    Richie reaches out and puts his hand on Irving's face very
    carefully, not forcefully.

    Irving swipes it away violently the second it touches his
    face.

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          Don't you fucking touch me. That
          bothers me --

          really wanted to fucking bother
          you, this is what I'd do.


    Richie takes his hand and destroys the combover Irving spent
    so much time creating. Irving just stands there, hair ruined,
    staring at Richie.

          of it.

<b>                     EDITH GREENSLY

</b>              It takes some time, ok.

    Edith walks over to Irving who is still standing there in
    silence with his hair all over the place. She carefully
    starts helping him put it back together.

<b>                        RICHIE DIMASO

how things can be done better as DRY CLEANING WORKER nods.

</b>Yes, I fell in love. My God, I
fell in love. Yes. But you know
what? I thought you were
mysterious like my mother until it
turned out that mysterious just
meant depressed, hard to reach. I
mean, I'm dying here! And you need
somebody who's gonna be quiet like
you. You're young, you're
beautiful. You gotta find somebody
else. You gotta go out and get
some friends all right? Don't sit
inside --

<b>          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

that I get anxiety when I have to
meet people. You know how hard that
is.

</b>Yeah but you can't just stay in the

Alright? And I can't-- I mean,
look, I can't trust you with it
anyway. That fire and everything. I
can't trust to leave you with

nothing.

          I'm not saying that I would, but
          I'm saying that I could. And I'm
          saying that that is why I don't
          like divorce, Irving. Women do that
          in divorces. Women get the
          children, and then the fathers
          never see them. My mother never got
          divorced. My grandmother never got
          divorced. There are NO divorces in
          my family. I am not getting a
          divorce.

     Dim cell, lit only from small high barred window, no lights

     eyes, a shadow of her confident self -- pale, scared, hair
     flat, stringy, unglamourous, pacing, rocking.

               It's like a fucking asylum. Joe, is

               it's scary. Maybe I wanted to scare
               you. I don't know. Maybe it was my

     Richie bends down to Edith who is sitting on the floor in the
     corner and hands her the cup and saucer. She lifts the cup
     but her hand is shaking almost violently as she raises the
     cup to her lips.

          It's so crazy -- it's clear to me,
          but it's not clear to you. He uses
          you, Edith, to protect himself. To
          protect his son and his wife in

          ring on her finger, he adopted her

          have two cars. What does she do all

          she plays with her nails, she
          watches T.V., and she spends your

he's saying.

her into him. He takes her hand -- puts it on his face,
makes her feel his cheek and forehead with her hand. It is
intense. She prepares for him to kiss her but he steps back.
They are both excited. They stare at each other. The air is
thick with tension, Richie exhales and leaves.

      kisses her cheek, then her mouth.

      Irv and Rosalyn squeeze hands on the table. SHE KNOCKS BACK A
      GLASS OF RED WINE as a plate of Chicken Picatta is served to
      the table.

      They all drink.

          one.

</b>              (shows her nails)
          I chip them moving furniture, it's
          my obsession -- Moving, re-
          decorating, it makes me feel better
          like exercise. There's this top
          coat that you can only get from
          Switzerland and I don't know what
          I'm going to do because I'm running
          out of it but I LOVE the smell of
          it.

<b>                    DOLLY POLITO
</b>          I can get that for you, of course.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
</b>          There's something, the topcoat,
          (sniffs nails) it's like perfumey
          but there's also something rotten?
          I know that sounds crazy, but I
          can't get enough of it.

Dolly laughs.

sniffs, closes his eyes, nods without even looking.

                a small jet. It doesn't even have
                to take off, cause I know you're so
                worried about how much money the

                of the house and I could see him
                coming. He was holding a lantern,
                and it was in the blizzard and I
                knew he was gonna be angry. So I
                went to intercept my father because
                I knew if he saw what my brother
                was doing he was going to kill him.

      "bodyguards" - the sheik in the front.

      The Sheik hands the ceremonial knife to Carmine and bows his
      head --

<b>                          CARMINE POLITO
</b>                Hello Sheik, my friend. Welcome.
                On behalf of the great state of New
                Jersey I want to welcome you to New
                Jersey. I know that was redundant.
                I'm sorry. I'm just very nervous.

          about? They're casino guys.

<b>                    CARMINE POLITO
</b>          They are businessmen.

<b>                     RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          We came all this way, Irving. We
          should be here. What's everybody
          scared of? There's nothing to be
          scared of.

Richie stares down Irv, Edith pulls Richie back -- Rosalyn is
starting to go down a SPIRAL OF DEPRESSION as she looks
increasingly uncomfortable.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
</b>              (re: the mob guys)
          Those are the guys you're all
          scared of? Those guys over there?
          They don't scare me.

She glares at Edith and Irv and pivots to walk to the bar.

<b>                     IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          Rosalyn!
<b>                                                        88.

But she's already on her way over to the MAFIA MEN at the bar
who GREET HER WARMLY as Irv, Edith, Richie, and Carmine
watch.

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          I love this!

Rosalyn walks up to PETE MUSANE, CHARISMATIC, 30 and sits
down in between all the Mafia guys.. THE OTHER THREE SALT AND
PEPPER MAFIA GUYS LAUGH AND TALK WITH Rosalyn - who gulps a
glass of PROSECCO and IS REFILLED BY PETE MUSANE.

<b>                     ROSALYN ROSENFELD
</b>          Hi.   Can I sit here?

Carmine whispers to Irv as he watches Rosalyn talk to the
Mafia guys.

<b>                    CARMINE POLITO
</b>          Irving, this is not a good idea.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
</b>          How you guys doing? Everybody over
          there is really scared of you guys,
          you know that?

She knocks back the prosecco. She seems relieved.

Dolly ushers her kids to the door.

</b>          Kids, I want you to go up and get

Irving and Edith watch in horror at Rosalyn.

<b>                    EDITH GREENSLY
</b>          It's a disaster.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
</b>          I would do it in all black and gold
          and I would do this bar like a big,

          because she's so beautiful --

He touches the front of her huge Farrah overhang bangs.
Richie, Irving, Carmine, and the Sheik walk up to them.

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          How do you do?

<b>                    PETE MUSANE

Irving takes the glass of prosecco out of Rosalyn's hand and
puts it on table.

<b>                    PETE MUSANE AND GUYS
</b>          Ohhhh, heyyyyy! Come onnn!

<b>                    ROSALYN
</b>          It's because he's a party pooper.
          He's so boring.

Irving stares fuming at Rosalyn and the guys, he nods and
forces a smile good naturedly as they put prosecco glass in
his hand. He knows how to fake it.

The Sheik acknowledges them with a nod. Irv is extremely
uncomfortable.

<b>                    PETE MUSANE
</b>          Mr. Sheik, as a sign of our

<b>                    PETE MUSANE
</b>          He's in the back room.

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          It's a sign of disrespect to do
          business on the first meeting.

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          That's not true. I don't know what

          He's got it all wrong.

</b>          Well, don't leave him back there in
          the back room waiting. Come on,

Rosalyn reaches to have her glass refilled by Dick Helsing
when one of the other guys NUDGES her hip in her tight dress
and she drops into Pete Musane's lap.
<b>                                                               91.

       Irving turns and heads with dread towards the back door with
       Carmine, Richie, and the Sheik. Sydney, worried about Rosalyn
       with Musane, decides to hang back.

                 In his prior reputation as an
                 enforcer from twenty years ago, he
                 was known to never bury a body

</b>          You sure you don't want to go into
          the Ocean Bar? It's really, it's
          beautiful in there.

<b>                    VICTOR   TELLEGIO
</b>          I'm very happy I   don't have to go
          there. I like it   here. There's an
          exit. I'm like a   ghost. Nobody
          knows I'm here.

Busboys whip open a white table cloth for the table.

Everyone sits down. Tellegio looks at the Sheik, then over to
Richie.

<b>                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
</b>          Tell him I speak for our friends in
          Florida. We're very excited. It's
          been our lifelong dream to build
          casino resorts on the East Coast.

Richie pretends to translate in the Sheik's ear.

<b>                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
</b>          You told him that? They didn't want
          the Jews to make money, they didn't
          want the Italians to make money,
          definitely don't want the blacks to
          make money. After the oil embargo --
          the gasoline crisis -- the
          hijackings, the Olympics, they
          don't want to see Arabs make money,
          trust me, not on our soil. You can
          tell him this in your own way: I've
          been in the casino business forty
          years. It's scrutinized more
          carefully than any other business.
          Carmine made this legal, but we
          must be careful or they'll take it
          away.

<b>                    CARMINE POLITO
</b>          So, Mister Tellegio, how do you
          think we should approach this? What
          do you want to do?

<b>                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
</b>          If you want to get the gaming
          license and keep it we have to make
          our principal investor here, the
          Sheik, an American citizen.

where this is going.

<b>                     CARMINE POLITO
</b>          To expedite citizenship -- well,
          that requires very special
          treatment.

<b>                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
</b>          You would know the right people to
          do that, Carmine.

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          Carmine knows everybody.

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD

</b>          Who is this guy? (to Irving) What
          are you, a farmer?

Richie and Tellegio both laugh.

<b>                    CARMINE POLITO
</b>          Mr. Tellegio, I'm sorry, this is

Everyone stares increasingly tense at Tellegio in silence.
This could go wrong at any minute. Tellegio looks over to
Richie and points to the Sheik.

Irving watches in horror as --

Sheik swallows hard and looks to Richie. It's a very tense
moment for everyone at the table.

Tellegio stares. Everyone hangs on this. Irving and Richie
share a look -- what is he doing?

A DRUNK, AL KOWALSKI, a working man, friend of the Mayor
BARRELS INTO INTO THE TABLE, spilling drinks. Tellegio's guys
jump in and grab him and start to pull him away.

<b>TELLEGIO GLARES BACK AT THE INTRUSION.

</b>          Al, I'll be right behind you, okay?
          Trust me.

Paco Hernandez/Sheik stands up and reaches over to Tellegio
to shake his hand. Irving panics. THE MENACING DEEP BASS

passable in Arabic.

Victor leans over to talk to Carmine.

Carmine nods.

<b>                    SYDNEY PROSSER
</b>          This is me.

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          What do you mean? What are you
          doing an accent? An American
          accent?

<b>                    EDITH GREENSLY
</b>          No. There is no English. There's
          only American. There is no English.

Richie looks at her and continues to hold her looking very
confused and flustered.

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          What are you talking about? Stop
          it. You're Edith. You're Edith
          Greensly. I checked your records.

<b>                    SYDNEY PROSSER
</b>          I falsified my records back to

          shit. He's such a liar. He thinks
          that I'm stupid, but I'm not

          arguing. He loves Carmine, but he
          hates that other guy, that curly-
          headed I.R.S. guy, or whatever

          and Carmine right now are at the

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          I can save all of us, and we can
          save money. I can take care of you
          and Danny. OK? But you gotta close
          your mouth.

Rosalyn looks satisfied and points her finger at Irving.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
</b>          I knew it. I have always said,
          Irving, that you are very, very
          hard to motivate properly. And I
          knew that Pete was gonna go over
          there and knock some sense into
          you. I've been reading this book,
          Irving. It's by Wayne Dyer, about
          the power of intention.

Irving can't believe what he's hearing right now.

Rosalyn, very satisfied, reaches over the bed and grabs a
book.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
</b>          And my intention in sending Pete
          over to you was so that you could
          come up with this plan. So, you're
          welcome.

Irving incredulous, thinks to himself how to respond. Forces
himself to say gently --

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          OK. Thank you, Rosalyn. Thank you
          for the plan.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
</b>          You're welcome.

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          I appreciate that. So, I think that
          we should be partners on this.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
</b>          I'm a good partner. Almost better
          than Edith. You ever think about
          that? You ever think about how you
          might have underestimated me?

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          So what is our plan? Tell me the
          plan. What are you gonna do?

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
</b>          I'm going to keep my mouth shut and
          I'm not going to say anything but
          what do I do if Pete calls me? What
          am I supposed to say?

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          You gotta stop talking about your
          government agencies and your I.R.S.
          and your tax and your conspiracies
          and all of that. You're gonna say
          how you were wrong, you were wrong
          about that.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
</b>          I'll tell Pete that I was wrong but
          you know that in real life, I was
          right for saying all that stuff
          because then that spurred on the
          actions that made you come up with
          this plan. So I will tell Pete.

<b>                      IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>                (holding his head)
<b>          OK.

               between fingers)
          The power of intention Irving. The
          power of intention.

Irv is doing everything he can to hold it together.

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          OK. You were right.

Rosalyn gets up from the bed and walks over to Irving.

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
</b>          You're so smart. Good job, peaches.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
</b>          Irving, I've been doing a lot of
          thinking and -- you need to grow
          up. And you need to face the
          facts. And I think that both of us
          will be a lot happier if we get a
          divorce.

As he listens to words he has been saying himself for months,
now spoken as Rosalyn's idea.
<b>                                                              133.

</b>                 Just think about it. (kisses him)
                 These things are never easy.

       Irving starts walking away towards the door.

<b>                            IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>                 Alright.

</b>          I appreciate the fact that you all
          came in person, but the trip was
          really unnecessary because this

          with a simple wire transfer. As a
          matter of fact this is the number

them. Richie stares at the paper, but doesn't touch it.

Irving.
