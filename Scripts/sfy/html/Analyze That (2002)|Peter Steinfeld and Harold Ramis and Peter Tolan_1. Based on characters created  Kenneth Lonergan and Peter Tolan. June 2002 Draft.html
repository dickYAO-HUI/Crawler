<b>FADE IN:</b>

<b>INT. DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHT</b>

Two men, CAESAR and MARTY "DUCKS," stand at  the   end of the
deserted bar, talking quietly, oblivious to  the   exotic dancer
grinding her pelvis on a pole in the middle  of   the small
stage. Body language and charisma tell us   that   Caesar is the
boss, "Ducks" his lieutenant.
<b>                         DUCKS</b>
           It's Peezee. Gotta be.    He hates your
           fuckin' guts.
<b>                         CAESAR</b>
                   (brooding)
           I don't know.
<b>                         DUCKS</b>
           Who else knew about the money? And
           how did Peezee know they popped Tony
           Cisco when we didn't even hear about
           it 'til last night?
<b>                         CAESAR</b>
                   (sighs heavily)
           I don't know.
<b>                         DUCKS</b>
                   (pressing)
           What is so hard to understand here?
           You said yourself Peezee was a
           mamaluke and you couldn't trust him.
           Now suddenly you're soft on the guy?
<b>                         CAESAR</b>
           I just don't think it was him.
<b>                         DUCKS</b>
           Okay, I'll bite. If not Peezee, then
           who?
<b>                         CAESAR</b>
                   (slowly rising to
                    his full height)
           I think it was you, Ducks.
Caesar starts to walk away as the bartender, now holding a
sawed-off shotgun, moves closer to Ducks. The exotic dancer
splits in a hurry through a curtain at the back of the stage.
<b>                         DUCKS</b>
                   (scared)
           You gotta be kiddin'!
Caesar stops at the door where two of his soldiers have

<b>                                                             2.</b>
appeared, holding AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
<b>                          DUCKS</b>
            Caesar, you know me! What kind of
            fuckin' idiot would I have to be to
            try that shit with you?
<b>                          CAESAR</b>
            A dead fuckin' idiot.
As he walks out the door, the soldiers OPEN FIRE on Marty
"Ducks." Caesar doesn't look back.

<b>PULL BACK TO:</b>

<b>TV SCREEN</b>
The title credits come up on the made-for-cable series we've
been watching, "Little Caesar." CLAPPING AND CHEERING from
<b>O.S.</b>
<b>WIDEN TO:</b>

<b>INT. SING SING PRISON - NIGHT</b>

Maximum-security prisoners are gathered around watching their
favorite show in the rec room. In the front row is PAUL VITTI,
former New York crime boss, and a couple of other wiseguys.
<b>                           VITTI</b>
            Garbage.   Change the channel.
<b>                           WISEGUY</b>
            Okay, Paul.
The WISEGUY gets up and starts switching channels on the TV.
A couple of CONVICTS in the back start to protest.
<b>                           CONVICT</b>
            Hey!   What're you doin', asshole!
Vitti turns and stares at them.      They fall silent
immediately.
<b>                          CONVICT</b>
            Sorry, Mr. Vitti. Didn't mean any
            disrespect.
<b>                           WISEGUY</b>
            Punks.
Vitti turns the page and sees a huge headline in the Post:
MOB SHRINK TELLS ALL. He gets up, agitated.

<b>                                                             3.</b>
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          I'm going to bed.
Vitti stands up and heads back to his cell.

<b>                                                   CUT TO:</b>
<b>INT. CELL BLOCK - MOMENTS LATER</b>
As Vitti approaches his cell, he sees a prison guard standing
by. His cellmate, EARL, a giant of a man, comes out of their
cell carrying his bedroll and a box containing his other
meager possessions.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
                  (suspicious)
          What's goin' on, Earl?
<b>                        EARL</b>
          They're transferring me.
<b>                           VITTI</b>
          Why?
<b>                        EARL</b>
                  (shrugs)

He notices something in the box.

warily steps into his cell.

<b>INT. MEMORIAL CHAPEL - DAY</b>
A deluxe casket flanked by elaborate floral displays and an
easel displaying a portrait of the deceased, Dr. Isaac Sobel.
Mourners fill the pews, standees at the back, an overflow
crowd. BEN SOBEL sits in the front row, staring at the
casket with his wife, LAURA, his son, MICHAEL, now a
teenager, BEN'S MOTHER, and her friend, DR. JOYCE BROTHERS.
At the podium, the RABBI is speaking.

          And now I'd like to call on Isaac's
          son, Dr. Ben Sobel, who would like to
          say a few words.
Ben rises and crosses solemnly to the podium.

                  (addressing audience)
          It's very difficult for me to talk
          about my father, because in a sense
          I'm talking about two men.

          One, of    course, is the public Isaac
          Sobel,    the eminent psychotherapist and
          popular    author known to millions of
          readers    around the world.
Laura, Michael and Ben's Mother listen proudly to the eulogy.

          The second Isaac Sobel is the private
          man -- my father -- Dad. And for
          those of you who knew him well and
          knew our family -- well, let's face it

Vitti and another WISEGUY pass through the cafeteria line
with their trays. Vitti now looks catatonic.

Vitti just stares, wild-eyed, actually drooling a little.

A guard, the one who tried to kill him, watches Vitti from
his post. Then he nods to someone across the room.
COYOTE, a heavily-muscled and tattooed gang member, nods in
response.
Vitti walks past the table where Coyote is sitting with other
tough Hispanic gang members.
<b>                        COYOTE</b>
                  (to Vitti)
          Hey, Fredo! Or is it Guido?
His friends laugh.
Vitti stops and stares dumbly at them.

          Just keep walkin', Don Corleone.
There is a tense moment, then Vitti bursts out laughing.
<b>                        COYOTE</b>
          Shut up!
Vitti laughs harder, strangely manic.

But Vitti can't stop. He drops his tray of slop, splattering
food on the men. Coyote leaps to his feet and pulls a shiv.
<b>                        COYOTE</b>
          You're a dead man, jefe!
Coyote lunges at Vitti with the knife, but Vitti suddenly
whirls around, bashes Coyote in the face with his food tray
and bursts into song.

Prisoners and guards stare at him like he's nuts.
Coyote stabs at him again, but Vitti dodges and smashes him
over the head with the tray.

Coyote rushes him, but Vitti sidesteps and hits him in the
face.
Guards move in from all sides.   Vitti jumps up on the
tabletop to escape them.

Laura notices FBI AGENTS CERRONE and MILLER waiting for them
in the living room. Cerrone is an attractive woman in her
late twenties, wearing a dangerously-short skirt. Miller is
a clean-cut man in his thirties.

Ben waves a hand in front of Vitti's face.       Nothing.

          This is how it's been. He sings for a
          while, then he goes completely
          catatonic.
<b>                        BEN</b>
                  (skeptical)
          Really. Can we take him to an

Vitti sits inert on the examination table.

          You already did a neurological work-
          up?

Ben slaps Vitti's face lightly a couple times.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Completely catatonic --
He pulls on Vitti's ears and nose.     Vitti does not react.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Totally gone. Well, I don't think
          he's smart enough to be faking.
          Street smart, yes, but we're talking
          about an I.Q. just north of a bedroom
          slipper.
Ben checks Vitti out of the corner of his eye. No reaction.
Then Ben takes a sharp needle from an instrument tray.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          So if I just stuck him with this
          needle, he probably wouldn't even
          respond.
<b>                          DR. CUTLER</b>
          I don't know.    Try it.
Ben hesitates for a moment to see if Vitti will crack, then

<b>                          BEN</b>
          Okay --
He sticks the needle into Vitti's shoulder.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
                  (bursts into song)

Vitti is sitting at a table facing Ben.     Dr. Cutler observes
from a chair in the corner.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Paul, we're going to    give you some
          tests to assess your    mental condition.
          There's no pressure    -- just answer as

          I'll take that as a yes. Okay, I'm
          going to show you ten cards, each
          containing a picture of an inkblot. I
          want you to look at each card and tell
          me what you see.
<b>                         VITTI</b>
          I see you.   I see him.   I see a table.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Focus, Paul. You haven't seen the
          card yet.
                  (hands him first card)
          What does this look like to you? Take
          your time.
Vitti looks at the wrong side of the card.    It's all white.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          It looks like snow.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          No, Paul, the other side.
Vitti turns it over and makes a face.

<b>                         VITTI</b>
          A bat.   A big bat. Or a weasel.
<b>                        BEN</b>
                  (taking notes)
          Bat or weasel. All right.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          And he's got a little girl -- no, it's
          a little boy -- in his teeth -- and
          he's shakin' him and shakin' him
          'cause the kid didn't wipe himself
          good -- and the kid is screaming
          because the bat-weasel ripped out his
          throat and the blood is shootin' out
          of his neck vein.
                  (pointing)
          That's the blood.
Doctor Cutler looks worried.

<b>                        BEN</b>

<b>INT. U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY</b>
Ben meets with RICHARD CHAPIN, the U.S. Attorney for the
Southern District of New York.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Based on his symptoms and the test
          results, I'd say brief psychotic
          disorder -- if it persists, possibly
          schizophreniform disorder. And Dr.
          Cutler agrees with my diagnosis.
<b>                         CHAPIN</b>
          So he's crazy?

<b>                                          17.</b>
<b>               BEN</b>
Dr. Cutler?   No, he's annoying, but --
<b>              CHAPIN</b>
Vitti.
<b>              BEN</b>
Not crazy. At least not permanently.
In certain people, continuous exposure
to an extremely stressful situation --
soldiers in combat, for instance,
disaster victims, a hostage situation,
or being locked up in a maximum
security prison with someone trying to
kill you -- it can produce a temporary
psychotic state.
<b>              CHAPIN</b>
How temporary?
<b>              BEN</b>
A day, a week, up to a month -- if the
precipitating stressors are removed.
<b>              CHAPIN</b>
        (musing)
Which means he's not going to get any
better while he's still in the can.
<b>              BEN</b>
He could get worse. He could
deteriorate to the point where he'd be
permanently schizophrenic.
<b>              CHAPIN</b>
Then I'd say he's got a real problem,
because he goes before the parole
board in four weeks.
<b>              BEN</b>
You think they'll let him out?
<b>              CHAPIN</b>
Oh, yeah, I'm sure they'll want to
release a major Mafia figure who's now
totally deranged on top of it.
<b>              BEN</b>
        (thinks)
Well, couldn't you release him to    a
halfway house or some place where    he
could get some decent treatment?
Based on my earlier work with him,    I
don't think he's dangerous, and I
think he was making a real effort    to
reform himself.

<b>                                         18.</b>
<b>              CHAPIN</b>
You do, huh?
        (thinks for a
         long moment)
Okay. Then I'll tell you what. I'm
gonna release him into your custody.
<b>              BEN</b>
Mine? Me? No, this is a bad time for
me. My father just died -- and I've
got this bulging disc in my neck --
and we're redecorating, which is a
total nightmare. I can't --
<b>              CHAPIN</b>
You want to see him killed in prison?
<b>              BEN</b>
No, of course not.
<b>              CHAPIN</b>
Or sent to a facility for the
criminally insane.
<b>               BEN</b>
No --

<b>              CHAPIN</b>
Then he's all yours. I'm going to
talk to the Bureau of Prisons and get
you certified as a temporary federal
institution.
<b>                BEN</b>
          (stricken)
What?    I can't be an institution.
<b>               CHAPIN</b>
        (firm)
You've got thirty days to get him in
shape for his parole hearing. That
means sane, sober and gainfully
employed. But let me warn you,
Doctor. If he fucks up in any way --
if he flees, or if I find out that
this whole thing was just a setup so
he could get back on the street and
return to a life of crime -- I will
hold you totally responsible, and I'll
see that you are stripped of your
license and prosecuted to the full
extent of the law. Are we clear?

          Think about it. Locked up, he was
          absolutely no use to me. But back on
          the street, Vitti's still powerful
          enough to pose a threat to both
          families. It's like throwing gasoline
          on a fire.
<b>                        DAVIS</b>
          If we can use Vitti to escalate this

          all away.

          If? People like Paul Vitti     don't
          change. This guy's been a     menace to

          Trust me.
<b>                        DAVIS</b>
          He's gonna head straight for trouble.
          Then all we have to do is sit back and
          pick up the pieces. We could get

And if I seemed a little hard on
Grandpa, it's just that your
grandfather was a hard man in a lot of

<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Minding my own fuckin' business, like
          you should be doin'.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Well, it's a little hard with the live
          sex show going on in the guest room.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          I've been in prison for two and a half
          years. What am I supposed to do?
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Go to a hotel.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          That's what I wanted to do, but you
          told me I had no choice -- it was
          either here or Sing Sing.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          I'm not trying to punish you. These
          aren't my rules, but I have a
          responsibility here. Besides, I
          thought you might like a nice home-
          cooked meal after being in prison that
          long.

<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Yeah, that's what I've been jerkin'
          off about for eight hundred
          consecutive nights -- a nice home-
          cooked meal.
                  (making a jerking
                   motion)
          Ohhhh, tuna casserole.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          That girl is not staying here.

<b>                        VITTI</b>
          I think you're jealous.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Oh, yeah, I'm really jealous.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          I didn't hear nothin' comin' out of
          your room.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          We don't think it's necessary to wake
          the neighbors every time we have sex.

<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Hey, if you're really quiet, you might
          be able to do it without even wakin'
          up your wife.
<b>                         SHEILA (O.S.)</b>
                   (moaning)
          Ohhh.   Ohhh.
Ben looks curiously at Vitti.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          I told her if I wasn't back in two
          minutes to start without me. I gotta
          go.
Vitti heads back upstairs.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          This is not a good start, Paul.
<b>                                                CUT TO:</b>
<b>INT. DINING AREA - NEXT MORNING</b>
Laura and Ben are hosting a brunch for the out-of-town
relatives. Laura offers a basket of bagels to a seated,
older woman.

<b>                                                           32.</b>

<b>                        LAURA</b>
          Aunt Ester, I'm so sorry we had to put
          you up at the hotel. We wanted you
          here with us, but we had an unexpected
          house guest.
She glares at Ben.
<b>                        AUNT ESTHER</b>
                  (sighs)
          Your father always had room for us.

<b>                        BEN</b>
          I'm sorry.
                  (mutters to Laura)
          Next time I lose a parent, I'll be
          sure to reserve the guest room.
A DOOR SLAMS somewhere, then Sheila storms into the room
sobbing, her hair askew, tucking her blouse into her skirt.
<b>                        SHEILA</b>
                  (screaming)
          Go to hell, Paul! You just go to
          hell!

<b>                         VITTI (O.S.)</b>
          Go ahead! Get out of here, you crazy
          fuckin' whore.
Vitti charges into the room, his robe open. From the
reactions of everyone in the room, it's clear he's not
wearing anything under it.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Go back to turning tricks in Jersey
          for all I fuckin' care.
Sheila exits and slams the front door.   Vitti sees everyone
staring at him. He closes his robe.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          How's it goin'?
                  (sees buffet)
          Oh, we got food. Good.
Vitti heads for the buffet.
<b>                        LAURA</b>
                  (smiling)
          Ben?
<b>                        BEN</b>
                  (quickly)
          Paul?

<b>                                                            33.</b>
Vitti bellies up to the buffet, stepping between an older
couple. He eyes the food disdainfully.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Oh, great. Jew food. Who do you have
          to fuck to get some bacon around here?
The woman reacts in horror.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Not you, I'm guessing.

<b>                        BEN</b>
                  (snags Vitti's arm)
          Why don't we go to my office?   I'll
          make you a plate.

<b>INT. BEN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER</b>
Ben and Vitti enter.   Vitti still in his robe.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          What is it with your relatives?   They
          tend to overreact quite a bit.

<b>                        BEN</b>
          I know. All you did was flash
          everybody in the dining room.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          So? From the look of 'em, some of
          those broads haven't seen the old
          salcicc' in a long time. It's good
          for them.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Well, when the paramedics revive my
          Aunt Goldie, I'll be sure to ask her.
          Sit.
Vitti starts for Ben's chair.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Ah ah ah!
He points Vitti to the sofa and takes his own chair.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          So what are you going to do, Paul?
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          What do you mean?
<b>                        BEN</b>
          With your life.

<b>                                                          34.</b>

<b>                        VITTI</b>
          First I'm gonna find out who's tryin'
          to kill me. I'm a target. Somebody
          could shoot right through that window
          -- blow my fuckin' head off.
Ben sees that he's in the line of fire, gets up and moves out
of the way.

<b>                        BEN</b>
          Okay, that's a priority. Have you
          thought about what you're going to do
          for work?
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Yeah. I'm too big for a jockey so
          I was thinkin' maybe a hairdresser.
          They'll call me Mr. Paul.
<b>                       BEN</b>
          Come on. There must be something you
          like to do.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          I like hitting a guy on the head with
          a baseball bat.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Oh, sporting goods. We'll check the
          want ads tomorrow but don't get your
          hopes up. Anything else?
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Shylocking, bookmaking, unions, the
          usual --
<b>                         BEN</b>
          Who are you?
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Who am I? I'm the guy who's paying
          you $150 an hour to play these stupid
          fuckin' games. You know who I am.
<b>                         BEN</b>
          I know that.   I mean what are you?
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          What do you mean, 'What am I?'
<b>                        BEN</b>
          I just want to know how you see
          yourself.

<b>                                                     35.</b>
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          You're making me very fuckin' nervous.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Just answer the question.     What are
          you?
<b>                        VITTI</b>
                  (shrugs)
          I'm the boss.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Really? The boss of what -- Jelly?
          You're not the boss of me. So what
          are you the boss of?
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          You, you're good. I see what you're
          doing here.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          What am I doing, Paul?
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          You're pissing me off is what you're
          doing. Look at me. It's starting
          again, the anxiety.

<b>                          BEN</b>
          I understand.
<b>                           BEN (CONT'D)</b>
          You've    spent your whole life becoming
          who you    are and now you can't be that
          anymore    -- that's gotta be scary. If
          you're    not Paul Vitti the mob boss,
          who are    you?
Vitti is at a loss.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Well, let's think. When you were a
          kid, What did you want to be?
<b>                          VITTI</b>
          I don't know.    Who remembers that
          stuff?
<b>                        BEN</b>
          You must've wanted to be something
          when you were little -- fireman?
<b>                          VITTI</b>
          No.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Baseball player?

<b>                                           36.</b>

<b>                VITTI</b>
No.

<b>                BEN</b>
Astronaut?
<b>                VITTI</b>
No.
<b>                BEN</b>
Al Capone?

<b>                VITTI</b>
Yeah, maybe.    What did you want to be?
<b>              BEN</b>
We're not talking about me.
<b>                VITTI</b>
I am.
<b>               BEN</b>
Fine.   I wanted to be a philatelist.
<b>              VITTI</b>
You wanted to look up people's
assholes all day?
<b>              BEN</b>
No, Paul, I believe you're thinking of
a proctologist. I wanted to collect
rare and unusual stamps.
<b>              VITTI</b>
You must've been a lot of laughs when
you were a kid. Lonely, huh?
<b>             BEN</b>
Oh yeah. Big time.      So what did you
want to be?
<b>                VITTI</b>
It's stupid.
<b>              BEN</b>
You afraid to tell me?
<b>              VITTI</b>
Yeah, I'm afraid.
<b>                BEN</b>
Then tell me.    I'm not here to judge
you.

<b>                                        37.</b>
<b>              VITTI</b>
        (a beat)
Okay. When I was really little --
like seven or eight -- maybe I wanted
to be a cowboy.
<b>               BEN</b>
A cowboy.   Really?
<b>              VITTI</b>
Yeah. My father gave   me a cowboy
suit -- you know, the  vest, the
chaps, the cap guns --  the whole
thing. And he used to   take me up
to my uncle's farm in  New Jersey
and lead me around on  this pony.
Yippee-i-o. You happy   now?
<b>              BEN</b>
So you watched cowboy movies and TV
shows with your father.
<b>              VITTI</b>
Everybody. The whole family.     My
father loved 'Gunsmoke.'
<b>              BEN</b>
Sheriff Dillon.
<b>              VITTI</b>
        (corrects him)
Marshal Dillon.
<b>                BEN</b>
Marshal.    So who were your favorite
cowboys?
<b>              VITTI</b>
This is so fuckin' retarded.
<b>               BEN</b>
Paul!
<b>              VITTI</b>
All right. Gene Autry, Roy Rogers,
the Lone Ranger --
<b>               BEN</b>
Interesting.   They're all good guys.
<b>               VITTI</b>
Yeah, I guess.
<b>              BEN</b>
No, that's important. You didn't want
to be the bad guy. You wanted to be
the hero.

<b>                                                             38.</b>

<b>                          VITTI</b>
          Yeah, so?

<b>                        BEN</b>
          So what happened?
<b>                          VITTI</b>
          I don't know.    Nothing happened.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          So why didn't you become a cowboy?

<b>                        VITTI</b>
          I lived in East Harlem! I joined a
          street gang when I was 12 and that was
          it.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Something else happened when you were
          twelve.
<b>                          VITTI</b>
          What?
<b>                        BEN</b>
                  (prompting)
          Something that made you very sad?
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          The Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to
          L.A. Everybody took it pretty hard.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Something else.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          We playin' a guessing game here?
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Paul! Your father was murdered!
          Right in front of you. Remember?
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Do I remember? I think about it every
          fuckin' day of my life. What's that
          got to do with it?
<b>                        BEN</b>
          It's got everything   to do with it. He
          gave you the cowboy   suit. With a
          white hat. He was    in the mob, but he
          wanted you to be a   good guy, didn't
          he?
Vitti starts thinking about his father and starts to weep.

<b>                                                   39.</b>
<b>                          VITTI</b>
          Yeah.   He did.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          He didn't want you in the gang life.
          He only did it himself so you wouldn't
          have to. He was trying to buy you a
          better life than his.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
                  (crying harder)
          He always said he wanted me to go to
          college. I didn't even finish high
          school.
He really starts sobbing now.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Well, Paul, this could be a  great
          opportunity for you. You're   right
          back where you were when you  were
          twelve. You've got some big   choices
          to make.
Vitti fights to regain control.
<b>                          VITTI</b>
          Okay.   Okay.   That's enough of that
          shit.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          It's not shit, Paul. My point is,
          when you're a child, you think
          anything is possible. Wouldn't it be
          great to think like that now?
<b>                        VITTI</b>
                  (retreating back into
                   his cynicism)
          Yeah, just sprinkle some fuckin' fairy

          an open mind and explore some new
          possibilities. Try some different
          things -- maybe you'll connect with
          one of them. There's a career
          counselor I work with. I can call
          him for you. He may be able to help

Suddenly one of the WINDOWS behind Vitti SHATTERS.
Ben dives for cover. Silence -- then another RAP on the
window. Ben looks out and sees JELLY in the back yard,
tossing stones at the window.

          Oh, yeah?   Watch me.   Drive, Jelly.

Jelly STARTS the CAR and slowly backs out of the driveway.
Ben runs after the car, talking to Vitti through the open
window.

          That's it, Paul. I forbid you to go.

Vitti puts the window up.

SAL MASIELLO, Vitti's old consigliere rises and warmly but
warily welcomes Vitti back into the fold.

Vitti embraces him and they sit down with the others.

          So, Paul, we heard you had some
          trouble while you were away. Some
          'mental' problems.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          No, I'm okay. It was an act. I had
          to pretend I was nuts. There were
          people watching me all the time.

Vitti is trying to sell an $80,000 Audi to the
MacINERNYS, an upscale middle-aged couple. Vitti opens
the trunk.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Look at the size of that trunk. You
          could fit three people in there.

          So what are you driving now?

out a long sword. Confused but desperate, he holds up the
sword to menace the intruders, but the sword suddenly goes

Raoul gushes over a platter of    sushi and sashimi.

Raoul chuckles and glances uncomfortably at his girlfriend.
Ben laughs loudly to cover the awkward moment. He's
suffering from some reaction between the pills and the booze
and he's oddly thick-lipped.

The light from outside barely penetrates the painted windows
of the shabby office.
LOU RIGAZZI, aka "Lou the Wrench," the aging boss of the
Rigazzi family, sits in the half-light as a couple of his

          Nothing. I didn't tell him anything.
          Mr. Rigazzi, can I

<b>                        RIGAZZI</b>
          That must hurt.
Rigazzi pulls out a GUN with a silencer and SHOOTS the
Gunman.
<b>                        RIGAZZI</b>

<b>EXT. BACK-YARD SWIMMING POOL - DAY</b>
A big, family barbecue is going on in a back yard in Queens.
Several children are splashing in an over-sized, above-ground
swimming pool. Oddly, the children appear to be shouting and
laughing but make no sound.
At the barbecue, Nicky Caesar is watching his friend MELLO
turn Italian sausage on the grill.

          I like mine burnt.

          I don't know how you like your

          doin' this. So you got the money?
The wind shifts and blows the smoke from the barbecue in
their faces.

          fucking smoke?

We PULL BACK to reveal the set of "Little Caesar." Assistant
directors and production assistants echo the director:
"We're cut!" "Reset!" "Effects!"
Vitti observes the action sitting in a director's chair,
still brooding over the previous night's events. Raoul sits
next to him.

          This is the problem with shooting on

          authenticity.

Raoul laughs hard.

            You laugh too much.

            So, Paul, you going to join us?
Vitti looks around, his future plans now beginning to form.

He exits.   Vitti turns to Raoul.
<b>                          VITTI</b>
            Coupla things, though. I don't know
            who makes these decisions, but some of

          Yeah, the theater. So how about if I
          bring in some guys that I know -- you
          know, more 'authentic.'

          I would be eternally grateful.
          Anything else?

                  (thinks)
          Yeah. One of those trailers like the

          I'll put that in the works right now.
He hurries off to talk to his assistant.   Jelly comes up to
Vitti.

          either shoot myself or shoot Raoul.
          But it's good cover while I figure out

Ben enters timorously, still carrying his groceries.
Patty LoPresti, Masiello and a couple of other heavyweights

gravity of their mood.

groceries. Ben looks at Patty, trying to gauge her role.

          A supernumerary. An 'atmosphere.' It
          ain't bad. You just stand around all

          pay you eighty bucks.

          Eighty bucks? For standin' around all

          How much you make shootin' craps?

          Today?   About eight hundred maybe.
<b>                        PATTY</b>

<b>                        JELLY</b>
          Another grand. One of the producers

Jelly and Tony Bella drag Ben kicking and screaming to the
edge of the roof and hang him over the edge.
On the ground, Raoul and Vitti look up, watching the action.

Ben drives, pissed off.       Vitti chuckles to himself.
<b>                           BEN</b>
             It's not funny! There was no safety
             harness or anything. They could have
             dropped me.
<b>                           VITTI</b>
             Hey, if you didn't want to do it, why
             didn't you say something?
<b>                           BEN</b>
             I know exactly what that was about.
             You resent the fact that you've been
             put in my custody, so you passive-
             aggressively arranged things to make
             me look like a fool.

                     (turning on a dime)
             Really? I was scared at first, but on
             the second take, I think I found some
             good stuff. I was able to texture the
             screaming --

Vitti is laughing.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Oh, screw you, Paul.   Just screw you.

He pops two pills.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          What, are you self-medicating again?
          And don't give that decongestant
          multi-vitamin bullshit.

<b>                        BEN</b>
          Don't worry about me. Just worry
          about what you're going to say to this
          parole officer. What are you going to
          say? That you've moved out of my
          house. That you've got your old gang
          back together. For what, a high
          school drop-out reunion?
<b>                        VITTI</b>

          fuckin' business.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          It's my business. I want to know.
          I'm a federal institution.
<b>                        VITTI</b>

          The one that's been following us the
          last mile and a half.
Ben jerks his head around to look and sees a black Mercedes
behind him.

          Lose 'em.
<b>                        BEN</b>

Vitti stomps his foot down on Ben's, flooring the

Laura comes out of the house.

             Ben? Where've you been?    What

<b>                            BEN</b>
                      (minimizing)
             I was  in a car chase. There  was a
             little  shooting -- not that much
             really  -- then they -- drove into the
             river.   It wasn't as bad as it sounds.
<b>                           LAURA</b>

<b>                           BEN</b>

             Why? A few days ago you weren't even
             sure you still wanted to be a

<b>                           BEN</b>
             Yeah, but he's an amazing lout, isn't
             he? I can't quit now. You know that.

          Okay!   I dropped him at the club.
<b>                          BEN</b>
          What club?

          Little Darling's in Queens.

<b>INT. CLUB ENTRANCE - MOMENT LATER</b>

Ben enters the nightclub and starts moving through the crowd,
looking for Vitti.
He pushes through and sees Jelly and a few of the guys
watching an exotic dancer, a beautiful young blonde in a
skimpy costume, standing on a platform grinding in mock
ecstasy.

<b>                          BEN</b>
          Jelly!
<b>                        JELLY</b>

          Hey, Doc. What are you doin' here?
<b>                          BEN</b>
          Where's Paul?
Jelly tucks a few bills into her G-string.     She looks at Ben
and winks suggestively.
<b>                        JELLY</b>
          I think she likes you, Doc.     Give her
          a couple of bucks.
Ben reluctantly digs in his pocket and holds out a bill to
the stripper.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Can you break a twenty?
The stripper sensuously fingers the top of her G-string, and
Ben gingerly sticks the twenty in it.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Do I just make my own change?
He tentatively reaches for some smaller bills in her G-string
but she dances away.
<b>                        BEN</b>
                  (calls to her)
          A ten and five ones -- when you have
          the chance.
He turns around to talk to Jelly, but he's already gone.
Ben finds Jelly at a table with Vitti.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Okay, Paul, what's going on?

<b>                        BEN</b>
          I could ask you the same thing.

          What's it look like? We're just
          blowin' off a little steam. What's
          the big deal?

Eddie DeVol enters, flanked by his main guys, AL PACINO and
<b>ENORMOUS BOBBY.</b>

          No. People call me that because I
          look like Al Pacino.

          The actor.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Anybody ever call you Carol Burnett?

          No.   Why?
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          'Cause you look about as much like
          Carol Burnett as you look like Al
          Pacino.
Ben laughs.   Al Pacino glares at him.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          I do see a little Pacino there --
          around the eyes.

          So we're all here. Let's do it.
He heads for the back of the club with his guys.   Vitti and
Jelly start to follow.

Vitti violently shakes off Ben's hand.

He walks away leaving Ben frozen.
Ben watches as they disappear through a door leading to the
back of the club. He starts toward the door.

<b>INT. BASEMENT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER</b>
Vitti is seated at a big table in the crowded, smoke-filled
room. Jelly sits at  his side. He's surrounded by his crew,
about a half-a-dozen guys, and Patty's man, Eddie DeVol.
Several street maps and diagrams are spread out on the table.
<b>                        VITTI</b>

Vitti pulls a street map to the center of the table and taps
a spot downtown.

Ben makes his way down the cramped, dimly-lit stairway and
approaches the door to the basement room.
He raises his hand to knock, then hesitates and stands there
for a moment listening to the MUFFLED VOICES inside.
Suddenly he is grabbed from behind and slammed up against the
door by Enormous Bobby. Bobby slams him against the door a
couple of more times, using Ben's head as a doorknocker. The
door is opened by someone inside and Enormous Bobby shoves
Ben into the room.

has slipped out the other side and disappeared.
Suddenly, a huge steel claw drops down from above and closes
around the top of the armored truck, its sharp points

                  (flipping out)
          What did I do? What did I do? I had
          a perfect life, I threw it away.
<b>                          VITTI</b>
          Don't do this.
Vitti drags him off toward the building structure.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          I can't help it! My life is over!
          I'm going to jail. Some people
          can handle prison -- I'm not one of
          them. I have delicate features. I'm
          small. I'll be way too popular!

          I can't calm down!      I'm gonna die!

          You're not gonna die!

Suddenly, he slaps Vitti hard across the face.      They both
freeze.

          to be there for you. But I just
          wasn't good enough.

          You were good.  It isn't your fault.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          No, it is. Since my father
          died --
                  (starts crying)
          I've lost my way. I don't know
          anything anymore. I mean, what's the
          point? I didn't think it would hit me
          so hard --
<b>                        VITTI</b>

<b>                        VITTI</b>
          He was an asshole -- you said it

<b>                        BEN</b>
          I'm grieving for myself, you fucking

Ben lets it all go, sobbing for all the years of pain.

Vitti looks at him.

                  (crying more)
          I mean, it had to be ten times worse

          I mean, it's like all his hopes for

<b>                        VITTI</b>
                  (starting to cry)
          There I go. You happy now?      You see
          what you're doing here?
Both men are crying now.

          Your father really loved you.

Jelly comes around the corner and sees the two men in a weepy
embrace.

          Oh, boy.    This is bad.

Another huge CRASH as the marshals ram the gates again, this
time tearing loose one of the big hinges.

          Maybe we oughta should go.
Vitti, Ben and Jelly run to the bus, but Eddie pulls a gun
and stops them. Al and Bobby cover Jelly and the rest of the
crew. Vitti backs away slowly.
<b>                        EDDIE</b>
          Did you really think you were gonna
          live through this?

          Yeah, well, nice work.   Mr. Rigazzi

          Rigazzi? I thought he worked for
          Patti LoPresti.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          That's what Patty thought, too. This
          scumbag's been playin' both sides
          against the middle.
<b>                        EDDIE</b>
          There's only one side as far as I'm
          concerned. Mine. What did you think?
          I was just gonna stand by and let some
          fuckin' has-been move back in? So
          long, Mr. Vitti.
He cocks the gun and is about to pull the trigger when Ben
suddenly roars and slams him in the head with his gun. Vitti
and Jelly quickly cover Al Pacino and Enormous Bobby.
<b>                        BEN</b>

          I hate about you fucking sociopaths!
          You just keep changing the rules to
          suit yourselves. Well, not this time,
          you anti-social asshole. You fucked
          with the wrong shrink!
Sitting on Eddie's chest, he presses the gun against Eddie's
nose.

They shove Eddie, Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino into the back
of the armored truck, Vitti gives a signal and the crane
lifts it off the ground.

             What's a sociopath?

The marshals handcuff them.
Suddenly, the marshals hear AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE coming
from the next block.
Uniformed SWAT COPS come running from that direction and
shout to the marshals.

             They're escaping out the back!    Get

The marshals rush toward the sound of the GUNFIRE and

Raoul strides out into the street, furious, still talking
through his bullhorn.

The Captain and the marshals look around and see that they're
on the set of "Little Caesar."
<b>                        CAPTAIN</b>
          What are you doing on my street?
The Captain walks toward Raoul until they are almost face to

          I have a permit!

                  (into his walkie-talkie)
          Release the traffic and reset for
          another take.
On the perimeters of the set, the PA's signal the off-duty
cops who work the set to release the real traffic they've
been holding on the cross streets.
A city bus passes behind Raoul and Tony Bella who are still
screaming at the Federal Marshal.

          Good idea. Change is hard, Paul.    But
          you did the right thing.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Yeah, you, too. You hung in there.
          That took a lot of guts.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          Well, I just --
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          No, you were like an animal back
          there.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          I just vented my displaced aggression
<b>                       VITTI</b>
          No. I'm telling you. You're a
          monster. I saw the beast in you.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          I'm not a beast. I can handle myself
          if I have to --
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Handle yourself? You were fuckin'
          John Wayne.
<b>                         BEN</b>
          Well, I wrestled a bit in high school
          -- 122 pounds.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Yeah, I could tell.   You're good, you.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          I'm not --
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Paul, I just --
<b>                       VITTI</b>
          No. You are good. You got a gift, my
          friend.
Ben gives up.
<b>                         BEN</b>
          Fine.   I have a gift.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          So -- happy ending, huh?

<b>                                                             120.</b>

<b>                        BEN</b>
          Well, I think so.   Don't you feel
          better now?

<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Are you kidding? I feel like shit.
          All that work for nothing. 20 million
          bucks.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          You're grieving -- it's a process.

<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Take it easy, Doc.
<b>                        BEN</b>
          You, too, Paul.
They embrace. Then Vitti starts to walk away toward Jelly
who has been waiting at a respectful distance.
Vitti stops and turns.
<b>                        VITTI</b>
          Hey, Doc!

          'A time and place for us -- '
