   Clean Shooting Draft

       February 1992


<b>    SCREEN IS BLACK
</b>    In the darkness we hear dripping water, the echoing
    approach of two sets of footsteps. There is the sound of
    a sudden, quick scuffle, a heavy fall of bodies.
    THREE BOOMING GUNSHOTS. Two from one gun, one from
    another. So fast and close, they're barely distinguish-
    able. The sound of the SHOTS ECHOES against concrete
    walls and dies away. Silence.
<b>    SLOW, SLOW, FADE IN:
</b>
<b>1   INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE (NEW YORK) - NIGHT                   1
</b>
<b>    FRANK FARMER'S FACE -
</b>    mid to late 30s, peers intently over a smoking gun.     He
    is The Bodyguard.
<b>    ANGLE - HIT MAN
</b>    dead on his  feet, leans against a car. A gun drops
    heavily from  his hand. His life ebbs as he slides slowly
    down the car  door to his knees then falls forward, face
    down on the  cement floor.
    A SLOW PULL BACK reveals that FRANK is lying on top of
    KLINGMAN. Protectively pressed body to body on the
    filthy cement floor of the garage. Klingman, a handsome,
    50-year-old arbitrageur, gasps in barely controlled fear
    as his Armani suit soaks up a black pool of oil. There
    is no movement.
    The two men are lying near the right front fender of a
    black limousine. Blood spreads from the body of the hit
    man, a few yards away. Klingman starts to raise himself
    up but Farmer keeps him pressed to the floor, still
    alert for any further threat.
<b>    MAIN TITLES BEGIN.
</b>    A beat, and VOICES are heard O.S.   Farmer wheels, snub-
    nosed .357 aimed at them.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>               Freeze!
<b>    ANGLE - DOORWAY TO GARAGE
</b>    A uniformed chauffeur freezes in his tracks.   Farmer
    lowers his weapon and speaks.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>                      (calm, but an order)
               Call 911.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                     2.
</b>

     CAMERA has CRANED UP TO a high, almost-frozen WIDE SHOT of
     the scene. It TRACKS AWAY INTO darkness.

<b>2    EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT                                   2
</b>
     Passing traffic reveals the storefront of a TV showroom.
     Inside, behind the reflections of the city lights, all
     the TV sets are showing the same picture, the glittering
     image of a woman singing. (We will recognize the woman
     as Rachel Marron.) We cut tighter and tighter on the
     image until it is almost broken up into its scanning
     lines. Through the city noise comes the sound of her
     song "I have Nothing."


<b>2A   INT. DAN'S APARTMENT - DESK TOP - NIGHT                    2A
</b>     A battered old desk.  Scattered across the top -- a pile
     of blank white paper, a jar of glue, a stack of
     magazines, a pair of scissors, a TV remote control,
     softly in the b.g., a TV is playing the same image we saw
     in the store window, the same song.
     Hands appear. Male hands. They open a drawer and remove
     a pair of translucent rubber gloves. Carefully they put the
     gloves on. The SNAPPING of the rubber is the only sound.
     The hands pick a magazine off the stack: Screen Stars.
     They put the magazine down and pick up the scissors. A
     headline on the cover reads: "RACHEL MARRON'S GREATEST
     TRIUMPH!" The scissors start to cut. Meticulously they
     excise the name "RACHEL MARRON" from the page. With the
     care of a surgeon.

<b>3    EXT. HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE - NIGHT                            3
</b>     A tumultuous crash of screaming, pushing bodies. Arms
     stretch out, cameras flash, sunguns flare, microphones
     are thrust forward. A deafening cacophony of "Rachel!
     Rachel! Rachel! Over here! Over here! This way,
     Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!" We cannot see the object of
     this frenzy. We catch a brief glimpse of an attractive,
     well-dressed young woman (NICKI), exiting with the other
     celebrities, as she is pushed and casually jostled aside
     by the mass of surging fans and media. Her face is calm
     and impassive as she watches from the sidelines.

<b>5    INT. KLINGMAN'S OFFICE DEN - NIGHT                         5
</b>     In a paneled room tastefully hung with a few choice paint-
     ings that reflect Klingman's success as an arbitrageur,
     he pours two snifters of brandy as he speaks with Farmer.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                   3.
</b>
<b>                          KLINGMAN
</b>             Your hands ever shake, Frank?
<b>                           FRANK
</b>             Sometimes.   It's just adrenaline.
<b>                          KLINGMAN
</b>             ... How did you know?
<b>                          FRANK
</b>             I saw him washing the car.
<b>                          KLINGMAN
</b>             I saw him.
<b>                          FRANK
</b>             They don't wash cars on the
             parking levels.
    He hands a glass of brandy to Frank, who looks at it.
<b>                          KLINGMAN
</b>             You know, I'd like you to stay on.
    He passes a small sealed envelope to Frank.
<b>                          FRANK
</b>             I'm not good in permanent
             positions, my feet go to sleep.
    The two men smile at each other. They raise their glasses
    in a joint salutation -- Klingman drinks. Frank doesn't.

<b>6   INT. DARKENED ROOM - DESK TOP - NIGHT                      6
</b>    The rubber-gloved hands are glueing the word "TIME" onto
    a message that is taking the classic form of a ransom
    note. Each word has been cut from a different page and
    is in a different typeface. The note is being assembled
    with such care that it has an unusually neat appearance
    and is quite easy to read. It reads:

    autograph books, notes are thrust forward INTO the CAMERA.
    Again, a mass chanting "Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!"
    Hands of Rachel's entourage accept some of the proffered
    items.

     SLAM of a CAR DOOR. Frank gets out of a cab with two
     suitcases. His house is a modest stucco affair on a
     small lot. He goes up the walk and puts down his suit-
     cases. He looks at rampant foliage and overgrown grass.
     Supermarket circulars cover his doorstep. He picks up a
     few and fishes a bunch of keys from his pocket. A
     curious neighbor peers from behind a net curtain. As the
     door opens, we are aware of a further pile of mail
     inside. Frank's feet push the letters aside and go
     inside. The door shuts.

<b>10   INT. FARMER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                              10
</b>     Farmer has carefully set a place for himself at the table
     in a breakfast nook. A bottle of red wine is open with a
     glass beside it.
     At the stove he stirs and flavors a Boeuf Bourgignon and
     reads a Time magazine. He adds a splash of wine. He
     lifts the pot from the stove and tries a piece of meat.
     At the table, he looks at the place setting and absently
     eats another piece of meat. Finally he sets the pot on
     the plate and eats from it directly while glancing
     through the magazine.

<b>11   INT. DRESSING ROOM - CLOSEUP - CORNER OF DRESSING TABLE    11
</b>     Lots of people are schmoozing in the dressing room.
     There's a loud buzz of excited chatter. Hands are stack-
     ing flowers, good luck messages, cards and cables by the
     mirror. Through the blur and bustle, we glimpse the doll
     with its embroidered ribbon message "RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU."
     Hands casually move it to one side, among the flowers
     resting on the small portable TV set. On the screen is
     an image of Rachel performing on stage, acknowledging
     applause, bowing.
     The doll EXPLODES, SHATTERING the TV, the MIRROR and the

<b>12   EXT. FRANK FARMER'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY                 12
</b>     Frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree, sun-
     glasses on, a glass of iced tea by his side. Strains of
     "DON'T WALK AWAY RENEE" come from a beat-up transistor
<b>     RADIO.
</b>
     An old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back
     and forth over the freshly cut grass.  Throwing knives
     lay scattered nearby. A wooden post is  sticking out of
     the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard.
     BILL DEVANEY, fiftyish, a distinguished-looking black
     gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage Frank in a
     conversation that up to this point hasn't been going well.
     He's Rachel's personal manager.
<b>                           DEVANEY
</b>              So, you won't protect Rachel Marron
              just because she's in show business?

</b>              But the biggest money's in show
              business people.
     Frank says nothing. His  eyes are  closed behind the sun-
     glasses. Devaney picks  up one of  the throwing knives.
     He holds it carefully by the blade  and throws it. It
     misses the post by three feet and  clatters against the
     fence.
     Frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his
     eyes again.
<b>                           DEVANEY
</b>                     (picking up another
                      knife)

     This is enough to distract Devaney from his knife-throwing.

         Yes.    She collects dolls.

Devaney tries to size up whether Frank is kidding him or
not. Frank's face betrays nothing. Devaney gestures with
a knife.

</b>         You're probably deadly with these

He senses an opening and sits down beside Frank for what
he takes to be the first serious talk.

         think this was for real.
                (long pause)
         Farmer, she begged me to get you.
Frank sits up finally and looks at Devaney a long time.
He picks up five throwing knives and stands up.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         All right. I'll come and I'll look
         the situation over. If I take it,
         it's three thousand a week.

</b>                (whistles)
         Okay. You must be very deadly
         for three grand a week.
Frank is now about twenty feet from the wooden post.     He
throws one of the knives. It misses the post and
clatters against the fence.
<b>                        FRANK
</b>         Shit.
Devaney's face drops.   Frank examines the next knife.

</b>                (mumbling)
         I know it's something like...
The second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc
and disappears into some bushes about three feet from
Devaney. Devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind
Frank.
<b>                        FRANK
</b>         Sorry.
Frank raises his hand to throw again, then stops and
motions Devaney off to the side.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         Better not stand right behind me.
Devaney smiles weakly. Frank lets the third knife go
with one smooth motion.
The knife sinks an inch into the center of the post.     THUMP.
Frank's hand arching again.     Throwing the remaining knives.
Both knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical
line with the first one.

<b>13   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - WAVERLY LANE (BEL AIR) - DAY          13
</b>     Frank stops his nondescript Chevy across the quiet street
     from the closed, unmanned gate at the bottom of the Marron
     driveway.
<b>     FRANK'S POV
</b>
     as he looks over the gate, the wall, the heavy vegetation
     and the rising grounds beyond.
     (NOTE: The use of the term FRANK'S POV, is not to be
     taken simply as a camera direction. Rather, it re-
     presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in
     the special way Frank sees. Frank lives by constant
     vigilance, heightened awareness. It is his genius and
     his burden. The audience must be put in the position of
     looking, searching, scanning with him.)
     He has a curious sense of being watched, a kind of prick-
     ling on the back of his neck. As he looks around, a
     black Toyota 4X4, parked some way down the road, drives
     rapidly off -- too fast to get a clear look. He watches
     it go.
     Frank pulls up   to the gate and gets out of his car. He
     grabs a bar of   the gate and pulls. The whole gate
     rattles. Frank    gets back in his car and pushes a button
     on the intercom   box at the side of the gate. A MAN'S
     VOICE CRACKLES   out of the BOX. Transmission is terrible.

     open.

</b>     as he moves up the winding drive through heavily land-
     scaped grounds. Plenty of potential hiding places. The
     mansion is at the top of the hill. The grounds behind
     the mansion fall away.

<b>15   EXT. MANSION - CIRCULAR DRIVE/ENTRANCE AREA - DAY          15
</b>     The mansion is huge. On and on it goes. Frank drives
     PAST the garage area where HENRY, the chauffeur, is
     polishing the mascot on the limousine. One of his arms
     is bandaged. Henry peers at Frank, puts down his cloth
     and walks toward the entrance where Frank is parking.
     Frank gets out, looks around. A painter's truck is
     parked nearby, two painters unloading equipment from it.
<b>                           HENRY

              A doll.
     He goes back to the limousine.
     Frank RINGS the DOORBELL, although the door is not shut.
     EMMA, a fiftyish housekeeper, appears. A man in cover-
     alls comes out past her, carrying a length of timber.

</b>     Frank steps into the foyer with Emma. She is a warm,
     matronly woman who does a fine job running the house
     without standing on custom.
<b>                           EMMA
</b>              I'll tell you quite honestly,
              Mr. Ford, I don't know where
              Mr. Devaney is. Did he say he'd
              be here?
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              Yes.
<b>                           EMMA
</b>              Then he probably is.   Let me look.
     She leads Frank into a large, unused formal parlor. There
     are dustsheets over the furniture and the walls are being
     repainted. On a number of TV screens scattered around,
     Rachel's latest video (the one we saw in the opening
     titles) is continuously playing. The sound of the song
     itself -- "I HAVE NOTHING" -- comes softly from concealed
     speakers.
<b>                            EMMA
</b>               Please make yourself at home. Can
               I get you anything?
     Frank demurs and Emma disappears back through the foyer.
     Frank watches her go, then moves off into the house in
     the opposite direction. It's obviously undergoing a
     major redecoration. Painters, decorators and designers
     come and go, oblivious to Frank's presence.

<b>17   INT. MARRON MANSION - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY                  17
</b>     The deeper Frank walks into the house, the warmer and
     more lived-in rooms appear.

<b>18   INT. MARRON MANSION - SUN ROOM - DAY                       18
</b>     Frank steps into a tiled room that overlooks the pool
     area. One wall is all glass. On the opposite wall are
     shelves containing the trophies of Rachel Marron's career:
     A Tony award, three Grammy's, gold and platinum records,
     other statuettes and plaques. Among the framed photo-
     graphs of Rachel accepting awards etc., is one of her and

</b>
     her small son, FLETCHER, dressed in a tuxedo. Both are
     goofing off for the camera with obvious affection. Frank
     looks down at the pool.
<b>     FRANK'S POV
</b>     Dwarfed by the pool, the only person in sight is seven-
     year old Fletcher, the little boy from the photograph,
     dark-haired and fragile. He is crouched at the side of
     the pool with the remote control unit for a foot-long
     speedboat which is cutting across the water. A nanny
     sits, some way off, embroidering.
     Frank's attention is distracted. A heavier BASS MUSICAL
     BEAT comes from somewhere nearby in the house, another
     Rachel Marron number, but this time up-tempo and bouncy.
     Frank follows the sound.

<b>19   INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY                                     19
</b>     Frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is
     coming from.
     It is large and comfortable with plenty of seating, a
     bar, a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth. It
     is packed with people, props and video equipment. There
     is lots of activity, a general air of barely-organized
     chaos. MUSIC BLARES out.
     A group of six dancers, is rehearsing an energetic dance
     number for a music video, directed by their choreographer
     RORY. Sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the
     glass wall at the end of the room. A video cameraman
     circles them, taping the rehearsal, which appears on a
     large-screen TV behind them.
     In one corner, a pretty black girl is being pinned into a
     proposed costume for the video. Several people are stand-
     ing around, tending to the video and playback gear. All
     the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn't
     immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among
     the big cushions.
     As Frank sits on the barstool at the back, a large swivel
     chair turns to reveal Devaney. He waves to Frank and
     makes his way over to him.
     On the other side of the room, a brawny, heavyset man in his
     late thirties rises to look at Frank. He has a twenty inch
     neck. Devaney signals to him  that everything is all right.
     The brawny man looks at Frank a moment more, then sits down.
     Frank looks around the room. A shelf laden with vitamins.
     Guitars of various makes. A flute. A gold record being
     used as a coaster. People smoking and chatting through
     the rehearsal.

</b>

In one of the chairs, a pretty  woman in her  mid-thirties
(NICKI, the woman we saw at the  premiere) is  knitting.
She glances occasionally at the  dancers. A   man sits next
to a phone busily discussing a  contract with  someone at
the other end of the line.

The music climaxes and abruptly stops. The dancers hold
their dramatic final poses for a second, then relax again.
APPLAUSE. The CLAPPING from the front sofa is loudest.
Then LAUGHTER.
From elsewhere in the room comes the voice of the VIDEO
<b>DIRECTOR.
</b>
<b>                      DIRECTOR (O.S.)
</b>         Playback, everybody!
Rachel's voice comes from the sofa.
<b>                      RACHEL (O.S.)
</b>         Come here, Rory!
The choreographer skips to the sofa and disappears from
sight. Sound of kissing, laughter.
The video rewinds on the big screen and the dancers gather
round it expectantly.
<b>                      RACHEL (O.S.)
</b>         Sugar, that's gonna be great.    I
         love the ending...
Devaney moves to the front of the room. The PLAYBACK
STARTS behind him. There are several overlapping
conversations going on.

</b>         Nicki, how'd you like the number?
         You like the end routine?
<b>                      DIRECTOR (O.S.)
</b>         Rachel. You wanna see it back
         from the beginning or just the
         ending...
NICKI, responds to Rachel's question.
<b>                      NICKI
</b>         It was just great, Rory...
But Rachel is already replying to the video director.

</b>         I wanna see it all. Tony?      I'll
         bet Tony loved it.
The brawny man, Tony, shrugs and stands to look at Frank
as he speaks.

<b>                       TONY
</b>         Ehh!
<b>                      RACHEL (O.S.)
</b>         Don't worry, Rory. Tony doesn't
         appreciate great art.
The pinned-up girl has been brought forward for Rachel's
approval, elbowing Devaney a little to one side.

         It's terrific...
Devaney is now facing the unseen Rachel.
<b>                      DEVANEY
</b>         Rachel, Frank Farmer is here.
Devaney nods in Frank's direction.     Nicki looks at Frank.

</b>         Frank Farmer.
                (getting no response)
         The bodyguard.
<b>                      RACHEL (O.S.)
</b>         I think Rory should be my

a shock to see that she is only about thirty years old.
A young woman. Not beautiful, not ugly. Unique only in
that she is immediately interesting. A Superstar.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Well, I'm up.

Rachel and Frank look across the room at each other.
Frank comes forward.
<b>                      DEVANEY
</b>         Frank Farmer, Rachel Marron.
Rachel offers her hand and they shake.    Rachel looks him
up and down.

<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         You don't look like a bodyguard.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         What did you expect?
<b>                      RACHEL

Rachel dismisses the Dress Designer.

Nicki goes to the bar. Rachel sits and motions for
Frank to sit opposite her.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Rory, I'll be with you in a second.
Rory gets up, and goes over to his dancers at the big
screen video.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Listen, this whole thing is Bill's
         idea... This sudden obsession with
         protecting me. Tony has always
         handled my security and we've done
         just fine.

Nicki hands Frank his orange juice.   She looks at Frank as
she speaks.
<b>                      NICKI
</b>         I think Bill's right, Rachel. It's

An ASSISTANT hands Rachel a small sheaf of phone messages,
some papers for signature and a pen. Rachel checks
through them and signs as she talks.
<b>                      RACHEL

         I'm not going to let this  alter
         my life one little bit.

         Oh. That was Clive's office.
         They called three times...

         Rachel runs a very informal
         household, we're all on a first
         name basis...
Spector has finished up on the phone and jumps in.
<b>                      SPECTOR

         security for the gate. What else,
         Rachel?
Rachel stands and starts to wander over to Rory and
the dancers.
Frank looks at Devaney.   Devaney doesn't like the tone
this is taking.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         I think I'm safe when I'm here at
         the house so I guess the main thing
         will be when I go out. Tony will
         be able to fill you in on all that.
         You two will have to work something
         out. I don't want both of you
         falling all over me everywhere I
         go. The most important thing is
         this -- I will not allow Fletcher
         to be affected by this thing...

Rory puts his arm around her waist and stands behind her,
starting to run through her steps with her in slow motion.
<b>                      SPECTOR
</b>                (punching phone)
         I was just going to cover that.

         have some other function...
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         I don't want him to think   he's in
         prison. So the house and    grounds
         must not be altered in any   way.
         He shouldn't be aware that   you're
         here. Is that clear?

Frank looks at her a long time, glancing up at Devaney
once.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         Miss Marron...
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Rachel.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         There's been a mistake. A
         misunderstanding. If you'll show
         me the quickest way out, we'll
         save each other a lot of trouble.
Frank's on his way. Someone brings a silver headpiece on
a stand to Rachel. She ignores it, still looking at Frank.
<b>                      TONY
</b>         You can go past the pool.

<b>                      DEVANEY

Rachel looks on coolly as Frank slides open the glass door.

     the slope. Devaney is scurrying to keep up.

</b>              Farmer, will you wait a minute? I

              sorry but I was afraid she wouldn't
              go through with it. I thought I'd
              let the two of you work it out...

     Frank starts to walk off.   Devaney is grasping at straws.
<b>                           DEVANEY
</b>              She's not a bad person, and whether
              she knows it or not, she needs you.

              You've come this far... Would you
              just wait here for one minute. I
              want to show you something. Please,

</b>     Fletcher, happy to have someone to talk to,  walks up to
     Frank with his remote-control speed boat.   Frank would
     like to walk away, but Fletcher blocks his  way. Frank
     looks at Fletcher's frail little, nut-brown  figure. The
     watching nanny continues her embroidering,  some way off.

stops.

</b>         Sure you do, but you don't want

Frank considers him, then slips out of his sport coat.
He crouches down so that he is eye-level with Fletcher.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         You're a smart kid.
Fletcher nods.
<b>                      FRANK

</b>         A lifeboat?

</b>                   (thinks about this)
         Yeah.     My mom rented this huge
         yacht    once, and we took a trip.
         It was    great. Everyone threw up

</b>         You're the bodyguard, aren't you?
Frank is surprised.

     Devaney trots into the pool area, out of breath. He is
     holding a bulging manila file. As he sees Fletcher, he
     holds the file casually at his side.
     Frank sees Fletcher looking at the file.

</b>     Devaney slides the file across the table at Frank, open-
     ing it. Inside are letters of every size and condition.
     Repeatedly throughout this scene Frank's gaze is drawn to
     Fletcher, who has started his boat again.
<b>                           DEVANEY

              Have you ever tried having these
              professionally assessed?
     Devaney shakes his head no.
     Frank begins to look through the letters, flipping them by
     the corner of the page. From many different sources, some
     are scrawled, some typed, some assembled from cutouts.
     Many are soiled and torn, others immaculate. Occasionally,
     one will have a photo of Rachel with crude markings on it.
     Spector enters sucking on a popsicle. He comes to stand
     over Frank's shoulder, peering nonchalantly at the piles
     of letters.
<b>                           SPECTOR

Frank goes through them quickly, with an expert eye. He
sometimes pauses to read one more carefully. A few he
removes from the stack and places in the center of the
table.
<b>                      SPECTOR

<b>                      FRANK
</b>         I was two years with Carter and
         four years with Reagan.
Frank sets another letter in the center pile.   He stops,
smiling at it.

<b>                      FRANK
</b>         This is a little old lady in
         Akron. She's written to
         everybody I've ever worked for.
He continues to turn until something stops him. Several
letters are paper-clipped together. They are the pasted-
up type we saw being assembled on the desk top.
<b>                      SPECTOR
</b>         Reagan got shot.
His chatter is beginning to annoy Frank.
<b>                      FRANK

Spector emits a gratuitous laugh, acknowledges the joke.

</b>         That's good.
Frank goes back to his letters.   He taps the stack in
the center of the table.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         At first glance, these don't
         bother me. But keep them. You
         never know.
He separates one letter from the others.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         This could be something.
Devaney searches Frank's face.
<b>                      DEVANEY
</b>         You think it could be the same
         guy? The one who rigged the doll?

</b>
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              I don't know. Did you tell Miss
              Marron about it? Does she know
              about the doll?
     Devaney and Spector exchange looks.   This is evidently a
     sore point between them.

</b>              We said there'd been some electrical

              Short circuit. Look, she doesn't
              need that kind of worry right now.
              It would upset her.
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              What about the police?
<b>                           SPECTOR
</b>              There was no reason for the police.
              No one got hurt.
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              What about the chauffeur?
<b>                           SPECTOR
</b>              It was nothing. It was just our
              people there.
     Frank turns and watches Fletcher by the pool.   Devaney's
     eyes are still on Frank's face.

</b>     Frank follows Spector and Devaney into the room. He
     glances around, taking in the murals, the decor, the
     kitsch attempt at fornicatorial splendour right from
     the pages of a tabloid layout.
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              Is this her bedroom?

<b>                           DEVANEY
</b>              No. She sleeps in a room next to
              Fletcher's down the hall. Sy had
              this done for a magazine layout,

<b>                      SPECTOR

Devaney gently lays the cut-out letter on the bed.
<b>                      DEVANEY
</b>         We found the letter here.

<b>                      FRANK

<b>                      FRANK
</b>         And she doesn't know about this
         either?
Devaney shakes his head.
<b>                      SPECTOR
</b>         Are you kidding? This would really
         freak her out.

</b>         Someone penetrates the house, gets
         upstairs and jerks off on the bed

</b>                     (does a quick read
                      on Frank)
              Frank, I totally respect what
              you're telling me. Tell me how
              you want to work and I'll

              be responsible for her safety if
              she doesn't know what's going on.

</b>              No.   I'll talk to her.
     Spector exits the room in a huff.

</b>              ...She won't give you any static,

     Frank is still focused on Fletcher.

</b>              Sure she will.
<b>                           DEVANEY
</b>              So what job's perfect? You're
              a bodyguard, aren't you?
     Slowly, Frank faces him.

</b>                      (quietly)
              Yeah.
     As they reach the car, Devaney is relieved.   He dares a
     perfect smile.

</b>              Devaney, if you ever lie to me

<b>25   INT. MARRON MANSION - FRANK'S ROOM - DAY                   25
</b>     Henry Dupres is leaning against the doorjamb. The room
     is comfortable, a guest bedroom. Frank flops one
     battered suitcase onto the bed and opens it. He pulls
     open some drawers in the dresser and starts putting away
     his clothes.
<b>                           HENRY
</b>              Why'd you say your name was
              Edison?
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              I wanted to see how hard it
              was to get in.

<b>                           HENRY
</b>              And it wasn't, was it?
     Henry unconsciously flexes his fingers, easing the muscles
     in his hands. Frank notices and pulls out a small tube of
     ointment from a pouch he's unpacking. He hands it to Henry.
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              Put this on your arm.    It'll help
              the ache.
     Henry takes it but is noncommittal.
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              I'll bet you can fill up a whole
              day just washing the cars and
              driving Rachel Marron around town.
<b>                           HENRY
</b>              That's my job.
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              We're adding to your duties.
<b>                           HENRY

<b>                           FRANK
</b>              You're my new assistant.
     Frank removes three boxes of cartridges from the suitcase
     and puts them in the back of a dresser drawer as Henry
     watches.
<b>                           HENRY

              and I've found one thing to be
              true. No matter how incompetent
              the assassins, no matter how much
              they miss their target by, there's
              one person who always gets hit.
<b>                           HENRY
</b>              Who?
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              The cocky black chauffeur.
     Henry considers this for a moment and smiles.
     OVER scenes 26-28, we hear the VOICE of CNN's MARTIN

</b>     The fortification of the estate begins as Frank and
     Henry walk the grounds. Frank talks and points, Henry
     takes notes on a pad. Frank gestures at the stonework
     of the gate, points at the top of the stone wall along
     Waverly Lane. At the tall hedges which separate the
     estate from its neighbors, Frank gestures to take in
     the entire length of the hedged border. Henry stops
     in amazement. Frank keeps walking.

     Frank tours the house with Emma and Henry. Frank opens
     various doors, fidgets with locking mechanisms. Emma
     finds it all exciting.

</b>     A small room at one end of the pool house has been fitted
     with a wall mirror and ballet exercise barre. A STEREO
     plays exercising MUSIC.
     Nicki, dressed in leotards, is doing pre-aerobic stretch-
     ing exercises. Frank appears outside the window. Nicki
     waves him in. Unseen by Frank, a huge St. Bernard lays
     in the front of the door. He muscles his way in, the dog
     never moves, just slides along the floor as Frank pushes
     the door open. Frank looks the room over.

     Frank indicates it won't be necessary.   Nicki stops
     working out.

              I'm the only one who works out
              around here.
     Frank glances at photos on one wall. Most are of Nicki
     from years ago; some show her performing with a band.

              school dances, stuff like that.
              Then Rachel joined the act. As
              you can imagine, she was quite a
              little entertainer. Even then,
              she had a way of stopping the show.
              So I kind of quit. Professionally,
              anyway.

     Henry leans in a doorway and hits a master switch. The
     three doors of the garage start to rise in sequence.

     He walks toward the Jag.

     Frank releases the hood. He looks inside for a moment,
     then reaches into the guts of the engine. He fiddles for
     a second, then stands up holding some wires and slams the
     hood shut again. He gestures toward the other two cars.

     As she speaks, some workmen test the remote control on a
     window shutter. It descends in front of Rachel's face.
     She is not amused. Fletcher passes Frank on his way to
     join Rachel. He mutters almost under his breath.

</b>              I think he's got a black 4 X 4. Could

     Frank stares at Fletcher, then looks back to the street.

</b>     The room is dark. An opaque projector throws an image
     onto a screen; it is a letter threatening Rachel's life.
     We hear voices. One is Frank's; the other two belong
     to special agents RAY COURT and TERRY MINELLA.
     The letter is one of the pasted-up threats we saw being
     assembled earlier. It reads:

     The projector light goes off and the room light goes on.
     The room is practically bare.
     Ray Court, a prematurely white-haired, career civil
     servant, raises the window shade. Sunlight streams
     in. On Court's lapel is a tiny P.T. Boat pin.
     Terry Minella, a slight, dark 35-year-old, offers Frank
     a cigarette; Frank declines, Minella lights up.

</b>     It's busy. Lots of customers arriving, leaving and
     seated at tables. Waiters criss-cross the terrace. Near
     the entrance, Rachel is saying goodbye to a middle-aged
     WOMAN. Frank stands nearby with Nicki. The Woman says
     something to Rachel, who turns and looks at Frank.
     Rachel whispers something to the Woman and they both
     laugh. They kiss and Rachel moves toward the entrance.

              Goodbye, Nicki. So great to see you.
     Nicki waves and follows Rachel. Frank stays very close
     without seeming to walk with Rachel.

     A little girl darts into their path and approaches Rachel.
     Rachel glances at Frank, who has stopped with her, then
     she signs an autograph for the girl. The girl's mother,
     close behind her, hands a small camera casually to Nicki
     to be photographed as she and her daughter pose with
     Rachel. Frank watches Nicki quietly comply.
     Rachel, Spector and Frank all reach the front entrance
     together, and Frank slips out first, glancing around.
     Rachel comes out and passes within inches of him.

     they reach the limousine, Frank continues scanning the
     street. Tony stares at him, uncomprehending.

</b>                     (impatiently)

     Frank takes a last look then gets into the front seat
     next to Tony.

     Tony looks at Frank, eyes narrowing.
     From across the street, we see the limo pull away. As
     the shot clears, the dark shape of another vehicle
     appears, slowly moving into frame over the top of the
     camera.

     to him in a near whisper.

While Tony speaks, Frank's eyes dart to the side mirror;
his gaze never leaves it.

</b>         No problem. I'd like to know how
         you handle things, Tony.

     The car slows.

     They look up from some papers.

</b>              Why are we stopping?    Are we here?
     Behind them, THROUGH the rear window, the 4 X 4 can be
     seen. Sensing something, it makes a sudden TIRE-
     SCREECHING left turn, disappearing behind them.

     Frank jumps out and jumps a hedge, racing toward the lawn
     and work area.
<b>     ANGLE - TONY, RACHEL AND SPECTOR
</b>     As the car pulls away they see Frank running wildly across
     the property.

</b>              What's with him?

</b>     As Frank comes through some bushes, he suddenly catches a
     glimpse of the 4 X 4 through the trees. It starts to
     accelerate.
     As it pulls away (it is too far to record the license
     number), he breaks into a full run toward the other end
     of the property.
     Leaping hedges, Frank crashes through tropical vegetation.
     CRASHING through a bamboo forest, he scurries down a
     steep wooded slope toward the road below. The 4 X 4 can
     be glimpsed through the trees as he runs to head it off.

     A retaining wall about   14 feet high rises from the road
     to the slope. Without    a pause, as the car speeds beneath,
     Frank leaps and drops   the full distance to the road. The
     4 X 4 ROARS PAST just   missing him and turns a corner.
     Hitting hard, Frank allows his knees to take the force of
     the fall, deliberately rolling once before he springs
     into a crouched upright position.
     But the 4 X 4 speeds around a corner and is gone.

</b>     The fortification  continues as workmen tighten screws,
     install electrical  wiring, test alarms. As Frank watches
     over the work, we  see him show Henry how to wear a SURV
     KIT communications  system.
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              Keep this loose.
     Fletcher comes to take a look too.   He peers up at Frank,
     expectantly.

     Frank nods.   Fletcher looks pleased.

</b>              One snag though.
     Fletcher's face falls.

     hill. Now she leans back on the chaise lounge where
     she is sunning, trying to listen to a new song on a
     Walkman.

     There is the SCREECHING howl of a DRILL on METAL from
     the direction of the house. Rachel jumps up and yells
     toward the house.

     window. Rachel walks in from the pool, starting to
     peel off the swimsuit. She stops, startled, as she sees
     him. This is the last straw. She blows up.

     Terrified, the Old Locksmith drops his tools and begins
     backing out of the room.

</b>              Yes, ma'am. Thank you. I'm a real

     Still angry, but disarmed, Rachel makes a face.

</b>              Then you can take your tools with you.
     She turns to the window, in what she imagines is
     Frank's general direction, and, like a little girl,
     suddenly sticks out her tongue.

     roars up the drive. Frank, Henry and Fletcher watch in

     changed. There is a uniformed guard with an impressive

     Rory, her choreographer, stands behind her, massaging her
     neck and shoulders. Spector is perched on a bar stool
     like a vulture. Devaney hurries into the room; Nicki
     gives him a look.

</b>              I want him gone.

<b>                           NICKI
</b>              He told Rachel no Sunday brunch
              at Charlie's.
<b>                           DEVANEY
</b>              No Sunday brunch. That's why you
              called me up here?
<b>                           RACHEL
</b>              That is not it! It's my money
              and my life and I want him out
              of here.

     Nicki indicates through the glass door.    Devaney walks
     over to it.

</b>         Rachel, I'm getting goddamn sick
         of running up here every time he
         steps on your toes.
                (leaning out the
                 glass door)
         Farmer! Would you come in here
         a minute?

Devaney walks back toward Rachel.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Did you know he was nuts?
<b>                      SPECTOR

</b>         Who?
<b>                      SPECTOR
</b>         Robin Leach, that's who.
Rory sniggers into the back of Rachel's hair, fighting
off a laugh. Rachel has difficulty keeping a straight
face, too. Spector glares at them as Frank enters from
the sliding door.
<b>                      SPECTOR
</b>         You think that's funny? The
         man talks to 20 million people
         and he can't even get in here.
<b>                      FRANK

Devaney turns to him.
<b>                      DEVANEY
</b>         Farmer, what is this about
         brunch at Charlie's? Rachel's

         for the last five years.

         'I don't want her doing anything
         she's always done.' The guy's a
         fanatic.
<b>                      DEVANEY
</b>         So are the guys he's protecting
         you from.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Excuse me if I don't faint.
<b>                      NICKI
</b>         Think of Fletcher --

Rachel turns ON the BLENDER, drowning out Nicki's voice.
Frank looks at Rachel coolly. She stares at him
petulantly, then turns OFF the BLENDER.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Do you know he's got the phones
         bugged?
<b>                      SPECTOR
</b>         Oh Jesus, Bill.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Maybe he gets off listening to my
         calls. All that heavy breathing...
<b>                      DEVANEY
</b>                (interrupting)
         What do you want from my life?
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         I want some peace around here.
<b>                      SPECTOR

Devaney looks at Frank imploringly.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         We're almost done.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         And I want to be able to eat
         brunch with my friends.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         Go on Tuesday this week.
Spector looks at him as though he were a Martian.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                       41.

               Where did you find this guy?
      Rachel turns ON the BLENDER and stares at Frank.


<b>48A   EXT. THRIFT SHOP - VALLEY - DAY                             48A
</b>      Rachel's limousine is parked opposite the shop.    It's
      a decidedly downscale area. A little way  off, a   group
      of unemployed youths hang around, eyeing the limo   with
      interest. Henry sits  at the wheel. Tony  stands   by the
      open window, leaning against the car.

<b>                            HENRY
</b>                      (looking at the
                       youths)
               I wish Rachel didn't keep coming
               here. It makes me nervous.
<b>                            TONY
</b>               Me too. 'Cept I'm not nervous
               'cos I got you with me.

<b>49    INT. THRIFT SHOP - CLOSE ON CLOTHES HANGER - DAY            49
</b>      SCREECHING as it's slid along a metal rack.
      Rachel is shopping for bargains, moving along racks of
      discarded clothing.
<b>                            RACHEL
</b>               Louise, you've got too much great
               stuff.
<b>                            OWNER
</b>                      (from the back of
                       the shop, laughing)
               Take it all, darlin'.
      Frank leans casually against a wall, not watching Rachel,
      but watching the shop, watching the street outside.
      Rachel finds something she likes.
<b>                             RACHEL
</b>               Wooo!   Let me try this on.
      She flicks a glance to Frank; he's not looking at her.
      She pulls back the curtain of the makeshift changing
      booth, then stops dramatically.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            42.
</b>
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>                (to Frank, indicating
                 the open booth)
         Farmer, do you want to come in
         here with me? Just to be safe?
Frank glances at her, then resumes his surveillance of
the shop. Rachel's head bobs up and down above the
curtain as she changes.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         You probably won't believe this,
         but I have a reputation for being
         a bitch.
Frank says nothing. He gazes outside through the store-
front window and sees Henry and Tony horsing around next
to the limo. A few small boys stand around the car. One
of them is climbing onto the hood.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         I didn't used to be. But you get
         known for being a certain way --
         a way people think you are -- and
         pretty soon you get like that.
         Can't help it.
Frank smiles knowingly.   Rachel notices.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         You don't think so? You're such
         an expert on famous people?
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         I've seen a few.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         And you disagree?
<b>                      FRANK
</b>                (very flat)
         You can be as you choose to be.
         It's an act of discipline
         sometimes, but it can be done.
Rachel stops in her tracks... then opens the curtains and
looks at herself in the mirror. Also reflected in the
mirror is Frank.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         That why you never stay with one
         of your clients? They too
         undisciplined for you? Or is it
         you're afraid you'll start to
         care about them?
<b>
</b><b>                                                         43.

<b>                      FRANK
</b>                (without interest)
         That's right.
Rachel turns to Frank.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Can't you answer straight just
         once? Why don't you talk to
         me? I'm not such a bad lady.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         You're too clever for me.   I can't
         keep up.
Frank continues to search the shop and street with his
gaze. Rachel steps closer to him.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Look at me, Farmer!
Frank turns and looks at her.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         You don't approve of me, do you?
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         Disapproval's a luxury I can't
         afford. Gets in the way.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Don't like emotions getting to you,
         huh? Never mix business with
         pleasure?
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         That's right.
It's a stand-off. After a moment, Rachel motions to
an outfit on a rack just behind him.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Grab that would you?
Frank takes a beat.   Looks out the window.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         I'm here to keep you alive... not
         to help you shop.
Fuming, Rachel sizes things up, then grabs it herself,
whipping the curtain shut behind her.
A smile plays across Frank's face.

<b>50   INT. DARKENED ROOM - CLOSEUP - NIGHT                       50
</b>     We see a man's hands remove a video cassette from its
     sleeve. The cover reads "RACHEL MARRON - THE #1 HITS."
     The CASSETTE is gently eased into the slot of the video
     player.

     Rachel's image appears on the screen, singing softly,
     intensely, passionately into the camera. WE TRACK INTO
     the image, as if a little hypnotized by it.
<b>     ANGLE FRANK
</b>     Frank sits alone in his room, lit by the glow of the TV,
     dressed in a business-style blue suit and tie. He's
     watching Rachel's videos. Scattered around the video
     player are a collection of other Rachel Marron CD's,
     tapes and videos. Frank has been noting down lyrics on
     the yellow legal pad on his lap. Some of the phrases
     are circled.
     As he watches, we see a subtle change in his expression.
     It is as if he really were looking at Rachel for the first
     time, here, watching her sing. For a second, she seems to
     be singing to him alone, passionate and vulnerable.
     He opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled Russian
     Orthodox-type cross. He fastens the clasp, checking that
     it holds, then looks back to the screen.

<b>51   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - NIGHT                                 51

<b>52   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              52
</b>     The room is surprisingly bare and simple, almost empty
     apart from Rachel's collection of old and faded dolls
     on the shelves and on the bed. Rachel is getting dressed
     for the evening. A hairdresser stands behind her,
     fussing with her hair. Rachel hears the MUSIC coming
     from outside and moves to the window. (The hairdresser
     moves with her, still busy with the brush.) Gazing
     across the garden, she sees the light in Frank's room
     and hears her own voice singing out from there too.

<b>53   EXT. MARRON HOUSE - NIGHT                                  53
</b>     Frank is showing Henry how to check the underside of the
     limo with an angled mirror on a stick. Both are crouched
     beside the vehicle. A noise makes them look up. Rachel,
     dressed to the nines and looking very sexy, emerges from
     the house with Spector and Devaney. Spector's carrying a
     videotape. Tony follows as they head for the car, where

Frank and Henry are waiting. Fletcher stands in the
doorway, flanked by uniformed security guards. He waves
at Frank.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>                (to Henry)

Henry shrugs.

         Are we going somewhere else?

<b>                      FRANK

Spector starts to climb into the limo.
<b>                      SPECTOR
</b>         It's a club, Frank. Come on,
         Henry, let's go.

         about these things.

He disappears inside the limo.
Rachel tugs at Frank's lapels, looks him up and down,
brushing something off his shoulder. Frank's annoyed.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Nice suit, Frank.
Rachel is about to get in.

He removes something from his pocket, a small enameled
cross.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         I want you to keep this.
Rachel looks at it, both flattered and confused.
<b>                       RACHEL
</b>         For me?   It's beautiful.

              there's ever a problem and we're
              separated, just press it and I'll
              know you need me.

     Rachel doesn't know how to respond. She's stuck for
     words. Spector pokes his head out impatiently.

     Rachel manages a quick smile to Frank as she gets in the
     back. Frank gets in the front beside Tony. The limo
     pulls out.

     The mob reacts to the sight of the approaching limo which
     turns into the parking area and heads for the backstage.
     Faces of the fans are at the windows leering at Rachel.
     Many are grotesquely painted. Some go into a wild frenzy
     as Rachel's limo pulls up. There is a punch-up and a man
     is beaten back. Someone has a video camera. Its quartz
     light shines in through the limo windows. Everybody
     squints at the glare.

</b>     As Rachel's car pulls up, the beaten man dances weirdly
     at the curb with blood streaming from his nose.
     A pair of security guards try to hold them back.    As her
     limo stops, a chant begins.
<b>                            CROWD
</b>              Rachel!   Rachel! We want Rachel!
     Others join in as the mob presses forward.
     The instant she exits the car, her expression goes public
     -- a wide, show-biz smile. Sandwiched between Spector and
     Devaney, with Tony in front and Frank at the rear, Rachel
     makes her entrance.
     A young man breaks the barrier   moving toward Rachel.
     Frank grabs him by one of his   belt loops, gracefully
     guides him all the way across   and slips him under the
     opposite cordon into the arms   of a security guard.

     before letting Rachel sit down. He goes out, closing
     the door, watchful.

     Frank's eyes search the crush of people, milling around
     outside the dressing room. A few feet away, Spector talks
     to a JOURNALIST who's carrying a tape recorder.
<b>                           JOURNALIST

              you. Maybe later. What can I
              say.
     Frank is checked out by a strange-looking women in
     Vampyra Drag.

</b>     Rachel sits in front of the mirror putting on the silver
     headpiece we saw earlier. She notices a small spray of
     lilies-of-the-valley among the floral arrangements.
     An envelope marked "Rachel" is attached to it. She
     reaches forward and opens it.
     We see the note as she unfolds it.

</b>     Spector, Frank, and Devaney are there. Rachel seems
     dazed, unfocussed. Devaney hands the note to Frank.

</b>              He sent another one.
     Rachel immediately picks up on this.

</b>              What do you mean 'another one'?
     Frank quickly shoots a look at Spector.

     Someone comes through the door with some flowers.   Frank
     eases them out and gently closes the door.

</b>              I can't protect her out there.

</b>              Do you think he's out there?
     Devaney can't answer.   She turns to Frank.

</b>     A lone mike stands onstage. The crowd's growing im-
     patient. A RHYTHMIC CLAPPING begins. Devaney walks
     timidly onstage. He's not happy to be there. He reaches
     the mike and taps it with a finger.

</b>     Frank guides Rachel toward the stage exit. A roar from
     the audience begins. "Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!" It
     grows louder as they near the exit. Rachel's expression
     is a combination of fear and humiliation. When they have
     almost reached the exit, she stops.

     She pulls away from him.    Farmer starts after her, closely
     followed by Spector.

     A great gush of applause from the audience. Devaney's
     befuddled. He doesn't see Rachel walking up behind him.
<b>                           DEVANEY
</b>              Rachel won't be able...
     Rachel stands beside him beaming. She bows. Claps back
     to her fans. Devaney retreats. Rachel gestures in his
     direction.
<b>                           RACHEL
</b>              Bill Devaney, ladies and gentlemen,

              Hello! Isn't Billy Thomas the
              greatest. He's asked me to sing
              a song. I hope you don't mind.
     The crowd roars its approval.
     Frank nervously scans the room. Rachel smiles and moves
     along the stage. MUSIC starts in the b.g. Masking
     obvious fear, she starts to sing.
     As she takes one hand from the microphone, her fingers
     tremble. She clasps it again to hide her anxiety.

      Rachel's limo stands waiting. CAMERA PULLS BACK to
      reveal a black Toyota 4 X 4 parked among the other cars.

</b>      Rachel approaches the end of her song, her voice coming
      ever stronger. Spector comes up to Frank in the wings,
      positioning himself combatively between Frank and his
      view of Rachel.
<b>                            SPECTOR
</b>               Are we having a communications problem
               here?
<b>                            FRANK
</b>               What?
      Spector's presence is a distraction. Frank steps to one
      side for a better view of Rachel. Spector moves too.
<b>                            SPECTOR
</b>               Apparently, I didn't make it clear
               to you how things go around here.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>               You told me you were going to
               tell her. And you didn't.
<b>                            SPECTOR
</b>               I didn't think she could handle it.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>               But she handled it fine.
      Frank continues to peer past Spector's shoulder, his
      vigilance undiminished. Soothed and nurtured by the
      obvious admiration of her audience, Rachel's fear is
      beginning to vanish. The song is taking over. Spector
      changes tack, becoming confidential, "man-to-man."

</b>              Look. Frank, I know what you're
              saying. I know you want to do
              what's best for her. I understand
              that. You have a job to do here.
              But you have to understand that
              Rachel has a job to do too. And
              that's what she's doing - out
              there. She's working, Frank.
              That's what she does and that's
              where she does it. She's hot
              right now. This is the time for
              her. If she doesn't get out there,
              she's dead. Forget about crazy
              death threats, if she doesn't
              sing, she's dead anyway... Look,
              handled properly, this thing could
              be good for a million dollars'
              worth of free publicity.
     Frank grabs him by the collar and slams him up against a
     wall of curtain ropes.
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              One word.

     crowd.

</b>     Rachel scans the crowd, spread before her like a surreal
     mural.
     Camera flashbulbs explode like crazy through the glare.
     The thundering adoration is like a stimulant. She darts
     a look to Frank and gives him a fierce "naughty girl"
     smile.

     From the wings, Billy Thomas gives her the nod to go for
     it. It seems to be alright with everyone. The band
     starts playing a dance beat.

              tell me something... wanna see a
              new video?
     The crowd explodes. They know what song is coming.
     They start to move with Rachel.
<b>                           RACHEL
</b>                     (dancing, talking)
              I want to dance...
     She skitters to the other side of the stage, baiting her
     fans. Her new video explodes across the video wall
     behind her. The crowd surges forward.
     Two security guards nervously tense up, watching the
     crowd. When one fan tries to climb onstage, Frank
     reaches out and unbalances him, so that the man falls
     back into the audience. Another man climbs the stage on
     the other side. One of the guards darts out like a
     ballboy at a tennis match, pushes the fan back and
     scurries to the far side to resume his vigilance. The
     crowd is getting even more excited, pressing closer,
     trying to touch Rachel.
     The security guards move in, but Rachel gestures for
     them to back off.
<b>     ANGLE - FRANK
</b>     Frank's task has suddenly become impossible. A forest of
     hands and faces start to engulf Rachel. Anyone could be
     the killer. Frank's eyes  dart over them all, his gaze
     intense, as if trying to hold them off by sheer willpower.
<b>     RACHEL'S POV
</b>     Looking offstage at Frank. His frustration is almost
     intoxicating to her. She struts over the lip of the
     stage. A man leaps up from audience to join her. Frank
     starts forward. Rachel gestures to him to hold back,
     waving him off.

</b>     Spector stands well out of Frank's reach, staring at Rachel
     onstage. He catches Frank's attention, yelling back
     defiantly.

</b>     Rachel dances erotically with the man -- bumping and
     grinding, sinking to her knees. The crowd roars
     approval.
     Frank quickly sizes up the scene. He speaks into a SURV
     KIT microphone in his sleeve. Across the room we see
     Henry listening, pushing an earpiece to his ear. Henry
     quickly scurries to an exit. Frank starts moving toward
     the stage. At that moment, the lucky man Rachel's
     dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her
     gleefully, like the dance partner she has been pretending
     to be. One of security guards rushes forward to extri-
     cate her. The spinning man inadvertently bumps hard
     into the guard and the man loses his grip on Rachel.
     She flies out of his grasp and tumbles off the front of
     the stage -- into the adoring arms of a half dozen fans.
     The audience goes wild. This is the kind of thing
     Rachel was famous for when she was starting out. The
     scene resembles a rugby scrum... with Rachel the ball.

     Frank sees Rachel being passed over the heads of fans --
     deeper into the audience. Her dress is ripped and torn
     apart. The silver headpiece is dislodged and disappears
     into the crowd.
<b>     CLOSE ON RACHEL
</b>     Fear fills her face. She's gone over the edge, literally
     and figuratively. She's lost control. Tony and the
     security guards are fighting to get to her, slamming
     bodies out of the way. In the b.g., the video continues
     on its serene, uninterrupted way.
<b>     FRANK'S POV
</b>     He spots a fire extinguisher in the wings.
<b>     BACK TO SCENE
</b>     Frank grabs it and heads to center stage. He aims the
     extinguisher at the crowd between Rachel and the stage.
     The chemical foam does its job, scattering fans.
     Frank leaps onto the floor, kicking a wild-eyed young
     blond man in the chest as he fights his way to Rachel,
     taking her in his arms. Tony runs ahead of Frank, knocks
     a fan off the stage and waves for Frank to follow.

     swath through the crowd. Rain beats down.

     A burly street regular gets a shove from Tony and comes
     back hard. The  crowd immediately sides with him, yells
     encouragement.  But Tony is the better man and sends him
     sprawling. The  rest of the way to the curb opens up.
     At the parking area Tony discovers there is no limo and
     turns in bewilderment to Rachel. But she is not there.
     A couple of people laugh.

</b>     Rachel and Frank emerge from the darkness between two
     garbage bins and get into the limo Henry has waiting there.
     The car moves out with a SCREECH of tires, narrowly missing
     Spector as he staggers out of the building.

               Farmer! Come back here...
     The limo skids around the corner and speeds off up the
     street, leaving Spector in helpless fury -- apoplectic and
     speechless.

</b>     Frank turns and looks at Rachel.    She is diminutive,
     doll-like, alone in the center of   the large limousine
     seat. Her  hands rise to her face   and her body begins to
     shake with sobs as she sits there   alone in the tattered
     remains of her dress.
     Frank turns away to avoid staring at her, but he feels

     speaks softly.

</b>     The crowd is thinning out. A dim worklight is burning
     somewhere backstage. The auditorium is a mess; the
     cleaning crew has begun to work on the debris from the
     riot. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH, walking, pausing, as if looking
     for something.
     Lying on the floor in big CLOSEUP we see a small  fragment
     of Rachel's dress. The FOOTSTEPS STOP by it. A    hand
     picks it up gently and lifts it OUT OF FRAME. We   hear the
     sound of a deep lingering INHALATION of breath.   The feet
     move on.

     glances in. Then she moves away. Opening the door to
     her room, she steps back, allowing him to enter ahead.

</b>     Frank moves quickly into the room, checking the window
     and French door. Rachel waits silently by the door.
     All is clear. He steps back to the door. As he
     approaches her she begins to tremble.
     He gently reaches out and takes her in his arms. Slowly
     holding her he leads her to bed, moving aside some of
     Rachel's dolls, laid out on the pillows.
     Her hands go automatically to her dress but they are
     shaking so badly she cannot undo it. Frank gently does
     it for her. She willingly allows him to undress her and
     not a word is spoken between them. As she sits naked
     still trembling, he pulls down the covers and guides her
     gently into bed.
     As he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of
     his hand. He looks down, stroking her forehead like a
     child's.

</b>
     Frank sits alone at a table in the huge kitchen, care-
     fully cutting and eating a peach.  The door at the other
     end of the room slams open and Tony stalks in, soaking
     wet. He has just made his way home  from the MAYAN and he
     is boiling. He sights on Frank and  moves toward him fast.
     Frank just watches until Tony is almost upon him. As
     Tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt, Frank spins
     low out of his seat. Tony's legs are knocked out from
     under him. He lands hard on his back and finds himself
     looking up at Frank, who holds him down with the chair he
     was sitting on, like a lion tamer, a leg strut pressed
     against Tony's throat. Frank looks down at him question-
     ingly, as if to ask, "Had enough?"
     Tony scowls and nods. Frank lifts the chair away. Tony
     stands up and faces him. Frank turns away and Tony
     throws a punch at his head, barely catching him as Frank
     ducks and moves in under it. He hits Tony twice and
     throws him against a cabinet. Tony gets up slowly, looks
     around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall.
     He holds it in front of him threateningly.
     Frank shakes his head. He's getting irritated. He picks
     up the knife he's been using on the peach and flips it in
     his hand so he's holding it by the blade. With the same
     fluid motion we've seen earlier, he throws it at Tony.
     It sticks in the wall an inch from Tony's ear. Tony
     does a slow take and then lowers his blade. Frank picks
     up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink. He glances
     at Tony.
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              I don't want to talk about this
              again.

</b>     Frank has been talking to the uniformed guard in the gate
     house and now begins walking up the drive toward the man-
     sion.
     The grounds are quiet, beautiful, misty.
     We see him from behind some foliage, as if he's being
     covertly observed, stalked. A twig snaps and he turns
     sharply. It's Rachel. She's dressed in a soft jumpsuit
     and starts jogging out from behind the bushes towards him.

</b>
The suit softens her appearance; she looks lovely. Her
manner, too, has altered; she is charming -- friendly and
very girlish.
<b>                       RACHEL
</b>         Hey!   Gotcha, didn't I?

<b>                         FRANK

<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         You're probably wondering what I'm
         doing.
                (as Frank nods)
         You didn't know I jogged, did you?

Frank shakes his head.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         What's the matter? 'Fraid I'll
         get picked off in my snazzy running
         suit?
<b>                     FRANK
</b>         No. I'm afraid I'll have to jog
         with you.
They both smile.
<b>                        RACHEL
</b>         Great.    I guess I can't do it.
Rachel stops pumping, gasps for air, and for one moment,
rests a hand on Frank's arm to support herself. She
removes it quickly.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Will you walk with me a little?
Frank nods and they cut off across the grounds.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>                (hard for her)
         I know this is kinda late, but
         thank you. I'm really glad you're
         here.
                (she looks at him)
         I'm going to try to cooperate.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         That would be good.
They walk in silence for few moments. When Rachel
finally speaks, she sounds genuinely unsure of herself,
nervous. It's very appealing. And if it's an act, she's
a terrific actress.

              This minor little problem. You

              evening. Just me and a guy. You
              know...

              ... like a 'date.' But I can't go
              out on a date because you have to
              be with me every minute. I mean,
              what if he invited me up to his
              place afterwards? Are you going
              to come, too?
                     (a beat)
              So the only thing I can figure is
              for you to take me out.
                     (pause)
              So... that's what I was wondering
              ... you know. What do you think?
              But only if you want to.
     Frank is bemused.

</b>              Only if you want to... I'm not so

              God, this is embarrassing. I'm
              gonna run up ahead there. You
              decide.
     She runs up the hill to the pool area, which is now above
     them. He walks up after her.

</b><b>     DAY
</b>     The SOUND is DEAFENING. A wet car comes out of the
     tunnel of machinery. In the distance, glimpsed through
     the spinning brushes, Henry talks to a couple of workers
     as he waits for the limo to be cleaned.

     Hands appear with a large chamois cloth, moving easily
     and fast over the hood and windshield. A black in his
     early twenties is finishing the exterior of the car.
     A second pair of hands appear.    White hands in rubber
     gloves. They open the  driver's   door and push a vacuum
     suction hose inside.  The hands   switch ON the car RADIO,
     loud. Loud enough to  hear over   the din outside the car.
     The hose works its way over the   front seats.
<b>                           D.J. (V.O.)

              these days, Miss Rachel Marron...
     We see the owner of the hands. It is the young blond
     man Frank kicked aside at the MAYAN. His name is DAN.
     His face is impassive.

              Queen Of The Night... I Have
              Nothing.
     The song begins and Rachel's voice fights the din. In
     the back of the car, Dan's hose probes around, nosing
     into all the crevices of the upholstery. It sucks up a
     crumpled pre-signed photograph of Rachel from the gap
     beside the rear seat. The hose is switched off and the
     gloved hands retrieve the picture.

</b>     Tight, shabby facilities. Dan opens the combination
     padlock to his locker and deposits the crumpled photo
     inside.
     As the hands remove the rubber gloves, the inside of the
     locker is revealed. Pasted over every inch of the locker
     are pictures of Rachel Marron. One tabloid shot of her
     dancing with the word "whore" scrawled across it. Taped
     to a single sheet of white paper in the center, like a
     holy relic, is the torn scrap of Rachel's dress from the
     MAYAN. The hands pin up the newly-acquired photo next to
     it.

     technician. The technician is leaning over one of the
     neatly pasted-up death threats we have seen earlier.
     With a scalpel, he lifts the word "whore" from out of the
     message. He sets it on a white sheet, then brings the
     blade back and scrapes at the residue of the dry glue on
     the letter.

     Frank and Rachel exit with a small crowd.    Rachel wears a
     scarf and tinted glasses. The combination    goes a long
     way toward disguising her. They pause at    one of the dis-
     play windows. Inside is a poster for the    movie, Yojimbo,
     a large picture of Toshiro Mifune looking   scruffy and
     fierce.

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          Oh, my god!    That's it, isn't it?

</b>
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              Nobody's perfect.
     Rachel is taken aback.
<b>                           RACHEL
</b>              Oh Frank, I'm sorry.

     Frank laughs.
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              No... Nice try though.
                     (pause)
              It was less dramatic than that.
              She didn't love me anymore. Can
              you imagine such a thing?

     Frank puts a smiling spin on this last; it's pretty
     charming. Rachel looks at him.
<b>                           RACHEL
</b>              No, not really.
     A SONG comes on the JUKEBOX -- 'WHAT BECOMES OF THE BROKEN
     HEARTED.' Frank smiles as Rachel begins to sing.
<b>                           RACHEL
</b>              So, is this a full service date,
              Frank?
     Frank's wary.
<b>                           RACHEL
</b>              I'm just asking you to dance.

<b>87   INT. DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT                                 87
</b>     Frank and Rachel navigate a tiny dance floor. Frank is a
     surprisingly good dancer and is comfortable being this
     close to her.
     Rachel hums softly, picking up the words to the song.   As
     we listen to the lyrics something clicks in her head.
<b>                           RACHEL
</b>              You like this?
<b>                              FRANK
</b>              Yeah.
     A beat, then Rachel bursts out laughing.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>                      (reddening)
              What?
<b>
</b><b>                                                                      66.

<b>                           RACHEL
</b>                     (trying to compose
                      herself)
              I'm sorry... It's just that...
              It's so depressing.
     Now they're both laughing.

<b>                           FRANK
</b>                     (grinning)
              It is, isn't it.
     Suddenly a dish drops to the floor. Frank, still dancing,
     makes a smooth quick turn that puts his body between
     Rachel and the noise. His head turns to locate the source
     of the noise.

<b>                           RACHEL
</b>              Don't worry, I'll protect you.
     They drift back into the music, Rachel singing, Frank
     watching.

<b>88   EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                  88
</b>     Frank's car is parked in the driveway.    A light goes on
     in a basement window.

<b>89   INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BASEMENT                               89
</b>     Frank hangs back, drink in hand, as Rachel explores the
     basement. Frank has fitted it out as a combination gym/
     target range/weapons workshop. The place has a kind of
     unfussy order about it, a simplicity.
<b>                           RACHEL
</b>                     (almost to herself)
              It's very quiet here.
     She walks to some shelves -- a random selection of
     books, football and karate trophies, framed citations
     and other memorabilia. She glances at a dusty framed
     photo of a football team.

     She looks at Frank, quizzically.

</b>              What'd you play?
<b>
</b><b>                                                           67.

</b>         Were you tough?
<b>                        FRANK
</b>         No.    Fast.
Rachel puts down her drink and moves toward a samurai
sword that is mounted in its scabbard on the wall. She
looks at it, peering closely.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         You some kind of a samurai, too?

Frank smiles.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         They said you were in the Secret
         Service. What made you get out?
Frank moves away and sits on a sofa against the wall.
<b>                        FRANK
</b>         Money.
Rachel looks around at Frank's modest home.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         I can see your tastes are
         extravagant.
She looks at Frank and then back at the sword.   She
reaches out to touch it.
<b>                        RACHEL
</b>         May I?
Frank nods. Rachel takes it off its mount carefully,
unhooks the scabbard and begins to slide it off.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         Watch yourself.
Rachel slides the scabbard off. The naked blade is
breathtaking. Rachel holds the sword out before her.
She walks toward Frank, then stops and looks over the
blade at him.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         You're a hard one to figure, Frank
         Farmer.
He stares at her. She steps closer, so the blade is only
about a foot from his face.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                      68.
</b>
<b>                           RACHEL
</b>              It seems to me a bodyguard must
              know little peace.
     Frank stands up so that the point of the sword is only
     about an inch from his chest. He reaches out over the
     blade to Rachel's neck and unties the silk scarf she is
     wearing there. One hand draws the scarf away. The other
     hand lingers for a moment on her neck, then lifts away.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>              Watch this.
     He has raised the scarf over his head, in   the space
     between them. With two hands he spreads    it out and then
     lets it go. Slowly, billowing, the scarf    floats down
     over the blade and is cut in two. These    two pieces float
     slowly to the floor.
     Frank takes Rachel's wrist and moves the sword away to
     the side. They are both holding it as Rachel presses her
     body against Frank's and they begin to kiss.

     Frank smiles.

</b>              No one could get by you.
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              Right now it might not be so hard.
     Rachel laughs, kisses him and buries her head down into
     his shoulder. Frank stares across the bed at the samurai
     sword lying on the floor. Some of Rachel's clothing is
     draped in a heap across it. The torn pieces of her scarf
     lie nearby. HOLD ON Frank's look.

activity.
<b>                     RACHEL

         doing?

Frank keeps moving, looking for his shoes.

Frank finds his shoes.

</b>         You pay me to protect you, that's
         what I do.
Rachel sits up.

         wrong?
<b>                         FRANK
</b>         No, nothing.

She lifts the sheet seductively and looks over the top
of it.

</b>         Do you want me to beg?
<b>                      FRANK

She stops.

<b>                      FRANK
</b>         You didn't do anything. It was me.
         I involved myself with my client.

Rachel picks up on the word.

</b>         Your "client"?
<b>                      FRANK

         attractive anymore.

He automatically checks the gun as he slips it into the
holster.

</b>         You can live with that or you can
         fire me.

Frank turns and looks at her.    This is hard for him, too.

     She stops suddenly and, with a roar of combined frus-
     tration, humiliation and rage, she lurches from the bed
     in search of her clothes. Frank shuts his eyes in morti-
     fication and pain.

</b>     A nanny sits in the early morning mist, embroidering.
     Frank is kneeling with Fletcher beside the pool. He's
     putting new batteries into Fletcher's boat. Fletcher
     watches him as he tears off the wrapping from the
     batteries, much preoccupied.
<b>                              FLETCHER
</b>                        (watching him)
                 She's real mad at you, isn't she?
     Frank stops what he's doing and just looks blankly at the
     batteries in his hands. There's a beat of silence.
<b>                              FLETCHER
</b>                 She told me she doesn't understand
                 why you're so shitty to her...
     Frank's shoulders droop and he lets out an imperceptible
     sigh. He gently resumes fitting the batteries, still
     not looking at Fletcher. In the quiet of early morning,
     it's almost like a confessional.
<b>                              FRANK
</b>                 I've spent a lot of time learning

                 doesn't always work, Fletcher...
                 it doesn't always work.

                 And I'm starting to get the
                 feeling I never will.
     There's a crunch of footsteps behind him.       He looks
     around.
     With a big flourish, a copy of Daily Variety is put down
     in front of us, front page upwards.

     Frank takes in that it's Nicki then glances at Variety,
     lying on the concrete beside him. Splashed across the
     top, the headlines announce the day's news of the
     Academy Award nominations. Rachel's name is among the
     Best Actress nominees. The Hollywood Reporter follows.
     Frank picks up Variety and stares at it. Nicki stands
     beside him with the morning's mail under her arm.

              Everyone said she was a sure thing.
              Of course, you know all about that.
     She raises an eyebrow, gives him a look. Frank looks
     steadily back at her. She drops a small pile of mail
     beside the magazines... several letters and a small
     packet. She's embarrassed by Frank's gaze.
<b>                           NICKI

              today's question marks for you.
     She turns and walks briskly back to the house. Frank
     watches her go, then looks slowly down to the pile.
     From across the pool, Fletcher watches silently, then
     pushes his boat out into the deep water.

<b>94   INT. SQUIRREL HILL PRODUCTIONS - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY     94
</b>     Frank is investigating the small packet, with a surgeon's
     precision, checking it with a stethoscope and a metal
     detector, sniffing at it.
     It has been addressed in the normal way, except that
     Rachel's name has been cut out of a magazine and pasted
     above the address. He begins carefully slicing away the
     wrapping. Inside is a cardboard box. The contents are
     still hidden by packing paper. He picks it away with
     tweezers. Suddenly there is a LOUD BUZZING from the box
     and movement in the paper. Frank drops the box into a
     bed of sand in a sink surrounded by sandbags.
     The movement slows and stops. Frank extracts the item --
     it is a wind-up mechanical beaver with a hand-painted
     sign hung around its neck:

     Devaney appear in the doorway with more cards. They
     also stop and listen.
<b>                           SPECTOR
</b>              ... and now you're fucking with
              her head.
<b>                           FRANK
</b>              That's between us.
<b>                           SPECTOR
</b>              You think so? You forget who signs
              your check. You don't understand
              the role I play around here.

</b><b>                                                              74.
</b>
<b>                       FRANK
</b>         No.   I understand.
Spector stiffens, then decides not to take this one on.
<b>                      SPECTOR
</b>         Get your shit together and be out
         of here by noon.
<b>                        DEVANEY
</b>         Frank stays.
Spector looks round, sees that Devaney and Rachel have
been listening. Rachel is silent. With a curt nod of
his head, Spector gestures to the assistants to leave the
room. Devaney weighs in.

<b>                      DEVANEY
</b>         With this high a profile, Rachel
         needs protection now more than
         ever. If he goes, you can forget
         Miami...
<b>                      SPECTOR
</b>         She's signed the fucking contract,
         Bill. You want me to read it to
         you?
Rachel is watching them both.
<b>                      DEVANEY
</b>         Fuck the contract. If he goes,
         she's not singing a note. It's
         too dangerous.
<b>                      SPECTOR
</b>         Oh. 'Fuck the contract.' Great.
         Why don't you let Rachel speak for
         herself? I think she has some say
         in this.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>                (flatly)
         Frank stays.
Spector considers her for a beat, then looks at the others.
The secretary interrupts from the back of the office.
<b>                      SECRETARY (O.S.)
</b>         Mr. Schiller calling on line one...
Spector ignores her, still holding his look at Devaney,
Rachel and Frank.
<b>                      SPECTOR
</b>         Well, I guess this is democracy in
         action.

</b><b>                                                             75.
</b>

Rachel nods. Spector, turning to take the call, flashes
her a "little boy" look.
<b>                     SPECTOR
</b>         I gave in. That's not easy for
         me. Don't I get a hug?

Rachel is stone-faced.   Spector covers by picking up the
phone.
<b>                      SPECTOR
</b>                (into phone)
         Yeah?... Sure, put him on... Ben
         how are you?... uh huh...

Frank and Rachel look at each other in silence.
<b>                      SPECTOR
</b>         ...The Ambassador? What the hell
         are you trying to pull, Ben?
         Rachel always gets the
         Presidential... I don't care what
         you thought...
Devaney leans to Frank as Spector's conversation continues
in the b.g.
<b>                      DEVANEY
</b>         Do you know the Fontainebleau
         Hotel in Miami Beach?
Frank nods.
<b>                      DEVANEY
</b>         How does the Ambassador Suite
         compare to the Presidential for
         us?
Frank thinks only for a moment.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         It's on the twentieth    floor in the
         south wing. There's a     service
         elevator right there.     Mainly
         ocean windows. Should     be no
         problem.
<b>                      SPECTOR
</b>                (into phone)
         ... I'm aware of that, Ben, but
         let me just remind you people
         that you invited us...
Frank turns toward the door.

              need your vaunted expertise.
     She reaches forward and hits a button on Spector's desk,
     throwing the call onto a speaker.

     ON the SOUNDTRACK, we hear JOHN TESH'S VOICE filling the
     viewers in on the latest Hollywood dirt.
<b>                           JOHN TESH (V.O.)
</b>              ...It's off to Sun City today for

              Rachel's giving two AIDS charity
              concerts this week at Miami's
              Fontainebleau Hotel. A thousand a
              plate no less. And rumor has it
              that the lovely lady has unseated
              the governor of Florida himself.
              Seems there was a showdown on
              who'll get to lounge in that big
              Fontainebleau penthouse tonight.
     As we CIRCLE the top floor, we see a tiny figure on the
     balcony.

     over the edge and around the corner. He leans slightly
     against the wrought iron railing. It sways precariously.
     Frank catches himself.

</b>              Thuringer.

     Frank kneels and inspects the fixture that anchors it to
     the cement balcony: the cement crumbles around it, a
     weld joint is broken on the side. THURINGER, the hotel
     security chief, joins Frank on the balcony. Frank shakes
     the railing.
<b>                             THURINGER
</b>              God damn.    I'll get someone right

</b>     Frank walks quickly across the living  room of the lavish
     suite.  Two uniformed security guards  are making a sweep
     of the room with POLICE DOGS. Frank   checks the drawer of
     a side table and then seals it with a  peel-off security
     tape.  Thuringer is waiting near the  entrance hall.
     Frank nods to him.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>              Okay.   Let's go.

<b>99   INT. HALLWAY - 15TH FLOOR - DAY                          99
</b>     This is a semi-private corridor; several hotel employees
     are steam-cleaning the carpet. Frank looks at them, then
     Thuringer.
<b>                           THURINGER
</b>              It's okay, they've been cleared.
     He shows his clipboard to Frank. As the two men walk
     along the corridor, the guest elevator opens and a
     twelve-year-old boy in a bathing suit (MARK KATZ) steps
     out, accompanied by his nanny. In the background, hotel
     security men are checking fire-extinguishers and closets.
<b>                           THURINGER
</b>                     (to Frank)

              prominent. Come every year. An
              elderly couple and three
              grandchildren. A nurse and a maid.
     They pass the little boy as he reaches the door of the
     Katz suite with his nanny.

      Frank smiles and nods to the nanny.

               Theirs is the only suite on the
               floor.
      The two men reach the service elevator and the emergency
      exit door at the end of the hall. Frank opens the stair-
      way door and goes inside. Thuringer follows.

<b>                            THURINGER
</b>               As you asked, the rooms below have
               been kept vacant.

      it's locked. They continue down the stairs.

      busy kitchen.

</b>      Frank walks ahead of Thuringer. He looks around and
      pauses at the edge of the stage. Then he steps out on a
      stage. A piano tuner is at work in the corner.

      Frank stands center stage and looks around. The naked-
      ess of this spot gets to him. He shakes his head and
      looks at Thuringer. Thuringer smiles.

</b>               What a silly job this is.

</b>      Behind the glass doors that lead to the pool, bright
      quartz lights clock on. A camera crew stands waiting.
      Someone mimes a "we're rolling" sign with his hands.
      Inside Rachel waits with Spector and BEN SCHILLER, the
      tough, fat fellow who owns the place. Frank is at her
      elbow.
<b>                            SPECTOR
</b>               O.K. Rachel. It's showtime!

<b>                               SPECTOR

</b>               Quit bitching, Farmer. This is
               the part you do get paid for.
      Rachel sweeps out the door.    The camera crew hurries to
      keep up with her.

<b>112   EXT. POOL AREA - DAY                                         112
</b>      This place is crowded with hundreds   of guests basking on
      chaise lounges. A sea of sun-baked    faces virtually as
      far as the eye can see. The sight    of the crowd and the
      presence of the news crew seems to   push Rachel to a
      whole new adrenaline level.
      Rachel walks among them, moving swiftly, evaluating the
      bodies displayed before her in words and expressions,
      playing to the camera.
<b>                           RACHEL
</b>               Oh my God. Look what they're
               wearing. Mother, hide your eyes...
      Heads turn to look.

               had a body like that...
      There is a murmur of recognition from some of the guests.
      She pauses to shake a hand, and now all the guests
      throughout the pool area are aware that Rachel Marron is
      among them.
      People stand on chairs, scramble for pens and paper, run

to get a closer look. Lounges collapse, drink GLASSES are
BROKEN, flower tubs are trampled. A lot of pushing and
shoving starts - too much for the video crew, who abandon
the filming attempt.
<b>                     SPECTOR
</b>         Great, babe. They got what they
         needed. Let's get back inside.
Frank increases his pace to keep by Rachel's side, gently
easing a path for her. Schiller scurries behind in
Frank's wake.
Rachel turns suddenly as a tall good-looking lifeguard
appears in the throng. She eyes him appreciatively.

<b>                      RACHEL
</b>                (to lifeguard)
         You look like a man of good taste
         to me. Come to my party tonight.
                (to Schiller)
         Ben, make sure this boy gets to
         my party.
Schiller nods. Rachel glances at Frank, making sure he
gets the point, and then she's off again. The throng
gets tighter. Frank's having to work harder, steering
her towards the door back into the hotel. The familiar
chant starts up: "Rachel, Rachel." It's starting to
resemble the frenzy of the opening scene. This time,
amid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces, a few
bewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved
forward. A child starts crying, lost in the mess of legs
and Bermuda shorts. A distraught mother tries to reach
him. Someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd
surges again.
Amid the chaos, whistles and scattered applause.   Rachel
drinks it all in.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>                (over her shoulder)
         Thank you. Thank you. Come
         tonight and give till it hurts.
With a final surge, Frank makes it to the door with his
party. The door closes shut behind them. A mass of
distorted faces pushes onto the glass. The party walks
on briskly.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>                (to Spector)
         I'm beginning to wonder about your
         judgement, Sy. Why do I have to
         keep paying my dues if I've
         already arrived?

                you feel good. But let's not
                pretend you don't like it. We're
                too close for that. Whipping
                people into a frenzy is why you
                got into it in the first place.
       Rachel's eyes lock with  Spector's -- there's a real connec-
       tion and understanding  here that she spends a lot of time
       denying. Frank sees it   as clearly as Spector, whose tone
       becomes almost soothing  --
<b>                             SPECTOR
</b>                And it's nothing to be ashamed of,
                either, not for a second. It's a
                gift... and only a handful are
                given it. Many call but few are
                answered.

</b>                Don't fool with the blessing,

<b>                             SPECTOR

                ... I know you like to be reminded
                sometimes.
       Rachel looks away.   It's true.   He's good at his job.

</b>       In the spotlight, all alone, Rachel Marron works her magic.
       She sings, as it was meant to be sung, "I Have Nothing."
       One person does not look at Rachel. He stands in a
       corner in front of the stage easily in the shadows. His
       eyes continually scanning. Picking up every movement.
       All alone. Watching.

      the windows. People clap.
      A mixed bag of upscale partygoers: women in party
      dresses, men in open shirts, etc. A black pianist is
      playing. Two bars at either end of the room. Waiters
      work the room with platters of canapes.

      hind him and makes his way down to the party. He pauses
      at the head of the stairs, checking out the party, and
      grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. Frank
      catches the movement; the two men briefly lock eyes. The

</b>      Thuringer has set up a checkpoint through which all
      guests are passing.
      As they get off the elevator, they walk up to a desk
      manned by one of Thuringer's uniformed guards. When
      their names have been checked off a master list, they
      walk past another guard wielding a metal detector. No
      one likes it, but they all do it.
      Most of the local TV stations have sent camera crews.    The
      handheld cameras move among the guests, their bright
      lights flaring. FLASHBULBS POP. It's a local media
      event.
      Frank squints as a quartz light shines straight in his
      face.
      A tall, fit, athletic-looking man raises his arms; is
      cleared by the metal detector. He is GREG PORTMAN.

      eyes scan the suite. His gaze settles on Frank checking
      out the people who filter in. Portman appears next to
      Frank.

         Technically I'm off duty,   but the

Rachel makes her entrance, and poses self-mocking on the
landing above the crowd, accepting applause. She has
succeeded in under-dressing everyone in the room. She
is a star. Frank nods in her direction... that's his
client.

Portman notices Rachel looking at him, as she makes her
way to them. Rachel takes Frank's orange juice and sips.
Makes a very funny face.

      high and happy. Conversation bubbles.
<b>      FRANK'S POV
</b>      Rachel leans into Portman; heads together, they whisper
      intimately. Rachel laughs, then for a brief moment, turns
      her head to look directly at Frank. Her look is petulant,
      defiant. Portman does not see this.

      Tony helps himself to a handful of canapes, he turns at
      the sound of a COMMOTION out on the balcony. Someone's
      horsing around, spraying champagne from a bottle over
      everyone. A woman screams. Frank   bolts for the balcony.

      Rachel and Portman are poised precariously halfway over
      the railing. Frank's hand shoots out, grabs Rachel's
      wrist and tugs at the pair of them.
      Portman regains his balance first and pulls Rachel back
      from the edge.

      Way, way below her, her champagne GLASS hits the tile

               You saved my life.
      Frank eyes the newly-welded anchor fixture.   It has
      held.
      Rachel takes Portman by the arm.   The front of her dress
      is stained with champagne.

      She leads Portman past Frank and up the stairs toward
      her bedroom. Frank and Portman lock eyes. Portman
      shrugs; he feels badly for Frank.

      Frank walks to the bar taking a drink from his glass. He
      looks in the mirror behind the bar and sees Rachel and
      Portman in the hall outside her bedroom. She turns her
      head to look directly at Frank's reflected face. Assured
      that Frank is watching, she takes Portman's hand and leads
      him into her room.

      Frank sets his glass down and the bartender refills it
      with orange juice. A stunning WOMAN IN GREEN glides down
      the bar and stands very close to Frank.

      flects off the ocean. The SURF sounds a STEADY BEAT.
      It is peaceful and quiet. A relief.
      On the Katz's balcony, forty feet away, little Mark Katz
      is leaning against the railing, staring at Rachel's
      suite. Frank smiles at him.

      She looks to the door that leads back to the party. The
      SOUNDS of CELEBRATION CONTINUE outside. She starts to
      cross to the door.

      Portman moves toward her as she opens the door, reaching
      for her arm.
      Then he sees, through the doorway, Tony standing in the
      hall talking to a woman. Tony looks up at the sound of
      the door and sees them both. Rachel slips quickly out
      of Portman's grip.

      Portman hesitates, then smiles at Rachel and Tony and,
      with a quick peck on Rachel's cheek, slips past them back
      to the party.
      Rachel briefly scans the party crowd over Tony's shoulder
      but she doesn't see Frank. The door closes, leaving her
      alone in the room again. She reaches for a bottle of
      Scotch and raises it to her mouth, drinking straight
      from the bottle.

       Rachel sits down at the table as though the walk in had
       been a terrible effort. She looks at the breakfast with

      Frank is at the telephone; he punches out three
      numbers.

               Well get someone up here.

      Frank hangs up the phone, looks at Devaney.

</b>               He doesn't know.
      They look at each other, worried. Frank walks out onto
      the balcony, looks round and down, comes back in. He
      heads for the front door.

</b>      Frank is almost at the door. We hear LAUGHTER. A key
      turns in the lock. Rachel and Tony come through the
      door in high spirits, their arms full of shopping bags
      and packages.
      Frank stops dead and    watches. Rachel glances at him and
      goes into the living    room. Tony looks at him meaning-
      fully and follows.     Frank reflects for a moment, then
      pulls the front door    closed, oh so gently.

       Tony comes back, a smile playing across his lips.    Frank
       watches near the entrance.

                You know you're not supposed to do
                that.
       Frank and Rachel look at each other.

       Frank turns and heads for the door.    Devaney looks at
       him anxiously.

       He opens the front door. A uniformed guard is standing
       outside. Frank goes out and closes the door.

       Devaney, staring after Frank, shakes his head "no."

Frank walks along checking the corridor.        At each door-
way, he stops, looks inside.
One room is dark. He flicks on the light. Near the door
is a pile of wooden crates, placed unnaturally out from
the wall.  Frank walks over and looks inside. They are
discarded vegetable crates. Frank goes back to the door
and yells toward the kitchen.
<b>                          FRANK
</b>            Gomez!   Louis Gomez!
He waits impatiently. No one comes. Two quick steps and
he is back at the CRATES, throwing them violently into
the corner where they CLATTER loudly to the floor. Frank
walks on along the corridor.

He stops, noticing something around the side.
He investigates.
An ENORMOUS CUBAN is sitting on some boxes in the
shadows. He doesn't bat an eye when he sees Frank.
<b>                         FRANK
</b>            What are you doing?
<b>                         ENORMOUS CUBAN
</b>            Is none of you fuckin' business.
<b>                           FRANK
</b>            Move it.
The Enormous Cuban gets slowly up from the boxes.        He
towers over Frank.
<b>                         ENORMOUS CUBAN
</b>            Shove it up you ass, motherfucker.
Frank has had   enough for one      afternoon. He hits the
Cuban low and   hard. The man       crumples forward, hurt,
but manages to   enfold Frank      in an awesome bear hug. His
weight carries   them backward      in Frank's direction.
The Cuban continues      moving in that direction, but Frank
is no longer in his      grasp. Instead, incredibly, Frank
seems to have passed      through the man's body and flicked
him into the corner      of the stairwell.
The Cuban hits the wall hard. Jarred but not lost, he
comes up and out wielding a long mop as if it were a
baseball bat.
Frank steps in and      under the man's long arms and hits him
four times around      the chest and jaw. Each of Frank's
hands lands twice,      their movement is barely visible.
The solid THUDDING      tells the story. Frank strikes both

       the Cuban's ears simultaneously with cupped hands.
       The Cuban goes down, stunned. Frank, his expression
       fierce, is upon him immediately. Frank's arms entwine
       the Cuban's and he begins to lift him roughly. At the
       end of the corridor, a woman screams.

<b>                       CLEANING WOMAN (O.S.)
</b>                Stop! Please. Don't hurt him.
                Please stop!
       Frank looks up. A hotel CLEANING WOMAN, carrying her
       purse, is running towards them, tears already on her
       face.
<b>                             CLEANING WOMAN
</b>                Don't hurt my husband, mister.       He
                not up to nothing.
       Frank lets the Cuban down gently and stands up. Dis-
       gusted with himself. Breathing hard, he leans back
       against the wall. The Cleaning Woman falls to her knees
       and hugs her husband protectively.
<b>                              FRANK
</b>                I'm sorry.
       Frank steps away, rubs a hand through his hair, tries to
       collect himself.
       He's standing amidst dumpsters and discarded food boxes.
       He looks up and sees a marquee.

      a cigarette and stands to meet him. Frank doesn't pause.

He senses another presence and looks to his right.
Rachel sits huddled in a balcony chair. The bright  moon-
light illuminates her as she looks out to sea. She  is
wearing one of her spectacular show gowns, her hair has
been brushed, and her stage makeup has been applied.   But
tonight it hasn't come together. It doesn't work.   She
holds a cigarette and the breeze keeps it glowing.  This
is the only time we've seen her smoke.

Frank looks at her. Tears are destroying her elaborate
stage makeup. She wipes them away with her hand.

</b>         I can't protect you like this.

This is the first time Frank has ever heard Rachel say
that. He studies her, then looks out at the ocean.

</b>         I want to take you away for
         a while.

      There is none.

      Sloping gently down from the house to the lake fifty yards
      away is a broad expanse of lawn.  Snow lies on the ground

      A little TERRIER skitters to the edge of the drive

      Frank's father, HERB, steps onto the front porch. He's
      in his mid-60's, lean, tan and fit. He's wearing a plaid
      shirt, jeans and cowboy boots.
      The van stops in front of the house. Frank steps out

      Rachel smiles and looks out of the window.

</b>               It's so quiet here.

</b>               Frank came back and stayed six
               months after the Reagan thing.
      Rachel's questioning look encourages Herb.
<b>                            HERB
</b>               Frank wasn't there the day he was
               shot. He never got over that.
                      (a long pause)
               We buried Katherine that day.
      Rachel looks out again at Frank and Fletcher in the boat.

</b>      Fletcher, Rachel and Frank are chugging across the golden
      water in the skiff. Fletcher sits at the back, operating
      the outboard, controlling the movements of the boat. He
      wears a life vest. Rachel watches him proudly. Fletcher
      locks the throttle into place and takes his hands off it
      for a laughing moment with a "Look, Mom, no hands"
      gesture.
      Rachel looks to Frank and smiles, the wind blowing her
      hair.
<b>      WIDE ON LAKE - DUSK
</b>      CAMERA is DOWN at water level by the lake's edge. In the
      distance, the small boat skims across the surface. A
      light mist is coming up.

</b>      Henry helps Fletcher tie up the boat for the night.   It
      is much foggier now and almost dark.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>               I don't want anyone going out in
               it until you've checked it over
               first. Okay? Every time.
      Henry nods.

      In the distance, Rachel and Fletcher have just reached
      the house where Nicki scoops up Fletcher and spins him
      round and round in a circle. She hugs him close and
      kisses his hair.  After a few moments, Fletcher squirms
      free and runs to catch up with Rachel.

</b>      Rachel, munching on a raw carrot, browses a row of family
      photographs. The sounds of dinner being prepared come
      from the kitchen.
      We see the history of the family in the pictures; Frank
      as a ten-year-old baseball player with a younger Herb;
      Herb as Police Chief of Bend, Oregon, being given a civic
      award; Frank as a college football wide receiver; Herb
      and Katherine Farmer, all dressed up and being introduced
      to Jimmy Carter by Frank; the picture-perfect family home
      in Oregon with Katherine tending flowers.
      Rachel notices a photo of a smiling Henry Kissinger,
      talking to some female reporters. There standing
      shoulder-to-shoulder with him, are Frank and Portman.
      Portman's also smiling at the women, flirting. Frank is
      in a familiar pose, alert, unsmiling, vigilant. Rachel
      looks at the two of them for a second.
      Frank steps from the kitchen with an orange juice and a
      drink for Rachel in his hand. He watches her for a
      moment as she studies the photo.
      She turns and sees him. They lock eyes for several
      seconds. She smiles as he hands her the drink.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>                      (inclining his head
                       toward the photo)
               Portman sometimes had trouble
               remembering what his job was.
               Supper's ready.
      We can see from Rachel's face that she feels embarrassed
      about her behavior in Miami.

</b>      The meal has been enthusiastically consumed. Fletcher's
      manhandling a chicken leg, his face covered with crumbs
      and drippings. Rachel shakes her head, laughing.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                 101.

               To this day.
                      (to Frank)
               That's true, isn't it?
                      (to Rachel)
               That's very unusual for my people.
               So what happens? When he's ten
               years old, he complains about it?
               Can you believe that?
<b>                            FRANK
</b>               Oh, for Chrissake! I'm going to
               tell her about the time you
               stripped in court.

      Frank gets up smiling and takes some dishes into the kitchen.
<b>                            HERB
</b>                      (to Frank)
               I don't care. I'm proud of that.
                      (to Rachel)
               Anyway, he's ten years old and
               he's just started playing tackle
               football. He comes to me and
               tells me he's afraid of getting
               hit, right? And he thinks it's
               because I never hit him. 'Why don't
               you ever hit me?' he says to me!

<b>155   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                    155
</b>      Frank puts down the dishes in the darkened kitchen.

                       shoulder)
               If you're lucky, maybe he'll
               tell you about my first jockstrap.
      As he speaks, he peers out through the window at the
      lake. We hear Herb's voice continue from the other room.
<b>                            HERB (O.S.)
</b>               He got over it: Turned into a
               helluva wide receiver. He
               couldn't stand being afraid. When
               he found something that scared
               him, he'd just do it 'til the fear
               went away.

</b>
<b>                            HERB
</b>               His mother was the same way.
      Rachel smiles at him, thinking, then looks through at
      Frank in the kitchen, still peering out of the windows.
      Nicki watches Rachel.


<b>157   INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER                                   157
</b>      Herb delicately lifts  a chessboard from the top of a
      cabinet and walks it  over to the table: A half-finished
      game. He leans over   and blows on the pieces -- sending
      a small cloud of dust  into the air.
<b>                            HERB
</b>               Come on, son, you can run but you
               can't hide.
      Herb pulls up a chair and smiles as Frank appears from
      the kitchen, a bowl of popcorn in his hand. Frank takes
      a place across from his dad by the fire. The others
      gather round.
<b>                              HERB
</b>               Your move.
      Frank studies the board.   Rachel lowers her head into a
      cupped hand, fascinated.
<b>                            RACHEL
</b>               How long has this game been going
               on?
      Frank picks up a knight, thinks, sets it back down.
<b>                              FRANK
</b>               Three years.
      Nicki takes the bowl of popcorn and squats down with it
      beside Fletcher. Fletcher peers intently at the board
      as he chews on a handful.
<b>                            HERB
</b>               He had me on the run there that
               first year.
      Frank picks up his rook, scratches his forehead with it.
      He turns to Fletcher.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>               What do you think?
      Fletcher finishes a mouthful of popcorn, wipes his mouth.

      Frank, Herbert and Rachel turn in synch and stare at the
      boy.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>               City kid.

      Herb pats his leg, gesturing to Fletcher to take a place
      on his lap.
<b>                            HERB
</b>               Come over here, Fletcher, sit by

      Fletcher goes over and joins him.

</b>               Well, that's it for me, I'm

      She rises. Frank follows her up the stairs.   Nicki
      watches them go.

</b>      Frank stops at the end of the hallway, checking the lock
      on the window, the little terrier is at his heels.
      Rachel pauses outside the door. Frank gestures for the
      dog to stay. The dog sits in the middle of the hallway
      looking from one to the other. For a few seconds neither
      speaks.
      Frank smiles.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>               Good night, Rachel.
      Rachel accepts this. She smiles in return and touches
      him on the arm, very tenderly.
<b>                            RACHEL
</b>               Good night, Frank.
      Rachel turns, goes to her room and closes the door.

      the gentle LAPPING of the LAKEWATER against the dock.

</b>      Frank steps quietly into the hall. Nicki is standing
      in the shadows. She watches as Frank goes through the
      ritual of locking the front door, several ways.
<b>                            NICKI
</b>                      (softly)
               You're very thorough.
<b>      VARIOUS SHOTS - AROUND INTERIOR
</b>      Frank makes a circuit through the rooms of the first
      floor, checking windows and doors. Nicki tags along.
<b>                            NICKI
</b>               What's happening between you
               and Rachel?
      Frank glances at her.
<b>                            NICKI
</b>               Come on. One minute she's got
               magnetic hands, the next she hates
               you. I can't figure out what it
               is now.
<b>                            FRANK

</b>               No, it isn't.
      He moves away into the next room.    She hesitates a
      moment, then follows.

</b>               You must.    I do.
      Frank steps into a tight, dark, little window alcove,
      checks the windows.

</b>         Is it that easy?
Frank turns from the window to find Nicki blocking his exit.
She moves close to him and kisses him, her hands on his
shoulders. The kiss ends and they look at each other.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         You're a lovely woman.
<b>                      NICKI
</b>         But you don't want me.

Frank's look affirms it.    Nicki is embarrassed, angry.
<b>                      NICKI
</b>         I'm surprised. Thorough fellow
         like you. Why stop at one sister

</b>         I make my mistakes.
<b>                      NICKI
</b>         But you didn't say no to the boss.
She starts to turn away from him, but his hands are on her
now, holding her close, refusing to let her turn away.
Their faces are very close.    It is tight and near here.

         No, don't go away, Nicki. Don't
         leave me with that. Tell me about

         second. Tell me how she has a
         child and you don't. Tell me
         something. But don't turn away
         and try to stick it on me.
Nicki twists in his grip.    He holds her tight.

</b>         I don't need this from you.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         Maybe I need it.     I'm fed up with

       Henry appears at the porch of the house, carrying a
       fishing rod as he comes out. At that instant, the sound
       of the OUTBOARD MOTOR CRACKLES through the air. Frank's
       head snaps toward the boathouse. Henry, in the distance,
       looks quickly at the boathouse, then to Frank.

<b>                             HENRY
</b>                       (shouting)
                 Frank! I haven't...
       But Frank is already moving, leaping from the porch
       and starting to run flat out toward the boathouse
       and dock.
       Rachel turns to look.
       The skiff appears out of the boathouse, Fletcher at the
       motor, the boat's lone occupant. The boat moves slowly
       away from the boathouse, parallel to the dock.
       Frank is running toward the water with everything he's
       got, his face contorted. The sound of the OUTBOARD
       drowns out his voice as he yells.
<b>                               FRANK
</b>                 Fletcher!   Fletcher!
<b>       IN BOAT
</b>       Fletcher, intent on his piloting, neither hears nor sees
       Frank running down the lawn behind him. The boat is
       approaching the end of the dock.
<b>       DOCK
</b>       Frank finally makes it to the dock and continues to
       sprint after the boat. His weight rattles the boards
       as he runs.
<b>       IN BOAT
</b>       Fletcher passes the end of the dock and gives the
       throttle a little twist.
<b>       DOCK
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                             108.
</b>
Frank reaches the end of the dock at a full run and dives
directly at the rear of the moving boat. Frank's body
flies out over the boat. He knocks Fletcher out of his
seat and into the water on the other side of the skiff.
<b>                         RACHEL
</b>                   (screams)
           No!   He can't swim!
<b>IN WATER
</b>Frank holds the terrified, shaking Fletcher in his arms.
Fletcher begins to cry. Frank paddles with him toward
the dock. The empty boat swerves, then continues out
toward the center of the lake.

<b>DOCK
</b>Henry and Rachel are already    at the end of the dock. Nicki
and Herb are running toward    it. Rachel is livid, hysterical.
Henry peers out at the boat,    which continues to bounce
innocently across the water,    defining a broad curve.
<b>                        RACHEL
</b>           Fletcher, baby. Are you all
           right? Baby.
Fletcher, spluttering, is handed up to Rachel by Frank.
Rachel hugs Fletcher to her. Herb bends down to check
he's breathing properly, wrapping the boy in his jacket.
<b>                        HERB
</b>           He's all right.
Henry helps Frank up out of the water.    Frank sits on
the end of the dock, breathing hard.
<b>                        RACHEL
</b>           What are you doing? You out of
           your mind? You're crazy!
                  (to Fletcher)
           You're all right, baby.
                  (back to Frank)
           You could have drowned him!
Frank and Henry look out toward the boat which has come
to a stop out in the middle of the lake.
<b>                         FRANK
</b>           I'm sorry.   I got careless.
Henry looks at Frank.    He feels terrible about not
checking the boat.
<b>                        HENRY
</b>           Frank, I'm sorry. I should have...

</b><b>                                                                     109.
</b>
<b>                             HERB
</b>                It's okay, Henry.
       Herb puts his hand on Fletcher's head.
<b>                             HERB
</b>                You all right now, son?

       Fletcher nods, his crying ends raggedly.   Frank begins
       to stand up.
<b>                             HENRY
</b>                How do we get the boat back?
       Out in the center of the lake, the BOAT BLOWS UP.    Every-
       one on the dock jumps.

       Nicki screams.
       Frank sits down again. He shakes his head. On an
       impulse, he stretches out his hand, palm downward.   It's
       trembling slightly.

       hovers nearby.

</b>       Frank slides out from under the van. The hood is up.
       Henry stands nearby. Frank goes to the driver's seat.

</b>                       (to Henry)
                Back off.
       Henry moves away from the van.   Frank inserts the key in
       the ignition.

       woods as he heads towards the shed.
<b>                                HERB
</b>                Frank!
       Henry turns and motions to Herb to stay away.

        van is dead.

        walks to Herb.

</b>                 Someone's cut the phone lines. It

</b>                 Both the cars are dead. And I
                 can't see how it was done.
        Frank and Herb exchange a look.
<b>                              FRANK
</b>                 Who could know we're here? This

        Frank looks at him.

</b>                 We can't walk out of here at

        Frank shakes his head.

</b>                 We'll button down tonight and

        down brightly but the house is totally dark.

        watches from an upstairs window. Rachel lies in bed,
        clutching Fletcher tightly.

      with him. At first it seems silent, but slowly we become
      aware of a subtle symphony of sounds. An old house sur-
      rounded by WOODS. There are lots of NOISES. But they
      are regular, innocent.
      Frank is aware of a new noise, a gentle sobbing coming
      from nearby. He picks up his gun from the table beside
      him and goes into the kitchen.

<b>166   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                       166
</b>      Nicki is sitting with her head in her hands at the kitchen
      table, sobbing. There's a nearly empty bottle beside
      her. Frank is instantly on the alert but makes no sign.

<b>                            NICKI
</b>                      (crying)
               I was an idiot last night.
      There is a long pause.

</b>               What do you think about today?
<b>                            FRANK
</b>                      (gently)
               I think this is no maniac.   He
               knows what he's doing.
      There is a long, long silence.   Nicki continues crying.
      Finally --
<b>                            NICKI
</b>               You're right. He does.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>               Tell me about it.
      She doesn't reply.
<b>                            FRANK

         I don't know.   I don't know.
Frank goes to her, treats her gently, like a doctor.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         You can call him off.

<b>                      NICKI
</b>                (shaking her head)
         He doesn't even know who hired him.
         He doesn't know who I am and I
         don't know who he is.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         How'd you do it?

She seems on the edge of hysteria. Frank takes her face
in his hands, strokes her hair, brings her back from the
brink.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         How?
<b>                      NICKI

         ... and then some... Till it's done.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         He keeps going until he kills her?
Nicki nods again, lowering her face into her hands.
<b>                      FRANK
</b>         What's the name of the bar?
<b>                      NICKI
</b>         I'm not sure... I was very stoned.

               No, no. You don't understand.
               The letters came first. I don't
               know who's sending them... but
               they're reading my mind... Those
               were my thoughts. I hate her. It
               made me think I could do it... But
               I could never hurt Fletcher.
               Never.
                      (begging him)
               You've got to stop it!

      He starts to rise.    She stops him.
<b>                            NICKI
</b>               Don't you even want to know why?
<b>                               FRANK
</b>               You told me.     She has everything.
      Frank stands up and begins to move across the room. Nicki
      puts her face in her hands and is silent for one moment.
      Suddenly, Frank freezes, listening.
<b>                            NICKI
</b>               What if we can't --
      Frank motions her into silence. We strain to hear what
      Frank hears. Silently, Frank goes to the door, crouch
      ing. He listens. There again is a DISTANT GROWL from
      the DOG upstairs.
      Frank lifts his gun from the table, turns to Nicki.
<b>                              FRANK
</b>               Stay here.    Don't move.
      Nicki's face shows true terror.
      Frank is out the door.

       Frank travels close to the wall, very quickly. He stops,
       listens. The TERRIER looks at Frank but still GROWLS.
       Frank throws open Rachel's door. Rachel gasps in
       surprise and clutches at Fletcher. Frank hears a noise
       behind him, whirls round him and drops to a knee, weapon
       ready to fire!

       It's Herb, stepping out of his room, carrying a police-
       issue pistol.
<b>                             HERB

       delicately raised in a classic gesture of restraint.

       back to Herb. He starts to move towards the stairs,
       fast.

       checks her. She's dead. The door beyond is open.     The

       The DOG continues to BARK upstairs. Frank sees a slight
       movement outside and window to his right. A split-second
       moment of decision. He heads off rapidly down the hall,
       away from the open door.

       RUSTLING of TREES.

       body breaking through the bushes. Frank heads off
       towards the sound at a run.

       The move fitfully through the eerie, beautiful scene.
       In and out of the fog. Stop, listen,  wait, go. Two
       wary, interchangeable animals. Frank  disappears into
       the fog. When the figure reappears,  Frank is moving
       faster, closing the gap.

       The figure, seen in CLOSEUP for the first time, is wear-
       ing a dark-colored ski mask.  His breath billows out of
       the mouth hole, whitening in the cool March air. He
       hears Frank APPROACHING and points his gun in the
       direction of the FOOTSTEPS.  He does not fire. SILENCE.
       Frank stops and rests on his haunches. Listening, he
       hears the intruder move. The sounds have stopped up
       ahead. Close.

       The figure peers into the fog, gun up.   He's ready,
       confident. He waits. Nothing.
       Frank, from his crouch, does something brand-new. He
       raises his gun into the fog in a two-handed grip, ready
       to fire. He holds it easily. And then he does something
       really strange: Frank closes his eyes. After a beat, we
       hear MOVEMENT. Frank, eyes still closed, swings his gun
       15 degrees and FIRES TWO BLASTS.
       The man jumps away from a small tree that has splintered
       six inches from his shoulder. His eyes are wild behind
       his ski mask. Frightened, he suddenly crashes away in
       the opposite direction. We FOLLOW. There is ANOTHER
       SHOT from Frank very close to the man.

</b>       Herb is at the window. There is anguish on his face as
       he hears the SHOTS. He wants to go to his son's aid but
       knows he cannot leave Rachel.
       Rachel and Fletcher are huddled in the bed, terrified.
       Fletcher clutches at the DOG, which is still BARKING.
       Henry stands by the bed, gun in hand.

</b>       Frank moves quickly through the woods, passes the
       splintered tree. We STAY WITH him and hear the ENGINE
       of a CAR ROAR to life and TIRES PEEL OUT of the dirt.
       Frank breaks out of the woods in time to see the red
       lights at the back of the car as it fishtails around a
       bend. He EMPTIES his GUN at it. We hear GLASS
       SHATTERING, but the car keeps going.

</b>      Rachel's black limousine moves slowly up the winding
      drive, followed by a black Mercedes limousine. Behind
      the cars, the gates close on a large press contingent
      gathered outside, held back by a large number of police
      and security guards. A light drizzle is falling.
      The two cars pull up to the entrance, Henry at the wheel
      of Rachel's. Frank gets out of the front and opens the
      back door. Devaney and Spector help Rachel and Fletcher
      out of the car. They are all dressed in black. A few
      other mourners, including Emma, get out of the Mercedes.
      Rachel, red-eyed and weary, takes Fletcher under her arm
      and goes inside. She does not look at Frank.

</b>      It has grown very dark in the family room. Frank is
      sitting all alone, perfectly still, in one of the over-
      stuffed chairs, the vodka bottle on a table next to him.
      He stares off into space. A small voice comes out of
      the darkness.
<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               You okay, Frank?
      Frank acknowledges Fletcher's small presence standing
      to the side of the big chair. He doesn't look at him
      directly.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>               Yeah, Fletcher, I'm okay.     How

</b>               I couldn't sleep... It was so
               scary, just thinking about it...
      He looks at Frank.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                    119.

<b>                            FRANK
</b>               Yeah, Fletcher, I do.

      Frank puts his hand gently on Fletcher's head, but he
      does not look at him.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>               Everybody's afraid of something,
               Flethcer. That's how we know we
               care about something, when we're
               afraid we'll lose it.

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               What are you afraid of?
<b>                            FRANK

<b>                            FLETCHER
</b>               Tell me, Frank, please. Is it the
               man who killed Nicki? Are you
               afraid of him?
      Finally, Frank turns and looks at Fletcher.    Frank is
      pretty far gone. He shakes his head "no."     He realizes
      that that kind of fear had never occurred to   him, and
      recognizing that fact sets him back into his   thoughts.
<b>                              FLETCHER
</b>               Then what?    What are you afraid

      Frank doesn't have the will to resist anymore.    He lets
      his hand drop away from Fletcher.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>               I'm afraid... of not being there...
      Fletcher stares at him, uncomprehending.
<b>                            FRANK
</b>               It's late. Do you want me to take
               you back to your room?
      Fletcher shakes his head "no," just barely.    Then he
      disappears.

</b>      Frank begins climbing the stairs. When he has gone a
      quarter of the way up, Rachel appears at the top and
      begins walking down.

      At first she doesn't see Frank; when she does she
      hesitates a moment, then continues down. They meet and
      try to sidestep each other, but twice they go in the
      same direction, unable to get around. Rachel, already
      emotionally ravaged, cracks. She begins slapping Frank
      hard about the face and torso. One of the first blows
      knocks the GLASS from his hand; it SMASHES loudly against
      the wall. He raises his arms in a half-hearted attempt
      to protect himself from the onslaught. She cries as she
      hits him.
<b>                            RACHEL
</b>                      (hysterical)
               You, you, you... You brought this
               pain into my house... Now you're
               here! Where were you then? Why
               didn't you save her? It was your
               job to protect me and she died
               doing it... It was me they were
               after. And you let them kill her!
                      (she gasps for air)
               She never did anything to anyone.
      As she loses the strength and the will to hit him, her
      blows become sloppy, weak. She sinks to the steps,
      sitting on them, sobbing.
<b>                            RACHEL
</b>               She never hurt anyone. She was
               good.
                      (she looks at him;
                       entreats him)
               You saw her. She never wished
               anyone any harm. Did she? Did
               she?
      Frank looks at her, shakes his head "no." Rachel puts
      her head in her hands and is silent for a few moments;
      her crying slows.
<b>                            RACHEL
</b>                      (finally, quietly)
               She never hurt a soul.
                      (long pause)
               ... I didn't love her well enough.
               I didn't take care of her...
                      (a beat)
               ... She gave me only love.

       She sits quietly on the steps in the gloom. Frank watches
       for a long moment, then softly continues on his way.

</b>       It's bright sunshine. Fletcher is splashing noisily in
       the pool with a few other kids. His nanny waits
       patiently at the side, towels at the ready.
       At one side of the pool, Rachel sits, lost in thought,
       mourning her sister.
       At the other side sits Frank, also thoughtful. He, too,
       is trying to adjust to the tragedy for which he bears
       some of the responsibility.

       The SHOUTS and LAUGHTER of the kids continue.

</b>       The guardhouse at the main gate is brilliantly illumi-
       nated in the distance. The guard patrols at his station.
       Inside, the T.V. screens flicker and glow.
       Perched on the top of a slight   hill, Frank sits alone and
       motionless under a big tree.    He gazes down at the gate-
       house, his face lit softly by   the glow from its lamps.
       All around him the rest of the   estate is quiet and
       tranquil in the moonlight.
       After a moment, another silhouetted figure slowly ap-
       proaches and stands beside him. It's Rachel.

Rachel takes this philosophically.     She tugs at the
grass, thinking.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         When I was back in Squirrel Hill,
         I started betting my friends
         fifty bucks each that someday I'd
         win an Oscar. You can understand
         how important it is that they see
         me up there if I win.
She looks at him and smiles.

<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         I know. But I can't stay up here
         on my hill forever.
They are silent for awhile.     Rachel lies back on the
grass, stares at the sky.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         I didn't get to this place in my

                (as Frank nods)
         How 'bout you, Frank Farmer? Out
         there on the edge... did you ever
         do something that didn't make too
         much sense, except maybe inside
         you? In your stomach somewhere?
         Something that wasn't smart?
                (looks at him)
         I'll bet you have plenty. I'll
         bet you do. Nobody gets really
         good without it. And you're good.
         I know that.

      Frank almost smiles.

</b>               That's right.
      He looks at her a long time, then takes her in his arms.

</b>      The limo is waiting in a line of limos to reach the red-
      carpeted entrance to The Pantages Theatre.
      Frank and Tony sit in front with Henry. In the back a
      spectacularly-gowned Rachel sits flanked by Devaney and
      Spector, both of whom, like Frank, are wearing tuxedos.     Up
      ahead, they can all see the hubbub at the entrance: TV
      cameras, lights, photographers, arriving guests, two
      bleachers full of fans. The glare from the arc lights
      is almost blinding.

      with the unexpected support.

      Rachel leans forward and flips down the mirror on the
      panel in front of her and checks her appearance. The
      limo moves up.

      The limo is almost at the red carpet.   Frank slips out
      the front door of the moving limo.

      The TV cameras all focus on the door of the limo as Frank
      steps out of the way.

      ahead in the distance, to the door, to the side at
      photographers nodding to the massed security men with
      their walkie-talkies.
      Rachel's smile is convincing, lovely, professional.
      Spector, Devaney and Tony look strained.
      As they enter, a WIDE SHOT from across the street shows
      their limo pulling ahead as the next car pulls up. The
      CAMERA TRACKS SIDEWAYS to reveal the rear fender of a
      Toyota 4X4 parked in the foreground.

      A TV monitor hangs from the ceiling in one corner. On

      Beside the monitor, a large clock with a ticking second

      Skip takes a typewritten sheet from a sheaf in his hand
      and gives it to Rachel. He consults a clipboard as he
      speaks. There, laid out minute by minute, is the order
      of the evening's events. Each one has a precise time
      printed beside it, including those that involve Rachel.

Clive and Rachel climb the stairs. Rachel turns once
more to look anxiously at Frank. She clutches the cross
but he doesn't see.
Frank watches them ascend. He signals Tony to stay
there until Rachel goes on. Frank moves off toward the

      Rachel is trying, but is obviously distracted.

</b>      As the applause dies away, we see  what they see: TV
      cameras, an orchestra in the pit,  the huge audience, and
      the bright glare of the lights.   At the front of the
      podium is the transparent plastic  of the teleprompter;
      their lines can be clearly seen,  printed out and moving
      vertically.

               and you'll want to leave as soon
               as we're done.
      Rachel's lines appear on the prompter, but she does not
      start reading them immediately. They stop moving on the
      screen. Rachel's face, her eyes darting about. There
      is an awful silence.

      start from the tiny receiver on his belt. He's puzzled.

      smiling out at the audience.

      FROM BEHIND Clive and Rachel, we watch as Clive picks up
      Rachel's lines from the prompter, AD LIBBING to make them
      fit.

                  they're going to help others once
                  they make it themselves, but Rachel
                  really follows through. I'd also
                  like to thank Helen Pollak, a

      Frank comes up. He    does not try to force his way through
      to Rachel. People    begin to move away, the cluster thins.
      Two stars move off   toward the back of the stage.

in the audience. As the people move off, Rachel becomes
clearly visible to Frank. Tony is standing next to her,
but another man has his arm around Rachel, comforting her.
Rachel's face is tear-stained and she dabs at it with a
handkerchief. She is recovering fast. Past her fear,
she is now very embarrassed. Her voice is strong.

<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Christ, what an idiot I am.
         Jesus. What the hell's the matter

Frank moves up closer, and exchanges looks with Tony,
who is confused by Rachel's behavior. Rachel turns
toward Frank and, in so doing, brings the man comforting
her around to face Frank. It is Reardon.
<b>                      RACHEL
</b>         Farmer, you've made me a raving
         lunatic.
Frank barely hears Rachel, so struck is he   by Reardon's
presence. Frank looks around them quickly    for Portman.
Rachel looks at Frank with irritation and   turns back
toward the Green Room. A production aide    signals Reardon.

</b>         Thank you for your help, John.
         I'm fine.
Rachel walks off toward the Green Room with Tony.
Reardon starts to walk out toward the stage. Frank stops
him. Reardon is irritated.

Reardon walks out on stage. Frank is left standing alone.
All the weariness comes back, all his senses start to hum.
Frank looks around, then moves off toward the Green Room.

</b>      Frank comes up swiftly. He stops behind a curtain, six
      feet from the path the winner will take. Tony is there.
      Frank speaks to him and, as he does, he puts a hand on
      Tony's arm. They both look across the stage, past
      Winston into the wings on the other side.
<b>      FRANK'S POV
</b>      In the wings of the opposite side of the stage, half
      hidden by a curtain, a TV cameraman is hoisting his
      lightweight portable camera onto his shoulder. His back
      is to us.

      Tony trots off quickly.
<b>      FRANK'S POV
</b>      The cameraman half-turns toward us, peering past the
      curtain into the audience. For a split second, we
      glimpse his face. It's Portman. Then someone crosses
      quickly in front of him and he's gone.

      Tony's already on his way, trotting round the labyrinth
      behind the set.
      Frank automatically raises his sleeve to call to Tony,
      then realizes his communications are useless. He tries
      to see where Portman has disappeared to, but he daren't
      lose sight of Rachel.

      Rachel stands. Devaney and Spector kiss her. People
      nearby reach out to touch her. Rachel walks along her
      row. The orchestra plays "I Have Nothing."

</b>      A mass of drapes and flats. Behind them, the cameraman
      is fixing something to the side of his camera. His back
      is to us. Tony comes up briskly behind him, unable to
      see his face.

      With amazing speed, the cameraman - Portman - wheels
      around, simultaneously jabbing two outstretched fingers
      from his free hand straight into Tony's eyes. Tony
      cries out, his hands flying to his face.
      Portman's hand moves swiftly again, jabbing to a nerve
      behind Tony's ear, Tony drops like a sack.
      Glancing rapidly around, Portman sees all other eyes on
      the auditorium. He pulls the curtain around Tony's
      body - obscuring it.
      He then removes his own "SECURITY" ID and fixes a
      laminated "PRESS" ID to his lapel.

      his words and we do not hear them. The guards rush off
      backstage and into the auditorium.

Rachel walks along her row. Hands reach out to her.
Some people stand in their seats around her. A crane-
mounted TV camera swoops down between Frank and his view
of Rachel, obscuring her for a brief instant.

</b>
Desperately scanning, seeking.   Suddenly his face
freezes.
<b>FRANK'S POV
</b>As Rachel reaches the center aisle and starts to walk
toward the steps, there in the far aisle, his face almost
hidden, is Portman -- the camera, hand-held on his
shoulder, moving level with Rachel, 20 feet behind her.

Frank raises his gun.

<b>AISLE
</b>Rachel walks down the aisle toward the side steps. Tears
in her eyes. Thunderous applause. Security guards in
the side aisles look around in all directions. They
can't see anything.

</b>TIGHT ON Portman, now almost completely obscured behind
the members of the audience, as more and more of them

      deafening.
<b>      FRANK'S FACE
</b>      He can't see Portman past the glare. He can't fire into
      the audience. He knows Rachel is now at her most vulner-
      able. There is only one thing he can do to protect his
      charge.
<b>      BACKSTAGE WINGS
</b>      Frank runs on stage at terrific speed and leaps through
      the air at Rachel, twisting his body as he does.

<b>      ON STAGE - PODIUM

      Rachel turns her head, sees Frank leaping at her and
      gasps out with a mixture of fury and terror.

      Totally calm and, as he gambled, invisible in the commo-
      tion. Camera still on his shoulder, he slowly backs
      away from the scene. Ushers and uniformed security men
      rush past him towards the stage. People leap from their
      seats. A woman screams piercingly behind him. Portman
      doesn't blink.

</b>      Dozens more helpers pour onto the stage around Frank and
      Rachel. Rachel starts to rise on all fours and sees, as
      hands reach out to help her, the blood on Frank's shirt.
      He has taken the hits for her. But he's still on the
      job, gaze alert. Without taking his eyes from the audi-
      torium, his left arm stretches out, with some pain, to
      push Rachel back down. The right arm, gun in hand,
      sweeps the auditorium. Where is Portman? Frank can't
      see past the mob.
      Ushers fall on Frank in a heap, trying to disarm him.
      Security men try to pull them off. Rachel shouts,
      trying to make herself heard above the noise.

      He walks away. Suddenly, for one brief second, his face
      loses its composure as he looks to the side door.
<b>      PORTMAN'S POV
</b>      Hysterical audience members jostle for the exit, screaming
      and shouting. It's like a football scrum. Cops and secur-

      Cool again, he turns back to the stage, seeking an

      A lumbering figure, blood streaming from one eye, his
      .38 drawn and outstretched. It's Tony staggering to the
      edge of the stage, straight towards his attacker.

      Frank and Rachel's heads swivel in unison at the sound,
      looking towards the far aisle.
<b>      PORTMAN
</b>      Against the side wall at the front, Portman's eyes
      desperately scan for the source of the voice. He sees
      Tony, his pistol takes aim.
<b>      FRANK'S POV
</b>      For a split second, two running figures f.g. pass and
      cross leaving a momentary clear line to Portman.

</b>      Frank FIRES.   ONCE.   TWICE.
<b>      PORTMAN
</b>      Frank's bullets hit home. The first slams Portman in the
      chest, knocking him against the wall. The second hits
      the CAMERA on his shoulder, EXPLODING it around his face.
<b>      FEMALE ACADEMY MEMBER
</b>      Blood spatters her white Armani dress and the shirt-
      front of her escort. Portman's body slumps forward in
      her lap, pinning her back in her seat. He's dead. His
      pistol drops onto a pair of shiny, black leather pumps.

</b>      Frank holds his aim steady, reluctant to look away. He
      half turns to Rachel, wincing with the effort. She's
      unhurt. He has fulfilled his promise to her.
      Rachel throws her arms around Frank and hugs him, tears
      streaming down her cheeks.

      Frank Farmer's face. Sad and weary. His guard is

      the gun, closes his eyes and lets his head fall onto his
      chest.

<b>      ANGLE ON SPECTOR

      In the midst of the commotion of medics, security men,
      police and ushers, Spector bends down and gently retrieves
      the gold envelope and the card bearing Rachel's name.
      There are splatters of blood on it. He tries to wipe
      them off with the silk handkerchief from his breast pocket.

</b>      Police and paramedics surrounding a man on a stretcher --
      it is Frank -- Rachel walks at his side, clutching his
      hand as he is rushed to an ambulance. Tony, a dressing
      over his eyes, is also helped out by paramedics. Among
      the gathered crowd, we focus in on one face. It is Dan,
      pushed back to the sidelines and unable to see what is
      happening. He slowly turns and walks away. CAMERA
      CRANES to a HIGH WIDE SHOT of the scene.

</b>      A buffed-out charter turboprop stands on the tarmac as
      the last pieces of equipment of Rachel's band are loaded
      aboard from a truck. A limousine pulls up and Rachel
      gets out with Tony and Court, who is clearly acting as
      her bodyguard.
      She greets some members of the band and others who will
      be part of her entourage. A roadie has her luggage
      removed from the limo and loaded aboard the plane.
      Devaney is trying to hurry her on board. Spector is
      conspicuous by his absence.
      As Rachel and the others prepare to get onto the plane,
      Tony, wearing a dark leather eyepatch, reacts to
      something O.S.
      Frank approaches from the nearby parking area. He is
      pale. Under his clothes it can be seen that his torso is
      still taped. He smiles as Tony. Their handshake becomes
      a quick abrazo.

Tony fakes a glancing blow to Frank's chin. Over by the
plane, Fletcher spots Frank and tugs at Rachel's dress,
till she turns to look. Fletcher runs up to Frank and
hugs him around the knees. Rachel approaches and Tony
moves back toward the plane.
Devaney waves in Frank's direction, tapping his watch to
indicate they are late. Frank waves and smiles.
Rachel's surprised to see Frank, but clearly happy.
Fletcher is ecstatic.
<b>                      RACHEL

Frank laughs.    There is a pause.

The steps start to fold down out of the plane, but not
fast enough for Rachel.
She jumps the last six feet, staggering slightly as the
plane's jet wash hits her, whipping her clothes and hair.
Without pausing, she runs to Frank who takes her in his
arms. They embrace and kiss. They kiss again and again.
Finally, slowly, Rachel draws back, her eyes are filled
with tears.

           laid it all on the line for me.
Frank tries to speak, she puts her hands to his lips.
<b>                        RACHEL
</b>           Don't wreck this for me. I don't
           want to hear any bullshit about
           you just doing your job. You did
           more than save my life, Frank.
           You showed me a way to be. And I
           love you for it.
                  (a beat)
           There, I said it.
                  (looks at him)
           I'll never forget what it felt
           like to be under your eye. Never.
<b>                        FRANK
</b>                  (smiles)
           I won't be forgetting you either.
She presses something into Frank's hand.
<b>                        RACHEL
</b>           Here... I want you to keep this.
           If you ever need me, you just put
           this on and no matter where you
           are I will find you.  I promise.
She gives him a quick kiss and walks back toward the
plane, her eyes holding Frank's. Frank opens his palm
to reveal the little enamel cross.
<b>ON FRANK
</b>as the engines roar and the plane turns to taxi out.

</b><b>                                                                   150.

      The ROAR of the plane becomes APPLAUSE.

<b>227   EXT. CONCERT - NIGHT                                       227
</b>      Rachel's face in FULL FRAME, bathed in light and the
      applause of a huge audience.

<b>                            RACHEL
</b>               Thank you... Thank you... Now I
               want to sing you an old song, but
               it's a new favorite.
      As the music begins, Rachel stands alone in front of the
      band, mike in hand.

<b>                            RACHEL
</b>               You know, this song used to make
               me feel sad... But it doesn't
               anymore.
      Rachel pauses.   The audience is still.
<b>                            RACHEL
</b>               Now it just reminds me of someone
               very special... This is for him.
      Rachel begins to sing the song 'WHAT BECOMES OF THE
      BROKEN HEARTED' - slow and sweet.
      It's the song she and Frank danced to.    As a VERSE
<b>      TRAILS OFF --
</b>
<b>228   INT. CLERMONT HOTEL (IOWA CITY) - NIGHT                    228
</b>      It is a Rotary Dinner.
      The CAMERA TRACKS ALONG the front of the head table which
      runs from one side of the room to the other.
<b>                            ROTARY PRESIDENT (O.S.)
</b>               Our speaker this evening, the
               honorable congressman from the
               fifth district, Galen Windsor, has
               been a lone, courageous, voice...
               he alone has challenged those who
               have linked organized crime with
               legitimate business throughout our
               state.
      STILL TRACKING, we see the Rotary  President as he nods to
      a distinguished-looking gentleman  one seat to his right.
      On the wall a sign identifying the  hotel and a club
      banner which reads -- "THE ROTARY  CLUB OF IOWA CITY."
      The CAMERA CONTINUES to TRACK and  the Rotary President
      goes OUT OF FRAME.

</b><b>                                                                  151.
</b>

<b>                            ROTARY PRESIDENT (O.S.)
</b>               But first our benediction will be
               delivered by Reverend Phillip
               Hardy of the First Presbyterian Church.
      STILL TRACKING we see the Reverend get up as the men
      around him bow their heads.
<b>                            REVEREND HARDY
</b>               Heavenly Father, please bless us
               today as we meet in friendship and duty.
      STILL TRACKING as we REACH the end of the table.
<b>                            REVEREND HARDY (O.S.)
</b>               And Lord, whatever dangerous
               endeavors those among us may take,
               let them never be without your
               sanctuary.
      The CAMERA STOPS. Standing against the wall behind the
      table is Frank. As the Reverend's prayer goes on, all
      heads are bowed to receive the benediction. All heads
      but Frank's. The CAMERA MOVES IN TIGHT ON his face.
<b>                            REVEREND HARDY
</b>               ... For all we know in our hearts
               that even though we may walk
               through the valley of the shadow
               of death, you are with us...
               guiding and protecting us. Amen.
      The Reverend's final words segue into Rachel's song.
      Frank's searching gaze around the room is arrested for
      a moment as though reacting to Rachel's voice.

<b>229   INT. CONCERT - NIGHT                                     229
</b>      Rachel ends a phrase. She dabs at the corner of her eye
      as she continues the song that still binds them together.

<b>230   INT. ROTARY CLUB DINNER - NIGHT                          230
</b><b>      VERY CLOSE ON FRANK
</b>      His expression, so intense in the opening scene of the
      film, is softer now. Rachel's voice continues as Frank
      carefully scans the room.
<b>                                                FADE OUT:
