EXT. NAZARETH - MORNING

From above: Flying close over a thick grove of olive trees. 
MUSIC fades into the sound of wings beating through the air. 
We hear (OVER) the voice of a young man, thoughtful but 
strong.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	The feeling begins. It's a light 
	tingling at first. Right on the top 
	of my head. Very tender. Like a 
	caress. Soft wings carrying me to 
	Paradise. Then the pain starts.

Now we see JESUS, the son of Mary, 28 years-old, sleeping 
under an olive tree. The mid-morning sun (OVER-EXPOSED) shines 
on his stubby face. He is dreaming.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	It feels like the bird has grabbed 
	me from behind. Just above the neck. 
	Talons slip underneath the skin and 
	work and claw their way up the back 
	of my neck. Then the real pain begins. 
	Each claw digs into the soft matter 
	behind my brain, and then across the 
	top of my head toward my eyes. Just 
	before they reach my eyes, they dig 
	down...

Jesus wakens. He looks around.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	And I remember. I have to make a 
	cross.

While he is still speaking he reaches up to touch the back 
of his head, where the pain started. He pulls his fingers 
away. There is blood on them.

						CUT TO:

INT. CARPENTER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

Jesus shapes a long piece of timber with an adze. His patched 
tunic rests on the workbench. Walls are hung with tools.

A nail-studded belt hangs from a hook above his head. The 
belt is speckled with dried blood. Two drops of fresh blood 
drip off the belt onto the ground.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	At first I fasted for three months. 
	Then I whipped myself before sleeping. 
	At first it worked, then the headaches 
	returned. I know it's God. Or the 
	devil. Who can tell them apart? They 
	exchange faces; God sometimes becomes 
	all darkness, the devil all light, 
	and they become confused in my mind.

Outside, there are NOISES of a crowd gathering nearby. 
Undistracted, he finishes off the piece of timber, which has 
become the crossbar of a cross. He places the crossbar between 
two brackets on the wall, then puts himself halfway between 
them and stretches out his arms, gauging the proper 
proportion.

						CUT TO:

EXT. NAZARETH STREET - DAY

Narrow and crowded with citizens on their way to a 
crucifixion. A ROMAN SOLDIER watches them with professional 
disinterest. His armour is non-existent, his uniform is 
certainly not splendid. He looks like a sloppy traffic cop. 
PEOPLE come from behind him and walk in front.

Over the soldier's left shoulder appears a man with blazing 
red hair and beard, moving with the crowd. He walks close 
behind the soldier for just a moment. Very professionally, 
he cuts his throat. The soldier falls to the ground. The man 
keeps walking calmly and the camera follows as, in the 
background, people start to notice that a soldier has been 
stabbed.

A WOMAN screams. Two other MEMBERS of the crowd grab her and 
silence her, while SEVERAL OTHERS drag the body off into a 
hut.

The red-haired man keeps walking. This is JUDAS.

EXT. NAZARETH CARPENTER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

Jesus looks toward the door, almost as if he has felt the 
murder.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	Who is it? Who are you? Why are you 
	following me?

Judas enters, sees Jesus working on the cross.

		JUDAS
	Are you ready?

Jesus doesn't answer.

		JUDAS
	I said are you ready?

He grabs him. Jesus still doesn't answer. He keeps working.

		JUDAS
	You're a disgrace.

Jesus smiles at him.

		JESUS
	I'm the disgrace? Judas, I see the 
	blood on your knife.

Judas lets go of him. He takes the knife from inside his 
cloak and removes it from its scabbard. He wipes the blood 
off the blade with a rag.

		JUDAS
	Come with us. Help us.

		JESUS
	Leave me alone.

		JUDAS
	No. This time you won't finish.

He grabs Jesus' hands and holds them.

		JUDAS
	Listen. Everything's ready. We're 
	going to save the Zealot. He could 
	be the one we've been waiting for. 
	You can't just pray for the Messiah. 
	You've got to help him. You can't 
	expect God to do everything. He needs 
	our help too.

		JESUS
	He'll have to do it without me.

		JUDAS
	You might be killing the Messiah. 
	This Zealot today is not like all 
	the others. I feel it. He's different. 
	Don't finish the cross. Come with 
	us. Don't you want to be part of it? 
	You want the Romans to be here 
	forever?

		JESUS
	The Messiah has nothing to do with 
	the Romans.

		JUDAS
	Yes he does. How else do you expect 
	to be free? If this Zealot is the 
	Messiah and we don't save him, then 
	he'll die and we'll never know. But 
	if we save him, the miracle might 
	happen.

		JESUS
	What miracle?

		JUDAS
	The sign, the signal. The royal crown 
	of David will shine on his head.

		JESUS
	It can't be much of a miracle if we 
	have to help.

		JUDAS
	You're not even ashamed.

		JESUS
	No.

		JUDAS
	Romans can't find carpenters to make 
	crosses. Except for you. You throw 
	yourself into it like a madman. 
	Everybody thinks you're crazy. But 
	not me. I can see through this act 
	of yours. Fainting, hearing voices, 
	having visions. Everyone thinks you're 
	a madman. But I know what your are. 
	You're an enemy. You're worse than 
	the Romans. You're a Jew who's killing 
	Jews. And you're not ashamed. You 
	don't even have any pride.

		JESUS
	No, I don't have any pride. I don't 
	go to Synagogue. I disobey the 
	commandments. I work on the Sabbath. 
	Your Messiahs? You find them, I'll 
	crucify them.

Judas hits Jesus across the mouth.

		JUDAS
	You're lucky you're a Jew.

		JESUS
	Why?

		JUDAS
	Anyone else would have been dead by 
	now. You think Zealots are murderers? 
	We're pathfinders, we're patriots, 
	and you're in the way.

		JESUS
	Then get me out of the way.

Judas and Jesus stare each other down.

		JUDAS
	I will. In my time. Not yours. When 
	I'm told.

		JESUS
	When did you ever need permission to 
	kill anybody?

		JUDAS
	To kill a Roman, never. To kill a 
	Jew, we all have to agree. We have 
	more respect for Jews than you do. 
	The next time I see you, you're dead.

EXT. CARPENTER'S WORKSHOP - DAY

A CENTURION pushes his way through a small crowd.

Jesus stands ready outside the workshop, the crossbar resting 
against a wall. The crowd is taunting him with cries of 
"Crossmaker!," "Traitor," "Cooperator," "Collaborator," but 
he ignores them.

Someone throws something. A MAN in the crowd deliberately 
jostles him roughly, trying to start a fight. The Centurion 
breaks things up.

		CENTURION
	Leave him alone. You ready?
		(as Jesus nods)
	Come on.

Jesus buckles the nail-studded belt around his waist. The 
Centurion helps Jesus heft the cross-beam to his shoulders. 
The Centurion leads Jesus through a gauntlet the crowd has 
formed from the village to the crucifixion site on the edge 
of Nazareth. Ahead, six Roman soldiers lead the protesting 
ZEALOT. Two mounted soldiers flank the group. The Zealot's 
hands are tied behind him. His clothes are torn and bloody, 
his long hair and grey beard matted with blood and sweat.

		ZEALOT
	You're the people of Israel! God is 
	with us! He's judging us now! Fight!

The soldiers push him along.

		MAN IN CROWD
	How long do we have to wait for the 
	Messiah?

		ANOTHER MAN
	Until you die! Because he's not 
	coming.

		WOMAN IN CROWD
	He forgot about us! He doesn't want 
	us!

		YOUNG MAN
	Listen to the Zealot! God is strength.

		MAN
	Give us strength now!

A Roman soldier slams the Man against the wall, then shoves 
the crowd back as the Zealot passes. The crowd cools down a 
little.

Now the villagers heap abuse on Jesus. MARY, 56, mother of 
Jesus, pushes her way through the crowd. A MAN is about to 
throw a stone at Jesus. She grabs his arm, tries to pry the 
stone from his fingers.

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	Don't touch him. Get away from him.

She starts pushing people away in angry desperation.

		WOMAN IN CROWD
	You defend him.

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	Yes. He's my son. He doesn't know 
	what he's doing.

The crowd now starts pushing Mary. She resists. A Centurion 
breaks up the melee. Jesus continues on his way.

The Zealot has reached the crucifixion site: a rocky, flint 
covered mound. The soldiers wait for the cross.

Children throw pebbles at Jesus as he approaches the Zealot. 
The Roman guards brace themselves for violence.

Jesus sets the cross down beside the Zealot who is held by 
guards.

Mary comes through the crowd, takes her son by the arm.

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	Alright. Come away now.

Jesus pulls away from her. She goes after him but a guard 
yanks her back into the crowd. The Centurion gathers some 
pieces of parchment together as the Zealot's voice rings 
out:

		ZEALOT
	Listen! Don't be afraid! God is 
	strong. Rome is smoke. God will blow 
	it away. Remember the Maccabees, 
	remember how they threw out the 
	Greeks! We'll throw out the Romans 
	the same way. There's only one God 
	of Hosts and he's our God!

		CENTURION
		(he's heard it all 
		before)
	Finished?

Without waiting for an answer, the Centurion begins to read 
the charges against the Zealot.

		CENTURION
	'This man naked before you now is 
	condemned for sedition, for lifting 
	his hand against Rome. Even as a boy 
	he pulled the Imperial Eagle from 
	walls. He ran to the mountains and 
	rallied the people to Revolution. He 
	promised a Messiah would come from 
	among the people to rise up and 
	destroy Rome...'

He starts paging through the parchment, his interest 
wandering.

		CENTURION
	'...murder... betrayal' ...so on... 
	'looting...' and so on... 'and 
	therefore he is condemned to die. 
	Rome condemns him. All the Gods of 
	Rome condemn him.' And I condemn 
	him. Start.

The Zealot has been stripped naked and laid down on the cross-
bar. The guards prepare to drive the nails into his wrists. 
A hush comes over the crowd.

The spike is placed in the Zealot's wrist. The hammer drives 
it home. The Zealot's scream (almost ecstatic) is echoed by 
the crowd.

Blood spurts from his wounds: a drop splatters on Jesus' 
lips.

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Close angle on Jesus, who is speaking vehemently.

		JESUS
	Speak softer! I can't understand! 
	Softer!

Silence.

		JESUS
	I still can't... stop... Are you 
	trying to make me understand, or do 
	you just want to hurt me?
		(pause; then, as if 
		answering)
	Well, if I don't belong here, with 
	men, where do I belong? Tell me! Or 
	do you just want to punish me?

Still silence.

Now we see the whole room, which is a small area just off 
the kitchen. Jesus is alone. His Mother enters. Jesus looks 
over.

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	What are you hearing?

She sits near him and puts her hand over his.

		JESUS
	They want to know if I'm afraid. 
	Afraid! Of course I'm afraid!
		(looking up)
	Hear that? I am afraid. Is that what 
	you want? Alright.

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	What do they want?

		JESUS
	They want me to speak. To go out and 
	speak!

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	Speak about what?

		JESUS
	About the Kingdom of Heaven. But I 
	don't care about the Kingdom of 
	Heaven. I like earth. I like to eat, 
	sleep, see a woman without my head 
	being torn in half.

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	But you can have that right now.

		JESUS
	No! Because anytime I try to get 
	what everybody else has, the pain 
	starts. And the voices.

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	And so you make crosses!

		JESUS
	Yes, I make crosses! To keep him 
	quiet. To make God hate me! To make 
	him find somebody else.

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	You're sure it's God? You're sure 
	it's not the Devil?

		JESUS
	I'm not sure. I'm not sure of 
	anything.

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	If it's the devil, the devil can be 
	cast out.

		JESUS
	What if it's God? You can't cast out 
	God.

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	But if it's God, why should he hurt 
	you?

		JESUS
	Because he loves me. And I don't 
	want him to love me. I want him to 
	hate me! I want to crucify every one 
	of his Messiahs.

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	The more you dare God, the more you 
	make him angry. Maybe that's why 
	he's made you so unhappy here.

		JESUS
	Where?

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	Here. With people. Maybe you shouldn't 
	be here.

		JESUS
	If I don't belong with people, who 
	do I belong with, God?

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	I don't know. Go and ask him. Go 
	where God is.

EXT. EDGE OF NAZARETH - DAWN

Jesus begins his journey to go where God is. He walks with a 
certainty we have not seen before.

Nazareth, seen behind him, is stirring to life. Jesus' path 
takes him past the crucifixion site of the day before. At 
the foot of the cross are several GUARDS who are dividing up 
the Zealot's clothes. One of the Guards sees Jesus and calls 
to him.

		GUARD
	Crossmaker! Here's your share.

The Guard throws the Zealot's bloody headcloth. Jesus holds 
it for a moment.

		GUARD
	What's the matter? Don't you want 
	it?

		JESUS
	Yes. I want it.

He puts the headcloth on.

						CUT TO:

EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE NAZARETH - EARLY MORNING

Jesus strides across a grassy plain. Much of the "lake 
district" of Galilee was a fertile and pleasant valley. Jesus 
leans his body into the wind as he reaches a ridge.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	All this time I've been cursing him, 
	trying to make him hate me. All that 
	pain for something so simple, I should 
	have realized. He just wants me to 
	devote my life to him. If that's 
	what it takes to stop the pain, I'm 
	happy. Only one road leads to God. 
	And it comes out in the desert. God's 
	waiting for me in a well in the 
	monastery. He does love me. I'll 
	hide under his wings.

Jesus watches a small caravan in the distance and follows 
its path.

						CUT TO:

EXT. GALILEE - DAY

Jesus passes two PEASANT GIRLS reaping in an open field. 
Their partially open dresses reveal their bodies. Their open 
sexuality intimidates Jesus.

		PEASANT GIRL
	Are you going to Magela?

		JESUS
	No. To the monastery.

They laugh.

		SECOND GIRL
	Then you take the other road.

		PEASANT GIRL
	If you really want to.

		SECOND GIRL
	Why not stop and have some bread 
	with us?

They're teasing him a little now and he's slightly 
embarrassed.

		JESUS
	No, thank you. I can't.

They smile as they watch him go.

LATER - JESUS

Walks alone along the windy seashore.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	Lord, thank you for everything, for 
	the loneliness, the hunger, the cold. 
	I don't need anything else.

Hearing FOOTSTEPS, he stops abruptly. Turns and looks.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	Who's that? Who's following me?

Seeing nothing, Jesus starts again. The FOOTSTEPS return -- 
LOUDER.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	Is that you?

He clutches his head, collapses to his knees in pain:

		JESUS (V.O.)
	Magdalene! Magdalene!

						CUT TO:

EXT. MAGDALA - DAY

Three camels in the forefront of a caravan kneel to the 
ground. Their riders and the camels are completely covered 
with sand. As the camels rest, the riders open their cloaks 
revealing bright robes of red, blue and gold and exotic 
jewelry.

Jesus walks past the caravan on the main plaza of Magdala, 
where TOWNSPEOPLE are salting fish in a public market. The 
streets are crowded with camels, donkeys, Mongols on 
horseback, Afghans laden with rugs and blankets, Nubian slaves 
following their Greek and Roman masters. A Berber woman 
dances. She is caked with dust. As she dances, the dust flies 
away, revealing her dress, her jewelry, her body.

Jesus passes a well where a woman is seated, drawing water. 
Her naked breasts are painted. He tries to avoid her glance.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	Thank you Lord for bringing me where 
	I did not want to come.

He pushes his way through the crowd until he reaches the 
home of Mary Magdalene. On her door, there is a painting of 
two intertwined snakes, one black, one white, and above the 
LINTEL, a painting of a large yellow lizard with its legs 
stretched out as if crucified. A row of camels, horses and 
donkeys stand outside. Jesus enters.

A young Indian nobleman with an aristocratic air, passes by 
Jesus and into the courtyard, Jesus stares and follows behind 
him.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	He must be one of God's angels. He 
	came down to show me the way.

						CUT TO:

EXT. MARY MAGDALENE'S COURTYARD - DAY

Jesus and the nobleman take their places seated on the ground 
in Magdalene's courtyard. About a dozen men wait for their 
turn with Magdalene.

Besides the young Indian nobleman (with three gold bands 
around his ankles), there are three Bedounin, three old men 
with painted eyelashes and nails, two young men with black 
beards and moustaches, and two rich black merchants. An old 
lady is off to one side crouched on the ground with a small 
cage containing some crabs. A small fire is beside her on 
which she is cooking food. There is no door to Magdalene's 
room where she does business, only a wispy half torn curtain 
floating in the infrequent breeze. This affords her waiting 
clients a half-darkened view of the proceedings. An Arab 
makes love to her. She is nude, and good at her work.

The young Indian nobleman lowers his eyelids, begins swaying 
his upper body back and forth and moves his lips as if in 
prayer. Jesus and the others glance at him. One of the black 
merchants pushes him with his knee and smiles.

		BLACK MERCHANT
	Prince of India, what does your God 
	have to say about all this?

		INDIAN NOBLEMAN
		(opening his eyes)
	All what?

		BLACK MERCHANT
	Here, in front of you.

		INDIAN NOBLEMAN
	That everything is a dream.

One of the old men, using prayer beads, turns to them.

		OLD MAN
	Well, if it's a dream, then don't 
	wake us.

Jesus stares straight ahead. At that moment the Arab comes 
out from Magdalene's room. All the men groan as if saying 
"about time." The old man gets up and enters.

		YOUNG MAN
	Don't take all day, old man. There's 
	six more here before me.

is waning. Three merchants wait with Jesus. Two are eating.

An Egyptian emerges from the Magdalene's house. Another man 
gets up. Jesus defers to him.

Jesus sits alone. The last customer closes the courtyard 
door.

Jesus stands, enters Magdalene's room.

						CUT TO:

INT. MAGDALENE'S ROOM - DARK - AMBERLIT - NIGHT

Mary, lies naked on a stack of blankets, covered with the 
sweat of all nations. Facing the wall, she calls:

		MAGDALENE
	Is there anyone else?

Jesus stops in the middle of the room.

Mary turns and recognizes Jesus. She instinctively pulls 
back.

		MAGDALENE
	What are you doing here.

		JESUS
	I want you to forgive me.

The Magdalene doesn't understand.

		JESUS
	I've done too many wrong things. I'm 
	going to the desert. To the monastery. 
	Before I go I want you to forgive 
	me. Please.

		MAGDALENE
	Oh, I see. You sit out there all day 
	with the others. Then you come in 
	there with your head bowed, saying 
	'Forgive me, forgive me.' Well it's 
	not that easy. Just because you need 
	forgiveness don't ask me to do it.

		JESUS
	Mary, I'm sorry.

		MAGDALENE
	I don't want your pity. I'm fine, 
	just fine. I don't need help from 
	anybody. Especially you or your God.

		JESUS
	God can save your soul.

		MAGDALENE
	I don't want him. He's already broken 
	my heart. Say the truth.

Mary is half in darkness. As she speaks her legs partially 
open and one hand slips between them. Her other hand covers 
her breasts.

		MAGDALENE
	You want to save my soul? This is 
	where you'll find it. You're the 
	same as the others only you can't 
	admit it. You lie about it. You're 
	pitiful. I hate you. Here's my body. 
	Kiss it. Save it.

Jesus, angry, lunges for her and hits her hand away very 
hard. She pulls back on the couch and they stare at each 
other. When Magdalene speaks again she is calmer, but even 
sadder.

		MAGDALENE
	Is that the way you show you're a 
	man? You never had the courage to be 
	one. If you weren't hanging onto 
	your mother, you were hanging onto 
	me. Now you're hanging onto God, 
	going to the desert to hide because 
	you're scared. Well go. Whenever I 
	see you my heart breaks. Don't look 
	at me.

She stands and puts on a dress.

						CUT TO:

LATER

Mary takes a casserole from the fire, pours it into a bowl 
and hands it to Jesus with a barley roll. Jesus eats 
ravenously.

		MAGDALENE
	Is that the way you eat? Without 
	thanking God? Don't you think you 
	should thank him for giving you all 
	this: bread, beans, whores, wine...

		JESUS
	Let me eat and let me go.

Mary looks at him and touches his face. As she speaks, Jesus 
doesn't respond.

		MAGDALENE
	I remember when we were children. 
	When I was five and you were three. 
	I remember when we laid under the 
	tree together. I watched you. Later 
	I wanted you to come to me but not 
	before you suffered...

Magdalene is coming on to him. He is her lifetime love. No 
matter what he does, she will never stop loving him.

		JESUS
	Stop it.

He stands and walks over to the fire.

		MAGDALENE
	I never felt so much tenderness toward 
	anyone as I felt for you then... all 
	I ever wanted was you... nothing 
	else.

		JESUS
	And what do you think I wanted? Do 
	you think I wanted this? God help 
	me.

		MAGDALENE
	To do what?

It takes him a moment to answer, but when he finally speaks 
it is with some tenderness.

		JESUS
	To leave.

		MAGDALENE
	Please... stay.
		(pause)
	Here, it's cold. Sleep by the fire.
		(she reaches for him)
	Is it so bad, sharing a prostitute's 
	room? You'll still have your virginity 
	for the desert. I promise.

		JESUS
	I can't stay, Mary. I'm sorry.

The monastery is actually an unconnected series of low mud 
huts. Jesus strides toward them. The wind blows.

huts.

Jesus joins him. The Master looks into his careworn face and 
smiles serenely, then leads him inside.

		JESUS
	I'll pray with you.

	I was brought here.

	By who?

		JESUS
	An old man.

		JEROBOAM
	There are a lot of old men here. 
	What was his name? Did he say 
	anything?

		JESUS
	He didn't say his name. He just said 
	'First came the wings and then the

Jeroboam is startled.

Another hut. A simple room with a menorah. The Master who 
showed Jesus to the room lies on an open shroud on the floor, 
hands folded over his chest. His naked body is partially 
obscured by by mourners. One MONK kisses his closed eyes. 
ANOTHER his upturned palms, OTHERS his beard and his feet. 
Jesus and Jeroboam watch.

		JESUS
	This was the man who let me in last 
	night. Did he just die?

		JEROBOAM
	This was the Master of the monastery. 
	He's been dead since yesterday 
	morning. And you've come in his place.

Carrying the Master's remains, the monks move through blowing 
sand. The dunes seem almost to sway like the rise and fall 
of the sea.

The procession, with Jesus at the end, stops at a pit. The 
monks, buffeted by the wind, roll the Master's remains into 
the pit.

Jeroboam shouts a prayer over the howling wind, but we cannot 
hear it.

JEROBOAM'S PRAYER:

		JEROBOAM
	The Master's soul has gone to heaven, 
	his body's work is completed. It 
	walked under the sun and moon, over 
	stone and sand, sinned, felt pain, 
	yearned for heaven. We commend his 
	remains to the earth and his soul to 
	our God. Flesh, the Master no longer 
	needs you. Melt away.

Even as he speaks, the wind leaves a fine layer of sand on 
the Master's body; the face, beard, and hands sink away.

						CUT TO:

EXT. MONASTERY - DAY

Later. The sandstorm is over, the air is still. Jesus and 
Jeroboam walk close together. They are in the midst of 
conversation.

		JEROBOAM
	In our period of mourning for the 
	Master we believe we'll feel his 
	presence here for forty days, advising 
	us, scolding us. It actually appeared 
	to you. And showed you the way to 
	his room. His own room. He treated 
	you like a royal visitor. He 
	recognized you.

		JESUS
	He couldn't have recognized me for 
	anything. I only came here to serve 
	God and nothing else. That's all he 
	wants from me, I'm sure of it.

		JEROBOAM
	God brought you here, didn't he?

		JESUS
	All he brought here is my shame.

		JEROBOAM
	Shame is also a temptation.

		JESUS
	God hunts me. He drives his nails 
	into my heart. He wants to push me 
	over.

Jesus' hand sweeps out. We follow. He is gesturing toward 
the steep precipice only a few yards away.

		JESUS
	He wants me to speak. But he didn't 
	touch my lips with burning coals. 
	How can I speak? I sinned.

		JEROBOAM
	We all sin.

		JESUS
	Not my sins. What does He want from 
	me? Can't he see what's inside me? 
	All my sins. I'm Lucifer.

		JEROBOAM
	Be quiet!

		JESUS
	No! I'm a liar. A hypocrite. I'm 
	afraid of everything. I never tell 
	the truth. I don't have the courage. 
	When I see a woman, I blush and look 
	away. But inside I have lust. For 
	God, I smother the lust, and that 
	satisfies my pride. But my pride 
	destroys Magdalene. I never steal or 
	fight, or kill... not because I don't 
	want to but because I'm afraid. I 
	want to rebel against everything, 
	everybody... against God!... but I'm 
	afraid. If you look inside me you 
	see fear, that's all. Fear is my 
	mother, my father, my God.

		JEROBOAM
	The more devils we have inside of 
	us, the more chance we have to make 
	angels. 'Angel' is the name for the 
	devils who repent... so, you have to 
	have faith. Have you ever slept with 
	a woman?

		JESUS
	No...

		JEROBOAM
	And you don't want to?

		JESUS
	I do... No, I don't.

		JEROBOAM
	Why not?

		JESUS
	It's not enough for me.

		JEROBOAM
	Well, then what do you want?
		(pause)
	...Why don't you answer me?

		JESUS
		(smiling)
	I am Saint Blasphemer, Father. So 
	you'd better not ask me anything 
	else, or I'll start my blasphemies.

		JEROBOAM
	Start your blasphemies. You'll be 
	relieved. Start.

		JESUS
	There's Lucifer inside of me saying, 
	You're not the son of the Carpenter, 
	you're the son of King David. You're 
	not a man, you're the son of man. 
	And further: the son of God. And 
	further than that: God.

Jeroboam is speechless.

		JESUS
	Do you want to ask me anything else?

		JEROBOAM
	No.

INT. JESUS' HUT - NIGHT

Jesus sleeps on a woven mat.

He hears a HISSING SOUND. His eyes open, he sits up.

A snake emerges from a hole in the wall and slithers across 
the earthen floor. Another snake follows it. The snakes coil 
around each other and copulate.

Jesus watches, his back to the wall.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	Why now after all this time? Coupling. 
	This is why we were thrown out of 
	Paradise.

He looks at one of the snakes. It speaks to him in Mary 
Magdalene's voice.

		MAGDALENE
	Jesus, I forgive you.

(fast dolly in as) Jesus grabs his chest; the snakes hiss 
inside his breast.

		JESUS
	Leave me. Leave me alone.

Jesus breathes a sigh of relief. The snakes are gone. Jesus 
looks up. Jeroboam stands in the door. Jeroboam enters and 
puts his fingers to Jesus' lips.

(follow hand around and to lips 36 fps)

		JESUS
	They're gone.

Jeroboam nods. He has seen the snakes too.

		JEROBOAM
	God has just blessed you. The snakes 
	left. They came from you. Everything 
	has two meanings, one obvious, the 
	other hidden. Now maybe you have to 
	leave.

		JESUS
	I have to stay. That's what God wants 
	me to do.

		JEROBOAM
	I don't think you're supposed to 
	stay. God is already talking to you. 
	He must want something else.

		JESUS
	What else could he want from me?

		JEROBOAM
	He's purified you for a reason. To 
	be his instrument. He must want to 
	speak through you. Outside.

		JESUS
	To who?

		JEROBOAM
	To anyone who will listen.

		JESUS
	And say what?

		JEROBOAM
	Just open your mouth. You love 
	mankind?

		JESUS
	I see men and I feel sorry for them, 
	that's all.

Judas stands in front of him, panting, his dagger in his

	I'm ready.

	Ready? You think we're going to a

		JESUS
	Good. I'm relieved. I'm happy to see 
	you. You're just in time.

Judas is startled.

		JESUS
	God purified me tonight. I thought 
	it was so I could go out and preach. 
	But now I see. It's so I could die. 
	And you're God's instrument. He 
	brought us together.

Jesus opens his tunic.

		JESUS
	Here's my neck. Cut it. Come on, cut 
	it. What's the matter? Is there 
	anything wrong? I was purified, you 
	got your permission, it's all arranged 
	by God. So what are you waiting for?

They stare at each other.

		JESUS
	You can't do it, can you?

		JUDAS
	I can if I want.

		JESUS
	Why don't you want?

		JUDAS
	I do want.

		JESUS
	Fine.

He positions himself for killing again. There is another 
pause.

		JUDAS
	Did you work some magic on me? When 
	I go to kill a man, I kill him.

		JESUS
		(thinking it out)
	Maybe God doesn't want me to die. If 
	God really wanted me to die, you 
	wouldn't hesitate. You'd just kill 
	me.

		JUDAS
	No, you should die. What good are 
	you living? Why should God want you 
	alive? What good are you for Israel? 
	Do you have some secret?

		JESUS
	I have no secret. I know that I have 
	pity, though.

		JUDAS
	Pity! How far will that get us? What 
	good is that for Israel?

		JESUS
	It's good for men.

		JUDAS
	Men! The Greeks who killed us were 
	men. So are the Romans. Don't pity 
	men, pity Israel. The rest can go to 
	hell.

		JESUS
	I feel pity for everything. Donkeys, 
	sparrows, grass.

		JUDAS
	And ants? I suppose you feel pity 
	for them too?

		JESUS
	Yes. Everything's a part of God. 
	When I look into the ant, into his 
	shiny black eye, I see the face of 
	God.

		JUDAS
	What do you see when you look in my 
	face?

		JESUS
		(matter of factly)
	I see God too.

		JUDAS
	You see God everywhere, don't you? 
	Maybe that's why you don't fear death.

		JESUS
	Why should I fear death? Death isn't 
	a door that closes, it's a door that 
	opens. It opens and you enter.

		JUDAS
		(pause)
	If I don't kill you, what happens?

		JESUS
	I don't know. Whatever God decides. 
	I'll speak to others. I can't think 
	of anything else.

		JUDAS
	What are you going to say?

		JESUS
	I'll just open my mouth and God will 
	do the talking.

		JUDAS
	See. I told you. You're not crazy at 
	all, are you? If God does talk through 
	you, then you're the messenger of 
	God and I can't kill a messenger of 
	God, can I? You've got my hand 
	stopped.

		JESUS
	I didn't stop your hand, God did.

		JUDAS
	He's the only one who could.

		JESUS
	God didn't send you to kill me. Maybe 
	he sent you here to follow me.

		JUDAS
	The one's I follow are the ones who 
	follow Israel.

Judas puts his knife away.

						CUT TO:

EXT. GALILEE - DAY

Judas and Jesus walk across the plain toward Magdala.

						CUT TO:

EXT. MAGDALA - DAY

Mary Magdalene is hurled into a shallow pit, her knees and 
elbows bloody from being dragged down the street.

Jesus and Judas enter the village. They hear a commotion and 
hurry toward the crowd.

The crowd, in a festive mood, hurl insults and spit at her.

		JUDAS
	It's Magdalene. She deserves it.

Jesus steps into the center of the pit as the crowd starts 
to throw stones. One of them hits Jesus on the chest. He 
looks over at the man who threw the stone. We have never 
seen Jesus like this before: neither has anyone in the crowd.

Two little KIDS take one look, giggle nervously, and run 
away. Judas is riveted. On the other side of the small crowd, 
PHILIP, PETER, ANDREW and JOHN watch this unexpected 
confrontation with fascination.

		MAN IN CROWD
	Get out of here. This isn't your 
	business. You want to get hurt?

More stones are thrown. Jesus doesn't move. Magdalene, has 
grabbed his leg for reassurance.

ZEBADEE pushes his way through the crowd.

		ZEBEDEE
	You heard what he said, idiot. Move.

		JESUS
	No. I don't want this.

		ZEBEDEE
	Oh, listen to this. He doesn't want 
	this. Well, we want it.

		JESUS
	Why?

		ZEBEDEE
		(livid)
	We don't have to tell you why...

Peter, in the crowd, interrupts angrily.

		PETER
	Bad enough we live in a whorehouse. 
	But does it have to be a Roman 
	whorehouse? Our women can't even 
	look in a mirror on the Sabbath, and 
	this one goes with Romans on the 
	Sabbath. She broke Moses' law. So 
	she dies.

Jesus picks up two stones from the ground.

		JESUS
	Who's never sinned? Which one of you 
	has never sinned? Whichever one of 
	you's never sinned should come up 
	here and throw these.

Zebedee steps forward immediately, carrying his own small 
stone.

		ZEBEDEE
	I've got nothing to hide.

		JESUS
	Good. Take one of these. They're 
	bigger. You're not going to do much 
	damage with the small one.

Zebedee hesitates.

		JESUS
	Be careful, Zebedee. There is a God. 
	He's seen you cheat your workers. 
	He's seen you with that widow, what's 
	her name...

		WOMAN IN THE CROWD
	Judith!

		JESUS
	...Judith. Aren't you afraid God 
	will paralyze you if your lift that 
	stone? That your hand will wither 
	and hang at your side?

Zebedee drops the rock and moves back. Several MEN start 
toward Jesus, but Judas steps between them, braced for action. 
They stop.

Jesus helps Mary to her feet. Judas calls to the crowd:

		JUDAS
	Follow us, follow the Rabbi. He wants 
	to talk to you.

Judas, Jesus and Magdalene walk away from the pit. A large 
segment of the crowd follows.

		WOMAN IN CROWD
	Who is he?

		MAN
	It's Jesus. From Nazareth.

		SECOND MAN
	Nothing good can come out of Nazareth. 
	Even the scriptures say it.

They start back, away from the crowd, toward the town.

						CUT TO:

EXT. HILLSIDE IN MAGDALA - DAY

The nearby summit of the hill which was the site of some 
ancient pagan temple, probably Mesopotamian. Fragments of 
several carved capitals of columns lay on the ground along 
with pieces of pagan Gods (winged lions with women's heads, 
etc.).

Magdalene sits near Jesus' feet; Judas stands in the 
background. The crowd waits to hear what Jesus has to say. 
Jesus looks out over the poverty-stricken villagers, the 
peaceful country-side:

		JESUS (V.O.)
	This is what I've always been afraid 
	of. There's so much to say. God has 
	so many miracles.

A pause. The words start to come.

		JESUS
	Come closer everybody. My brothers. 
	My sisters. I'm calling you that 
	because we're all a family. A little 
	closer. My voice isn't very strong, 
	and I've got something to tell you.

The crowd gets closer, still more curious than anything else.

		JESUS
	I'm sorry if I have to tell you 
	stories. But is seems to be the only 
	way I can tell you what I have to.
		(pause)
	A farmer was planting in his field. 
	Some seed fell on the ground and the 
	birds ate it. Some seed fell on rocks 
	and dried up. But some seed fell on 
	rich soil, grew into wheat and fed a 
	lot of people.

Long silence. No one has any idea what the hell he's talking 
about.

		JESUS
	Didn't you hear me? Are you people 
	deaf?

		ZEBEDEE
		(indignant)
	We can hear fine. It's not us. Can't 
	you be more... clear.

Jesus thinks for a moment. He is also hiding annoyance.

		JESUS
	I'm the farmer. The farmer's me.

		ZEBEDEE
	Wait a minute. I get it. Don't tell 
	me. We must be the stones. We're the 
	ground, is that it? That's just fine. 
	And two and two makes four.
		(to crowd:)
	Another lunatic.

JOHN, Zebedee's youngest son, who has an air of perpetual 
abstraction, leaves his father and approaches Jesus.

		JOHN
	Rabbi, tell me. If you're the farmer 
	and we're the stones, what is the 
	seed?

Jesus is baffled.

		JOHN
	What's the seed?

		JESUS
		(surprised)
	Love one another. Love one another!

This is too much for the crowd to take.

		ANDREW
	Alright, let's say we accept that. 
	Maybe that's even good advice. But 
	for some other world. Not here. we're 
	starving. Feed us first, then talk.

While the crowd makes noise, Judas steps near to Jesus and 
talks to him so the others can't hear.

		JUDAS
	What are you talking about, love? 
	This is your message? We should all 
	love the Romans? That's like putting 
	our neck on the knife.

Jesus takes a step forward, going with the momentum of his 
strong feelings.

		JESUS
	Listen, I used to think God was angry 
	too. But not any more. He used to 
	jump on me like a wild bird and dig 
	his claws into my head. But then one 
	morning he came to me. He blew over 
	me like a cool breeze and said 'Stand 
	up.' And here I am.

		ZEBEDEE
	Go to hell!

		MAN IN CROWD
	These are all stories for children. 
	They can't help us.

Jesus starts into the crowd, confronting them directly.

		JESUS
	What are you hungry for? And you, 
	you're thirsty. What are you thirsty 
	for? For justice. Justice.

		ANDREW
	And bread.

		JESUS
	Bread too, bread too. I'm telling 
	you, whoever's hungry for justice, 
	whoever's thirsty for justice... 
	they're the one's who'll be blessed. 
	They'll be filled with bread. They'll 
	never be thirsty again.

Jesus works his way through the crowd, really winning them 
over. He points at somebody else.

		JESUS
	And you. You're in mourning. But 
	mourners will be blessed. You'll 
	have God's comfort, you won't need 
	it from men.

Now he addresses the crowd at large.

		JESUS
	And the meek... they're the ones 
	who'll be blessed. And the 
	suffering... they'll be blessed too. 
	and the merciful, and the peacemakers. 
	And the poor, and the sick, and the 
	outcasts... you will all be blessed. 
	Because Heaven is yours.

Now the crowd is really with him.

		JESUS
	But believe me. The ones who are 
	laughing now...

He indicates a couple of skeptics in the crowd.

		JESUS
	...will be crying later. The ones 
	who are fed now will be hungry soon. 
	And the rich... will be poor forever.

The crowd, agitated and excited, starts to run off.

		FIRST VOICE
	Let's kill the rich!

		SECOND VOICE
	Why bother with the rich? Kill the 
	Romans.

		JESUS
		(protests)
	I didn't say death. I said love! I 
	said love!

		ZEBEDEE
		(motions to his son)
	Let's go.

		JOHN
	No. Go on without me.

JAMES looks as if he wants to stay too, but Zebedee pulls 
him by the arm and stalks off. John and Andrew stay behind 
with Peter, Philip and Judas.

Mary Magdalene stands next to Jesus now.

		MAGDALENE
	Rabbi. I can help. Let me go with 
	you.

		JESUS
		(interrupts)
	No. Stay here. Tell people about me. 
	Show them how to live.

He kneels and wipes her bloody feet with his tunic.

						CUT TO:

EXT. SEA OF GENNASARET - DAY

Another day. Jesus leads his little band along the seashore: 
Peter, John, and Andrew walk with Jesus; Judas and Philip 
follow. Two peasant women, a street urchin and a couple of 
dogs bring up the rear. They approach Zebedee, who works 
with James, Nathaniel and two other fishermen.

		ZEBEDEE
		(to John)
	Where have you been? We've been 
	working all morning.

John steps over to his brother James and starts pulling him 
away.

		JOHN
	What are you doing this for, after 
	what we heard. Come with us.

Zebedee grabs James' other arm.

		ZEBEDEE
	What do you think you're doing?

He swats both John and James on the ear. The other disciples 
laugh.

		JUDAS
		(laughing)
	Watch it, Zebedee, you'll lose another 
	son.

		JESUS
	Zebedee, do you really need them? 
	You can hire other men. They won't 
	be your sons, so you'll have to pay 
	them...

		ZEBEDEE
	Pay them! I can't afford to pay them. 
	I can't afford to pay anybody. Look, 
	my nets have been empty for weeks.

		JESUS
	Look at them now.

The nets are teeming with fish.

		ZEBEDEE
	How'd you do that?

		JESUS
	Maybe the current changed.
		(pause)
	Zebedee, let your sons come with me. 
	They can fish for men.

						CUT TO:

EXT. SEA OF GENNASARET - AFTERNOON

Later the same day. Jesus and the disciples, now with James 
among them, walk past a stand of tall reeds.

						CUT TO:

EXT. GALILEE - NIGHT

The disciples sleep in an olive grove. Jesus, awake, sits on 
a nearby knoll, looking into the night.

Judas walks over and sits next to him:

		JUDAS
	Rabbi, can I talk to you?

He sits next to him.

		JUDAS
	I'm not like these other men. I mean, 
	they're good enough. But they're 
	weak. How are they going to fight 
	for you? They couldn't even fight 
	for themselves. Where'd you find 
	them? One's worse than the other. 
	This is no army.

		JESUS
	I don't need soldiers.

		JUDAS
	You wanted me. And if I love somebody, 
	I'd die for them. If I hate somebody, 
	I'll kill them. I can even kill 
	somebody I love if he does the wrong 
	thing. Do you understand?

		JESUS
	I understand.

		JUDAS
	The other day when you said turn the 
	other cheek to the man that hit you, 
	I didn't like that. Only an angel 
	could do that, only an angel or a 
	dog. I'm a free man. I don't turn my 
	cheek to anyone. You do need soldiers.

		JESUS
	Will soldiers make me free?

		JUDAS
	You want freedom for Israel?

		JESUS
	I want freedom for the soul.

		JUDAS
	First you free the body, then the 
	soul. You know that. The Romans come 
	first.

		JESUS
	The soul is first. If you don't change 
	what the soul needs, you'll only 
	replace Roman domination with another 
	domination and nothing'll ever change. 
	First you have to change man inside. 
	Then man can change what's around 
	him. It's wanting wealth and power 
	that makes the soul want to dominate 
	others. That's the wanting we have 
	to change, we have to free the soul 
	first. With love.

		JUDAS
	We all want that eventually. But 
	right now the only way is to start 
	from the bottom. You build a house 
	from the foundation up...
		(he turns)
	Who's there?

Andrew, sleepy-eyed, walks over, concerned:

		ANDREW
	It's me, Andrew. Is everything...

		JESUS
		(interrupting)
	Go back to sleep. Judas and I are 
	talking.

Andrew turns and leaves. Judas waits, then speaks.

		JUDAS
	I still don't know who you are.

		JESUS
	Neither do I.

		JUDAS
	You can't look to the others for 
	answers. All they can do is follow 
	you. It's between you and me. When I 
	went to kill you in the monastery, 
	God took my strength away. That's 
	what made me think, even if I didn't 
	want to... that's what made me think 
	you might be the one. The Messiah. 
	Maybe you are, maybe you aren't, 
	maybe you don't even know yourself 
	if you are. That's why I said to 
	myself, be patient for once in your 
	life. See what he does, see what he 
	says, and if he's not the Messiah 
	there's plenty of time to kill him.

		JESUS
	How can I be the Messiah? First of 
	all I wanted to kill those people 
	when I saw them torturing Magdalene. 
	Then when I opened my mouth, out 
	came the word 'love.' Why? How can 
	we tell?

		JUDAS
	Alright. You say God talks through 
	you and right now I believe you. 
	There's another one he talks through.

		JESUS
	The Baptist.

		JUDAS
	We'll go to see him. He stands out 
	there every day preaching 'He is 
	coming, he is coming.' As soon as he 
	sees you he'll know who you are. 
	He'll know if you're the one.

		JESUS
	I'm afraid, Judas. Stay here.

Judas spreads his blanket on the ground.

						CUT TO:

EXT. GALILEE - NIGHT

Later that night. Judas and Jesus are asleep in each other's 
arms. Then Jesus appears to wake. On the ground in front of 
him is an apple. He reaches for it, takes a bite, extracts 
some seeds and the core. He scatters them on the ground. He 
watches where they fall.

And now we see: a tree has grown, ripe red apples hanging 
from its every branch.

						CUT TO:

EXT. RIVER OF JORDAN - DAY

Jesus and his followers reach the edge of the Dead Sea. 
Andrew, a disciple of the Baptist, points ahead.

		ANDREW
	Up ahead. The water forms a pool in 
	the caves. I'll show you.

		JESUS
	You're tired. Stay here.

		ANDREW
	No, I'd better come. It could be 
	dangerous.

		JESUS
	NO. I want to go alone.

Jesus walks through the burning heat toward the caves. Judas, 
following behind, runs to catch up.

		JUDAS
	What about me! I'm supposed to be 
	with you.

		JESUS
	Come on.

They walk down a slope. Jesus in front. Judas behind. John 
the Baptist's voice echoes in the distance.

Offscreen Voice:

		THE BAPTIST (O.S.)
	'Behold, I will raise up evil against 
	you out of your own house, and I 
	will take your wives before your 
	eyes, and give them to your neighbor, 
	and he shall lie with your wives in 
	the sight of this sun.'

(2 SAMUEL XII, 11)

They push their way through a mixture of lower class 
Israelites, Ethiopians (painted nails, eyelashes, etc.), 
Chaldeans (brass rings in their noses, etc.) Some who have 
been or are about to be Baptized are naked.

						CUT TO:

EXT./INT. BAPTIST'S CAVE - DAY

Jesus and Judas approach. They enter a small cave like an 
antechamber in which the light has a slight greenish tint.

In the larger cave, the BAPTIST is preaching. Jesus gasps 
when he first sees him: a wild man, unkempt, unwashed, (hair 
like a Rastafarian). He shouts in the wind:

		THE BAPTIST
	"Roll on the ground, bite the dust, 
	howl! The Lord of Hosts says: 'On 
	this day I will command the sun to 
	set at noon; I will crush the horns 
	of the new moon and spill darkness 
	over the earth. I will reverse your 
	laughter, turn it into tears, and 
	your songs I will turn into 
	lamentations. I will blow and all 
	your finery -- hands, feet, noses, 
	ears, hairs -- will fall to the 
	ground.'"

He's awesome. Even Judas is taken back. He grabs Jesus:

		JUDAS
	God. He sounds like the Messiah.

		JESUS
	No, the Messiah won't have an ax in 
	his hand.

Judas pushes Jesus forward.

		JUDAS
	We'll see. Go in front. Let him see 
	you.

Jesus walks slowly toward the Baptist, his eyes fixed on the 
prophet. The crowd flails and shouts; one half-naked woman 
slashes herself with sharp stones (throws herself on the 
ground, etc.).

		JESUS (V.O.)
	Even from behind, I knew I had seen 
	him before. Where? When? Was it a 
	dream? Yes, it was. But in the dream 
	he was all dressed in white.

Jesus steps behind the Baptist. John suddenly turns at him.

		THE BAPTIST
	Who are you?

		JESUS
		(his voice anxious)
	Do you recognize me?

		THE BAPTIST
	Who are you?

		JESUS
	Have you read Isaiah? Do you know 
	the prophets? What does Isaiah say?

		THE BAPTIST
	He says, "Prepare the way of the 
	Lord." Are you telling me that's 
	you?

		JESUS
	I don't know.
		(demanding)
	Tell me.

The Baptist looks around: the crowd wails in SILENT MOTION. 
A sudden calmness. We see them from Judas' P.O.V. Judas 
strains to hear but can't. The Baptist knows Jesus.

		THE BAPTIST
	Why are you here?

		JESUS
	To be baptized.

		THE BAPTIST
	I don't dare. If you are the Master, 
	you should baptize me.

		JESUS
	Baptize me.

Jesus kneels at John's feet, throws off his robe (his 
nakedness partially hidden by people in the foreground). 
Judas looks on.

						CUT TO:

EXT. RIVER OF JORDAN - NIGHT

Jesus and the Baptist sit in the cave by a fire built near 
the baptismal pool. An eerie blue-green light falls on the 
walls of the cave; their faces are reflected in the pool 
water. A group of pilgrims camp in the back of the cave. 
Music is heard.

Jesus and the Baptist are weary from hours of debate.

		JESUS
	Isn't love enough?

		THE BAPTIST
	No. The tree is rotten. You have to 
	take the ax and cut it down.

		JESUS
	If I was a woodcutter, I'd cut. If I 
	was fire, I'd burn. But I'm a heart 
	and I love.

		THE BAPTIST
	I'm a heart also but I can't love 
	what's unjust. I can't love evil. 
	What I can't love I attack. God 
	demands it. God demands anger.

		JESUS
	Anger? Aren't we all brothers?

		THE BAPTIST
	You think love is God's only way? Go 
	to the Dead Sea. Look in the bottom, 
	you'll see the two whores, Sodom and 
	Gomorrah. God was angry. He threw 
	fire at them, turned over the dry 
	land and the sea swallowed them up. 
	That's God's way. 'On the day of the 
	Lord, blood will flow from wood, the 
	stones of the houses will come alive 
	and kill their owners!' That day is 
	here. He gave me the ax, now I give 
	it to you.

Jesus, frightened, turns away:

		JESUS
	That's not the answer.

		THE BAPTIST
		(aggravated)
	No? Then what is the answer?

		JESUS
	I don't know. I think it's love.

		THE BAPTIST
	Well I know. And if you won't listen 
	to me who will you listen to? To 
	God? The God of Israel's a god of 
	the desert. If you want to speak to 
	him, then you go to the desert.

		JESUS
		(a beat)
	I'll go to Idumaea.

		THE BAPTIST
	But be careful. The desert's full of 
	sweet voices and death.

The Baptist walks over to Jesus.

		JESUS
	Thank you Baptist.

John kisses Jesus on the mouth.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	His tongue felt like a burning coal 
	in my mouth.

Judas watches from a hole in the ceiling of the cave. From 
his P.O.V. he can't hear anything.

Jesus walks away, not looking back.

						CUT TO:

EXT. IDUMAEA DESERT - SUNSET

Jesus runs across the desert as if pursued. He stops, pants, 
continues. The earth underneath is cracked. The whole 
landscape shimmers with heat under a huge white sun. (SPECIAL 
EFFECT). The image is tinted warm red.

						CUT TO:

EXT. DESERT - NEXT DAY

Jesus wanders through the wild, uninhabited terrain. The 
sun, like a blast furnace, blows sand into his face.

He starts to draw a large circle.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	I'm not going to leave this circle. 
	I won't leave until you talk to me. 
	No hums. No thunder. No headaches. 
	Just talk to me in human words. 
	Whatever path you want, I'll take. 
	Love or the ax or anything else. Or 
	if you want me to stay here and die 
	I'll do that too. But you have to 
	tell me.

He sits in the center of the circle.

He sees: the sun, looming huge in the sky, seeming to be 
unnaturally close to him. (SPECIAL EFFECT).

He sees: in the far distance, birds flying across a great 
plain.

He sees: on the flat desert, the plain of Sodom, a herd of 
gazelles.

He continues to watch as we...

										FADE OUT:

EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

FADE IN. Days have past. The hunger and deprivation are 
beginning to show on Jesus' face. His clothes are the color 
of soil.

		JESUS
	I don't want... I don't want to be 
	alone.

He puts his head down, but hears sounds and looks into the 
moonlit night. SOUNDS: of water; bracelets; laughing. Then a 
large SERPENT coils at the edge of the circle, speaking in a 
half-human, half-animal voice.

		SERPENT
	I felt sorry for you. You were lonely. 
	You cried, so I came.

		JESUS
	I didn't call you. Who are you?

		SERPENT
	Your soul.

		JESUS
	My soul.

		SERPENT
	You're afraid of being alone. Just 
	like Adam. He called me and I reached 
	into his ribs and gave him a wife.

		JESUS
	You're here to trick me.

		SERPENT
	Trick you? To love and care for a 
	woman? To have a family -- this is a 
	trick? Why are you trying to save 
	the world? Aren't your own sins enough 
	for you? What arrogance to think 
	it's your duty to save the world. 
	The world doesn't have to be saved. 
	Find love.

		JESUS
	I have love.

		SERPENT
	Look into my eyes, look at my 
	breasts...

The Serpent's voice dissolves into the soft, comforting voice 
of Mary Magdalene.

		SERPENT
	...Do you recognize them? Say the 
	word. Nod your head and we'll be in 
	my bed together.

Jesus looks up, eyes glaring.

		SERPENT
		(compassionately)
	Oh, Jesus.

The Serpent suddenly explodes, leaving no trace. Jesus places 
his head between his legs and begins to sob, as if he has 
lost a loved one.

						CUT TO:

EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

FADE IN. Another week has passed. Jesus' clothes are torn 
and tattered by the desert winds. He awakens.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	After ten days the hunger went away.

He hears a sound. A LION stands at the edge of the circle.

		LION
	Welcome, Jesus. Congratulations. 
	You've overcome the small temptations 
	of a woman, a family. We're both 
	bigger than that. A woman's not 
	enough, we need the whole world.

		JESUS
	Who are you?

		LION
	I'm you. I'm your heart. Your heart 
	is so hungry. It pretends to be humble 
	but it secretly wants to conquer the 
	world. I will set my four feet down, 
	one in Babylon, one in Jerusalem, 
	one in Alexandria, the last in Rome.

		JESUS
	I've never wanted a kingdom on earth. 
	The Kingdom of Heaven's good enough 
	for me.

The Lion's voice transforms into Judas':

		LION
	You're a liar. You've always wanted 
	power. When you were making crosses 
	for the Romans in Nazareth, your 
	head was exploding with dreams of 
	power. You said it was God, but you 
	really wanted to rule others. Now 
	you will. Any country you want. All 
	countries. You will rule Babylon. 
	You will rule Jerusalem. You will 
	rule Alexandria. You will even rule 
	Rome.

Jesus, shaking, reaches out toward the Lion.

		JESUS
	Liar! Step into my circle so I can 
	pull out your tongue.

The Lion steps into the circle, and, as he does, disappears.

										FADE OUT:

EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

FADE IN. Jesus lies sleeping. Another week has past. He's a 
wasted skeleton.

An ARCHANGEL stands at the circle's edge. The Angel appears 
as a normal ten-year-old boy speaking in the voice of a young 
girl. Jesus strains to see through his swollen eyelids:

		JESUS
	Archangel... go farther back. You're 
	blinding me.

		ARCHANGEL
	I'm the one you've been waiting for. 
	Remember when you were a child, you 
	cried, 'Make me a God. God, make me 
	a God.'

		JESUS
	But I was just a child then.

		ARCHANGEL
	Adonai. You are God. The Baptist 
	knew it. It's time you admit it. I 
	salute you, Son, only Son of God. 
	Join me in power. We will rule 
	together over the living and the 
	dead. You'll give life and take life. 
	You'll sit on the throne and I'll 
	sit at your hand. Imagine how strong 
	we could be together.

Jesus suddenly realizes who he's talking to:

		JESUS
	Satan!

The ripe tree from Jesus' dream appears behind the Archangel. 
The Angel offers an apple.

Jesus bites into the apple: it turns into blood in his mouth. 
The blood splashes down his chest.

		ANGEL
		(smiling)
	We'll see each other again.

The Archangel turns and leaves. Jesus picks up a stick at 
his feet. The stick is an ax.

We see from over Jesus' shoulder. John the Baptist crouches 
down into the frame, puts his hand on Jesus' shoulder and 
speaks:

		THE BAPTIST
	Don't be afraid. You are the One. I 
	was the one who came before you. My 
	work is finished. Now I can die. The 
	Lord wants me to tell you to stand 
	up, his day is here. Take the ax. 
	Run and carry the message to men.

Jesus rises and strikes at the root of the tree with an ax. 
Entire scene turns red.

INT. MARY AND MARTHA'S - DAY

MARY and MARTHA, sisters in their early thirties, are working 
in their house. Mary sits at a weaving loom; Martha near the 
fire.

The door opens. An emaciated figure in tattered clothes stands 
silhouetted in the doorway. The sisters turn, aghast.

		JESUS
	I'm a foreigner. From Galilee. I 
	need rest. The door was open. Excuse 
	me... I...

		MARY
	We're alone. Our brother Lazarus is 
	out.

		MARTHA
	What difference does that make? Come 
	in. Don't listen to her. She's afraid 
	of her own shadow. I'm Martha and 
	this is my sister, Mary. There's not 
	much here, but you're welcome to it. 
	Who are you?

		JESUS
	Jesus of Nazareth.

		MARTHA
		(laughing, teasing)
	A good man?

		JESUS
	Yes, good.

Jesus staggers over to the hearth.

		JESUS
		(smiles as he sits)
	...I do my best.

						CUT TO:

INT. MARY AND MARTHA'S - NIGHT

Jesus, washed and wearing a new tunic, eats bread and olives. 
Martha hands him a wine flask. Sitting by the fire, they 
almost look like a family. Jesus raises his pot of wine in a 
toast.

		JESUS
	Martha. Mary. I swear to you if 
	there's another flood and if it's up 
	to me to invite you into the ark, 
	I'd do it. You'd both be on it. 
	Because tonight a stranger came to 
	your door. You fed him, dressed him, 
	made him comfortable, spoke kindly 
	to him, and the Kingdom of Heaven 
	came down and went in his heart.

They drink. Mary and Martha look at Jesus flirtatiously.

		MARY
	Go on.

		JESUS
		(eating)
	What should I say? Silence is good, 
	It says everything.

		MARY
	It doesn't say everything to me. A 
	kind word now and then helps.

		MARTHA
	Do you have a wife?

		JESUS
		(thinks)
	No.

		MARY
	If you only knew what goes through a 
	woman's mind when she weaves. You'd 
	pity her, Jesus.

		JESUS
	I do know. I was once a woman, in 
	another life, and I used to weave.

		MARY
	And what did you think about?

		JESUS
	God. And you?

		MARTHA
	God. But we think about men more.

		MARY
	God is a man after all. And men can 
	be husbands.

Jesus smiles, but deliberately chooses not to pursue this 
subject. There is a brief silence.

		JESUS
	You know the Baptist? He died, didn't 
	he?

		MARY
	He was killed... by Herod. You didn't 
	know?

		JESUS
	No... I knew.

		MARTHA
	They say the King was drunk and cut 
	off his head to satisfy a little 
	girl... It happened in his palace in 
	Jerusalem.

		MARY
	No, at his palace in Tiberias.

		JESUS
		(not listening)
	Jerusalem.

		MARTHA
	Is that where you're going, to 
	Jerusalem?

		MARY
	I envy you.

		JESUS
	Not now. Eventually.

						CUT TO:

INT. ROMAN CAVES - NIGHT

The disciples sit around a pool of water and two small fires. 
Other fires and groups of people are scattered around and 
behind them throughout the cave. One group plays music. The 
cave walls are washed in blue-green light; a brilliant streak 
of violent red cuts across the rock of the back wall.

		JAMES
	Now they say they're going to kill 
	everyone who was baptized.

		PHILIP
	Nobody told you to get baptized.

		PETER
	You were baptized too. You begged 
	for it. So be quiet.

		JAMES
	I can just imagine Galilee right 
	now. The sea... I hear the fishing 
	is so good that you just touch the 
	nets and the fish jump in.

		NATHANIEL
	Don't talk about fish. It reminds me 
	of my sheep. I don't know what's 
	happened to them.

		PETER
	Maybe we should wait for him in 
	Galilee.

		JAMES
	We promised the Master we'd wait 
	here for him.

		NATHANIEL
	That was a month ago. He talks to 
	the Baptist, then disappears.

		JOHN
	Brothers. I don't understand you. 
	Think of the last words the Baptist 
	said. He said 'Jesus of Nazareth, 
	leave the desert. I am finished. 
	Return to mankind!'

		PHILIP
	How do you know the Baptist really 
	said that?

		JOHN
		(insisting)
	Everybody says he did. But even if 
	he didn't say it, those words are 
	important because people believe 
	them. I don't want to blaspheme, but 
	what if our Master... what if he's 
	the one?

		JAMES
	What one?

		JOHN
	The one.

There is silence.

		PHILIP
	But we don't know if the Baptist 
	really said that. I mean, what if...

They argue.

		JUDAS
		(interrupting)
	We're waiting here!

		PETER
	I don't know now.
		(pause)
	I don't think we should go to Galilee. 
	We should wait here, maybe.

		JUDAS
		(to Peter, sarcastic)
	Changed your mind when you heard 
	what John said, uh? 'The one?' That's 
	what I like about you Peter, nobody 
	can change your mind. Not you. What 
	good are you?!

The apostles in front of Judas suddenly look past him. Judas 
turns and stands up.

John sinks to his knees.

		JOHN
	Master.

Reverse angle shows Jesus standing before them.

		PETER
	Rabbi. John heard your foot-steps in 
	his heart... in a way... and we were 
	just preparing to welcome you.

		JESUS
	Were you baptized?

		PETER
	Yes.

		JESUS
	John baptized with water and they 
	killed him. Now I'll baptize with 
	fire.

		JUDAS
	Is that what the Baptist told you?

		JESUS
	I have an invitation for you.

Momentary silence.

		PETER
	Is there a celebration?

		JESUS
	No, I'm not inviting you to a 
	celebration. I'm inviting you to a 
	war.

Jesus is standing at the edge of the pool. He reaches into 
his chest and rips out his own heart. He offers it at arm's 
length to the disciples. Blood drips from the ventricles.

		JESUS
	This is my heart. Take it. I lead 
	the way to the Kingdom of God. The 
	Kingdom of God's inside us. It's the 
	Devil's kingdom that's outside, all 
	around us. We'll turn an ax against 
	the Devil's kingdom, against the 
	world. If you have sheep, give them 
	away. If you have nets, let them 
	rot. If you have a family, children, 
	leave them behind.

CAMERA tilts down following drops of heart blood which are 
dripping into the pool. The water begins to glow red.

Jesus now stands before them no longer holding his heart, 
but the ax the Baptist gave him in the desert.

		JESUS
	I once believed in love, now I carry 
	this. Who's with me?

Judas falls to his knees in the water and kisses Jesus' feet.

		JUDAS
	Adonai!

						CUT TO:

EXT. SAMARIA - DAY

Jesus and his followers (they have grown in number) walk 
through the Samarian lowlands.

The group advances with determination and purpose. Judas 
walks at Jesus' right; Peter at his left. Women and children 
follow them.

They come upon pits dug into the ground. The soil is colored 
a strong green. Suddenly, bare arms come up out of some of 
the pits. Heads pop up from others. Then, seven deranged men 
and women, their naked bodies colored green from the soil, 
crawl out of the pits and run toward Jesus. They flail at 
him, some fall at his feet. Some beg in jibberish.

Judas and Peter try to ward them off. Jesus is angry -- not 
at the men, but at the evil spirits that possess them.

He slaps one man, kicks another: he grabs one by the head 
and pushes on him causing him to fall:

		JESUS
	Satan! Leave them! Get out!

Judas and Peter hold Jesus as he touches each of the insane 
people. They are in the thick of what looks like a brawl. At 
one point, Jesus almost faints but is carried forward by the 
two apostles. Jesus shouts as he touches the possessed. After 
they have been confronted by Jesus, they grow suddenly calm. 
Some are confused, some praise Jesus. Jesus is held by the 
apostles, partially for protection and partially for strength.

						CUT TO:

EXT. ANOTHER SAMARIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

A BLINDMAN, led by his BROTHER and SISTER, approach Jesus 
and the disciples. His reputation has spread through the 
countryside.

Jesus stops. He takes ground herbal powder from his sleeve 
and mixes it with sand. He spits into the mixture, then 
applies it to the Blind Man's eyes.

		JESUS
	Moses, Elijah, Isaiah -- touch my 
	mouth, touch my lips.

Jesus kisses the man's mud-caked eyes. The clay falls from 
the Blind Man's eyes. His gruesomely deformed eyes are now 
normal: he can see.

		JESUS
	Go to the temple. Let the high priests 
	see you.

						CUT TO:

EXT CANA - DAY

On a small hillside. A group of children, at the right of 
the frame, sees Jesus and the disciples approaching to the

Jesus' arrival. A couple wave at him as they go.

						CUT TO:

EXT. CANA - NIGHT

Six virgins, carrying lit lamps, sing a psalm at the wedding 
of Nathaniel's cousin. It's a festive, happy occasion.

Jesus exchanges small talk with a group waiting for the 
ceremony to begin. Everyone is in high spirits.

Mary Magdalene steps next to Jesus. She looks like a changed 
woman: simply dressed, radiant.

Jesus smiles and takes her hand. An OLD MAN says to Mary:

		OLD MAN
	You don't belong at a wedding. We're 
	here to celebrate purity.

		JESUS
	Listen to me. What do you think the 
	Kingdom of Heaven's like? It's like 
	a wedding. God's the Bridegroom and 
	Man's soul is the Bride. The wedding 
	takes place in Heaven and everyone's 
	invited.
		(points to Mary)
	God's Kingdom is large enough for 
	everybody.

		OLD MAN
	Nazarene, that's against the law.

		JESUS
	The Law is against my heart.

						CUT TO:

LATER

The ceremony is over. People are dancing. Jesus, the disciples 
and the guests are laughing, drinking and swapping stories. 
(MS SEE PG. 219 BOOK) Jesus' hand rests on Magdalene's 
shoulder. The wine has loosened everyone's spirits. Nathaniel 
is nearby frantically talking with his wife and two other 
family members.

		JAMES
	Nathaniel, what's wrong.

		NATHANIEL
		(walks over, mortified)
	I didn't buy enough wine. More people 
	came and stayed late and now we've 
	run out.

Jesus points to several large vats:

		JESUS
	What's in those?

		NATHANIEL
	Water.

		JESUS
	No. It's wine.

		NATHANIEL
	No, no. It's water.

		JESUS
	Go over there and make sure. It's 
	wine, I'm telling you.

Nathaniel, still unconvinced, goes over to a vat and tastes.

		NATHANIEL
	You're right. It is wine.

		JAMES
		(as a joke)
	It's another miracle.

						CUT TO:

EXT. NAZARETH - DAY

Sabbath. The faithful, fresh from synagogue, mill about under 
the date palms in the manner of churchmen over the centuries.

These are not common people. On the contrary, they represent 
the Jewish hierarchy: the severely moral Pharisess, Saducees, 
in collusion with the Romans; and the landowners and 
shopkeepers who supported the synagogue.

Jesus calls out:

		JESUS
	Brothers! Sisters! My old friends! 
	Listen to me! Listen to me.

THe churchmen, curious, gather around.

		JESUS
		(continuing)
	The prophet was talking about me. 
	God talked to me in the desert. He 
	gave me a great secret and told me 
	to bring it to you -- didn't you 
	hear me coming? I ran here first -- 
	to Nazareth -- where I grew up -- to 
	give you the news. The Lord's Kingdom 
	is here.

		VILLAGER #1
		(taunting)
	You do miracles. Do a miracle for 
	us, make us believe in you. Otherwise, 
	go away!

		JESUS
		(impassioned)
	The Messiah doesn't need miracles. 
	He is the miracle. The Day of the 
	Lord is here. Are you ready? I've 
	come to tear down the world around 
	you. The old world will be replaced 
	by the new world. The Kingdom of 
	Heaven! The Kingdom of God! So call 
	the poor and give them your food. 
	What do you care about your 
	possessions? Your gold and silver 
	will rust and their rust will eat 
	your flesh like fire. Flood and fire 
	will come down, and the new Ark will 
	float above the flames. I hold the 
	keys and I open the Ark and I select. 
	My brothers of Nazareth, you're the 
	first I invite. Come and enter.

The villagers boo and laugh. Some children put stones in 
their hands.

		VILLAGER #1
	A boat. We're in the desert and he 
	tells us about a boat.

		VILLAGER #2
	Aren't you the son of Mary? Right? 
	Who are you to tell us about God.

		VILLAGER #3
	You made better crosses than speeches.
		(to companion as he 
		walks away)
	Go get somebody from his family. 
	This is embarrassing.

		JESUS
	What are you laughing at? Everything 
	you have will burn!! Soon! Leave 
	your homes! Come with me to Jerusalem!

		VILLAGER #2
	This is what happens when a man 
	doesn't marry. The semen backs up 
	into his brain.

Someone throws a stone; it grazes Jesus' head, drawing blood.

		VILLAGER #4
	Go home! You're full of devils.

		JESUS
		(wiping blood from 
		his brow)
	This is my home!

Peter and Judas rush to Jesus' defense. Judas puts his hand 
to his dagger.

		VILLAGER #2
	Kill him!

He throws another rock.

		PETER
	What are you doing that for? That's 
	a shame.

		VILLAGER #2
	He's a sorcerer. He's calling the 
	fire to come down on us!

		POOR VILLAGER
	Don't touch him! God's Kingdom is 
	for the poor. It's our Kingdom!

The rich and poor scuffle. Judas, Jesus, Peter and the others, 
all disgusted, break free from the brawl. Jesus looks back, 
confused and angry.

		JESUS
		(yelling back at crowd)
	If I could touch every stone, breathe 
	on every twig, they would rise up 
	and join me! Come with me! Jerusalem 
	is falling. I can feel it!

						CUT TO:

EXT. OUTSIDE NAZARETH - DAY

Jesus and his followers head across the plain toward Samaria. 
He turns to Judas who walks at his side:

		JESUS
	See these misfits. They're crippled, 
	they're blind, they're poor. That's 
	our army. They shout and the Old 
	Jerusalem will fall.

		JUDAS
	We'll need more men than this.

		JESUS
	God will provide them. We're going 
	to build a New Jerusalem.

Mary comes out of the crowd near him and grabs Jesus' arm.

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	Son. Please. Come back with me.

		JESUS
	Who are you woman?

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	You know who I am. Don't you recognize 
	me? I'm your mother.

		JESUS
	I have no mother. I have no family. 
	Only my father who's in heaven. Get 
	away from me.

He shakes off her arm. She trips, Jesus keeps walking, 
followed by the disciples. Peter and a WOMAN help Mary to 
her feet. Peter walks on as Mary and the woman turn back to 
town.

		WOMAN
	Mary... why are you crying? Didn't 
	you see them?

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	See what?

		WOMAN
	When he spoke to you, thousands of 
	blue wings, behind him, I swear to 
	you Mary, there were armies of angels.

		MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
	I didn't see anything. What good are 
	angels to me? I wanted children and 
	grand-children behind him, not angels.

EXT. ALONG THE JORDAN RIVER - DAY

Jesus and his ragtag "army" continue their southward march.

Martha and Mary, dressed in black, approach Jesus.

	We heard you've healed the sick, 
	made cripples walk, that you preformed

	Take me to him.

						CUT TO:

LAZARUS' TOMB - SUNSET

Jesus, Mary, Martha and the disciples stand before the tomb, 
which is sealed by a large boulder. There is a small crowd 
of mourners nearby.

		JESUS
	When was he buried?

		BETHANY WOMAN
	Three days ago.

		JESUS
	Roll the stone away.

Judas and Peter elicit the help of two others and lean their 
shoulders to it.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	What can I do? How much can I do?

The stone moves: a hideous stench gusts from the tomb. Some 
disciples turn their faces: others put handkerchiefs to their 
noses.

Jesus stands at the entrance of the tomb and yells. His voice 
echoes: a wild, strange cry, like something from another 
world.

		JESUS
	Lazarus! In the name of the prophets, 
	in the name of Jeremiah and my Father, 
	in the name of most Holy God, I demand 
	that you rise and come out!

At first, nothing. Then we begin to hear a soft rustling 
inside the tomb. Jesus is apprehensive. He stares at the 
tomb's entrance. Suddenly a decomposed skeletal human hand 
reaches out. The crowd gasps. Jesus, startled, jumps. Slowly, 
Jesus reaches out, moves a bit closer and clasps the corpses' 
hand. He is terrified. Suddenly, the corpse pulls back as if 
to yank Jesus into the tomb. Jesus is more frightened. He 
stands his ground. Then, Jesus decides to pull and the corpse 
comes out. The disciples and the crowd are stunned. The 
desicated figure, Lazarus, is covered head to toe in white 
burial cloth. His free hand slowly unwraps the cloth from 
his face. Strips of rotting flesh hang loose. Lazarus embraces 
Jesus.

		LAZARUS
	Adonai.

Jesus is shocked by his own miracle.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	Is the power of God so strong? If it 
	can raise the dead, can it also move 
	mountains? Can it destroy Rome? Tear 
	the world in half? God help me.

Jesus embraces Lazarus.

						CUT TO:

EXT. TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM - EARLY MORNING SUNRISE

Jesus and his companions are walking along the ruins. 
("Excavations in Jerusalem") The city wall is behind them.

Then from above, ("St. Steven's Gate") they enter the Roman 
ruins. An arch towers above them, a pool below them. some 
inhabitants of the ruins watch.

They enter the temple plaza.

Jesus enters the temple grounds with his central core of 
disciples. They have come to worship.

But they are stopped cold by the sight that greets them. 
Arranged all around the stairs that lead to the temple are 
money-changers, merchants, beggars and whores. A tall, shiny 
bronze statue of Tiberius towers over the plaza floor, which 
is stained with the blood of sacrificial animals. Jesus turns 
to Peter.

		JESUS
	We came here to pray. What is this?

		PETER
	The money-changers? Its' for the 
	temple tax... for the feast.

Jesus calmly addresses a money-changer.

		JESUS
	How's the exchange today? Making a 
	good profit?

		MONEY-CHANGER
	Fair. Can I help you?

Jesus stares for a moment and then with one violent blow 
sends the counter filled with coins sailing into the money-
changer's face.

Jesus, now enraged, strides past the booths, overturning the 
tables. Scales, weights and coins from all over the world 
scatter in every direction. The vendors rush to retrieve 
their money.

Other vendors and customers turn on Jesus. Judas, Peter and 
the others forcibly fight them off. Jesus calls out:

		JESUS
	This is my Father's house. It's a 
	place for worship, not a bank, or a 
	market.

The disciples circle Jesus for his protection. The RABBI, 
surrounded by SADDUCESS, steps out of the temple.

		RABBI
	Nazarene, what are you doing?

		JESUS
	God doesn't need a grand house. He 
	doesn't need cyprus and bloody 
	animals. He doesn't need shekels.

		RABBI
	You expect people to pay the tax in 
	Roman coins? They have images of 
	false gods on them. You want pagan 
	gods in the temple? All foreign coins 
	have to be changed to shekels. That 
	the law.

		JESUS
	I abolish the law. I give a new law 
	and a new hope!

		RABBI
	What, did God change his mind about 
	the old law?

		JESUS
		(exasperated)
	No, no. He just thinks our hearts 
	are ready now to hold more.

		RABBI
		(not listening)
	This chaos is your new law? How can 
	you presume...

		JESUS
	How can I presume? Because I am the 
	fulfillment of the old law and the 
	beginning of the new.

		SADDUCEE
		(shocked)
	Watch what you're saying.

Peter, becoming concerned with the drift of this argument, 
whispers to Jesus.

		PETER
	Maybe we should go...

Jesus pushes him away.

		JESUS
	When I say, 'I,' Rabbi, I am saying 
	'God.'

		RABBI
	That's blasphemy!

		JESUS
	Didn't you hear? I'm the Saint of 
	Blasphemy. Don't make any mistakes. 
	I haven't come to bring peace, I've 
	come to bring a sword.

		SADDUCEE
	Talking like that will get you killed.

		JESUS
	I'm sick of all of you. This temple 
	will be destroyed in three days. One 
	stone won't be left standing on 
	another. You think God belongs only 
	to you?! He doesn't! God's an immortal 
	spirit and belongs to everybody -- 
	to the whole world. You're not 
	special! God is not an Israelite!

Even the disciples are shocked by this heresy. They escort 
Jesus out of the temple grounds for his own safety.

As they reach the bottom of the temple steps they are mobbed. 
The beggars press on Jesus, pulling at his arms and legs.

		MOB MEMBER #1
	Magician! Heal me.

		MOB MEMBER #2
	Cure us. Make us rich.

		MOB MEMBER #3
	Heal me. Do a miracle. You want me 
	to enter the Kingdom of Heaven 
	crippled like this?

		JESUS
		(pushes them away)
	Get away. You sicken me. You're 
	selfish! You're full of hate! God 
	won't help you.

		MOB MEMBER #1
	Cure us or you won't leave this city 
	alive!

		JESUS
	You don't demand from God!

The disciples intervene and pull Jesus away. The mob follows. 
Suddenly, four Roman Calvary men stampede into the mob 
whipping beggars and everyone else. Jesus and the disciples 
break loose from the fray.

		ROMAN OFFICER
	You, all of you stop. Which one of 
	you is Jesus of Nazareth?

The disciples groan.

		JESUS
	I am.

		ROMAN OFFICER
	Come with us. The Procurator wants 
	to see you.

The calvarymen lead Jesus away, leaving the disciples behind.

As they watch him go, SAUL, a Zealot, comes up behind Judas 
and draws him aside.

		SAUL
	We need you. What are you doing with 
	this magician? First you were supposed 
	to kill him. Now he acts like a 
	prophet and you follow him.

		JUDAS
	What are you saying? Didn't you just 
	hear him?

		SAUL
	I heard him. He talks about a new 
	law, he talks about using a sword. 
	But we took an oath to use the sword 
	against Rome. I don't see anything 
	against Rome here. All I see here is 
	Jew against Jew.

Judas walks away from him.

INT. ROMAN THEATRE - DAY

The Roman soldiers escort Jesus into the open theatre.

Pilate confers with two soldiers at a table near the stage. 
He watches a play in rehearsal. (See Director, Production 
Designer, and Costumer for details of play.)

Pilate is informed of Jesus' presence and turns to him.

		PILATE
	Are you Jesus of Nazareth, King of 
	the Jews?

		JESUS
	I'm no king.

		PILATE
	You aren't the Messiah? They say you 
	are. You say you are.

		JESUS
	My kingdom's not on this earth.

		PILATE
	Oh? Where is it then? In the air, 
	maybe?

		JESUS
	In heaven.

		PILATE
	Good. Keep it there. They tell me 
	you do miracles. Is this good magic 
	or bad magic? Can you do a trick for 
	us?

		JESUS
	I'm not a pet. I don't do tricks.

		PILATE
	That's disappointing. I was hoping 
	to see something.

		JESUS
	The prophet Daniel had a vision. A 
	huge statue had a gold head, and 
	silver shoulders...

		PILATE
		(interrupts)
	Don't tell me stories. I'm not a 
	dumb Jew.

		JESUS
	Listen. Learn.

		PILATE
		(daring him)
	Go ahead. Teach me something.

		JESUS
	The stomach was bronze, the legs 
	were iron, the feet were clay. A 
	stone was thrown. The clay feet broke 
	and the statue collapsed.

		PILATE
	Is that it?

		JESUS
	God is the thrower. I'm the stone. 
	Rome is the statue.

		PILATE
	Clearly. But that's how you're going 
	to bring down the Roman Empire? One 
	stone? Only you?

Jesus starts to speak, then stops.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	God, give me the answer. I don't 
	know what to say.

		PILATE
	No answer?

		JESUS (V.O.)
	Please speak to me. I need words.

A pain suddenly surges through the back of Jesus' neck. His 
knees buckle. For a moment he seems crippled.

		PILATE
	You're not a stone. You're excrement. 
	Get him out of here.

Jesus is confused, humiliated, and in pain. Soldiers start 
to lead him out.

		PILATE
	And my wife dreams about you. She 
	should see you now.

Pilate turns back to the play.

EXT. MARY AND MARTHA'S HOUSE - DAY

Lazarus, his back to us, is resting and looking out over the 
valley. His hand reaches for a cup of water. The fingers are 
more whole. He seems to be healing.

It is midday, Lazarus thinks he is by himself.

		VOICE
	Lazarus. Lazarus.

He turns in the direction of the voice. We see Saul, the 
Zealot who spoke to Judas in the temple at Jerusalem.

		SAUL
	Feeling better?

		LAZARUS
	I like the light.

		SAUL
	What was it like? Which is better, 
	life or death?

		LAZARUS
	Well, I was a little surprised. There 
	wasn't that much difference...

		SAUL
	Well, let me help you make up your 
	mind.

Another arm comes in from behind and grabs Lazarus around 
the neck. Saul pulls a sword and very professionally plunges 
it into Lazarus' chest, ripping upwards towards his heart.

						CUT TO:

EXT. OUTSIDE JERUSALEM - NIGHT

Judas, who has been looking for Jesus, finds him alone on 
the road leading out of the city. He sits beside him.

		JUDAS
	I've been looking all over for you. 
	For two days. We're really worried 
	about you. I have to tell you. They 
	killed Lazarus.

Jesus collects his thoughts.

		JESUS
	Who?

		JUDAS
	Zealots.

		JESUS
	Your people. Why?

		JUDAS
	Because he was the living proof of 
	your power. Zealots say you're paid 
	by the Romans to tell the people 
	only heaven is important. Not their 
	life now. Not being dominated by 
	Romans. That's very dangerous.

		JESUS
		(quietly)
	Yes. It make everything clearer.

		JUDAS
	Clearer? What are you talking about, 
	clearer? It just makes everything 
	worse. We want a revolution, the 
	Zealots want a revolution but now 
	they're against us. We can't let 
	that happen. We need them.

		JESUS
	Do you want to join them, then?

		JUDAS
	No. They're my brothers, but you're 
	my master.

		JESUS
	You are the strongest, aren't you? 
	Of all my friends, you're the 
	strongest. I have to tell you 
	something.

		JUDAS
	Tell me whatever you want. You can 
	depend on me.

		JESUS
	You know why I came to Jerusalem?

		JUDAS
	This is where we're going to fight. 
	This is where the revolution's going 
	to happen.

Jesus nods.

		JESUS
	Last night Isaiah came to me.

		JUDAS
		(eager)
	What did he say?

		JESUS
	He opened his book and I read in 
	giant letters: 'He has borne our 
	faults; he was wounded for our 
	transgressions. He was afflicted, 
	yet he opened not his mouth. Despised 
	and rejected by all, he went forward 
	without resisting, like a lamb led 
	to the slaughter.'

		JUDAS
		(pause)
	So? What does that have to do with 
	you?

		JESUS
	Judas. I'm the lamb. I'm the one who 
	is going to die.

		JUDAS
	What do you mean, die? Die? Did you 
	change your mind again.

		JESUS
	No.

Judas jumps up.

		JUDAS
	Then what are you talking about? 
	That can't be. If you're the Messiah, 
	why do you have to die?

		JESUS
	Don't shout. You'll understand soon. 
	At first I didn't understand myself.

		JUDAS
	Every day you have a different plan. 
	I can't believe it. First it's love, 
	then it's the ax, now you have to 
	die. What good could that do. We 
	need you alive.

		JESUS
	I can't help it. God only talks to 
	me a little at a time. He only shows 
	me as much as I have to know. Now I 
	finally understand. All my life. All 
	my life I've been followed. By 
	footsteps. By voices. By headaches. 
	By shadows. And you know what the 
	shadow is? It's the cross. I have to 
	die on the cross. And I have to die 
	willingly... We need courage, Judas. 
	We need faith. I'm the fulfillment 
	of the prophecy. The cross is the 
	way I have to take.

Judas is dumbfounded, and his anger is mounting.

		JESUS
	So we go to Jerusalem. We go back to 
	the temple. Whatever happens there 
	will put me on the cross.

		JUDAS
		(barely controlling 
		his anger)
	And after you die on the cross? What 
	happens then?

		JESUS
	I'll come back to judge the living 
	and the dead.

		JUDAS
		(pause)
	I don't believe you.

		JESUS
	If you don't believe, nobody will. 
	You have to believe. You're the 
	strongest.

						CUT TO:

EXT. OUTSIDE JERUSALEM - DAY

A blazing sun. Jesus and the disciples on the march. Following 
close behind is an entourage of twenty toughs.

James turns to Judas.

		JAMES
	I'm worried he's going to change his 
	mind again.

		JUDAS
	No he won't. We're taking the temple.

		JAMES
	What if we don't.

		JUDAS
	We'll die.

		JAMES
		(looking around)
	There aren't many of us. And nobody 
	back there looks like a soldier.

		JUDAS
	God will provide.

Near them, Nathaniel and Philip are talking.

		NATHANIEL
	What do you want?

		PHILIP
	What do you mean?

		NATHANIEL
	When we build the New Jerusalem and 
	set up the new government.

		PHILIP
		(thinks)
	Well, I guess I'd like more sheep. 
	You know, my other sheep, I don't 
	even know where they are now. This 
	time I want a large herd. I'd hire 
	other shepherds to take care of them. 
	You know, Laban, that man who has a 
	large farm north of Tiberias? I'd 
	like one like that.

		NATHANIEL
	Yeah.

		PHILIP
	How about you?

		NATHANIEL
	First, I'd like to be able to worship 
	in the temple. I mean really worship -- 
	without Roman banners and soldiers 
	standing around.

		PHILIP
		(nods)
	Of course. But what else?

Behind them, John, Andrew and Thomas argue.

		THOMAS
	I'm not afraid.

		JOHN
	Then don't act like it.

		THOMAS
	I'll do anything the Master asks... 
	anything but get crucified.

		ANDREW
	You're a coward.

		THOMAS
	Call me a coward after you've been 
	hanging up there for two days and 
	the crows come and suck out your 
	eyes.

		JOHN
	I made my decision. If you can't 
	make yours, leave now before we enter 
	the Kingdom.

		THOMAS
		(touches his chest)
	I'm ready. I have my knife.

Peter passes by and rushes a little anxiously to catch up 
with Jesus, who is walking at the front of the line.

		PETER
	I've been talking with the others, 
	and listening, and a lot of us are a 
	little concerned, we're wondering... 
	well... will you have legions of 
	angels meeting us there? Or anyone? 
	Besides who's here?

Jesus doesn't answer, but he puts his arm around Peter's 
shoulder.

						CUT TO:

EXT. JERUSALEM - DAY

Jesus and his followers -- about a hundred strong -- pass 
through "The excavations around Jerusalem." The city wall is 
behind them. More people begin to join the ranks.

They enter "St. Stephen's Gate" (the arch over a pool of 
water). The mob grows around them. Some have palm branches.

They are now in the "Underground City." Jesus is riding a 
donkey. Women and children wave palm branches, throw flowers, 
lay down palms and shawls in Jesus' path. They cheer "Rosanna, 
Rosanna."

A new chant -- abetted by Judas and his followers -- goes 
up: "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews."

The procession reaches the temple plaza. Jesus dismounts and 
looks around.

Outside the temple walls, stalls occupy every nook and cranny. 
Hundreds of people are selling, buying, bargaining, hawking 
their wares: merchants, money-changers, innkeepers, 
prostitutes.

Jesus, full of rage, followed by the disciples, sweeps down 
on the wine stands and workshops, overturning the tables, 
striking the tradesmen with his goad. (determined crane - 
MS)

		JESUS
	Get out! Away!

Jesus mounts the temple steps. Smoke seems to be coming from 
his body. This is his moment.

Behind him, everyone loots stalls and routs merchants with 
great enthusiasm, as if Jesus' solitary act of anger last 
time in the temple had now become an example for mob action.

On the top of the temple steps, Jesus pauses momentarily.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	Lord, I hope this is what you want. 
	Please let it happen quickly, while 
	I have the strength.

Now he turns to face the mob.

		JESUS
	I am here to set fire to the world! 
	In the desert The Baptist said, 
	'Repent, Repent! The day of the Lord 
	is coming!' but I'm saying it's too 
	late to repent. The Day of the Lord's 
	already here! I am the Day of the 
	Lord. I come with the baptism of 
	fire!

The poor in the mob yell: "Fire! Fire -- burn it all down!"

The TEMPLE GUARDS (usually Levites) grab their lances and 
swords. Judas' cohorts draw their weapons.

Suddenly, there is a blast of trumpets. ROMAN SENTRIES, 
heavily armed, appear on top of the temple walls. There are 
dozens of them, and they are ready to fight.

The people look up. Jesus stops. Peter is still rallying the 
crowd, lighted torch in his hand.

		PETER
	Let's go! Now's the time!

The crowd looks from the Romans to Jesus. For the moment, 
the crowd is still with him. Judas whispers urgently to Jesus.

		JUDAS
	They're all with you! They're waiting 
	for your signal! Give it!

Peter looks over at Jesus.

		PETER
	Come on! Now!

Jesus looks from the Romans on the wall to the ground.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	Please. I'm waiting too. Put the ax 
	in my hands. Not the cross. Let me 
	die like this.

		JOHN
	If you don't give the sign now, we're 
	finished. We'll be killed for what 
	we did today.

		PHILIP
	We came here to fight, not to die!

Jesus remains still.

		JUDAS
	Master, we knew they would be strong! 
	We knew it would be like this.

The Roman Soldiers swarm off the walls and start down into 
the temple.

Jesus looks at his hands: blood oozes from his palms. He 
closes his fists to hide the stigmata and raises his eyes to 
Judas.

		JESUS
	Judas. Come beside me.

Judas puts his arm around Jesus. The crowd, confused and 
furious, starts to scatter. Some of them throw things at the 
disciples as they all scramble to avoid the violence of the 
Roman soldiers.

		JESUS
		(to Judas)
	Stay by my side.

The other disciples swarm around Jesus and Judas and form a 
wedge. As the Roman soldiers disperse through the temple 
courtyard, Jesus and the disciples are swept by the frantic 
crowd into a side street leading to the Underground City 
below the temple.

						CUT TO:

EXT. JERUSALEM - SUNSET

Passover preparations are underway. At twilight we see the 
"excavations in Jerusalem." Over a hundred people in black 
move across them. Large candles cover the entire site.

We see now elderly Jews cleansing themselves at the ritual 
baths. The steam rises to the sky.

The "Underground City" is teeming with men, women, children, 
(animals) preparing for the celebration. They wear black and 
white shawls and are bathed in candlelight. Psalms, music 
and voices are heard.

Jesus and Judas are walking and watching carefully. They 
stop at a selected spot between two trees.

		JUDAS
	There's got to be something else you 
	can do.

		JESUS
	I wish there was. At the temple I 
	prayed. I prayed to die. But it's 
	not God's will. I have to die on the 
	cross. I prayed out of weakness and 
	I'm weakening even more. You've got 
	to give me strength.

		JUDAS
	I won't let you die.

		JESUS
	You've got to. There's no other way. 
	The world around us is Satan's world. 
	It will be destroyed! The world of 
	God will come! But only by my dying! 
	By my sacrifice on the cross! Forget 
	everything else! Understand that.

		JUDAS
	No I can't. I'm not strong enough.

		JESUS
	You are. You're the strongest. You're 
	part of God's plan too. You once 
	made me a promise. You said if I 
	ever strayed, if I ever shied away 
	from revolution, you would kill me. 
	Remember?

Judas nods.

		JESUS
	I've strayed, haven't I?

		JUDAS
	Yes.

		JESUS
	Then you have to keep your word. You 
	have to kill me.

		JUDAS
	If God wants that, then let God do 
	it. I won't.

		JESUS
	He will do it. Through you. The Temple 
	Guards want to arrest me where there 
	aren't any crowds. Tonight we'll be 
	in Gethsemane. Arrange for them to 
	find me. It will be terrible. But 
	only for three days. Only three days! 
	Then I'll come back. We'll all be 
	together in triumph.

		JUDAS
	No.

		JESUS
	You've got to! Don't abandon me now. 
	Without you, the world can't be saved, 
	There'll be no redemption. Without 
	us together, the sacrifice can't be 
	made.

		JUDAS
	Could you betray God? If you were 
	me, could you betray your Master?

		JESUS
	No. That's why God gave me the easier 
	job... to be crucified.

INT. UPPER ROOM - NIGHT

Three seven-branched candelabra illuminate the lamb, wine 
and unleavened bread.

The disciples are seated on cushions on the ground. Food is 
brought in from an adjacent room.

Mary, Martha and Magdalene have all come to Jerusalem to 
celebrate the festival with Jesus and his disciples and 
prepare the ritual meal.

Jesus fills the disciples cups from a pitcher of salt water.

		JESUS
	Our ancestors in Egypt celebrated 
	Passover before they escaped to the 
	freedom of the desert. On this 
	Passover we come out of another kind 
	of slavery and enter another kind of 
	freedom.

		PHILIP
	Oh, please. We're hiding here like 
	criminals, we can't go out the door, 
	and even if we could we wouldn't 
	want to because we've been so 
	humiliated, we'd like to respect 
	you...

		JOHN
	Respect him? We love him.

		PHILIP
	...yes, alright, yes, we love him, 
	that goes without saying, but at 
	least he could...

		JESUS
		(interrupting)
	First... first... first we drink 
	salt water to remember the tears and 
	pain our ancestors suffered in the 
	land of Israel.

Jesus swallows his drink in a single gulp; Judas is the first 
to do likewise. Mary brings a tray of bitter herbs. As the 
disciples eat, Jesus watches.

		JESUS
	Tonight we go further. This passover 
	celebrates the passage from death to 
	eternal life. I'll lead the way, you 
	will follow. John, you know the 
	prophets. Isaiah says, 'He had neither 
	beauty nor luster that we should 
	turn our eyes to him. He was despised 
	and rejected by men...'

		JOHN
		(continues)
	'...But he took on himself all our 
	pains. He was wounded for our 
	transgressions, he was bruised for 
	our inequities, and with his stripes 
	we are healed.'

		JESUS
		(interrupting)
	'...He was scourged and he was 
	afflicted. Yet, like a lamb led to 
	the slaughter, he opened not his 
	mouth.'
		(a beat)
	My dear, wonderful friends. I am the 
	lamb. And I won't open my mouth. 
	They've been leading me to the 
	slaughter ever since I was born.

The disciples exchange fearful glances.

		PETER
	If you die, I'll die first. Because 
	I'll be at your side.

		JESUS
	Be quiet. What did you have before I 
	found you? All of you. Nothing.
		(no answer)
	Now you have God's love -- and eternal 
	life. Don't worry. You won't die 
	yet. There's still a lot of work to 
	do. We haven't come to rule, but to 
	serve. In three days I'll rise from 
	the dead to lead you.

The disciples stare in shocked silence. Jesus has either 
gone completely mad -- or he is the Messiah.

Jesus breaks the bread loaves and passes them around. He 
pours wine for the others:

		JESUS
	Eat, this is my body. Drink, this is 
	my blood. I will be in you always.

As they do, the bread and the wine transubstantiate into 
flesh and blood in their mouths. They blanch and cough; some 
blood falls on the table. Peter removes the substance from 
his mouth with his hand and examines it: it has the 
consistency of blood and flesh. This is literally hard for 
all the disciples to swallow. But they all persevere, and, 
finally, they all manage to do it. As they wipe their bloody 
mouths, John starts to weep. Jesus turns and looks at Judas.

Judas exits... Peter shouts angrily after him:.

		PETER
	Judas, where are you going?
		(to Jesus)
	Where's he going?

		JESUS
	Don't get in the way. Tonight we'll 
	go to Gethsemane to pray.

						CUT TO:

EXT. GETHSEMANE - NIGHT

As they climb the steep hills of Gethsemane, Jesus leaves 
most of his group behind and proceeds with Peter, James and 
John. Passing through thick, gnarled olive groves, they reach 
a clearing marked by three boulders. (looks like a Henry 
Moore sculpture). The leaves glisten on the trees all around 
them.

		JESUS
	Wait for me here.

Jesus walks alone until he finds a secluded spot. Pulling 
his tunic around him, he kneels beneath an ancient tree.

		JESUS
	Father, Father in heaven. Father on 
	earth. The world you created that we 
	can see is beautiful. But the world 
	you created that we can't see is 
	beautiful too. I don't know -- forgive 
	me -- Father, I don't know which is 
	the more beautiful.

Jesus scoops up a handful of soil and smells it. "What 
perfume" he thinks. Then as he rubs the soil on his cheeks, 
neck and lips, he speaks.

		JESUS
	This is my body too. Together we 
	will die.

Jesus' body weakens. He starts to sweat.

		JESUS
	Abba, Father, we've been together a 
	long time. I never asked to be chosen, 
	but, I always obeyed. You've done 
	many miracles for others. You opened 
	the Red Sea for Moses. You saved 
	Noah. You took Elijah directly to 
	heaven in a fiery chariot. Now you 
	ask me to be crucified. Can I ask 
	you one last time? Do I have to die? 
	Is there any other way? Do I have to 
	drink from this cup? Can't you take 
	it away from me?

Jesus waits for an answer that doesn't come. The wind blows 
through the olive trees.

Jesus looks over, sees Peter, James and John asleep.

Now, in front of him, a GUARDIAN ANGEL in the form of one of 
the sleeping disciples appears and sets a clay cup before 
Jesus.

		JESUS
	Is this your answer?

The Angel drinks from the cup then hands it to Jesus.

Jesus reaches for the cup, but the Angel no longer holds it. 
His hand is empty. Then, slowly, the Angel's hand reaches 
forward and lightly caresses the top of Jesus' head to comfort 
him.

		JESUS
	Your will be done. I only ask for 
	strength.

Jesus wipes the sweat and tears from his face and leaves.

						CUT TO:

EXT. GETHSEMANE - NIGHT

At the three-point rock Jesus finds Peter, James and John 
fast asleep. John's head rests peacefully on his brother's 
chest. Peter lies flat with his arms outstretched. Jesus is 
tempted not to wake them.

		JESUS
		(softly)
	Couldn't you stay awake with me for 
	just an hour?

Peter is the first to awake.

		PETER
	I'm sorry.

Jesus hears the sound of soldiers in the distance.

		JESUS
	It doesn't matter. It's too late.

Jesus hears the evening nightingale overheard. A feeling of 
peace sweeps over him. He smiles at James and John as they 
awaken. (moving camera here to end of scene?)

Judas and a band of Romans and armed Temple Guards carrying 
long torches burst into the clearing. Peter pulls his dagger; 
Jesus pushes him back. Judas greets his master.

		JUDAS
	Welcome, Rabbi.

Judas kisses him fiercely on the mouth. Jesus gratefully 
embraces his faithful disciple. Tears stream down Judas' 
cheek.

Peter attacks and slices off one of the Temple Guard's ears.

Jesus pushes Judas unwillingly away. He turns to Peter, 
touches the knife simply (36 f.p.s.).

		JESUS
	No. You live by this, you die by it.

The knife falls to the ground (36 f.p.s.). Two guards grab 
Peter but he wrestles them off and runs away. Jesus picks up 
the severed ear (36 f.p.s.) and miraculously restores it to 
the Levite (36 f.p.s.).

		JESUS
	Welcome. You're the messengers of 
	God. Let's go.

INT. ANTONIA - DAY

Jesus again stands before Pilate. He is bloody, beaten, 
exhausted from lack of sleep. A clique of Temple Guards, 
Pharisees and Sadducess stand in one corner of the hall.

		PILATE
	You're back.
		(pause)
	Hello.
		(pause)
	So now you're a king. Is that right?

Jesus stares at the sky.

		PILATE
	Don't look in the air. Look at me. 
	Answer me. I can crucify you. You 
	know that? Now... are you a king?

		JESUS
	Some say so.

		PILATE
	Ah yes. Well last time you took that 
	line with me, you fooled me. I don't 
	like to be fooled. What you did in 
	the temple makes it very clear. You're 
	just another of these religious 
	revolutionaries making difficulties. 
	You take the people into the desert, 
	you talk about God, love, mercy and 
	the new kingdom, but you're just the 
	same as the Zealots. You all promise 
	glory and bring death. There's a new 
	Messiah every week and a new one 
	dies every week and Rome continues.

		JESUS
	Remember the statue. And the stone. 
	And the clay feet.

		PILATE
	How could I forget. Still think your 
	kingdom will replace Rome?

		JESUS
	No. My kingdom is not on earth.

		PILATE
	No, it wouldn't be. You're a little 
	smarter than the others. After all, 
	what's a revolution on earth compared 
	to a revolution in people's hearts?

		JESUS
	It's a revolution that will come 
	with love, not by the sword.

		PILATE
	Either way it's dangerous. It's 
	against Rome. It's against the way 
	the world is. And either way, I don't 
	care. Sword or love, it's all the 
	same. I don't care how you want to 
	change things. We don't want them 
	changed. So you know what has to 
	happen. We have a small space for 
	you up on Golgotha. Right next to 
	the bones of your predecessors. Three 
	thousand skulls there, very likely 
	more by now. Maybe you people should 
	go out and count them sometime. Maybe 
	then you'd learn your lesson. But 
	probably not.

Pilate looks over at the Pharisees and Sadducees.

		PILATE
	Do you gentlemen have anything to 
	add?

		SADDUCEE
	We can't condone the killing of any 
	Jew. But everything this man does 
	and everything he says could lead to 
	revolution. We don't want revolution. 
	Action against a power like Rome is 
	hopeless. It invites reprisals that 
	would mean the extinction of the 
	Jewish people. It's the death of one 
	man against the death of millions. 
	There's no alternative for us.

		PHARISEE
	Many of our own people believe this 
	man is being paid by Rome anyway.

		PILATE
	Fine. It's agreed.
		(to Jesus)
	But just so people appreciate your 
	rank, we'll write it all out for 
	them. "King of the Jews."

						CUT TO:

EXT. ANTONIA - DAY

Direct overhead angle: We see down a thick column. Jesus is 
tied to it, naked. (obscured nudity) He is scourged.

						CUT TO:

EXT. ANTONIA - LATER

Weakened, bloody, naked (obscured nudity), Jesus is being 
swung by the arm like a rag doll into a solid wall (pan). 
Closer, we see his face as it hits the wall, smashing his 
nose.

						CUT TO:

EXT. ANTONIA - LATER

Close of a crown of thorns (rather, a skullcap of them), 
being hit onto his head with the broad edge of a sword.

						CUT TO:

EXT. ANTONIA - LATER

In the distance, Roman soldiers lead Jesus onto the balcony 
overlooking the temple plaza and present him to the awaiting 
mob. His tunic is drenched with blood.

The crowd watching this ceremony is literally divided against 
itself. Half is cheering and carousing, a real lynch mob. 
The other half is angry and shouting to stop the crucifixion. 
Soldiers manage to contain these little pockets of action.

PETER stands watching with his back pressed against a wall. 
A BEGGAR turns to him.

		BEGGAR
	I've seen you. You're one of his 
	followers.

		PETER
	No. It must be somebody else.

		BEGGAR
	No, it's you.

		PETER
	You don't know what you're talking 
	about.

Peter turns quickly and disappears into the crowd.

						CUT TO:

EXT. JERUSALEM STREETS (UNDERGROUND CITY) - DAY

Peter is running down an alley when, turning a corner, he 
runs into Philip, also fleeing.

They don't even speak. After a fleeting recognition, they 
sprint in opposite directions.

						CUT TO:

EXT. JERUSALEM (THE EXCAVATIONS IN JERUSALEM AND AVDAT) - 
DAY

Roman soldiers lead Jesus through the peasant streets outside 
Golgtha. The blood has dried on his tunic. He still wears 
his thorny "crown."

The cross-bar Jesus carries scrapes alongside the walls of 
the houses because the paths are extremely narrow. (high 
angle looking down on these open roofed dwellings and the 
narrow passageways.) They are jammed with people (36-48 
f.p.s.). Men, women, children, (animals), in the windows and 
open doorways try to get a glimpse of Jesus. The atmosphere 
has changed. Now it's just another show. A multiple 
crucifixion: Laughter. Ridicule. Figs for sale. Jesus weakens. 
He's knees buckle, the weight of the cross-bar throws him 
off balance and he falls. A Roman soldier pulls him back up 
by a rope around his neck.

We see close shots of people, their faces. Their eyes, (36-
48 f.p.s.). Some turn away. Some cry. Some are mocking. One 
woman in a window, her head covered with a shawl, turns away 
(moving, 36-48 f.p.s.).

						CUT TO:

EXT. GOLGOTHA (ADVAT) - DAY

Golgotha, the hill of the skull. The rocks are bleached white. 
There are many crosses, most of them with no cross-bars. 
Some are simply trees with no branches (see DeMassina). One 
or two crosses bear half-eaten decomposed corpses. On the 
ground, we see human skulls and bones, skeletal arms and 
hands mixed with the rocks.

A curious crowd has already assembled at the crucifixion 
site. Toward the rear, afraid to approach, Magdalene, Mary, 
Martha and Jesus' Mother stand in a tight group.

The Romans bring Jesus to the peak of the hill and strip 
him. Two other criminals are prepared for crucifixion.

Jesus looks at the rough-hewn cross laid before him (P.O.V. 
move in?). He searches the crowd.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	Mother? Magdalene? Where are you?

He sees his Mother and tries to gesture to her.

		JESUS (V.O.)
		(continuing)
	Forgive me for being a bad son.

TWO SOLDIERS grab Jesus by the arms:

		FIRST SOLDIER
	Alright, You Majesty, on your throne.

They stretch Jesus out on the cross while slave laborers 
finish preparing the post hole for the cross.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	Don't dessert me here. Don't leave 
	me.

The Soldiers place the crude spikes against Jesus' wrists. 
The sound of METAL AGAINST METAL rings out as the hammer 
comes down. (see nail driven through from behind wood).

A bloody mist sprays on Jesus' face. He grimaces but does 
not cry out.

Martha and the three Marys hide their faces. Near Jesus, the 
other criminals are being impaled. (trees, see DeMassina)

The Romans fasten ropes around Jesus' arms. The spikes alone 
will not support his weight.

It takes three soldiers to hoist Jesus' cross upright. Now, 
suddenly, he is above the masses. All of Jerusalem is within 
view.

His body jars in to place. The pain is excruciating. His 
fellow criminals howl in agony.

Jesus surveys the mob: a sea of hostile faces. He finds 
Magdalene, Mary, Martha and his Mother standing together.

The Sadducees are satisfied; the Romans are complacent. Groups 
of townspeople and schoolboys point out the sufferings of 
the condemned men.

		JESUS (V.O.)
		(continuing)
	Father, forgive them.

The sky changes color. A fierce wind blows across the rocky 
hill.

Writhing on the cross, Jesus looks to heaven and screams:

		JESUS
	Eli, Eli...

						CUT TO:

EXT. GOLGOTHA - DAY

The sky turns a pleasant pale blue. Jesus looks up at the 
thick white cumulous clouds floating on the horizon. Birds 
sing in the distance.

He thinks: Am I dead? No, the crowd is still there, SILENT. 
On either side of Jesus, his fellow criminals writhe in silent 
agony.

An old man appears before him, standing.

		JESUS
	Who are you?

The man does not answer.

		JESUS
	Are you my father?

		ANGEL
	No, but I was sent by him. I'm the 
	angel who guards you.

He is now closer to Jesus.

		ANGEL
	Your father is the God of Mercy, not 
	punishment. He saw you and said, 
	'Aren't you his Guardian Angel? Well, 
	go down and save him. He's suffered 
	enough.' Remember when he told Abraham 
	to sacrifice his son? Just as Abraham 
	lifted his knife, God saved Isaac. 
	If he saved Abraham's son, don't you 
	think he'd want to save his own? He 
	tested you, and he's pleased. He 
	doesn't want your blood. He said, 
	"Let him die in a dream. But let him 
	have his life." Come with me.

		JESUS
	All this pain is a dream?

		ANGEL
	Just a dream.

In three separate shots, the Angel takes out the nails in 
Jesus' body.

First, the Angel extracts the nail in the feet, then kisses 
the wound, stopping the flow of blood.

Then, the Angel does the same to the left hand.

Then, the same is done on the right hand.

In a moment Jesus and the Guardian Angel are standing at the 
foot of the cross. They pass through the silent crowd 
unnoticed. Jesus looks over his shoulder: his cross is empty. 
He begins to understand.

		JESUS
	I don't have to be sacrificed.

		ANGEL
	No. No you don't.

Jesus smiles. This is finally the answer he's been waiting 
for. He is free of God.

		JESUS
	I'm not the Messiah.

		ANGEL
	No. No you're not.

		JESUS
	Thank God.

They start to walk away from the cross down the hill. We 
still see the crucifixion site in the background.

		JESUS
	What about all the others?

		ANGEL
	Don't look behind, God gave you the 
	gift of life. Look ahead.

		JESUS
	But what about the people? What will 
	happen?

		ANGEL
	They can see you crucified. Or they'll 
	see you dead. Or they can see you 
	any way they want.

		JESUS
	What happens later if they see me 
	alive?

		ANGEL
	They'll see any one you want them to 
	see. Even you. If you want.

		JESUS
	Where are the disciples?

		ANGEL
	Oh, they were frightened and ran 
	away.

						CUT TO:

EXT. JUDEAN COUNRYSIDE - DAY

They walk through the pleasant landscape of the Jordan Valley. 
All is quiet, peaceful. A light morning fog envelops them.

		JESUS
	Is this the Kingdom of God I spoke 
	about?

		ANGEL
		(laughing)
	No, this is earth.

		JESUS
	Why has it changed so much?

		ANGEL
	It hasn't changed, you have. Now, 
	you can see its real beauty. Harmony 
	between the earth and the heart, 
	that's the Kingdom of Heaven. Maybe 
	you'll find this hard to believe. 
	But we angels often look down on man 
	and envy you.

Ahead (possibly in a wooded area), Jesus sees a group in 
ceremonial dress. Virgins dressed in white, merchants carrying 
incense and gifts,

		JESUS
	What is this?

		ANGEL
	A wedding ceremony.

		JESUS
	Who's getting married?

		ANGEL
	You are.

Mary Magdalene, dressed in white, steps from the group. Jesus' 
face bursts into a smile. He rushes into her arms.

		JESUS
	What's wrong? Why are you crying?

		MAGDALENE
	I'm thanking God for bringing you 
	here.

He holds her tight.

						CUT TO:

EXT. JUDEAN HOUSE - NIGHT

A small hut in wooded are. Moonlight shimmers off the river 
and a fog filters through the wooded area.

The Guardian Angel sits on a stool in front of the door.

						CUT TO:

INT. JUDEAN HOUSE - NIGHT

Jesus and Magdalene make love on blankets spread over straw. 
He kisses her breasts, her lips. He kisses her abdomen below 
the navel, taking in the sweat and scent of her body as he 
did the soil in Gethsemane.

		MAGDALENE
	We can have a child.

		JESUS
	Yes.

Jesus continues kissing her body.

The Guardian Angel steps into the darkened room, stands over 
their bed and makes a strange sign in the air that may be a 
blessing.

		ANGEL
	Bless you, children.

They look at him for a brief moment, then resume kissing. 
The Angel withdraws quietly to a corner and sits, guarding.

						CUT TO:

EXT. JUDEAN HOUSE - DAY

The house shows sign of domestication. Magdalene sits outside 
in the sun. She is several months pregnant.

She sits with her back to the camera, very much in the manner 
of Lazarus in a previous scene. The camera dollies in. She 
turns and smiles.

A shadow of a hand falls down across her face and bosom onto 
her belly.

		MAGDALENE
	Death is kind.

Her own hands hug her stomach lightly as she starts to fall 
over. She dies as if she's gone to sleep.

						CUT TO:

EXT. JUDEAN HOUSE - DAY

Jesus' face in grief. He's kneeling over the body of 
Magdalene.

		JESUS
	Magdalene...

The Angel comes into the frame. Jesus gets up and grabs an 
ax. The Angel stops him.

		ANGEL
	Where are you going?

Jesus doesn't answer but starts to walk -- determined. The 
Guardian Angel calls after him.

		ANGEL
	Who are you going to kill, Jesus?

Jesus keeps walking.

		ANGEL
	God. Are you going to kill God?

Jesus stops and looks back.

		ANGEL
	It was God who killed her.

The Guardian Angel holds him in his arms and caresses his 
hair and shoulders as he leads him away.

		ANGEL
	God took her at the height of her 
	happiness. Now she's immortal. She 
	won't see her love fade or her flesh 
	rot away. Can she be happier? I was 
	there the whole time he was killing 
	her and I saw what happened.

They sit on a bench near the house.

		JESUS
	But it wasn't right... it wasn't 
	right for him to kill her.

		ANGEL
	You didn't question God when he let 
	you live. You can't question why he 
	let her die. Be patient. Trust in 
	God's way. Listen, only one woman 
	exists in the world, one woman with 
	many faces. This one falls, the next 
	one gets up. Mary Magdalene died, 
	Mary, Lazarus' sister lives. She's 
	Magdalene with a different face. 
	She's carrying your greatest joy 
	inside her. Your son. Come with me.

The Guardian Angel helps Jesus to his feet. They exit frame.

						CUT TO:

EXT. MARY AND MARTHA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

We are moving in to a close view of their doorway, Jesus' 
and the Guardian Angel's P.O.V. as they approach.

		ANGEL (V.O.)
	This is the way the Savior comes: 
	gradually -- from embrace to embrace -- 
	from son to son. This is the road.

		JESUS (V.O.)
	I understand...

Martha enters the doorway, looks out and sees them.

		MARTHA
	Oh, Mary look!

Mary joins her in the doorway. Both women wear black, as do 
most people in these Bethany scenes.

						CUT TO:

INT. MARY AND MARTHA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jesus enters. The Guardian Angel remains outside.

Mary touches Jesus' chest.

		MARY
	Rabbi, I want to see if it's really 
	you.

		MARTHA
	It's real flesh -- like us. Don't 
	you see? And look, there's a shadow 
	on our doorstep.

Jesus turns and goes to the doorway. From outside, over the 
Guardian Angel's shoulder, we see Jesus approach. Mary and 
Martha remain in the background.

		JESUS
		(to Guardian Angel)
	Come in.

		ANGEL
	Come here.

Jesus leans forward to listen.

		ANGEL
	Master, I'm sorry about Magdalene. 
	I'll never leave you alone again. 
	I'll always protect you. I don't 
	want you to take the wrong road again 
	and get lost.

Martha walks over to them.

		MARTHA
	You must be hungry. I'll cook for 
	you and your friend.

The Angel goes into the home with them.

						CUT TO:

INT MARY AND MARTHA'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)

They all sit around the fire. Jesus cleans his bowl with a 
piece of bread. He smiles at Mary.

		MARTHA
	Rabbi, I like your friend.

		JESUS
		(expansive)
	Nothing was enough for me before. 
	And now look at this. Can you believe 
	it? A small house is big enough for 
	me, some bread, some friends. I'm 
	not going to fight with God anymore. 
	I'm not going to build crosses 
	anymore. I'm going to build cradles 
	and beds.

Mary reaches out to touch Jesus. He takes her hand. Martha, 
noticing this, gets up and leaves quietly. Mary and Jesus 
embrace. The Angel watches.

						CUT TO:

EXT. MARY AND MARTHA'S - DAY

Years have passed. An older Jesus sits out front hewing a 
chair. Two children play nearby.

		ANGEL
	Are you satisfied with me? Do you 
	have any complaints?

Jesus stops working, sets the chair on its' side.

		JESUS
	None.
		(pause)
	I'm ashamed when I think of it.

		ANGEL
	Of what?

		JESUS
	What a twisted road I took to find 
	God.

		ANGEL
	Don't worry. I won't leave you. I 
	like you.

Jesus rests in the sunlight. Martha walks over to them. She 
has been washing clothes.

		JESUS
	Where's Mary?

		MARTHA
	In the olive groves. She won't be 
	back until this evening.

Martha pauses a moment, then takes Jesus' hand.

		MARTHA
		(continuing)
	Let's go inside. It's too hot out 
	here.

Martha goes inside.

		MARTHA
	Come inside.

Jesus looks towards Martha, then the Guardian Angel.

		ANGEL
	There's only one woman in the world. 
	Go inside.

Jesus stands.

		JESUS
		(to the Guardian Angel)
	Watch the children.

The Angel smiles as Jesus enters the house.

						CUT TO:

EXT. BETHANY - DAY

Years have passed. Jesus and Martha return from the market 
with four of their children, ages two through ten. Jesus 
carries the youngest, who is laughing, under his arm, like a 
bundle. The Guardian Angel walks with them.

Ahead, Mary sits in front of the house repairing a dress. 
Two girls play with straw dolls in the dirt beside her.

The two youngest children, boys, race toward Mary. One 
snatches a doll from one of the girls as they race off again. 
Mary scolds them as they go.

From the distance, we hear the SOUND of someone preaching in 
the townsquare. The voice attracts Jesus' attention. He calls 
to his eldest son.

		JESUS
	Don't forget to thank God for the 
	food and make sure you save me some.

		ANGEL
	Aren't you going to dinner?

		JESUS
	I'll be back soon. I want to hear 
	what he's saying.

		ANGEL
	You don't have to go there...

They walk off, arguing in a friendly way.

						CUT TO:

EXT. TOWNSQUARE - DAY

Paul -- who we recognize as the Zealot Saul who killed Lazarus -- 
preaches to a handful of villagers. Standing straight, 
radiating confidence, he speaks with the evangelistic fervor 
of a born-again Christian.

		PAUL
	I used to be a sinner. The worst 
	sinner. I did everything. Whored, 
	drank, murdered. I killed anyone who 
	violated the Law of Moses. Then, I 
	was struck by a burning light and a 
	voice called to me, 'Saul, why are 
	you persecuting me? Why are you 
	against me?' 'Who are you?' I said. 
	'Jesus,' the voice said, and he gave 
	me my sight. I opened my eyes and I 
	was baptized and became Paul. I bring 
	the good news to every country.

Jesus comes closer, the Angel by his side.

		PAUL
	I bring this news. About Jesus of 
	Nazareth. He wasn't the son of Mary, 
	he was the son of God. His mother 
	was a virgin. The angel Gabriel came 
	to earth and put God's seed in her 
	womb. That's how he was born. He 
	took on our sins, he was tortured, 
	crucified -- but three days later he 
	rose again and was taken up to heaven. 
	Death was conquered, praise God! 
	Death was conquered, sins were 
	forgiven and the Kingdom of Heaven's 
	now open to everyone.

Jesus can restrain himself no longer. He calls out:

		JESUS
	Did you ever see this resurrected 
	Jesus of Nazareth? I mean, with your 
	own eyes?

		PAUL
	No. But I saw a blinding flash of 
	light and I heard his voice.

		JESUS
	You're a liar!

		PAUL
	His disciples saw him. They were 
	hiding in an attic with the doors 
	locked when suddenly he appeared. 
	Only one, Thomas, wasn't convinced 
	but he put his fingers in his wounds 
	and gave Jesus some fish, which he 
	ate.

		JESUS
	Liar!
		(to people around him)
	He's a liar!

Disgusted, Jesus turns and walks away. His angel follows.

In the background, Paul comes after him.

Jesus feels Paul's footsteps drawing closer. He's about to 
explode. Suddenly, he turns on his heel, grabs Paul by the 
shoulders and shakes him violently.

		JESUS
		(continuing)
	You're a liar! I'm Jesus of Nazareth. 
	I was never crucified. I never came 
	back from the dead. I'm a man like 
	everyone else. Why are you spreading 
	these lies?

		ANGEL
	Quiet.

		PAUL
	What are you talking about?

		JESUS
	I'm the son of Mary and Joseph, who 
	preached in Galilee. James and John, 
	the sons of Zebedee, were my 
	disciples. We marched on Jerusalem, 
	they brought me before Pilate, but 
	God saved me.

Jesus' Angel doesn't like this conversation; he tugs violently 
at his sleeve. Jesus shoves him aside. Paul takes Jesus around 
a corner where they won't be seen.

		PAUL
	No he didn't!

		JESUS
	Now I live like a man. I have a 
	family. I eat, work, have children. 
	Do you understand what I'm saying? 
	Don't go around the world spreading 
	these lies about me.
		(shouts)
	Because, I'll tell everyone the truth.

Now it's Paul's turn to explode.

		PAUL
	Look around you! Look at these people. 
	Do you see the suffering and 
	unhappiness in this world? Their 
	only hope is the Resurrected Jesus. 
	I don't care whether you're Jesus or 
	not. The Resurrected Jesus will save 
	the world -- that's what matters.

		JESUS
	The world can't be saved by lies.

		PAUL
	I created the truth. I make it out 
	of longing and faith. I don't struggle 
	to find truth -- I build it. If it's 
	necessary to crucify you to save the 
	world, then I'll crucify you. And 
	I'll resurrect you too, whether you 
	like it or not.

		JESUS
	I won't let you. I'll tell everyone 
	the truth.

		PAUL
	Shout all you want. Who'll believe 
	you? You started all this, now it 
	can't be stopped. The faithful will 
	grab you and call you a blasphemer 
	and throw you in a fire.

		JESUS
	No, that wouldn't happen.

		PAUL
	How do you know? You don't know how 
	much people need God. You don't know 
	what a joy it is to hold the cross, 
	to put hope in the hearts of men, to 
	suffer, to be killed -- all for the 
	sake of Christ. Jesus Christ. Jesus 
	of Nazareth, Son of God. Messiah.

Jesus is listening intently now.

		PAUL
		(continuing)
	Not you. Not for your sake.
		(pause)
	I'm glad I met you. Now I can forget 
	you. My Jesus is much more powerful.

Paul returns to the townsquare to preach. Jesus, exhausted, 
dazed, starts back toward his house. The Guardian Angel 
faithfully follows.

						CUT TO:

EXT HOUSE - DAY

At the house, Mary and Martha wait for him. Jesus embraces 
them. His Angel takes his hand. Jesus turns to his "family."

		JESUS
	Don't ever leave me. I'm happy here.

						CUT TO:

EXT. MARY AND MARTHA'S - DAY

Jesus, now in his 50's, sits in the vine arbor beside the 
house. His Guardian Angel, unchanged by time, sits beside 
him. Jesus turns to him:

		JESUS
	Remember when Mary and I planted 
	these vines -- how many years have 
	we been eating these grapes?

		ANGEL
	I don't remember.

		JESUS
		(reflecting)
	In my hands her hair became white... 
	Mary, white... in my hands... she 
	became white.

		ANGEL
	You know, this will all have to pass 
	soon.

		JESUS
	Why? Are you leaving me?

		ANGEL
	Yes. We have to go on. You've grown 
	old. You've done well. We've both 
	done well.

The Angel looks at Jesus who has suddenly aged to his 80's. 
Jesus does not react to this transformation.

Now SOUNDS of yelling and screaming come from the street. A 
woman's WAIL pierces the air. Jesus and the Angel turn to 
look.

Mary and Martha, aged similarly, rush from the house. Jesus 
and the Angel stand.

		JESUS
	What is it?

		MARTHA
	They're burning Jerusalem. The city 
	is destroyed.

		MARY
	The Romans are killing everyone.

Jesus takes them by their arms.

		JESUS
	Let's go inside.

They go inside, but Jesus peers out the entrance. We see 
people running away. CAMERA tilts up to the sky, which is 
red from the flames of Jerusalem. (SPECIAL EFFECT).

						CUT TO:

INT. MARY AND MARTHA'S - NIGHT

Jesus lies dying. He is facing the entrance, in which we can 
see glimmers of the still-burning sky.

Mary and Martha stand close around him. Jesus is in no pain. 
He seems to be at peace.

Suddenly looming in the entranceway, silhouetted against the 
red sky, is the figure of an old man. He starts down the few 
stone steps into the room where Jesus lies. He is followed 
by two other men. The Guardian Angel recognizes them instantly 
and starts toward them.

		PETER
	Let us through. We're sent by God.
		(to Jesus)
	He told us you would show yourself 
	to us. He said you were dying.

		JESUS
	Is that Peter? I can't tell. That is 
	Peter. What happened to you?

		PETER
	The years.

		JESUS
	The years?
		(he points)
	This one I know. No matter how old 
	you get, I know. This is Philip. You 
	were the best of all shepherds, 
	because you had no sheep. They were 
	all in your head.

		PHILIP
	Have I changed so little in all this 
	time?

		JESUS
	Only for the better, I hope.

Jesus points to the mutilated man standing next to Peter. 
The man's face is a mask of injury: he is missing his nose, 
and one eye, and one ear.

		JESUS
	And you? They cut out your eye, your 
	ear. Your face... who are you?

		JOHN
		(bows)
	Rabbi.

		JESUS
	John!

		JOHN
	The Romans tortured me and cut away 
	my face. I saw Jerusalem burn. I saw 
	the Ark of the Covenant taken from 
	the temple.

		JESUS
	The ark?

		PHILIP
	The Temple's destroyed, just as you 
	predicted.

		PETER
	There's somebody else. Outside.

		PHILIP
	Him you'll know. Be careful, he's 
	still angry.

Judas is silhouetted in the entranceway.

		JESUS
	Judas!
		(Judas doesn't answer)
	Judas, come in. Do you hear me? I've 
	missed you so much.

Now Judas advances slowly.

		PETER
	He hears you. He's just not going to 
	say anything.

		JOHN
	He's been fighting in Jerusalem. 
	Look at his hands. There's still 
	blood on them.

		PHILIP
		(warning protectively)
	Judas...

The other disciples stand up.

		PETER
		(reprimanding)
	Judas, the Master is speaking to 
	you. Answer him.

		JUDAS
	Traitor!

Everyone freezes.

		JUDAS
	Traitor. Your place was on the cross. 
	That's where God put you. But when 
	death got too close you ran away, 
	you got scared and ran away and hid 
	yourself in the life of some... man. 
	We did what we were supposed to do. 
	You didn't. You're a coward.

		PETER
	Don't you have any respect.

		JUDAS
	For him? He was supposed to save 
	man. But all he did is save himself.

		JESUS
	No. You just don't understand...

		JUDAS
	Understand? Rabbi, you broke my heart. 
	Sometimes I curse the day I ever met 
	you. We held the world in our hands. 
	Remember what you said to me? You 
	took me in your arms, do you remember? 
	And you begged me. "Betray me, betray 
	me. I have to be crucified. I have 
	to be resurrected to save the world."

The wounds in Jesus' hands and feet begin to bleed.

		JUDAS
		(continuing)
	"I am the lamb," you said. "Death is 
	the door. Judas, my brother, don't 
	be afraid. Help me go through the 
	door." And I loved you so much I 
	went and betrayed you. But you... 
	you... what are you doing here? What 
	business do you have here? With women, 
	with children... what's good for a 
	man isn't good enough for God. Why 
	weren't you crucified?

Judas is crying.

		PETER
	Look at his wounds, Judas. He's 
	bleeding. You're hurting him, that's 
	enough.

		JUDAS
	He was going to be the New Covenant. 
	Now there's no more Israel.

		JESUS
	But my Guardian Angel...

		JUDAS
	Your Guradian Angel! Look at him!

All their eyes turn to the Guardian Angel. As they watch he 
transforms into a death figure in a black monk's habit.

		JUDAS
	Satan.

Judas looks back at Jesus.

		JUDAS
	If you die this way, you die like a 
	man. If you die like that, you deny 
	God. Your Father. Then there's no 
	sacrifice. Then there's no salvation.

Jesus looks over at Mary and Martha, then back at the 
disciples. They have disappeared.

He looks again, and for the last time, at Mary and Martha. 
Now they are gone too.

He is left alone in the room with the death figure.

		DEATH FIGURE
	I told you we would meet again.

Jesus starts to try to pull himself up off the floor. The 
death figure stands in front of him.

		DEATH FIGURE
	There's nothing you can do. You lived 
	this life. You accepted it. It's 
	over now. Just finish it and die 
	like a man.

But Jesus starts to crawl across the floor.

He crawls past the death figure, who watches, turning to see 
Jesus leave through the entranceway.

						CUT TO:

EXT. MARY AND MARTHA'S - NIGHT

Jesus crawls into the deserted street. The village is still.

There is a red glow in the distance: Jerusalem is burning.

He surveys the empty street. Blood still stains his hands 
and feet.

The old man gets on his hands and knees in the middle of the 
road. He lifts his head toward heaven.

		JESUS
	Abba, father, will you still listen 
	to me? Are you still there? Will you 
	listen to a selfish, unfaithful son? 
	I fought you when you called. I 
	resisted. I thought I knew more. I 
	didn't want to be your son. Can you 
	forgive me? I didn't fight hard 
	enough. I want to take your hand; I 
	want to save my fellow men. Father, 
	take me back. Make a feast. Welcome 
	me home. I want to be your son. I 
	want to pay the price. I want to be 
	crucified and rise again. I want to 
	be the Messiah.

						CUT TO:

EXT. GOLGOTHA - DAY

Jesus is back on the cross, 37 years before. The CAMERA tracks 
rapidly up his side stopping on his face.

He has regained his 33 year-old Nazarene form.

All that we have seen since he last cried out in pain has 
taken place inside a second. He finished his cry.

		JESUS
	...lama sabachthani!

Jesus looks around, realizes where he is. The past thirty-
seven years have been a dream. He has resisted the last 
temptation. He looks to heaven and says:

		JESUS
	It is finished.
