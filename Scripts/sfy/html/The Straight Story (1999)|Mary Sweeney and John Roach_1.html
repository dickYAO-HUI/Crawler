1	EXT.--NIGHT SKY

	Autumn evening FULL of STARS. Music plays over
	as credits roll.

					DISSOLVE TO:

2	EXT.--DAY  LAURENS, IOWA

	It is a hot day in early September in Laurens, a small
	rural community in north central Iowa. The main
	drag, all of four blocks, is bookended by a giant
	grain elevator and a John Deere dealership. No cars
	on the road.

					CUT TO:

3	EXT.--DAY  SMALL HOUSE & NEIGHBORING HOUSE

	At the neighboring house, DOROTHY, a rather
	large woman, 50ish, with bleached blond, cropped
	hair is sunbathing in a chaise lounge. She is wearing
	bermuda shorts, a tank top and eye protectors over
	her eyes. Next to her is a small table with a plate on
	it. Out of the other house, which has chipped siding
	and faded, peeling window frames, comes ROSE
	(late 30s, brown hair in a pixie cut, stocky, in jeans
	and a cotton shirt). The door slams and Rose heads
	down the walk. Dorothy doesn't move a muscle or
	remove her eye protectors.

				DOROTHY
		Hey Rose.

	Rose doesn't break stride but yells over...

				ROSE
 		Hey Dorothy.

	Rose exits and we remain on the two houses and
  	Dorothy sunbathing. After a moment, Dorothy
	reaches over and feels the plate next to her. She lifts
	the protectors and checks out the table...sees she's
	out of treats, gets up, grabs the plate and heads into
	her house. As the screen door slams shut behind her
	we slowly move in on the house Rose came from.
	We might be hearing footsteps as we move closer.
	The sound leads us slowly toward the rear of the
	house. As we continue moving closer we hear a short
	peel of rubber followed by a thudding sound and a
	sound like a stick dropping. We hold on the house
	in silence.

 					CUT TO:

4	EXT.--DAY  HOUSE AND NEIGHBORING HOUSE

	As before. Dorothy comes back out carrying the
	plate now filled with treats. Munching all the while
	she settles back into the chaise lounge and resumes
	sunbathing.

 					DISSOLVE TO:

5 	EXT.--DAY  LATER--SMALL TOWN BAR IN LAURENS

 	A small brick storefront bar. Two windows with
	neon beer signs are on either side of a red door with
	a window in the shape of a tilted martini glass. The
	door opens and BUD, a stocky 70ish man in jeans,
	a cotton shirt and construction boots emerges. He
	looks down the street. Not seeing anyone he turns
	and sticks his head back in the door of the bar and
	yells in...

				BUD
		I'm goin' over there.

	He lets the door close and heads off down the street.
	Another man, SIG, late 60's, 6'0", 265 lbs., in bib
	overalls and a seed cap, comes out the bar door
	holding a long-neck beer bottle and watches Bud
	walk away.

				SIG
		We're waitin'.

					CUT TO:

6	EXT.--DAY  LAURENS RESIDENTIAL STREET

	Bud is striding down the street past small and
	weatherbeaten houses. The yards are mowed and
	dotted with lawn chairs and picnic tables. He
	approaches the house we saw earlier. He turns up
	the walkway, reaches the front door and starts
	knocking somewhat angrily.

				BUD
		Alvin! Alvin Straight!

					CUT TO:

7	EXT.--DAY  THE NEIGHBOR'S YARD

	Dorothy doesn't move a muscle when she hears the
	knocking. She yells across the yard to Bud.

				DOROTHY
		Rose left a couple of hours ago.

					CUT TO:

8	EXT.--DAY SMALL HOUSE

	Bud jumps. He hadn't seen Dorothy until she spoke.

				BUD
		Did you hear me hollerin' for Rose? I'm
		not lookin' for Rose.

				DOROTHY
		I ain't seen Alvin today.

				BUD
		Did I ask....

 	Bud stops for a look at Dorothy who still has the eye
	protectors on. He shakes his head in exasperation.
	He resumes knocking on the door.

				BUD
		Straight. ......you're late!!

	Not getting any response he heads around to the
	backyard and finds no one. He goes up to the back
	door and starts knocking.

				BUD (cont'd)
		Alvin?!

					CUT TO:

9	INT.--DAY  KITCHEN

	From inside the darkened kitchen we see Bud
	through the door window, knocking.

				BUD
		What the hell Alvin!

	At a break in his knocking on the door we hear an
	off-camera voice.

				ALVIN
		Come on in Bud.

	Bud, startled, reaches down, opens the door and
	enters. He stands blinking and flustered, letting his
	eyes adjust to the darkened room.

				BUD
		Where the hell are you Alvin? I can't
		see a damn thing.

				ALVIN
		I'm right here Bud...watch your step.

	Bud's eyes adjust and he follows the sound of Alvin's
	voice to the kitchen floor right at his feet. ALVIN
	STRAIGHT is stretched out on the floor. He is in
	his 70s, a lean man, weathered face, bald with a full,
	scruffy white beard. He is wearing a plaid cotton
	shirt, worn jeans and black cowboy boots. There is a
	wooden cane lying on the floor next to him.

				BUD
		What the hell's goin' on? What in god-
		damn hell are you doin' on the floor
		Alvin? What'r ye nuts? You're supposed
		to be down at Davmar's one hour ago.

	At this point a shadow falls on them and Dorothy
	fills the door frame.

				DOROTHY
		What's going on....

	She sees Alvin on the floor.

				DOROTHY (cont'd)
			(panicking)
		Oh my god Alvin!

				ALVIN
			(with resignation)
		Hey there Dorothy.

	Dorothy makes a beeline for the phone, and picks it
	up.

				BUD
		What the hell are you doin'?

 				DOROTHY
			(breathlessly)
 		What's the number for 911?

 	Bud rolls his eyes.

				ALVIN
			(with authority)
		Dorothy, put that phone down.

	She doesn't move. Her face flushed, bosom heaving,
	she looks back and forth between Alvin, Bud and
	the phone. Bud strides over to her and yanks the
	phone out of her hand.

				BUD
		I gotta call the bar and tell them we're
		not comin'.

	Dorothy grabs the phone back, wild-eyed.

				DOROTHY
		Bud Heimstra are you crazy? We have a
		stricken man here.

 	Bud hesitates and looks over at Alvin, assessing his
 	condition.

				BUD
		You stricken Alvin?

 	Dorothy starts dialing.

				ALVIN
		Dorothy, PUT THAT PHONE DOWN!

	Dorothy hesitates. Bud tries to wrestle the phone
	from her. We hear the front door slam and Dorothy
	and Bud freeze. Rose enters the kitchen from the
	front of the house.

				ROSE
		Dad? What's all the.......yelling?

 	She stops short. She takes in the scene...Bud and
	Dorothy at the phone and her dad on the floor.

				ROSE (cont'd)
		What have you...........done to my dad?

				BUD
		Oh for cry aye.

				ROSE
		Dad?..........are you........?

 	Rose starts to cry.

				ALVIN
			(exasperated but forcefully)
		I just need some help gettin' up.

					CUT TO:

10 	EXT.--DAY  PARKING LOT

	We see Rose helping Alvin get out of the passenger
	side of their car. Once standing, Alvin won't move.
	Rose is tugging on his arm. He is not budging and
	he's shaking his head.

				ALVIN
		I'm not goin'.

				ROSE
		Dad.....

				ALVIN
		I'm not goin'.

				ROSE
		Dad....you promised me.

	After a pause Alvin nods.

				ALVIN
		Alright Rosie.

	They slowly make their way across the hot parking
	lot to the Doctor's office.

					CUT TO:

	OMIT SCENES 11, 12, & 13.

					CUT TO:

14 	INT.--DAY  EXAMINING ROOM

 	The nurse and Alvin enter the examining room. She
	turns to him and hands him a robe.

16	INT.--DAY  EXAMINING ROOM

 	Alvin leans against the examining table as he pulls
	his pants to a close and fastens his belt. He is shirt-
	less. His skin hangs loosely off his rib cage. He has a
	serious farmer's tan: lily white chest and shoulders
	and arms with nut brown face, neck and hands. A
	middle-aged DOCTOR GIBBONS is standing
	looking over some notes.

				DOCTOR GIBBONS
		So you're not sure just how long you
		were on the floor?

				ALVIN
			(shaking his head)
		I remember my cane slippin'...and
		losing my balance....
			(he pauses, concentrating)
		...next thing I knew Bud Heimstra was
		banging on my kitchen door.

	The doctor nods at this account and writes something
	in his notes. Alvin sits on the examining table
	and looks around. He takes in the foreign room:
	bright fluorescent lights, slick pastel Formica
	surfaces, matching pastel framed art, bio-hazard
	warnings and medical equipment. He looks back to the
	Doctor and catches the man watching him with a
	look of concern on his face.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		Somethin' the matter Doc?

	The Doctor switches to an attempt at a smile.

  				DOCTOR GIBBONS
		Listen Alvin, sometimes it's my job to
		tell people things they don't want to
 		hear. I'm concerned about you. I think
		you need an operation on those hips.

				ALVIN
		No operations.

				DOCTOR
		Well...this morning you fall and can't
		get off the floor...that's your hips Alvin.
		You'll have to use a walker to get
		around now.

				ALVIN
			(barks)
		No walker.

				DOCTOR
		Fine...a second cane then. You say
		you're not seeing too well. That could
		be a diabetes-related problem. I would
		like to run some...

				ALVIN
 		No!

	The doctor looks back down at his notes and up at
	Alvin.

  				DOCTOR GIBBONS
		I can see and hear that you smoke. I
		would guess you're in the early stages of
		emphysema. And Alvin you have
		circulation problems. I worry about your
		diet and unless you change some things
		quick, there will be some serious
		consequences.

	Alvin doesn't say anything. He just stares at the
	Doctor.

					CUT TO:

17	INT.--DAY  KITCHEN

	ALVIN sits at the kitchen table and takes a deep
	drag off of a Swisher Sweet. Two canes are propped
	up against the table. Rose looks on. She stands in
	the middle of the kitchen holding a birdhouse, fret-
	fully watching Alvin. She holds the birdhouse out to
	him.

				ROSE
		It has a.........red roof.

 	Alvin looks at the birdhouse and smiles at Rose.

				ALVIN
		That's another pretty one Rose.

	He continues smoking. Rose, pleased at his
	response, turns smiling to do a few dishes. She sets
	the birdhouse down.

				ROSE
		I want to paint the.......next roof...
			(she blurts)
		...blue.

	Alvin smiles again.

				ALVIN
		That's a good idea.

	Rose turns to the window and thinks for a while
 	with a smile on her face. As she reflects, her smile
	begins to fade.

				ROSE
		What did the.......Doctor say?

 	Alvin puts out the Swisher Sweet.

				ALVIN
		Said I'm goin' to live to be a hundred.

	Rose smiles at this. Alvin stands, puts on a cream-
	colored Stetson and heads to the back door.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		Time to cut the lawn.

				ROSE
		I can......cut it for......you...Dad.

	Alvin is navigating the door with his two canes in
	hand. Says gently back over his shoulder.

				ALVIN
		I got it sweetheart.

	Rose turns, clears the table and takes dishes over to
	the kitchen sink. Out the window over her shoulder
	we see Alvin cross the backyard and mount a Rehds
	riding mower. She sets the dishes in the sink, then
	gets distracted by the birdhouse.

	talkative. He is wearing a short-sleeve shirt and a tie.
	He's concentrating on his right boot. He frowns as
	he works it up and down with his toes. His attention
	is split between working the shoe and watching
	the Weather Channel which is on the television over
	the counter.

				APPLE
			(all the while

		Looks like another low comin' out of

		And here comes Alvin Straight. He's

				PETE
		Well he took that bad fall.

		An hour late! I found the darn fool on

		How old are you now Sig?

	Apple has his shoe off and is digging inside of it
	with his hand. He looks up at Pete's remark.

				APPLE
		He's 70 in September..."Oh the days
		dwindle down to a precious few..."

				SIG
		You can shut up any time Apple.

	Alvin enters. They turn their heads, nod hello. Bud
	scowls.

				ALVIN
		I love a lightning storm.

				ROSE
		Me....too Dad.

	The phone rings. Rose is reluctant to leave the show
	at the window and lets it ring 3 or 4 times. Finally
	she gets up and leaves the room to answer the phone
	in the kitchen.

				ROSE
			(off camera)
		Hello.........this.......is Rose.
		Yah...yah...Uncle......Lyle?

	Alvin's expression changes to a frown as the light of
	the TV plays off his face. He does not turn his head
	or speak but he is listening and reacting to Rose's
	conversation.

				ROSE (cont'd)
		Oh.......no. When? O.K. Ah..ah...I'll
		tell him. Yah. O.K. bye.

	Rose comes back in and sits down. She doesn't say
	anything and neither does Alvin for a bit. We see

		A tornado has been sited in Ida

	There is Alvin, with two canes, silhouetted in the
	doorway to the kitchen.

				ALVIN
		Rose honey, why don't you come in here
		and join your dad for a cup of coffee.

	Rose looks puzzled. This is not a common invitation
	from Alvin.

				ROSE
		Dad..........we're not going to move
		again are we? You always set me down
		for a coffee when you tell me we are
		going to move again.

	Alvin laughs a little. Rose is clearly wary.

				ALVIN
		No honey...we're not breaking camp.

	Rose sighs in relief and smiles. Alvin pauses, clearly
	uncomfortable.

	From around the side of the house comes Rose hauling

	wrestles with the large board. She is speaking to
	Alvin who is on the back stoop with a wrench and a
	ball joint. She is also reasoning aloud with herself.

				ROSE
		One...Your eyes are bad....That is why
		you don't drive your car because you
		cannot see the signs anymore.

	Rose turns and looks directly at Alvin. He is letting
	her vent.

				ROSE (cont'd)
		One...Your eyes are bad.

	Rose walks back around the corner of the house and
	returns with another large piece of old plywood. As
	Rose enunciates her reasons she ticks them off on
	her fingers.

				ROSE (cont'd)
		Two...Lyle is in Wisconsin which is 317
		miles away. You can't take any bus
		straight to Mt. Zion. You'd have to stay
		overnight in Des Moines....and.....then
		there's no bus to Zion.

	Rose eyes Alvin again. She vanishes around the
	corner one more time. Alvin continues working on
	the ball joint, adding oil to loosen the bolt. Rose
	comes around the corner again.

				ROSE
		Three....Your hips. You can't hardly
		stand for two minutes and when you
		do stand up after you are sitting down
		this is the sound you make when you
		stand... "aaaaaraaaaarrrrhhgggg. " That is
		your arthritis sound.

	Alvin chuckles at her impersonation of him. She is
	almost finished with her tasks. Her talking slows as
	she gets to the last of her rant.

				ROSE (cont'd)
		Four....You are 73 years old. You were
		born when Calvin Coolidge was
		President of America.

	Rose sits down next to Alvin on the stoop. She is
	hot, tired, worried and upset. Her voice almost
	breaks as she finishes her speech.

				ROSE (cont'd)
		You are 73 years old......And I can't
		drive you there.

				ALVIN
		Rosie....darlin'....I'm not dead yet.

	This subdues Rose. Alvin looks at her for a beat,
	turns and moves to a stool with the wrench and ball
	joint. He begins screwing the ball joint to a beam.

	Alvin chuckles and then sets one cane against the

	container and heads back to the counter.

 	Alvin sets the can on the counter. He turns to walk
	back down the aisle.

		You got that right.

	Sig clamps his jaw. Alvin turns back to Pete.

				ALVIN
		Pete, I'd like to buy that from you.

	Alvin points to a contraption used in hardware
	stores to grab things on high shelves. Pete sees what
	he's pointing to and gets a possessive jolt. He turns
	to Alvin.

				PETE
		Jeez Alvin.

				ALVIN
		Well?

 	Pete eyes the grabber. He looks down the aisle to the
	other end of the store where he's got another grabber
	hanging.

				PETE
		I do have two of them...I guess I could

				ALVIN
		Five bucks would seem about right.

				ALVIN
			(considering, not

		OK. Ring her up.

	Pete pulls down the grabber and longingly works it a
	few times and sets it reluctantly down on the
	counter. Alvin smiles. Pete starts ringing up Alvin's
	items.

				PETE
		Three 5-gallon gas cans at $9.89. Two
		Styrofoam coolers...

				ALVIN
		Rosie...sometimes a man likes bein' a

	Rose ponders this notion. A new anxiety creeps in.

				ROSE
		I will be alone......here...

	This stops Alvin. He realizes he hadn't really thought

				BUD
		Oh for da cry eye Alvin.

				APPLE
		Alvin you are gonna get blown right off

		Oh....

 	All three stop and watch as Alvin moves slowly out
	of town.

 		He'll never make it past the Grotto.

44	EXT.--DAY  SAME HIGHWAY

	Alvin passes a farmhouse. A farm wife is hanging
	clothes on a clothesline. She gawks. A boy gawks. A
	dog chases after Alvin. Alvin holds out his hand
	with a wiener in it. The dog sticks with him for
	awhile. We ride along with the two of them for a
	bit. Alvin turns to dog.

				ALVIN
		Go on home now.

	The dog looks a little crestfallen but realizes Alvin is
	right. He wheels and heads back home.

45	EXT.--DAY  SAME HIGHWAY

	A farmer in the field on a John Deere tractor cutting
	third crop hay. The mower and tractor are on in parallel

	Alvin sees a sign that says, "Only Five More Miles to
	The Grotto of West Bend Iowa."

					CUT TO:

47	EXT.--DAY  SAME HIGHWAY

	Alvin is approaching the outskirts of the town of
	West Bend. His reverie is interrupted by a distant,
	building sound. A huge truck approaches and flies
	by Alvin with a deafening roar. It completely rattles
	lawn mower, trailer, and Alvin. Alvin's hat is blown
	off. He has to stop the mower, get out his canes, do
	the slow dismount. He struggles down through a
	ditch into a field. He retrieves the hat, goes back
	down through the ditch. He climbs back up out of
	the ditch onto the road and mounts the mower. Real
	time. Just as he sits down, the tractor dies. Alvin
	hauls himself off the mower again and pops the
	hood. Shaking his head he gets back on the mower.

 	Alvin is sitting on the mower in the same spot. He

	He sits and eats.

					DISSOLVE TO:

49	EXT.--DAY

 	Alvin is sitting on the open back door of the trailer
	looking back down the road. He sees a bus
 	approaching. He waves it down and the bus stops.
	The side of the bus has written large "SUN-RAY
	TOURS."

					CUT TO:

50	INT.--DAY  INSIDE TOUR BUS

	The doors of the bus pop open to reveal Alvin
	standing there with his two canes, wearing his
	Stetson.

				ALVIN
		I'm having some engine trouble.

	The busdriver cranes his neck to look beyond Alvin
	and spies the lawn mower and trailer.

				BUSDRIVER
		What the heck are you driving there.

				ALVIN
		A Rehds.

	The busdriver is puzzled by this answer.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		Can you give me a lift into town?

				BUSDRIVER
		I can get you as far as the Grotto. This
		is the SUN-RAY Tour.

				ALVIN
		I'd appreciate that.

	then turns and snaps a photo of the lawn mower
	and trailer.

 					CUT TO:

54	INT.--DAY  BUS

	Alvin moves down the aisle toward a seat. His canes
	are hanging one from each arm as he grips one seat
	back after another. Some of the women cringe slightly
	as he passes. One old lady leans over to another.

				OLD LADY #1
		My Edward loved his riding mower.

	The bus pulls up to the Grotto, a fantastic, magical
	tourist attraction. The old people begin to get out of
	the bus.

					CUT TO:

56 	INT.--DAY  BUS

	Alvin sits patiently waiting for everyone else to leave
	the bus. People give a variety of looks as they file
	out. Alvin watches them as they walk into the
	Grotto. As the last person disappears through the
	entrance, he stands and slowly exits the bus.

					CUT TO:

57	I/E.--DAY  GROTTO

	Pan of the interior wall of the Grotto. It is a beauti-
	fully detailed structure of pieces of rock and crystal.
	The stations of the Cross are represented on the two
	sides of the interior walls. Alvin sits on a bench in a
	courtyard inside the Grotto looking at what he sees.
	The bench is situated under a spreading oak tree. In
	the background we see the group from the bus with
	the tour guide talking through a megaphone.

				TOUR GUIDE
		...The Pastor of this Catholic Parish
		began his work on the Grotto in 1912
		and continued it until his death in
		1954. All this work you see before you
		was done by hand...

	An old gentleman (WENDELL) breaks from the
	group and approaches Alvin. Wendell is wearing a
	seersucker suit with a bow tie. He is walking with
	one cane. He walks up to Alvin sitting on the bench.

				WENDELL
		May I share the bench? As you can see
		I have a little arthritis myself.

				ALVIN
		Be my guest.

	Wendell sits, gets himself situated and leans forward
	on his cane.

				WENDELL
		This was one fellow who had quite a
		bit of time on his hands.

				ALVIN
		A lot of work.

	The tour guide in the background has made some
	comment which causes all the women to start
	giggling. Alvin and Wendell turn at this.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		So how's it traveling with a hen house?

				WENDELL
		Well I'll tell you. My wife passed away
		in '87. After she was gone I spent a lot
		of time alone. Oh there were women
		who came out of the woodwork trying
		to cook and clean for me. I managed to
		keep myself unattached and they finally
		stopped coming around. Then things
		got pretty quiet. I got to missing
 		things.

				ALVIN
		My wife passed in 1981.

	Wendell nods and they sit quiet for a moment.

				WENDELL
		My daughter tricked me into one of
		these bus trips a couple of years ago. It
		was The House on the Rock if I'm not
		mistaken. A very interesting structure
		that. I was the only man on that bus. It
		was a singular experience.

				ALVIN
		I bet.

	They share a chuckle.

				WENDELL
		I was pleasantly surprised at how much
		I enjoyed all that femininity. I discovered
		how much I missed it. Since then
		I make one of these bus trips every
		other month. I rather enjoy the
		attention.

				ALVIN
		I live with my daughter Rose. Of
		course, it's different from being with
		my wife, but it's a comfort to have a
		woman around.

				WENDELL
		There's not a man born who doesn't
		enjoy being fussed over.

				ALVIN
		You wouldn't a had your way with any
		of these fillies now wouldja?

	Wendell pauses and chuckles.

				WENDELL
		It is a wonder how invigorating a
		tumble with a maiden can be.

				ALVIN
		If there's a maiden on that bus I'll dance a
 		jig.

				WENDELL
			(chuckling again)
 		See those three over there? They're
		Dominican nuns.

 	Alvin begins laughing and Wendell joins in.
	Without rising from the bench Alvin moves his
	feet in a jig. The two fellas laugh again. They hear
	an outburst of giggles from the gaggle of gals and
	look their way. One of the women waves to
	Wendell. He waves back. The two men sit in
	silence for a while.

				WENDELL (cont'd)
		That's an interesting attachment to
		your lawn mower.

				ALVIN
		You mean my trailer.

				WENDELL
		Is that what that is? Why would you
		attach a trailer to a lawnmower?

				ALVIN
		I'm takin' a trip. That's where I bunk.

				WENDELL
		A trip on a lawnmower? That's an
		interesting means of conveyance. A bit
		hard on the hips isn't it?

				ALVIN
		No worse than a tumble with a maiden.

	The two laugh again.

				ALVIN
		It's not too bad. A little rough on the
		dismount.

	They laugh some more. It subsides.

				WENDELL
		And what's your destination?

 				ALVIN
 		Mt. Zion.

 				WENDELL
		Wisconsin?

 				ALVIN
 		Yup.

				WENDELL
		I admire your gumption.

	Two women have broken away from the crowd and
	approach the bench.

				FIRST WOMAN
		Oh Wendell. The tour guide has so
		much to say. We hate to see you miss
		this.

	Wendell turns to Alvin and winks. Woman number
	two reaches down and flicks some lint off of Alvin's
	shoulder. Alvin smiles at her.

				ALVIN
		Thank you.

	The woman blushes. Wendell stands and turns to
	Alvin.

				WENDELL
		Bon voyage my friend.

				ALVIN
		Adios.

	Wendell and the two women walk away.

59	INT.--DAY  LAURENS ACE HARDWARE

 	The Weather Channel is on. The locals all turn their

				SIG
		Told ya that mower wouldn't make it
		mor'n a few miles. Alvin (shakes his
		head), he's got more brass than

				PETE
			(almost to himself)
		Hardly out a full day.

				APPLE
		Least he's not hurt. Old timer like that
		on the road. There's no tellin'.

	Pete, Apple and Sig stand looking as Alvin passes.
	Alvin looks straight ahead.

				WEATHER PERSON
			(off camera)
		...and now for your local forecast.

	Contrary to their previous actions when the local
	forecast is announced, Pete, Sig and Apple do not
 	take their eyes off of Alvin. They walk to the
	window as he passes out of frame. They peer down the
	street after him.

					CUT TO:

60	INT.--DAY  ALVIN'S KITCHEN

 	Rose is sitting at the kitchen table with Dorothy.
	Between them is a large bowl of potato chips and
	they are each drinking a large glass of milk.
	Dorothy's hair is now bright red.

				ROSE
		...so the man in a pick up...he brought
		my...my dad back.

				DOROTHY
		Oh...I must've been at the beauty
		parlor. What kinda pickup?

 	Alvin enters kitchen from inside the house, passes
	by them and on out the back door. He is carrying a
	pump action shotgun under his arm. He has a
	little trouble with the canes, the gun and the back
	door. The gals stop talking until he goes out the
	door.

				ROSE
		A Ford.

	Dorothy's eyes are glued to Alvin as she watches him
	through the kitchen window crossing the lawn.

				DOROTHY
		What's your dad doin' with that gun?

				ROSE
		I.....don't know. My dad...he got
		medals in the war for sharpshootin'....
		But his eyes ain't so good now.

	All through this we see Alvin out in the yard. He
	begins to put his canes down and prop himself up
	against a picnic table.

				ROSE (cont'd)
		Once he shot....a cougar....right
 		out....of a tree....it was up above me
		and my......brother Bobby.

	Through the window we see Alvin pick up the shot-
	gun and raise it to his shoulder. The two women
	unconsciously rise up out of their seats and move
	toward the window to see what is going on. Alvin
	pumps the shotgun and fires. The women can now
	see the target -- the Rehds lawnmower explodes.
	Alvin pumps once more and finishes it off.

				DOROTHY
		Jeez.

61	INT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S LIVING ROOM

	Alvin and Rose are watching the TV news. Alvin is

		My Mexican coins.

				ROSE
		Remember...I was born in New

62	EXT.--DAY  JOHN DEERE DEALER IN LAURENS IOWA

 	Pan across flat Iowa landscape to huge John Deere
	sign. The camera moves down to find a herd of
	the huge, green titans of farm machinery; the John
	Deere tractors. We first see the biggest farm tractors
	John Deere makes, some more than a story tall
	with air-conditioned cabs, CD players and onboard
	global positioning computers. As the camera
	moves the vehicles get smaller, until the shot
	comes to rest on the spanking new John Deere
	Riding Mower, sparkling in the summer sun. As
	the camera rests on the riding mower we see Alvin,
	leaning on his two canes, gazing longingly at the
	mower.

					CUT TO:

63	INT.--DAY  JOHN DEERE DEALERSHIP

 	Two salesmen stand sipping coffee from official John
	Deere mugs. The older man is Tom. He is late 50s,
	greying and stocky and short. A seasoned tractor
	salesman who has seen it all. He is wearing a John
	Deere sports shirt, yellow with green JD logo over
	his breast. With Tom is his young, energetic sales
	rookie, Andy. Andy is a big kid, just off the family
	farm, a little soft but full of sales gumption. He
	works on straight commission. He too is wearing a
	John Deere shirt and hat, which is a bit small for his
	great melon of a head.

				ANDY
		That's the LD 155 right Mr. Hillenbrandt.

				TOM
		As I told ya'...Andy I'd rather ya didn't
		call me "Mister Hillenbrandt." Tom is
		fine. People hear you call me Mister
		and they'll think I've actually become a
		real businessman. Pretty soon they'll all
		be calling me Mr. Hillenbrandt and I'd
		have to sell my implement business and
		move to someplace where folks call me
		"Tom" again.

				ANDY
		Sorry...T...T...Tom...it's just that I've
		been calling you Mister Hillenbrandt
		all my life...

				TOM
		Well you're out of school and a workin'
		fool like the rest of us now Andy and
		you can start usin' first names. And one
		other thing...that's not the LD 155,
		that's the LT 155.

	Alvin enters the showroom, where there are more
	riding mowers.

				ANDY
			(confidently)
		Would you like to me to handle this
		one...Tom?

				TOM
		Sure. It's Alvin Straight. I'm sure you'll
		do just fine Andy.

	Andy walks over to meet Alvin as he enters the door.
	As he leaves Tom ducks his head and leaves the
	showroom. He turns and looks at ALICE, the gray
	haired woman who is his bookkeeper. She crosses
	herself and raises her eyes to the heavens. Alvin is
	looking at another model of riding mower as Andy
	saunters over.

				ANDY
		Good morning. I'm Andy Laufenberg.
		Anything I can help you with today
		sir.

				ALVIN
		Well Andy Laufenberg...I'm looking to
		get a riding mower. I want good
		power -- comfortable ride.

				ANDY
		Well sir this is the one to look at. It's
		the John Deere LT 155....

	Andy nervously reaches for a pamphlet.

				ANDY (cont'd)
		It's got a 15 horsepower Kawasaki
		engine. Cast iron cylin...

				ALVIN
 		Japanese?

				ANDY
			(flummoxed)
		No ah sir...no I'm not. I'm mostly
		Dutch.

				ALVIN
		The engine. Kawasaki. A Japanese
		engine?

				ANDY
		Yessir.

	Alvin grunts.

 				ANDY (cont'd)
		They...the Japanese make a very fine
		engine. The LD 155...

				ALVIN
 		LT.

				ANDY
 		Beg your pardon?

				ALVIN
		LT...LT 155...says here right on the
		side.

 	Andy is flustered and begins fumbling with the
	pamphlet.

				ANDY
		And you're right sir...similar models. By
		Gish that is the LT 155. Same engine
		looks like and...it's...got....air
		cooling...electronic ignition...right here
		with that key....It's got a hydrostatic
		drive transmission.

				ALVIN
		And what would that be?

				ANDY
		Good question and I'm sure I can get
		that answer for you...

	Andy looks over his shoulder to search for Tom.
	Tom and the bookkeeper wave and turn back to
	some papers.

				ANDY
		Well Alvin. Disc brakes on a lawn
		mower. Isn't that something?

				ALVIN
		You're young enough to be my grand-
		son. Proper thing would be to call me
		Mr. Straight. If a buck private called
		me Alvin I made him shovel slop.

				ANDY
		Right Mr. Straight. I'm a bit new at
		this and....and...well--

	Tom crosses the showroom to them. Alvin nods.
	Andy looks relieved.

				ANDY
		Just talking to Mr. Straight here, Mr.
		Hillenbrandt... ah...well...he's interested
 		here in a LT 155.

				TOM
		Mornin' Alvin.

				ALVIN
		Tom.

				TOM
		Alvin the LT 155 runs about $2500
		dollars. What ya lookin' to spend today?

				ALVIN
		Not that much.

				TOM
		Follow me Alvin. Andy, Alice has some
		paperwork you need to fill out.

				ANDY
			(dejected)
		OK Mr. Hillenbrandt.

				TOM
		You did fine Andy. Didn't he Alvin?

				ALVIN
		Pleasure doing business with you Mr.

		Can you follow me around back Alvin? I
		got something that might fit your needs.

 					CUT TO:

66	EXT.--DAY  REAR OF JOHN DEERE DEALERSHIP

	The back lot of the dealership is an elephants'
	graveyard of tractors and implements and parts. If
	the front of the dealership is the color of John Deere
	green, the back is the color of rust. Tom and Alvin
	wind their way through the backlot talking as they
	go.

				TOM
		I set you up with that old Rehds that
		we had the last time didn't I, Alvin?

				ALVIN
		That you did.

				TOM
		That ran about $325. Same price
		range?

				ALVIN
		Generally.

				TOM
		You tradin' in the Rehds today?

				ALVIN
		I don't think so Tom.

	Tom nods. He decides not to ask more on the
	subject.

				TOM
		Pete tells me that you tried usin' the
		rider in an interesting way. Still
		planning to do that?

				ALVIN
		Still planning to Tom.

				TOM
		I know better than to talk Alvin
		Straight out of anything he sets his
		mind to. But I have to tell you Alvin
		that you have always struck me as a
		smart man....

				ALVIN
		That's appreciated.

				TOM
		...Until now.

	Alvin chuckles. They come around a large John
	Deere field tractor and there sitting amongst the
	heaps is an old John Deere riding mower. Strong,
	simple and still green with a golden-yellow, tractor-
	style seat. Alvin looks at it.

				ALVIN
		What year?

				TOM
		'66. Has the Kohler engine. We've used
		it for parts but I always order and
		replace them when they arrive. The
		guts are good.

				ALVIN
		How fast will it go?

				TOM
		'Bout five miles an hour...more down-
		hill. It's got the old transmission.
		Nothing fancy.

				ALVIN
		What are you askin' Tom?

	Tom pauses and sighs. Looks around the lot.

				TOM
		Alvin, we've done business before. I
		know you're an old horse trader from
		way back and I don't much feel like
		sparring with you today. Hard to find a
		price on a riding mower that's near 30
		years old. Your guess is as good as
		mine....I guess I'd just like to ask you
		what you're willing to pay.

	Alvin takes a look at the mower.

				ALVIN
		It's a good machine?

				TOM
		It's a good machine, Alvin.

				ALVIN
		I've got three hunnert and 25 dollars
		Tom. And there's no fiction there.

				TOM
		That sounds fine with me Alvin. Let's
		go and you can settle up with Alice.

 	Alvin is moving down the shoulder and slows to a

	lights up. He sits for a moment and considers the
	landscape around him: a vast expanse of flat corn-
	fields and the road stretching into the horizon ahead
	of him. The mower is idling and there is no other
	sound. He is content.

					CUT TO:

76	EXT.--DAY

	Alvin slows down as he is passing a small woods on
	the side of the road. He comes to a stop and considers
	the woods. He makes his laborious dismount and
	stretches. He goes around back of the trailer, reaches
	in and gets his grabber and a tarp. He heads into the
	woods and begins grabbing some wood. This is no
	simple task since he's walking with the two canes.
	After grabbing a large piece of wood while placing it
	on the tarp, his hand slips off one of his canes. He
	tries to catch himself but falls face down on the
	ground. He doesn't move.

	He reaches out and gets a hold of his canes. With all

	shaking he uses one cane to retrieve the grabber.
	With the grabber he gets the stick that had undone
	him and loads it onto the tarp and drags it over to
	the trailer. He puts the sticks into the back one by
	one. He climbs aboard and pulls back onto the
	shoulder and heads off down the highway.

					CUT TO:

79	EXT.--LATE AFTERNOON  CAMPSITE IN A FARMER'S FIELD

	Alvin pulls off the road onto a dirt track leading
	into a field. He is in the wide open, no trees, no
	farm buildings. He takes a look at the surroundings
	and pulls off the track where the ground is slightly
	higher. He does the slow dismount off the Deere
	and stretches, rubbing his lower back. He goes about
	setting up for the night. He opens the trailer and
	pulls out an aluminum frame chaise lounge and
	some of the firewood he had gathered. He slowly
	gathers twigs & leaves for kindling for the fire. He
	opens up the food locker at the front of the trailer
	and pulls out a few items. He puts a few hot dogs
	and some bread and cheese on a plate. He sits down
	on the camping chair and proceeds to eat with little
	ceremony. It is not quite magic hour.

					DISSOLVE TO:

80	EXT.--MAGIC HOUR  FARMER'S FIELD

	Alvin has built a fire. He sits in his lawn chair
	drinking coffee and smoking a Swisher Sweet. His
	canes are lying across his lap. The night is very quiet.
	Alvin listens to the quiet and the occasional rustle of
	small field animals. He looks to the horizon where
	the sun had set.

					CUT TO:

81	EXT.--MAGIC HOUR

	The sky is royal blue with a band of gold at the
	horizon. Higher up the sky is navy blue and there
	are a million stars as you can only see in a clear
	country sky. Alvin sits back and enjoys his smoke.

					FADE OUT.

					FADE IN:

82	EXT.--DAY  HIGHWAY 18

	Alvin going down the road. He sees a small figure
	up ahead. A car whizzes past Alvin. The figure ahead
	sticks out a thumb. The car passes by. Alvin
	approaches the figure, sees it's a young, tough-
	looking girl CRYSTAL. She has dark hair under a
	baseball cap. Somewhere between 13 and 17 years
	old. Heavy eye makeup, bad tattoo on her shoulder.
	She is wearing a tank top, cut-offs, high-top sneakers
	with tiger-striped laces, and a backpack. Alvin nods
	in acknowledgment as he passes her. She coldly
	returns his gaze.

					CUT TO:

83	EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S CAMPSITE

 	Alvin is eating a raw hot dog. He has built a campfire.

					CUT TO:

84	EXT.--NIGHT  SAME HIGHWAY WIDE SHOT

	Crystal is walking along.

					CUT TO:

85	EXT.--NIGHT  SAME HIGHWAY CRYSTAL'S POV

	Crystal spies Alvin's campfire in the field along the
	road. The lawnmower and trailer are clearly visible
	and she remembers him from the road.

					CUT TO:

86	EXT.--NIGHT  SAME HIGHWAY

	Crystal considers. Her face is unreadable...her inten-
	tions are unclear. She cuts off the road into the field
	and heads toward the campsite.

					CUT TO:

87	EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S CAMPSITE.

	Alvin barely looks up as Crystal walks into range of
	campfire light. Neither of them say anything for
	some time.

				CRYSTAL
		I couldn't get a ride.

	Alvin nods his head. Doesn't say anything for a bit.

				ALVIN
		Hungry?

				CRYSTAL
		Whatya got?

				ALVIN
		Wieners.

				CRYSTAL
		Wieners?

				ALVIN
		Grab a stick and cook one.

	He points to the fire. She hesitates...looks at Alvin for
	a bit longer. Alvin just keeps looking at the fire. Finally
	she looks around, finds a stick and leans toward Alvin
	to take a hot dog. She hunkers down holding the stick
	with the hot dog over the fire. She casts occasional
	glances at Alvin. More silence. She looks over to the
	mower and trailer. Her expression darkens.

				CRYSTAL
		What a hunk of junk.

				ALVIN
		Eat your dinner missy.

	Startled a bit at his abruptness she falls silent. She
	nibbles on her hot dog and then realizing how hungry
	she is she begins to eat faster. She polishes off
	the hot dog. Alvin notices this.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		Get yourself another.

	She's relieved at this offer and gets another hot dog,
	puts it on the stick and holds it over the fire. They
	sit, not speaking, listening to a chorus of crickets
	and peepers.

				CRYSTAL
		How long you been out on the road?

				ALVIN
		I've traveled just about all my life.

				CRYSTAL
		I like being out on the road.

				ALVIN
		It's different for a girl alone.

				CRYSTAL
			(defensively)
		It doesn't have to be different for a girl.

	Alvin just nods his head. Doesn't speak or look at her.

				CRYSTAL (cont'd)
		Where you from?

				ALVIN
		Laurens.

	She nods, and sits quietly.

				CRYSTAL
		You got a wife back there?

				ALVIN
		Nope.

				CRYSTAL
		Kids?

				ALVIN
		My wife Frances brought fourteen kids
		into the world. Only seven made it....
		My daughter Rose lives with me.

	No comment for a while.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		Frances died in '81.

	Quiet for a time.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		Where's your family?

	Now she's not talking.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		You runnin' away?

	She still doesn't answer. Alvin leans back and draws
	on his cigar. He looks at the girl.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		How far along are you?

	Crystal looks away from the fire into the darkness.

				CRYSTAL
			Five months.

	Alvin nods. More quiet. Alvin gets up, walks out of
	firelight with his grabber and comes back with a log.
	He throws it on the fire and works the embers for a
	bit.

				ALVIN
		My daughter Rose that lives with
		me...she's what some people would call
		a little slow. But she's not. She's got a
		mind like a bear trap for facts and
		keeps everything organized around the
		house. She was a real good mom....had
		four kids.

	He pauses looking into the fire. Crystal watches him
	expectantly.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		One night.......someone else was
		watchin' the kids...

					DISSOLVE TO:

88	INT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S KITCHEN

	We see the shot of Rose sitting alone in the kitchen
	that we saw before. She is at the kitchen table smoking
	a cigarette and thinking.

				ALVIN
			(continuing in
			voice over)
		There was a fire. Her second boy got
		burned real bad. Rose didn't have nothin'
		to do with it.

	He pauses.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
			(continuing in
			voice over)
		...but...because of the way Rose is... the
		state said she wasn't comp'tant to care
		for the kids and took them all away.

					DISSOLVE TO:

83	EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S CAMPSITE

				ALVIN
		Not a day passes she doesn't pine for
		those kids.

	Crystal looks away from him into the fire. He looks
	back to the fire, coughs.

				ALVIN
		Well, I'm headin' to see my brother Lyle.

				CRYSTAL
		Huh?

 				ALVIN
		I said I'm goin' to visit my brother Lyle
		in Mt. Zion.

				CRYSTAL
		Where's that?

				ALVIN
		In Wisconsin. Just over the state line.

				CRYSTAL
			(nodding)
		Oh....Cheddar Heads.

	Alvin laughs at this and Crystal smiles, too.

				ALVIN
		Aren't those just about the dumbest
		things you ever saw a person put on
		their head?

	She nods and laughs.

				CRYSTAL
		I hear that's a real party place,
		Wisconsin. Guess I'll never get to find
		out.

	They sit in silence. Alvin looks away from the fire.

				ALVIN
		I haven't seen my brother in ten years.

	Alvin picks up the hot dogs and takes one out of the
	pack. He proceeds to eat it raw.

				CRYSTAL
		You're eatin' a raw hot dog!

				ALVIN
			(smiling)
		I like 'em straight up.

	Crystal makes a face. Alvin munches slowly.

				CRYSTAL
		Ten years is a long time.

	Crystal shivers with a chill. Alvin notices this.

				ALVIN
		There's a blanket in the trailer.

	Crystal leaves firelight. She rustles about in the trailer.

				CRYSTAL
			(offscreen)
		What the hell kind of boom box is
		this?

				ALVIN
		Eight track stereo...watch your god-
		damned language.

				CRYSTAL
			(offscreen)
		Are these videotapes or what?

				ALVIN
		That's music girlie.

				CRYSTAL
		They're huge!.....I never seen anything like
		this.

	We hear some rattling and the sound of the tape going
	in. A sweet Patsy Cline ballad floats out of the trailer
	and into the night air. Smiling, Crystal comes back
	into the light with a blanket around her shoulders.

				CRYSTAL (cont'd)
		Figured it out.

				ALVIN
		Good girl.

	They sit for a while and listen to the music.

				CRYSTAL
		Your brother.

				ALVIN
		Lyle and I had a falling out.

				CRYSTAL
		Over what?

				ALVIN
		I can't say as I recall.

				CRYSTAL
		Well that's pretty stupid. You haven't
		seen him in 10 years because of a fight
		and you can't remember what the fight
		was about?

				ALVIN
		You got some rude habits girl.

	Crystal is taken aback. She is quiet, thinking.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		Maybe I do recall.

	Quiet for a while.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		People do lots of stupid things,
		knowing they're stupid.

	He looks at her. She looks up.

				CRYSTAL
		Sorry.

	They both stare into the fire for a while.

				CRYSTAL
		So why are you going to see him now?

				ALVIN
		He's sick.

	Crystal is poking the fire with the stick. Alvin picks
	up another stick and he starts poking the fire.

				CRYSTAL
		My family hates me. They'll really hate
		me when they find out....

				ALVIN
		You didn't tell them?

				CRYSTAL
		No...no one knows...not even my
		boyfriend.

				ALVIN
		Well that doesn't strike me as fair
		treatment of your people.

				CRYSTAL
		I can take care of my own problems.

	There is a pause as they watch the fire. Then Alvin
	speaks.

				ALVIN
		Don't let pride make you dumb. I
		should know.

	She's listening.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		They may not be happy. But not so
		much that they want to lose you...or
		your little problem.

				CRYSTAL
		I don't know about that.

				ALVIN
		Well a course neither do I but a warm
		bed and a roof sounds a mite better than
		this...eating hot dogs on a stick with an
		old geezer traveling on a lawn mower.

	She giggles a bit and then falls silent. After a
	moment, Alvin stirs.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		When my kids were young I played a
		game with them. I'd give each of them
		a stick. One for each of 'em, and I'd tell
		them to break it. They'd do that easy.
		Then I'd tell them to make one bundle
		of all the sticks and try to break that. A
		course they couldn't. I used to say that
		was family, that bundle.

	Crystal listens in silence.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		Sleep in the trailer if you want. I'll be
		just fine here in my chair.

				CRYSTAL
		No, I'll be fine sleeping out here.
		Looking at the stars helps me think.

	Alvin nods. He begins to struggle to his feet. Crystal
	stands to help him. After a moment of hesitation
	Alvin accepts her arm. He stands, nods, smiles and
	moves slowly to the trailer. Crystal sits down alone
	to watch the fire. We hear the sounds of Alvin settling
	into the trailer. A bit of silence.

				ALVIN
			(from offscreen)
		Sweet dreams.

					CUT TO:

102	EXT.--AFTERNOON  HWY 18 ON THE
	APPROACH TO WEST UNION, IOWA

	Alvin has had to pull into a busy four lane highway
	on the outskirts of a medium-sized city. There is no
 	shoulder as there has been out in the country. The
	traffic is heavy. Drivers pass, some angry, some
	curious. A squad car pulls up behind and turns on its
	lights. Alvin is oblivious.  Frustrated, the POLICE
	OFFICER (young but not a rookie) gets on the
	loudspeaker...

				WEST UNION POLICEMAN
			(very loud)
		Please pull your vehicle off the road.

	Alvin jumps and looks around. He sees the police
	car and pulls into the parking lot of a Computer
	Cosmos store. He sits patiently on the mower waiting
	for the officer. The officer approaches.

				WEST UNION POLICEMAN
		May I see your driver's license sir?

	Alvin looks at the guy and laughs. The officer looks
	off, takes a deep breath.

				WEST UNION POLICEMAN (cont'd)
		Have you been drinking today sir?

				ALVIN
		No sir.

	The Cop thinks for a minute, looks at heavy traffic
	passing by, looks at Alvin, his mower and trailer.

				WEST UNION POLICEMAN
		I'm going to have to ask you to step
		out...uh...get off of the lawn mower, sir.

	Alvin goes into the slow dismount. Officer regards
	this and reaches to assist. Alvin jerks his arm away
	from the officer.

				WEST UNION POLICEMAN (cont'd)
		Sir, would you just walk a straight line for
		me?

	Alvin looks at his canes, looks at the officer and
	proceeds to walk a straight line.

				WEST UNION POLICEMAN (cont'd)
		Sir, can you do that without the canes?

				ALVIN
		Nope, I'll tip over.

	The Cop looks down.

				WEST UNION POLICEMAN
		OK Sir. I don't believe you have been
		drinking but I'm gonna have to ask you
		to stay here at Computer Cosmos for
		another hour or so...just 'til traffic dies
		down. That would be best for you and
		the other cars. Alright?

	Alvin nods and hobbles back to the mower. He
	mounts and the cop watches this. The cop then gets
	into his squad car and takes off.

104	EXT.--DUSK  RED ROAD ON HWY 18

	Alvin is once again on a country road. A car passes
	him. The woman driving gawks at him as she passes.
	Moments later we hear off camera a screech of
	brakes and a heavy thud. We see Alvin react to the
	event up ahead.

					CUT TO:

105	EXT.--DUSK  RED ROAD HWY 18 ALVIN'S POV

	Up ahead a blue Japanese subcompact is parked at a
	strange angle across the shoulder of the road. The
	engine is still running. Smoke rises from the hood.
	The driver car door opens and a hefty woman with a
	bouffant hairdo, stretch pants and a tunic gets out.
	Alvin's POV slow approach. He watches her as she
	walks around to the front of the car, and looks down
	to the ground. She looks up to the heavens and then
	begins pounding her open hand on the top of the
	car hood.

					CUT TO:

 	Alvin reacts to the scene as he approaches.

					CUT TO:

107	EXT.--DUSK  RED ROAD HWY 18

	Alvin drives up to the woman. Alvin executes his
	slow dismount. The woman glances briefly at Alvin
	but barely registers his presence because she is so
	distraught.

				ALVIN
		Can I help Miss?

				DEER WOMAN
		No you can't help me. Jesus, Mary and
		Joseph. No one can help me.

	Alvin moves around to the front of the car. He notes
	that the car has quite a few dents. We see that the
	woman has struck a nice eight point buck. Alvin's
	face shows relief. All the while the woman rants and
	paces.

				DEER WOMAN (cont'd)
		I've tried driving with my lights on. I've
		tried sounding my horn. I scream out
		the window. I roll the window down
		and bang on the side of the door and
		play Public Enemy real loud...I have
		prayed to St. Francis of Assisi...St.
		Christopher too, what the hell! I have
		tried everything a person can do and
		still every week I plow into at least one
		deer. What is it?

	Alvin shakes his head. She now begins walking
	around the car, the mower and Alvin. She flails her
	arms.

				DEER WOMAN (cont'd)
		I have hit 13 deer in seven weeks driving
		down this road mister and I have
		to drive this road every day 40 miles
		back and forth to work. I don't know
		what to do...I have to drive to work
		and I have to drive home...

	She pauses. Takes a deep breath and looks out over
	the flat landscape. She turns and pats the deer carcass.

				DEER WOMAN (cont'd)
		He's dead.

	She starts to cry.

				DEER WOMAN (cont'd)
		And I love deer.

	She turns and climbs back in her car. She backs up
	and sprays gravel as she accelerates away. Her front
	fender falls off and she runs over it. Alvin watches
	her drive away, then looks down at the deer.

	Alvin is driving along a particularly desolate stretch

	slows the mower and brings it to a stop, the engine
	idling. We see Alvin's face tight. He sees something.

					CUT TO:

110	EXT.--DAY  HWY 18 IOWA FLATLANDS ALVIN'S POV

	The Iowa horizon is a large dark mass. An occasional
	burst of light races through the black clouds. A
	breeze blows dirt along the field. Alvin's gaze searches
	for shelter. There are no farms near. He cannot
	outrace the storm. He spots a small outbuilding
	alone in the field. It is an old granary, used by
	farmers to store corn.

					CUT TO:

111	EXT.--DAY

 	Alvin turns off the highway onto a narrow rutted
	field road used only by the farmer to get to his crops.
	It is pot-holed and uneven. Alvin stops at the entry
	to the road. Moving as quickly as he can, Alvin
	secures everything that could blow away on the
	mower and the trailer. Then he mounts the mower
	and races for shelter. As he's heading to the granary
	the sky darkens dramatically and the winds hit.
	He puts his head down into the gust, holds onto his
	hat and lets out a holler, carrying all the speed a
	riding mower can. He bounces across the field and
	closes on the granary. Just as a large crack of
	lightning, rain and the full gust of wind sweep in, Alvin
	makes it into the sanctuary of the granary. A smile
	crosses his face as he revels in the race before the
	storm and the pleasure of watching the thunderstorm
	from beneath a strong roof. He shares the granary
	with a flock of pigeons who have taken shelter
	as well. Alvin sits looking out on the storm, relaxed
	and content on his perch aboard the mower.

					DISSOLVE TO:

112	EXT.--DAY  IOWA COUNTY HIGHWAY

	A warm afternoon. Alvin is making his way down a
	lonely stretch of Iowa highway. The perforated,
	yellow center line passes slowly below him. Suddenly
	Alvin hears a strange, whirring sound. A moment
	later he is startled by a strangely helmeted, goggled,
	bicyclist speeding by him.

				CYCLIST #1
		On your left! Thank you.

				ALVIN
		What the......?

 	Another whir and another cyclist passes.

				CYCLIST #2
		On your left. Thank you.

	And then a trio of cyclists. Another rider approaches
	pedalling a recumbent bicycle.

				CYCLIST #3
		Comin' by on your left. Thank you!

				ALVIN
		What in the hell....?

 	Alvin pulls his rig over to the side of the road and
	watches as a large herd of cyclists, numbering more
	than a hundred riders, engulfs Alvin and his rig.
	One rider slows to gawk at Alvin and nearly causes
	an accident. Other cyclists wave as they churn by...a
	few yell greetings.

	Alvin pulls over for the evening to make camp at a
	county park. Also at the wayside are many of the
	cyclists who passed Alvin earlier. Pup tents abound.
	Riders, dressed in skin-tight, brightly colored spandex
	cycle togs, are spread about the park eating,
	drinking out of squirt bottles, stretching, hydrating,
	swapping massages and just plain preening. Alvin
	pulls into the park. Heads turn as Alvin passes
	through the crowd. A few onlookers begin clapping.
	Alvin, a bit of a showman, doffs his Stetson to even
	more applause. He pulls over to an open patch of
	campground and brings the John Deere to a halt.
	He begins his arduous dismount. A cyclist looks on.

				CYCLIST #1
		That's the same sound we make when
		we dismount.

					CUT TO:

115	EXT.--NIGHT  CAMPSITE

	Some cyclists, mostly younger, are gathered around
	Alvin's campfire and trailer. STEVE is in his early
	30s, an earnest, likable fellow with a neatly trimmed
	beard.

				STEVE
		So you're averaging about twenty miles
		a day?

				ALVIN
		'Bout that. She'll go five miles an hour
		if I push 'er. I stop when my hips start
		barkin'.

	The other talkative cyclist is RAT. He is early 20s,
	bleached cropped hair and he features a smattering
	of tattoos. He talks like a skateboarder.

				RAT
		Wow man, five miles an hour.

	Rat looks up to see a ball flying in his direction. He
	snags it and tosses it back offscreen. He's not exactly
	paying close attention to Alvin.

				STEVE
		So you're thinking about five weeks to
		get to your brother's place in
		Wisconsin?

				ALVIN
		I haven't given it a schedule. That
		would sound about right.

				RAT
		Oh man.....I could not handle five
		weeks on a lawn mower.

				ALVIN
		And I couldn't handle sittin' on one of
		them seats for more'n an hour....if that.
		You all walk like you got a case of
		baboon butt. Seems my ride is a bit
		more comfortable.

	The cyclists laugh. Rat catches the ball again.

				RAT
		So why the lawnmower?

	Rat tosses the ball.

				ALVIN
		Can't drive. My eyes. Don't like other
		people drivin' me where I want to go.

				RAT
		I can totally dig that.

	Alvin smiles and rises to get more firewood. Steve
	notices the difficulty he has walking and gets up to
	help.

				STEVE
		Can I ask how old you are Alvin?

				ALVIN
		Seventy-three.

				RAT
		Oh man. Seventy-three years old. Bad
		eyes, bad hips.

				ALVIN
		Eyes, hips....diabetes....circylation.
		Can't hardly believe it myself. I'm older
		than I ever thought I'd be.

	Two young spandex-clad women walk by. Alvin follows
	them with his eyes.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		You don't think about old age when
		you're young. Shouldn't.

				STEVE
		When d'ya know you're getting old?

	Alvin stirs the fire.

				ALVIN
		The first time I felt old was when I saw
		a buddy die in the war. I got old that
		minute.

	The group around the campfire is silent for a while.

				STEVE
		There must be something good about
		getting old.

	Alvin ponders a moment, stirring the fire.

				ALVIN
		Hard to imagine anything good about
		goin' blind and lame at the same time.
		But still...at my age...you've seen most
		everything life has to dish out. You can
		separate the wheat from the chaff. You
		know to let the small stuff fall away.

				RAT
		Cool man.

	Rat snags the ball one more time. Someone offscreen
	yells

				BIKE RIDER
			(offscreen)
		Sally's in my tent.

	Rat laughs and throws the ball back. Still smiling
	and looking off...

				RAT
		What's the worst thing about being old
		Alvin?

	Alvin stirs the fire. The embers rise on the flames.
	Alvin watches the embers float up into the night sky
	and stars.

				ALVIN
		The worst thing about being old is
		remembering when you were young.

	Again the group around the fire falls silent. They
	listen to the night sounds.

					FADE OUT.

116	EXT.--DAY  HWY 18

	Alvin is moving out of the prairie and approaching
	the Mississippi Valley terrain. Corn is being harvested
	in the fields and the leaves have begun to turn

	does the mower begins to show signs of strain. He
	pulls off the road half way up one of these gentle
	hills to lash his shift lever into low gear.

117	EXT.--DAY  CLERMONT, IOWA HOUSE ON FIRE

	Close shot of an inferno. A house is burning down.

					CUT TO:

118	EXT.--DAY  CLERMONT, DANNY RIORDAN'S FRONT PORCH

 	Five people are sitting in aluminum chairs sitting
	watching the fire. They are drinking beer. They do
	not seem alarmed by the house burning down across
	the street.

					CUT TO:

119	EXT.--DAY  CLERMONT IOWA

	Wide shot reveals that volunteer firemen are burning
	down the house as a firefighting exercise.

					CUT TO:

120	EXT.--DAY  DANNY RIORDAN'S FRONT PORCH

	Everyone is clearly enjoying watching the house
	burn down and the firefighters scurry about.
	DANNY RIORDAN is the owner of the house on
	whose porch everyone is gathered. He is mid-50's
	shortish and stocky, and wears khaki bermuda shorts
	and a Hawaiian print shirt. His wife DARLA
	RIORDAN is of similar build and age and has a full
	head of blond, bouffant hair. She wears white capri
	pants and a bright yellow shirt. Their friends
	JOHNNY AND JANET JOHNSON and VERLYN
	HELLER have joined them for the festivities.
	Johnny and Janet are about the same age as Danny
	and Darla and have known each other since high
	school. They all have a strangely youthful air about
	them. Johnny and Janet are both very quiet, small
	and neat. Verlyn is quite a bit older and a farmer.
	He is very tan and rugged looking. At the same time
	he bears a certain air of refinement.

				DARLA RIORDAN
		Criminy sakes alive. You can feel the
		heat all the way over here.

				JOHNNY JOHNSON
		Makes you appreciate what a volunteer
		fireman has to do.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		That Rumelthanger place was an eyesore.

				DARLA RIORDAN
		Remember old man Rumelthanger?
		What a dirty old cur...never bathed.
		The smell that came off that man. I tell
		you, it was enough to make a girl faint.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		You always had an inclination to faint
		Darla.

	Darla blushes at this.

				JANET
		You know. There really is something
		about watching a fire that causes you to
		sort of go off...like it's hypnotism.

				VERLYN
		Time was when all civilization did was
		stare at the fire.

	They are happy. It's like the fourth of July and they
	are all feeling like kids watching a house burn down
	on a warm autumn afternoon. Shouts of volunteer
	firemen in the background.

					CUT TO:

121	EXT.--DAY  BURNING HOUSE

	Shots of firemen battling the blaze. A small crowd
	has assembled next to the house to watch the show.
	The firemen turn and wave to the assembly. A wife
	is taking pictures. We hear a clattering sound
	intrude upon the scene. It is not coming from the
	fire.

					CUT TO:

122	EXT.--DAY  RIORDAN'S FRONT PORCH

	Darla's attention is drawn from the fire by the
	rattling sound. She looks up the hill.

				DARLA RIORDAN
		What's that noise?

 	One after another they turn their heads to the
	direction of the hill.

				VERLYN
		Now what in the sam hill do you suppose...

	Down the hill, barely under control comes Alvin on
	the mower.

				JOHNNY JOHNSON
		What on earth....?

				DARLA RIORDAN
			(to Danny)
		Honey bun...is that a lawnmower?

				JANET
		It's going too fast for a lawnmower.
		Isn't it Danny?

				DARLA RIORDAN
		And what on earth is drivin' that
		thing?!

 					CUT TO:

123	EXT.--DAY  CLERMONT HILL ALVIN ON MOWER

	Alvin is barreling down the hill, foot stamping on
	brake, no response. The steering becomes more difficult.

 					CUT TO:

124	EXT.--DAY  RIORDAN'S FRONT PORCH

				VERLYN
		That sure as hell is a lawnmower....
		with an old Indian on top.

				JOHNNY JOHNSON
		He doesn't look like he has that thing
		under control.

				DANNY RIORDAN
			(he begins heading over
			to the scene and over
			his shoulder he adds)
 		...nothing runs like a Deere.

	Wide shot of Alvin careening down the hill, picking
	up even more speed.

					CUT TO:

126	EXT.--DAY  ALVIN'S POV

	The road moves back and forth. Burning house fast
	approaching. Look to road bed flying by beneath the
	mower. This is much faster than Alvin or the mower
	has ever gone.

					CUT TO:

127	EXT.--DAY  CLERMONT HILL ALVIN ON MOWER

	Alvin picks up speed. His hat threatens to blow off.
	Water is streaming from his eyes. Amazingly he
	makes it to the bottom of the hill without rolling
	the machine. As he comes to a stop the front porch
	gang reaches him.

					CUT TO:

128	EXT.--DAY  BOTTOM OF THE HILL

	Alvin is sitting on the mower catching his breath
	and composure. He wipes the tears from his cheeks.
	Some of the volunteer fireman turn their attention
	from the burning house to the activity at the bottom
	of the hill.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		Mister are you O.K.?

	Alvin is a little shaky. Nods in answer to Danny's
	question.

				JOHNNY JOHNSON
		Jeez Mister you're lucky she didn't roll
		on you.

				ALVIN
			(a little short
			of breath)
		I think the belt's shot.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		I wouldn't be surprised. You don't have
		brakes on that trailer do you?

 	Alvin shakes his head.

 				DANNY RIORDAN (cont'd)
		Mister I worked for John Deere for
		thirty years so I can tell ya you shouldn't
		be hauling a rig like that behind a
		riding mower. At least not down a hill
		like that.

	Alvin doesn't really respond. Danny softens a little.
	Considers the situation.

				DANNY RIORDAN (cont'd)
		I'm Danny Riordan.

	He extends his hand. Alvin reaches out.

				ALVIN
		Alvin Straight.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		Well Alvin...let's get you and this rig off
		the road and see what the damage is.

	Alvin goes through the slow dismount under the
	watchful eyes of Darla and Janet. Danny and Verlyn
	start to push the mower and trailer and are joined
	by a couple of the volunteer fireman. Alvin brings
	up the rear, moving slowly.

					CUT TO:

129	EXT.--DAY  BEHIND RIORDAN'S HOUSE

	Guys are pushing Alvin's rig into the backyard. They
	roll to a stop alongside a small separate garage.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		Well let's have a look at this mower.
		This is what? '65 ...'66?

				ALVIN
		'66.

	Danny is looking under the hood. He notices a
	small pool of oil forming under the mower.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		Well I can tell you right now Alvin you
		won't be going anywhere tonight. Aside
		from your drive belt being busted,
		you've got transmission problems.
		Where were you hoping to get to?

				ALVIN
		Mount Zion.

				DARLA RIORDAN
		Mount Zion, Wisconsin? Past Prairie
		du Chien?

				JOHNNY JOHNSON
		That's 60 more miles of hills.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		That's across the Mississippi. What's in
		Mount Zion Alvin?

				ALVIN
		My brother lives there.

				JANET
		Why didn't you take your car?

				ALVIN
		Don't have a driver's license.

				DARLA RIORDAN
		Couldn't your brother come to visit
		you?

				ALVIN
		He's had a bad stroke.

				VERLYN
		Where are you coming from?

				ALVIN
		Back a piece.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		West Union?

				ALVIN
 		Nope.

				JOHNNY JOHNSON
		Hawkeye?

	Alvin just shakes his head.

				DARLA RIORDAN
		Not New Hampton. You didn't come
		that far?

 	Alvin gets a small smile.

 				ALVIN
 		Nope.

	Janet jumps in thinking she's got it.

				JANET
		Mason City!

	Alvin shakes his head again.

				VERLYN
		You've come a long way haven't you?

	Alvin looks at Verlyn and nods.

				ALVIN
		Yes I have. From Laurens, Iowa.

				DARLA RIORDAN
		Laurens?

				VERLYN
		That's west of the Grotto. How long
		have you been on the road?

				ALVIN
		What's the date today?

				JOHNNY JOHNSON
		October 8th.

	Alvin thinks for a minute. Counts on his fingers.
	Looks up.

				ALVIN
		5 weeks. I left Laurens on September
		5th.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		You been bunking in that?

	Alvin points his thumb over his shoulder at the trailer.

				ALVIN
		That's my rolling home.

	They all swing their heads and look again at the
	trailer. Darla and Janet look at each other. They
	share a "Holy Cow" look.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		Where've you been settin' up camp?

				ALVIN
		In the fields. I'd just pull off the road
		every evening. I don't travel at night.

				DARLA RIORDAN
		Weren't you scared staying out there
		alone at night? There's a lot of strange
		people everywhere now.

				ALVIN
		Ma'am, I fought in the trenches in
		World War II. Why should I be scared
		in an Iowa cornfield?

				DANNY RIORDAN
		Well why don't you bivouac right here
		in our yard tonight? We got a bathroom
		out here in this garage you can use.

				ALVIN
		I appreciate that. I believe this machine
		is in agreement with you.

					CUT TO:

A130	EXT.--LATE AFTERNOON  RIORDAN'S YARD

	Alvin, Danny and Darla are rigging up a lean-to of
	plastic tarp and tree limbs. The lean-to extends out
	from the garage.

				ALVIN
		Sure is nice of you folks to help me with
		this.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		Well...there's a lot of rain in the
		forecast and you don't want to be stuck in
		your trailer.

	Darla is on a stepladder attaching a red wooden
	fish to the top of the post.

				DARLA RIORDAN
		I do a little woodwork art. I thought
		you might like some fish on your tent.

				ALVIN
		My daughter Rose builds birdhouses.

134	EXT.--DAY  RIORDAN'S BACKYARD

	Four men are standing around looking at Alvin's
	mower: Danny, Alvin and two guys from the local
	John Deere dealer. HARALD AND THORVALD OLSEN
	(they are both tall and skinny with big
	adam's apples. They have bright blue eyes and very
	ruddy red cheeks. They are prematurely bald). They
	are twin brothers and bicker like an old married
	couple. Can't agree on anything.

				HARALD
		I tell you Thorvald it's a '65 John
		Deere 110.

				THORVALD
		It's a '66 Harald. I fixed one just like it
		three years ago. That was a drive belt too.

				HARALD
		'65.

				THORVALD
		'66!

				DANNY RIORDAN
			(to Alvin)
		They're twins. Siamese, separated at the
		opinion.

	Alvin chuckles.

				DANNY RIORDAN (cont'd)
		It's a '66. Ask Mr. Straight.

	They both look to Alvin. Each of them still sure
	they're right.

				ALVIN
		'66.

	Harald kicks the ground. Thorvald smirks. Blows his
	nails and shines them on his shirt.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		So Olsens. How bad is it?

				ALVIN
		I can't be dawdlin' here. I gotta get
		back on the road.

	The twins look at the lawn mower and then at each
	other. Thorvald turns back to Alvin who is waiting
	expectantly.

				THORVALD
		Well you know about the transmission.
		The belt is shot, you blew a head gasget,
		you're in bad need of oil, and your
		right side tires are bald.

	Alvin takes this in.

				ALVIN
		Is that all?

				HARALD
		Well it wouldn't be a bad idea to
		remove the blade assembly...As best as I
		can tell ...you're not mowin' any lawns.

135	INT.--DAY  RIORDAN'S KITCHEN.

	Darla is kneading bread. She is up to her elbows in

	and sits down at the kitchen table. He lights a
	cigarette. There is a small TV on the kitchen counter.
	The Weather Channel is on.

				DARLA RIORDAN
		Storm rollin' in.

	Danny sits lost in thought. He doesn't react to her.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		It's going to cost him a bundle to fix
		that mower. I don't think he's got that
		kinda money.

				DARLA RIORDAN
		Mmmm.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		I wouldn't drive that old thing to
		Excelsior. It's a lawn mower for god's
		sake.

				DARLA RIORDAN
 		Mmm Hmmm.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		He was damn lucky he made it to the
		bottom of that hill. He could've been
		killed. Easily coulda' been killed.

				DARLA RIORDAN
		Yah. Ah huh.

 				DANNY RIORDAN
		He's none too strong. Did you see how
		he can't walk without those canes?

				DARLA RIORDAN
			(still kneading)
		Uh uh.

 				DANNY RIORDAN
		The hills just get worse the closer you
		get to the Mississippi.

	Darla stops kneading her bread and smiles. With
	dough up to her elbows she walks over to Danny
	and kisses him on the forehead.

				DARLA RIORDAN
		Go ahead and drive him honey. Mt.
		Zion can't be a half day. That's fine.

	Darla goes back to her dough as Danny keeps
	thinking.

				DARLA RIORDAN (cont'd)
		....You're a good man Danny Riordan
		....That's why I married you despite

		Sure, sure. Come on in.

		If it's all the same to you I was

		without a cord.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		The door's wide open...come on in.

				ALVIN
		I can talk from out here.

	Danny smiles, goes back in and returns with a

				DANNY RIORDAN
		Here you go. You're more than welcome
		to sit down at the kitchen table.
		Darla and I can leave the room if you're
		lookin' for a little privacy.

				ALVIN
		Thank you. Out here's just fine.

	Alvin turns and starts to hobble away. Danny is
	starting to shut the door. Alvin turns back to him.

				ALVIN
		What area code am I in? I don't think
		this is 712 anymore.

		No it isn't Alvin, that hill rolled you

	She puts the phone down, puts down the birdhouse
	which she has been holding through the

		Mind if I join you?

				ALVIN
		You'd be a guest in your own yard.

	Danny goes off, comes back with an aluminum

	lounge.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		I talked to the Olsen twins and they
		estimate it will cost you around
		$250.00 to get this mower running

				ALVIN
		That's twice what it oughta be. Must be

	Danny smiles at this.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		You know I'd be happy to drive you the
		rest of the way to Mount Zion.

	Alvin starts shaking his head.

				DANNY RIORDAN (cont'd)
		It'd be a nice Sunday drive for me and
		Darla. We enjoy crossing the river.
		Especially with the trees in color.

				ALVIN
		I appreciate the offer friend. I'd like to
		finish this my own way.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		Even if you fix your mower there are
		hills bigger than Clermont's between
		here and Zion. There's no guarantee
		that your machine won't break down
		again. In fact I'll guarantee it will.
		Alvin, this machine was meant to go
		across a lawn, not the state of Iowa.

				ALVIN
		You're a kind man talkin' to a stubborn
		man. This is a trip I'd like to finish.

	Danny resigns to Alvin's decision. Lights up a
	cigarette.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		Well then let me give you a loan for the
		repairs.

				ALVIN
		Well that is generous. And if I needed
		that help I'd take it. But I phoned to
		have money sent to me. I gave my
		daughter your address. I hope that's
		O.K.

	Danny knows better than to argue with the proud
	man about money.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		Well then Alvin you'll stay right here in
		our yard until you're ready to go. We
		enjoy your company.

				ALVIN
		I'm thankful for that.

		Oh excuse us Alvin. We were just

	from the cab. As he approaches Alvin, both men
	watch the women walk into the rear of the Riordan
	house. Verlyn reaches the trailer with a smile on his
	face.

				VERLYN
		Janet give you a plate of her brownies?

	Alvin chuckles at this and reaches behind him into
	the trailer. He pulls out the plate of brownies. He
	holds it out to Verlyn.

				VERLYN (cont'd)
		Well how about that timing. Janet

	Alvin joins in and they say in unison:

		Chocolate chips.

				ALVIN
		Huh?

				VERLYN
		The secret ingredient...no one's
		supposed to know.....chocolate chips.

	Alvin takes a brownie too and the two men enjoy
	the delicious experience together. There is a brief,
	comfortable silence between them.

				ALVIN
		You've had enough rain this summer,
		have ya?

				VERLYN
		Put up third crop hay last week.

				ALVIN
		Dairy farm?

				VERLYN
		Beef. I got too old for milking and

				ALVIN
		I worked cattle in Montana. Back when
		it was all by horse. Before the war.

				VERLYN
		Army?

				ALVIN
			(looks off)
		Infantry. Third Corps.

				VERLYN
		Under Bradley. I was Second Corps.

	Another silence. Alvin offers Verlyn a Swisher Sweet.
	Verlyn accepts.

				VERLYN (cont'd)
		I been out on errands and I'm headin'

	Alvin ponders the offer briefly.

		Sittin' a little higher and goin' a little
		faster.

				VERLYN
		Wait'll I get 'er over thirty.

	They both chuckle.

					CUT TO:

158	INT.--DAY  CLERMONT BAR

	Alvin and Verlyn at the bar. The Weather Channel is
	on the television over the bar. There are some local
	farmers in the place. There is a cribbage board at a
	table. Old timers are slapping cards on the table.
	Verlyn is drinking beer. Alvin is having a glass of
	milk.

				VERLYN
		I can still have my beer but I can't
		drink the brown stuff anymore.

	Alvin nods with understanding at this comment.

				ALVIN
		I picked up a mournful taste for liquor
		in France.
			(shaking his head)
		When I came back I couldn't drink
		enough of it. I wasn't worth a stick of
		stove wood. Mean. A preacher helped
		put some distance between me and the
		bottle. He helped me see that I was
		drinkin' because some of the sights I
		was still seein' from over there.

	Verlyn nods. Takes a sip of beer. Looks straight
	ahead at the back bar.

				VERLYN
		Lot of men came back drinking hard.
		My brother Dewey did that. Spent
		most of his adult life drinking from
		noon on. He was an awful sweet drunk
		though.

	Alvin takes this in. Nods quietly.

				ALVIN
		Everyone trying to forget. I can see it
		still in a man right away.

	Verlyn looks quickly at Alvin.

				VERLYN
		Yup.

				ALVIN
		It was one hard day after another hard
		day all strung together.

				VERLYN
		Yeah.

	The bartender comes over. Verlyn orders another.
	The bartender looks to Alvin who is nursing his
	glass of milk.

				ALVIN
		No, I'm good thanks.

	The bartender moves down the bar. Alvin and
	Verlyn sit in silence. Verlyn is peeling the label off
	of his long neck bottle. He is really concentrating on
	this process.

				VERLYN
		There was this one time...We were just
		...waiting on our first warm meal in ten
		days.

 	Verlyn looks up quickly at Alvin in the mirror on
	the back bar to see how he's reacting. Alvin just
	looks into his milk glass but doesn't stop him.

				VERLYN (cont'd)
		...We thought we'd seen the worst.
		They hadn't given us much trouble
		from the air.

	Verlyn takes another drink of beer. He stops working
	on the label. He looks straight ahead at the back bar.

				VERLYN (cont'd)
		I was on a rise with the quartermaster
		working on more coffee for me and my
		buddies. A stray Focke-Wolf comes
		over the treetops and drops an incendiary
		right on the mess tent...all my
		buddies...

		The Kraut banks right in front of me
		on that hill and......I can (he pauses and
		the memory becomes the present) see
		the Iron Cross...(suddenly unable to
		speak...he tries in a choked
		voice)....right in front of me (composes
		himself, shaking his head)....

	There is silence. Alvin gives Verlyn time to set
	himself.

				VERLYN (cont'd)
		Then I look...I couldn't tell which of
		my buddies it was burnin' up down
		there.

	Verlyn can barely finish his story. Alvin is very still
	and quiet. Verlyn has collected himself and looks
	quietly to the mirror of the back bar.

				VERLYN (cont'd)
		"...Swept with confused alarms of
		struggle and flight,

		Where ignorant armies clash by night."

	Verlyn looks down, slightly embarrassed at his
	speech. Alvin thinks about what he's heard. He starts
	with his own story.

				ALVIN
		There is a thing I can't let loose..... All
		my buddies faces are still young...

		The spirit of the thing is that the more
		years I have... the more they lost.
		And... it's not always a buddy's face I'm
		seein'. Sometimes it's a German face. By
		the end we were shooting moon-faced
		boys....

	Alvin takes a sip of milk and draws a deep breath.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		I was a sniper. The way I grew up...you
		learn how to shoot huntin' for food.

	Alvin stops. He's not sure if he's going to continue.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		They'd post me up front, damn near
		ahead of the line. I'd sit still
		forever.

		Amazin' thing what you can see just sittin'.
		I'd look for the officers...or their
		radio guy or artillery spotter...
		Sometimes I'd sight a gun nest by the
		smoke and fire into that. Sometimes it
		was just movement in the woods.

	Alvin pauses.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		We had a scout. Small guy. Name of
		Kotz. He was a Polish fella from
		Milwaukee. He would always take
		recon and he was good. We went by his
		word and he saved our skins more'n
		once. A short fella.

	Alvin sets both hands palm down on the bar. He
	looks hard at his hands.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		We had broken out of the
		hedgerows...made a run across the open
		when we come upon a woods an' started
		drawin' fire. I took my usual spot. I
		saw some movement real slow like. I
		waited for ten minutes and it moved
		again. I fired. The movement stopped.
		We found Kotz the next day. Head
		shot. He had been movin' back toward
		our lines. Everyone in the unit thought
		he was taken by a German
		sniper...everyone all these years.
		Everyone but me.

	Alvin and Verlyn sit real quiet for a while. Verlyn
	shifts on his stool...shakes his head.

					FADE OUT.

					FADE IN:

159	EXT.--NIGHT  RIORDAN'S HOUSE

	Alvin is sitting in his chaise lounge having a smoke.
	It is night time and he is sitting without a fire in the
	dark.

					CUT TO:

160	EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S POV OF THE SKY

	A crisp, star-filled sky.

161	EXT.--NIGHT  RIORDAN'S HOUSE

	Alvin looking up at the stars...pain in his face.

					FADE OUT.

					FADE IN:

162	EXT.--DAY  DANNY RIORDAN'S BACKYARD

	Danny and the two Olsen brothers are fixing the
	mower. Alvin looks on.

				HARALD
		You can work all day and you won't get
		that piece off with that wrench.

				THORVALD
			(from beneath the mower)
		Danny, did you hear me ask
		Wisenheimer there for his advice on
		how to fix a riding mower?

				HARALD
		Fine. Then we'll all just stand here and
		wait for Mr. Wizard to finish...Anyone
		got a deck a cards?

				THORVALD
			(still beneath)
		Very funny Harald. If it was you
		underneath here we could all go home
		and wait for winter. Then we could just
		put the snowplow on this rig.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		Jeez you two can bitch. I heard you
		about killed each other last week over
		horseshoes at the Dew Drop.

	Harald gets a mad look on his face.

				THORVALD
			(up from beneath)
		See Harald...brainiac...I got the mower
		assembly free with this little old wrench
		here you said wouldn't work...Well I'd
		say it worked pretty good, wouldn't
		you? Help me slide'er out here and we
		can settle up.

	They slide out the mower assembly. Thorvald steps
	back, wiping the oil off his hands. Harald is pulling
	out the bill. He reads off of it.

				HARALD
		I got the labor and parts coming to
		$247.80.

	He hands the bill to Alvin. Alvin scans it. He looks
	up at them.

				ALVIN
		That's a little heavy for light work.

	The Olsen brothers are a little taken aback by this.
	Alvin moves over to the mower and starts a slow circle
	around it.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		Now I got old man's eyes...

	He reaches down and runs his hand along the treads
	of the tires.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		...but I was noticin' these new tires......

	Danny is starting to enjoy himself. He crosses his
	arms and smiles at the Olsens.

				HARALD
		Well, now we did take them off of a
		resell, but the treads are good.

	Alvin, still caressing the treads gives him a long look
	from under the brim of his Stetson.

				ALVIN
		Friend, are you chargin' me good or are
		you chargin' me new?

				HARALD
		Uh, (turns to his brother) Thorvald?

				THORVALD
		Well I guess we can make an adjustment
		there.

	Danny pulls up a lawn chair and lights a cigarette.
	Hunkers down for the entertainment.

				ALVIN
		I figure that adjustment to be about
		$30.00? Is that what your pencil's
		sayin'?

				DANNY RIORDAN
		Sounds right to me.

	The twins give Danny a dirty look.

				ALVIN
		Now about that labor. I'm agreeable
		that you boys have put some real time
		in on this job. But a man's gotta ask
		when he workin with twins, especially a
		bickerin' pair, how much workin' was
		fightin'.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		You got that right.

				THORVALD AND HARALD
			(in unison)
		Shut up Danny.

				ALVIN
		If I were to judge from the joyous affair
		I've seen today I would calculate a 20%
		discount on the labor charge.

	Thorvald and Harald exchange a look

				THORVALD
		Anything else mister.

				ALVIN
		Now I'm not from these parts exactly
		but where I come from this is a mighty
		rich charge on a can of Iowa oil.

	Thorvald and Harald can not believe this old fart.

				THORVALD
		Take the oil. No charge.

				ALVIN
		Well that's a splendid offer that I very
		much appreciate. Now what's your tally?

	Danny turns grinning to the twins. They are slightly
	befuddled.

				HARALD
		Uh...uh.

	Looking at Thorvald who shrugs.

				HARALD (cont'd)
		...uh...$180.00 even?

				ALVIN
		Done.

	Sticks out his hand which each of the twins takes
	in confusion. Alvin brings out the money, and pays
	the twins. They see that he has 4 c-notes in his
	wallet.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		Now it's thanks to you boys that I can
		get back on the road.

	Alvin stuffs the change in his wallet and puts the
	wallet back in his pocket.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		I drove this rig across Iowa. I'm hopin'
		it'll hold into Wisconsin...

	Alvin looks up at them.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		...that's where my brother lives. Haven't
		seen him in ten years.

	Alvin looks at the Olsen brothers. They squirm
	under his gaze.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		No man knows your life better than a
		brother near your age. He can know
		who, and what you are best than most
		anyone on the earth.

	He stops for a moment. Looks hard at the Olsens.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		My brother and I said some unforgivable
		things last time we were together. I
		want to put those times behind us.
		This trip is just one hard swallow of
		pride. I'm only hopin' I'm not too late.

	They make to gather their tools and leave.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		A brother's a brother.

	Danny smiles at this. The Olsens move to get out of
	there as fast as they can.

					CUT TO:

163	EXT.--NIGHT  DANNY RIORDAN'S BACK YARD.

	Alvin is cooking up a large jug of water for coffee.
	Danny is sitting in the chair watching Alvin and
	smoking a cigarette. He has come to enjoy his time
	out in the backyard with Alvin.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		I've gotta tell you Alvin that I'm
		worried about you. About you...about your
		trip on that mower.

				ALVIN
		Not to worry. Me and my machine are
		in splendid form after our stay here.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		You're sure are you Alvin?

 	Alvin just nods. A somewhat awkward silence settles
	on the scene.

				DANNY RIORDAN (cont'd)
		Well.

	Little more silence. Danny puts out his cigarette.

				DANNY RIORDAN (cont'd)
		I guess I'll be turning in. See you in the
		morning then before you go.

				ALVIN
		I'll be traveling plenty early.

	Alvin takes off his hat and stands directly in front of
	Danny.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		I want to thank you for your kindness
		to a stranger.

	Danny stands up from his chair and puts out his
	hand.

				DANNY RIORDAN
		It has been a genuine pleasure having
		you here Alvin. Write to us sometime.

	Alvin takes his hand in a firm shake.

					CUT TO:

164	EXT.--EARLY MORNING  DANNY RIORDAN'S BACKYARD

	Tight on door of trailer closing. Alvin comes
	around and gets on the mower and starts her up.

					CUT TO:

165	EXT.--SUNRISE  DANNY RIORDAN'S HOUSE

	Danny is standing at a window unseen by Alvin. He
	has been watching Alvin's preparations from inside
	the house, sensing Alvin's reluctance for goodbyes.
	Alvin pulls out onto the road.

					CUT TO:

166	EXT.--SUNRISE  RIORDAN'S FRONT PORCH

	Danny steps out onto the porch, holding a coffee
	mug. He watches Alvin in the distance heading
	down the main drag of Clermont.

					CUT TO:

167	EXT.--SUNRISE  MAIN DRAG CLERMONT

	Traveling shot of Alvin going through a sleeping
	Clermont. The only vehicle on the road is another
	John Deere tractor. Alvin and the farmer exchange
	the farmer wave.

					CUT TO:

168	EXT.--DAY  A HILL JUST WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI

	Shot of empty road, top of the hill. The trees on
	either side of the road are in full fall color. Alvin
	and the mower rise into view. Then he stops and
	eyes the steep downhill grade. He sets his hat and
	starts down.

					CUT TO:

169	EXT.--DAY  ANOTHER HILL JUST WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI

	Alvin again crests a hill. This one a bit bigger. Again
	he takes a deep breath. He lashes down the gear shift
	and heads down the hill.

					CUT TO:

170	EXT.--DAY  THE LAST HILL LEADING DOWN TO THE MISSISSIPPI

 	Alvin pulls up to the top of a big hill and comes to a
	stop.

					CUT TO:

171 	EXT.--DAY  HILL TOP ABOVE THE MISSISSIPPI

	Close up of Alvin looking and taking off his hat.

					CUT TO:

172	EXT.--DAY  SAME HILL TOP  ALVIN'S POV.

 	The beautiful, broad Mississippi stretches out before
	him. The hills are in full autumn foliage. There is
	river as far as the eye can see. It is dotted with boats
	and barges. Directly across from Alvin, the
	Wisconsin River flows into the Mississippi... the sun
	glints off their surface where they join. Alvin secures
	his hat and gets back out on the road.

					CUT TO:

173	EXT.--DAY  TOP OF LAST HILL WEST OF MISSISSIPPI

	OMIT

174	EXT.--DAY  SAME HILL

	OMIT

175	EXT.--DAY  MACGREGOR IOWA

	OMIT

176	EXT.--DAY  HIGHWAY LEADING TO THE BRIDGE.

	As he approaches the bridge over the river, Alvin has
	to pull more off the shoulder and into the slow lane
	of traffic. He begins his crossing.

					CUT TO:

177	EXT.--DAY  HIGH ANGLE SHOT OF ALVIN ON BRIDGE

 	Alvin is tooling along in the slow lane. The landscape
	around the bridge is breathtaking. Cars and
	trucks pass him. A car tailgates him. Traffic behind
	him begins to build.

178	EXT.--DAY  MISSISSIPPI BRIDGE

	Alvin riding on his mower, enjoying the view at his
	nice, slow pace. The mower's pace allows him to
	enjoy the scene. People in cars and trucks pass and
	gawk in disbelief. A few are irritated. Some kids take
	his picture. One child motions for him to blow his
	air horn.

179	EXT.--DAY  HIGH ANGLE SHOT OF ALVIN ON BRIDGE

	Alvin at mid-point of the span. The number of cars
	backed up behind him has increased. The flow of
	cars in adjacent lane become affected by the gawkers.
	Alvin has no idea that he is now a one man traffic
	jam.

180	EXT.--DAY  MISSISSIPPI

	Alvin on his mower. He is oblivious to the traffic
	behind him. He is really enjoying the view of the
	Mississippi.

181	EXT.--DAY  HIGH ANGLE OF ALVIN ON BRIDGE

	Now there is a serious back up behind Alvin. He is
	3/4 of the way across the bridge and cars are backed
	up 1/2 way back.

182	EXT.--DAY  ALVIN'S POV

	Alvin scans the river but as his view moves past the
	"WELCOME TO WISCONSIN" sign...

183	EXT.--DAY  ALVIN'S FACE TIGHT

	...his expression changes from blissful tourist to
	concerned motorist.

184	EXT.--DAY  ALVIN POV

	Next to the welcome sign Alvin's sees a Prairie du
	Chien police officer leaning against his squad, lights
	revolving.

185	EXT.--DAY  PRAIRIE DU CHIEN, WISCONSIN

	As Alvin approaches, the officer waves him to the side
	of the road. Alvin slows to a stop along the shoulder.
	The police officer begins to direct the cars past
	around Alvin, moving the gawkers along. He begins
	to converse with Alvin over his shoulder as he waves.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
		Sir, are you aware of the congestion you
		caused on the bridge just now?

				ALVIN
		I wasn't.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
		I am assuming sir that you have the
		appropriate registration to operate a
		Slow Moving Vehicle. Am I correct?

				ALVIN
		Yes sir.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
		And where are you headed today?

				ALVIN
		Mt. Zion.

	At this the police officer stops directing traffic and
	walks over to Alvin with an incredulous look on his
	face.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
		You are going to drive that to Mt.
		Zion? The Mt. Zion by Boscobel?

				ALVIN
		Boscobel?

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
		The Mt. Zion by Blue River?
		That Mt. Zion?

				ALVIN
		That Mt. Zion ...yes.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
		May I see some identification please?

	Alvin extracts his wallet and chain and hands over
	an ID.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP (cont'd)
		It says here you're from Laurens. That
		is...?

				ALVIN
		A bit west of the Grotto.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
		And you've made it to Wisconsin with
		this setup?

				ALVIN
		I have.

	The cop stands back and takes in the whole rig:
	lawnmower, plywood trailer, antlers.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
			(amazed)
		It says here Mr. Straight that you are 73
		years old. How long have you been on
		the road from Laurens?

				ALVIN
		Goin' on six weeks.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
		And what's your business in Mt. Zion?

				ALVIN
		My brother is sick.

	The cop considers this for a moment.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
		Well Mr. Straight, we've got a problem
		here. All of this traffic that you've
		managed to stop runs right on through
		downtown Prairie du Chien. I'd like
		you to take the side streets.

				ALVIN
		Well I'd like to accommodate you
		but...I'm afraid I'm not familiar with
		the streets in this town.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
		You stay right here Mr. Straight. Don't
		move.

	Alvin nods. The officer walks back to his squad and
	begins talking in the radio. Alvin sits and watches
	the river and the traffic. A car goes by and a dog
	barks at him from a window. Little children stare at
	him as they pass. The officer returns. He notices
	again the deer antlers mounted on the trailer.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP (cont'd)
		Do you have a hunting license?

	Alvin turns and sees he's looking at the antlers.

				ALVIN
		That was a road kill.

	Another Prairie du Chien squad car pulls up lights
	flashing.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
		Mr. Straight, I'd like you to follow me.

				ALVIN
		Are you arresting me?

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
		No sir....we're escorting you.

	The two squads bracket Alvin and move out into
	traffic. The caravan drives through the side streets of
	town. The squad cars have their red lights flashing.
	A state patrol car joins the procession. Locals look
	on in confusion and amusement. They wave and
	Alvin, a regular parade marshall, waves back.

					CUT TO:

186	EXT.--DAY  EASTERN EDGE OF PRAIRIE DU CHIEN

	The lead police car stops. The other cars wave and
	peel away. The officer from the bridge walks over to
	Alvin on the mower.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
		You take this up as far as 61, head
		north and it'll take you straight into
		Mt. Zion. Have a safe journey, Mr.
		Straight.

				ALVIN
		Thank you for the grand parade.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP
		Our privilege sir.

	He turns to walk away, then looks back.

				PRAIRIE DU CHIEN COP (cont'd)
		Must've been one slow buck.

	Alvin sits grinning on his rig, his head framed by the
	buck's antlers.

					CUT TO:

187a	EXT.--SUNSET

 	Alvin traveling along the Wisconsin country road.

187b	EXT.--SUNSET

 	Alvin pulls off the road to set up camp alongside a
	small country church and cemetery.

187	EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S CAMPSITE

 	Alvin sits in his chaise by the campfire. A train whistle
	sounds in the distance. Alvin looks up, and looks
	into the sky.

188	EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S POV

	Stars in the cool autumn sky with a crescent moon.
	The train whistle blows again.

189	EXT.--NIGHT

 	Alvin looks off in the direction of the sound. His
	trip is nearing an end. He looks around at his
	surroundings.

190	EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S POV

	He is camped alongside a small country church and
	cemetery. A simple iron archway guards the cemetery.
	The back door of the church opens and a swath
	of light cuts into the cemetery. A PRIEST in layman's
	clothes comes out carrying a plate and
	approaches Alvin.

				PRIEST
		I noticed your campfire. I brought you
		some dinner...meat loaf and potatoes.

	He holds the plate out to Alvin. Alvin hesitates and
	then reaches out and takes the plate.

				ALVIN
		I thank you kindly. Hope you don't
		mind my trespassin'.

				PRIEST
		Not at all. You've made a fine choice.
		You're camped next to one of the oldest
		cemeteries in the midwest. French
		Catholic trappers.

				ALVIN
		Marquette's party?

				PRIEST
			(nodding)
		Two of his men.

	Alvin reflects on this. He motions for the priest to
	sit down by the fire. The priest does so.

				PRIEST (cont'd)
			(hesitantly)
		I couldn't help but notice your rather
		unusual mode of transport.

				ALVIN
			(shakes his head
			and smiles)
		Well you wouldn't be the first person to
		say so Padre.

	The priest doesn't say anything...he waits on Alvin.
	Finally...

				ALVIN (cont'd)
			(he's ready to stop
			explaining himself
			to people)
		I can't see good enough to drive a car, I
		don't like someone else drivin' my bus
		and I got to get to my brother's place.

				PRIEST
		Fair enough. How far have you traveled?

				ALVIN
		Well now this vehicle doesn't sport an
		odometer so I couldn't exactly say...but
		I been on the road since September
 		5th.

				PRIEST
		But we're October 15th. Where in
		heaven's name did you start out?

				ALVIN
		Back in north central Iowa. Laurens,
		Iowa.

				PRIEST
		That must be over 300 miles from
		here!

				ALVIN
		I reckon that's not a bad guess.

	The priest gets up and walks over to Alvin's mower
	and trailer. He walks around it real slow...one full
	circle.  He comes back and sits down by the fire. He
	looks at Alvin for a bit.

				PRIEST
		Well I would guess that you are on a
		mission.

	This sets Alvin to thinking. He nods to himself.

				ALVIN
		You know I wouldna ever thought of it
		that way but I guess you could say
		that's exactly what I'm doin'.

				PRIEST
		You say you've got to see your brother.
		Where is he?

				ALVIN
		So close I can practically feel him...
		Mt. Zion.

				PRIEST
		What's his name?

				ALVIN
		Lyle Straight.

				PRIEST
		That the fellow had a stroke some weeks
		ago?

				ALVIN
		That's right. You know him?

				PRIEST
		Well I do some work over at the hospital
		in Boscobel and I remember him
		coming in. He caught my attention
		because he lives in my parish.

				ALVIN
		He's Baptist.

				PRIEST
		I believe he told me that. He told me a
		few things as a matter of fact. Didn't
		mention having a brother though.

	Alvin looks up to the sky.

				ALVIN
		Don't think we've either of us had a
		brother for some time now. I'm hopin'
		to fix that...

	Alvin pauses for a moment.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		So you saw him? ...He's O.K. then?

				PRIEST
		I only saw him that once...never heard
		anything more.

	There is a pause in the talk. Alvin takes in the scene.

					CUT TO:

191	EXT.--NIGHT SKY

	Alvin's POV of the crescent moon, the stars and
	down to the church and the cemetery. The priest
	waits for him to go on. Night sounds, train whistles.

				ALVIN
		Lyle and I grew up close as brothers
		could be. We were raised on a farm up
		in Moorhead, Minnesota. Worked so
		hard...my ma and pa pretty much
		killed themselves trying to make that
		farm work.

	Alvin shakes his head at the sorrow of this memory.
	He takes out a cigar and lights it. The priest patiently
	waits on him to continue.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		Me and Lyle...we made games out of
		our chores. A day's work'd go quicker
		when it was just the two of us. We'd
		make up different races and wagers just
		to get our mind off the cold...Christ it
		was cold....

	He looks quickly to the priest.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		'Scuse me Padre.

	The priest nods tolerantly. He waits for Alvin to
	continue.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		He and I used to sleep out in the yard
		every summer night it wasn't pouring.
		After nine months of winter we couldn't
		get enough of summer. We'd bunk
		down as soon as the sun went down
		and lie there talkin' ourselves to sleep.
		Talk about the stars...and other planets,
		whether there might be other people
		like us out there, 'bout all the places we
		wanted to go...made our trials seem
		smaller. We pretty much talked each
		other through growin' up.

	Alvin looks up to the sky.

192	EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S POV OF THE NIGHT

				ALVIN (cont'd)
			(voice over)
		Funny but lookin' up at these stars
		tonight and feelin' him so close...makes
		me feel I'm right back there again. All
		those years ago.

	They are both quiet for a bit...we stay on the night
	sky.

				PRIEST
			(voice over)
		What happened between you two?

					CUT TO:

193	EXT.--NIGHT  CAMPSITE

	Alvin looks back down to the fire.

				ALVIN
		Well that's a story old as the
		bible...Cain and Abel. Anger...vanity
		...mix those things up with liquor and
		you get two brothers not talkin' for ten
		years....

	Alvin shakes his head.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		It doesn't really matter anymore.

	He's quiet for a while.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
		I've lived on this earth for 73 years. I'm
 		a humble man in the world but my life
		is so full that from where I sit now I'll
		be damned if I know how I did it
		all...growin' up on a hardscrabble
		farm...then went to war...
			(he shakes his head
			at these painful
			memories)
		...God help us.
			(he pauses and
			takes a breath)
		I had seven children. We lived in every
		part of this beautiful country...I loved a
		woman for 40 years...and then she
		died.

	He has to stop for a while.

	The priest is looking into the fire. He gives Alvin all
	the time he needs.

				ALVIN (cont'd)
			(he takes a breath)
		I've got two daughters...one we lost
		track of back in '74...don't even know
		if she's alive. Got in with a mean fella.
			(another painful pause.)
		So...whatever it was made me and Lyle
		so mad doesn't matter to me now...I
		want to make peace...I want to sit with
		him again and look up at all the stars.

	The priest looks over at Alvin. Alvin looks up and
	becomes embarrassed.

				PRIEST
		Well sir, I say amen to that.

194	EXT.--NIGHT  ALVIN'S CAMPSITE

	The hilltop wide under the stars. The fire glows
	small in the frame. The firelight's flickering
	illumination of Alvin, the priest, the Church and the
	cemetery.

					SLOW FADE TO BLACK.

					FADE IN:

195	EXT.--DAY  WESTERN WISCONSIN

	Alvin is driving through rolling Wisconsin farmland
	dotted with dairy farms and red barns. He sees a
	sign: "Mt. Zion. Unincorporated"

					CUT TO:

196	INT.--DAY  MT. ZION BAR / GAS STATION

	The bartender sits behind the bar watching the
	Weather Channel.

					CUT TO:

197	INT.--TV SCREEN

 	The weather person is giving the national five day
	forecast.

				WEATHER PERSON
		First frost of the season is expected for
		the midwest and great lakes region...

					CUT TO:

198	INT.--DAY  MT. ZION BAR

 	Something out the window catches the bartender's
	eye. He glances out and his expression changes to
	one of disbelief.

				MT. ZION BARTENDER
		What the....

	He gets up off his stool and walks over to the window
	for a closer look.

				MT. ZION BARTENDER (cont'd)
			...hell?

199	INT.--DAY  MT. ZION BAR/GAS STATION

	Through the window we see Alvin hauling up the
	hill approaching the bar.

200	EXT.--DAY  MT. ZION BAR GAS PUMP

	Alvin arrives at the top of the hill and stops at the
	gas pumps. Alvin executes his usual laborious dismount
	and enters the bar.

					CUT TO:

201	INT.--DAY  THE MT. ZION BAR

	Alvin crosses the bar and perches atop a bar stool.
	He sets his canes against the bar rail and addresses
	the bartender.

				ALVIN
		I haven't had a drink in years but I
		believe I'll have a cold beer right now.

				MT. ZION BARTENDER
		What flavor?

				ALVIN
		What does a Miller Lite taste like?

	The bartender places a bottle in front of Alvin.

				MT. ZION BARTENDER
		Interesting rig you got out there. Make
		it up the hill OK?

				ALVIN
		That one and about 200 others.

				MT. ZION BARTENDER
		How far'd you come?

				ALVIN
		Iowa. Headin' to Lyle Straight's place.

				MT. ZION BARTENDER
		Iowa?...by God you must be thirsty.

				ALVIN
		One'll do thank you. Can you point
		me to Lyle's place? I don't quite recall
		the way...it's been an awful long time
		since I seen him.

	Alvin starts drinking the beer in short order.

				MT. ZION BARTENDER
		Cross 61 there on W. Take W to Weed
		Road and then take Weed on down to
		Remington. Remington drops down
		onto S...that's the county trunk by
		Frankie Schwartz's farm. On your right
		would be Lyle's place...if he's even
		there.  I heard he's had a bad stroke...if
		you see him, tell him Micky O'Connor
		tells him to get better quick.

	Alvin finishes off the beer, gets up and heads out of
	bar. MARTHA, the bartender's wife arrives after
	Alvin's exit. She peers out the window. Then turns
	to the bartender.

				MARTHA
		I believe that would be a '66.

					CUT TO:

202	EXT.--DAY  MT. ZION BAR

	Alvin drives through a beautiful valley.

					CUT TO:

204	EXT.--DAY  WEED ROAD ALVIN TIGHT

 	Alvin knows that he is near the end of his journey.
	Then a look crosses his face. We hear the engine
	cough. Then with a puff of black smoke, the mower
	dies. Alvin sits alone on the dirt road.

					DISSOLVE TO:

205	EXT.--DAY  WEED ROAD LATER THAT DAY

	Alvin is still sitting alone on the dirt road.

					DISSOLVE TO:

206	EXT.--DAY  WEED ROAD EVEN LATER THAT SAME DAY

	Alvin still sitting. We hear the off camera sound of a
	tractor. Around the bend of the dirt road comes a
	big John Deere farm tractor.

					CUT TO:

207	EXT.--DAY  DIRT ROAD WIDE

	The farmer stops and converses with Alvin. He is
	offering to haul Alvin. Alvin tries the mower again
	and to his surprise it starts. The farmer climbs on his
	tractor and proceeds down the road in front of
	Alvin. They continue like this approaching Lyle's
	place. Alvin turns off into Lyle's yard and the tractor
	keeps moving off. Alvin cuts his engine and the
	sound of the tractor fades off.

					CUT TO:

208	EXT.--MAGIC HOUR  LYLE'S FRONT YARD

	Alvin dismounts and slowly walks toward the front
	door of the house. He stops in the yard and calls out.

				ALVIN
		Lyle.

					CUT TO:

209	EXT.--MAGIC HOUR  LYLE'S HOUSE

	Close on the screen door. A pause...then we hear
	Lyle's voice from inside.

				LYLE
		Is that you Alvin?

 	We hear a rhythmic bumping noise from inside.

					CUT TO:

210	EXT.--MAGIC HOUR  LYLE'S YARD

	Alvin starts moving toward the front porch. Lyle
	comes out the front door using a walker. It makes
	the bumping noise. As Alvin climbs the few steps he
	and Lyle stand very close and take a good look at
	each other...at the old men they have become.

				LYLE
		Sit yourself down Alvin.

	They move slowly to the two chairs set up on the
	porch. They are situated about five feet apart on
	either side of the screen door. Lyle is on the right
	and Alvin on the left.

					CUT TO:

	Lyle looking out at the lawnmower and trailer in the
	yard.

				LYLE (cont'd)
		Did you ride that thing all the way here
		to see me?

					CUT TO:

	Alvin nodding his head.

				ALVIN
		I did Lyle.

	We stay on Alvin's face for a while.

					CUT TO:

 	Close shot of Lyle. He is crying.

					CUT TO:

	Alvin...tears are running down his cheeks. He turns
	with a crying smile to Lyle.

					PAN UP TO:
