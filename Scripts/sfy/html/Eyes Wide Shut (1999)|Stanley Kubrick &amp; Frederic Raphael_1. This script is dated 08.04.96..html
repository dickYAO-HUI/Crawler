INT BILL & ALICE'S APT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
It is a week before Christmas. The tree is decorated and Christmas
cards stand open everywhere in the comfortable Central Park West
apartment.
Settled into the couch in the living room, watching TV, are seven
year-old , HELENA, and the BABY-SITTER, a young college girl.
BEDROOM
BILL and ALICE HARFORD, an attractive couple in their thirties, are
in evening clothes preparing to leave for a party.
ALICE (looking in mirror)
How do I look?
BILL
You look great.
ALICE
My hair okay?
BILL
Perfect.
ALICE
You're not even looking at it.
Bill kisses her neck.
BILL
It's absolutely beautiful. You always
look beautiful.
ALICE
Oh, shut up... OK, let's go.
They walk into the living room. The baby sitter gets to her feet.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BABY-SITTER
Oh, you look so-ooo lovely, Mrs.
Harford.
ALICE (laughs)
Thank you, Roz.
(to Helena)
All ready for bed?
HELENA
Yes, Mommy. I took my bath and
brushed my teeth.
AD-LIBS of praise as BILL and ALICE kiss HELENA goodnight.
BABY-SITTER
What time do you want Helena to go to
bed?
HELENA
Please, Mommy, can I stay up late
tonight and watch the (name of TV
show) Ple-eease.
ALICE
When is it on?
HELENA
Ten-thirty.
ALICE
Okay, darling, but just for tonight.
HELENA
Thank you, Mommy.
The house intercom rings. BILL goes to answer it.
DOORMAN (VOICE)
Doctor Harford?
BILL
Yes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOORMAN
The car is here.
BILL
OK, we'll be right down.
Bill returns to sitting room.
BILL
OK the car's here - let's go.
(to Baby-sitter)
Roz, we might be late tonight but I'll
hold the car to take you home.
BABY-SITTER
Oh, that's great, Doctor Harford.
Thanks very much.
AD-LIBS of Good nights and have a good time.
EXT HIRED CAR DRIVE-BY (CPW TO 5TH) - NIGHT (2nd Unit)
INT CAR - NIGHT
BILL takes ALICE's hand and gives her a loving wink.
EXT ZIEGLER MIDTOWN MANSION - NIGHT
BILL'S car pulls up behind a stretch limo.
INT CAR - NIGHT
The driver hands Bill a clip board with a form attached to it.
DRIVER
Can you sign this, Doctor?
The doorman, carrying an umbrella, opens the car door.
BILL (signing)
Okay, thanks..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRIVER
Thanks. (handing his card) Just phone
about half hour before you want to be
picked up.
BILL
OK. Fine.
DRIVER
Have a good evening.
BILL and ALICE exit the car and enter the house.
INT ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT
Big party already in progress.
Sound of a dance band off.
Many guests still arriving.
Two ladies seated at a table confirm that Doctor and Mrs Harford are
on the invitation roster.
Their coats are taken.
The hosts, VICTOR ZIEGLER, a fit, sun-tanned, man in his mid-fifties,
and his wife, ILLONA, a Hungarian beauty, stand to one side
greeting their guests in the large entrance hall.
ZIEGLER (speaking above the noise)
Bill!...Alice!... I'm so glad you could
come. It's wonderful to see you both,
AD-LIBS of further greetings while they shake hands and kiss on both
cheeks.
ZIEGLER
And Alice, my dear, forgive the pitiful
understatement but you look totally
beautiful.
Victor and Alice exchange if-there-was-world-enough-and-time
smiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZIEGLER
And Bill, that osteopath you sent me
to? He was wonderful. You should see
my serve now.
BILL
Yes, he's the top man in the world.
ANOTHER FABULOUS ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
BILL and ALICE, carrying champagne glasses make their way through
the glitterati.
They stop to admire the 17 foot Christmas tree trimmed with colored
lights and antique ornaments.
BALLROOM - BILL & ALICE DANCING
BILL's attention is caught by one of the musicians on the bandstand.
BILL
I don't believe it.
ALICE
What?
BILL
The guy at the piano. That's Nick
Nightingale, I went to medical school
with him.
ALICE
He's plays pretty good for a doctor.
BILL
He's not a doctor. He dropped out. I'm
going to have to say hello to him.
ALICE
Okay, I'll go and get us some more
champagne.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL
I'll see you at the bar.
BILL walks over to the bandstand as they finish a set.
BILL
Nick!.. Nick Nightingale!
NICK
Hey! Bill Harford! What a surprise.
How the hell are you?
AD LIBS of greetings as they shake hands.
BILL
God, how long has it been?
NICK
Ten years?
BILL
And a couple.
NICK
How's life been treating you?
BILL
Not too bad. And you've become a
pianist.
NICK
My friends call me that.
BILL (laughs)
And how do you happen to playing
here tonight?
NICK
I know my Cole Porter and I work
cheap.
They both laugh.
NICK
How about you. Still in the doctor
business?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL
You know how it is, once a doctor,
always a doctor.
NICK
In my case, never a doctor, never a
doctor. You _don't_ know how that is.
BILL
I never did understand why you walked
away.
NICK
No? It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.
The BAND LEADER comes over and gives NICK a nod and BILL an
polite smile.
NICK
Okay, we're off again. Listen, if I don't
catch you later, I'm down in the
Village for the next two weeks, at the
Cafe Sonata. Come by if you get a
chance.
BILL (nods)
Cafe Sonata, right. Okay, and listen, it
was great seeing you again.
NICK
Same here. Take care.
The band starts up again.
The ballroom is crowded and BILL starts to make his way around the
dance floor to the bar.
ALICE is at the bar waiting for him.
She reaches absently for her champagne glass...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
and finds she is holding - or touching - a man's hand.
ALICE (smiles)
I think that's my glass.
SZABO
I'm absolutely certain of it.
SZABO is a handsome man, in his mid-forties with a slight Central
European accent.
He drinks slowly from ALICE'S glass and looks directly into her eyes
as he does so.
SZABO
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on The Art of Love?
ALICE
Didn't he wind up all by himself, crying
his eyes out in some place with a very
bad climate.
SZABO
But he also had a good time first. A
very good time.
SZABO
By the way, my name is Sandor Szabo.
I'm Hungarian.
ALICE
Pleased to meet you. My name is Alice.
I'm American.
SZABO
Would you like to dance, Alice?
ALICE notices BILL across the room talking to two beautiful models.
ALICE
Why not? - Sandor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACROSS THE ROOM - BILL & THE MODELS
GAYLE, the taller model, shouts to BILL above the music.
GAYLE
Nobody likes you?
(louder)
GAYLE
Nobody likes you, is that the problem?
BILL
Put it this way, nobody _wants_ to admit
how much they like me. But I'm
confident it can still happen.
GAYLE (laughs)
Do you know Nuala Windsor?
GAYLE asks, putting her arm around her friend's waist.
BILL (smiles)
Nuala...I certainly feel like I do. How
do you spell, Nuala?
NUALA
N..u..a..l..a.
BILL
Is that a Hawaiian name?
NUALA
No, it's an agency name.
They all laugh.
GAYLE
You were very kind to her once.
BILL
Only once? That sounds like an
oversight.
NUALA
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was on a shoot, modelling at
Rockefeller Center, on a very windy
day. You happened to be passing by.
BILL (remembering)
And you got something in your eye?
NUALA
Just about half of 5th Avenue. You
were such a gentleman.
BILL
That can happen when you're in a
hurry.
NUALA
You actually had a _handkerchief_ -
which was also clean!
BILL
That's the kind of hero I can be
sometimes!
ALICE is dancing with the Sandor. He holds her close to him.
SZABO
What do you do, Alice?
ALICE
Well, actually, I'm looking for a job at
the moment. I was an editor at a
publishing house but they went broke.
SZABO
Perhaps I can be of some help. I know
a few people in publishing.
Alice doesn't reply to this.
SZABO
And you're married?
ALICE shows him her wedding ring.
SZABO
And you're here tonight with your
husband?
ALICE
I am, indeed..
SZABO
How sad.
Alice makes a that's-life face.
SZABO
But of course I should have guessed
that. If you weren't with your husband
tonight you wouldn't be so careful.
ALICE laughs.
SZABO
May I ask why a beautiful woman who
could have any man in this room wants
to be married?
ALICE
You can ask.
SZABO
You know why women used to get
married, don't you?
ALICE
Why don't you tell me.
SZABO
It was the only way they could lose
their virginity's and be free to do what
they wanted with other men. The ones
they really wanted.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALICE
Fascinating.
SZABO
Victor and Illona have a fabulous art
collection.
ALICE
They do, don't they.
SZABO
Have you ever seen the Impressionist
stuff upstairs?
ALICE
I don't think so.
SZABO
There are a couple of magnificent
Bonnards up there.
ALICE
Are there?

SZABO
Do you like Bonnard?
ALICE
Yes, I do.
SZABO
Would you like me to show them to
you?
ALICE
Well, maybe not just right now.
SZABO
We won't be gone long.
ALICE smiles and shakes her head.
BILL AND THE MODELS
NUALA slowly leading BILL to the door.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NUALA
Do you know what's so nice about
doctors?
BILL
Usually a lot less than people think.
NUALA
They look so... knowledgable!

BILL
They are very knowledgeable - about
all sorts of things.

GAYLE
But I'll bet they work too hard. I bet
they miss out on a lot of fun.
BILL
You're absolutely right. Where we
going, girls?
NUALA (laughs)
Where the rainbow ends.
BILL slows down a little.
GAYLE
Don't you want to go where the
rainbow ends?
BILL
Do I want to go where the rainbow
ends?
Before he can answer, a big man who looks like he stepped right
out of _The Godfather_ walks up - HARRIS, Ziegler's _personal
assistant_.
HARRIS
Excuse me, Doctor Harford. May I
trouble you for a moment?
BILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure.
HARRIS (nods towards the door)
Could you spare a minute, please?
BILL
What's up?
HARRIS
Could you come with me, please?
GAYLE (laughs)
It's something for Me. Z.
BILL
Okay.
GAYLE
Come back soon.
The girls blow kisses. Bill smiles.
ALICE AND SZABO DANCING
SZABO
Alice, you're a fascinating woman.
ALICE makes a can't-help-that face.
SZABO
I'd really like to see you again.
ALICE
I don't think that would really be a
good idea.
SZABO
You _are_ cruel. What about lunch, later
this week?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL AND HARRIS - CORRIDORS AND STAIRCASE
Muffled sounds of the music echo from the ballroom below.
HARRIS stops in front of a large door and knocks quietly.
ZIEGLER (os)
Yes?
HARRIS
It's Harris, sir.
After a few seconds the key is turned in the lock and the door slowly
opens revealing a barefoot ZIEGLER wearing only his pants and
undershirt.
ZIEGLER
Thanks very much for coming up, Bill.
He gestures BILL in. HARRIS waits outside.
A strikingly beautiful, half-naked woman in her late twenties, is
sprawled face up, her clothing scattered on the floor.
BILL
What happened?
ZIEGLER
She OD'd on coke.
ZIEGLER gestures to the cocaine paraphernalia on the night table.
BILL (checking her pulse)
How long has she been like this?
ZIEGLER
Maybe ten minutes?
BILL feels her carotid artery.
BILL
Has this happened before?
ZIEGLER
Not sure, but probably.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL turns her face to the light of a table lamp to check her pupils.
The woman stirs.
BILL
She's starting to come around.
The woman makes a few unintelligible sounds.
BILL takes her wrist again and looks at his watch.
BILL
Good...Well...I don't think there's
really anything to worry about. Coke
wears off in half an hour or so.
ZIEGLER is visibly relieved.
BILL continues to watch her in silence.
BILL
Someone should stay with her, though,
until she's fully herself again.
ZIEGLER
Okay.
BILL
Some cold towels on her face
wouldn't be a bad idea.
ZIEGLER
Okay.
BILL
Anyone here with her to take her
home?
ZIEGLER
I'll take care of that...She's a friend of
the family.
Bill nods and watches her for a few moments longer. The he makes
moves like he wants to go..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL
She'll be all right, Victor. Okay if I
leave the rest to you?
ZIEGLER
Sure... And listen, Bill, I don't know
how to thank you enough for this.
BILL
It was nothing. Glad to be of help.
ZIEGLER
And, Bill - I know I don't have to say
this but I trust this is just between the
two of us.
BILL
Of course.
BALLROOM
BILL re-enters the ballroom and looks around for the two models but
he doesn't see them.
Then... a woman's arm slips through his.
He looks down at the wedding-ringed hand.
It's ALICE.
She is flushed and glad to have found him.
ALICE
Haven't I seen you someplace before?

BILL
Could be. What's your name again?
She kisses him.
ALICE
Can we go home now?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL AND ALICE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
ALICE stands naked in front of her dressing table mirror rubbing face
cream. BILL comes up behind her, kisses her shoulder and runs his
hands lightly over her breasts.
V.O.
That night they were more blissful in
their ardent love than they had been
for a long time.
SHOTS TO ILLUSTRATE V.O.
Getting up.
Alice and Helena in the kitchen.
Bill in his office with patients.
V.O.
The gray of morning awakened them
only too soon.
Alice had to take Helena to school.
And Bill had a number of early
appointments.
So the evening hours passed in the
predetermined daily routine of work,
and the events of the night before
began to fade.
BILL'S APARTMENT - HELENA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
HELENA reading aloud to BILL and ALICE from "A Child's Garden of
Verses". She finishes her poem and yawns.
BILL
And now, my darling, time for bed.
What do you say?
HELENA smiles and puts her arms around BILL.
BILL and ALICE kiss her goodnight, turn out the lights and go into the
living room.
LIVING ROOM
ALICE sighs comfortably.
ALICE
So, how do you feel about wrapping
some presents?
BILL
Kind of negative. We can do it
tomorrow.
Bill drops down on the couch, picks up the TV controller and starts
switching channels.
Alice snuggles up to him.
ALICE
Anything good on tonight?
BILL
Have you got the paper?
Alice puts her arms around him.
ALICE
I don't feel like watching TV.
They kiss.
ALICE
Let's break the law a little first
BATHROOM - A FEW MOMENTS LATER
Bill takes a Band-Aid box from the bathroom medicine cabinet and
removes a small plastic bag of pot.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEDROOM
Alice skillfully rolls two joints.
MINUTES LATER
Bill and Alice sitting in bed, partly undressed and smoking the joints.
Alice inhales and leans back with an ashtray in her lap.
She is high.
ALICE
How about the truth game?

BILL
Always a bit dangerous with pot.
ALICE
Isn't that the fun?
BILL
I'm putty in your hands.
ALICE
Okay, let's start with who were those
those two gorgeous women at the
party last night?
BILL
Don't really know. One of them just
started talking to me.
ALICE
I thought they might be patients?
BILL
No such luck. They're models. One of
them said I once removed something
from her eyes on windy day in
Rockefeller Plaza.
ALICE
Always on the job.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL
That's me.
ALICE
And what did they want from you this
time?
BILL
My body - what else?
ALICE doesn't find the remark particularly amusing.
BILL
Hey, come on - all I did was talk to
them... Anyway, who was the guy _you_
were dancing with?
BILL is not that interested and just wants to change the subject.
ALICE
Sandor?
BILL
Sandor... Who is he?
ALICE
A friend of the Zieglers.
BILL
And what does he do?
ALICE
I never actually found out?
BILL
Rich?
ALICE
Talked like he was.
BILL
And what did he want?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALICE
Sex. Upstairs. Then and there.
The pot makes ALICE think this is hilarious.
BILL
Well, I guess that's understandable.
ALICE
Understandable?
BILL
Well, you're a beautiful woman.
ALICE
Oh, I see. So does exhaustive
research show that every man I meet
wants to screw me?
BILL
There might be some exceptions.
ALICE
Does that mean that all men, with
_possibly_ _some_ _exceptions_, want to
screw all beautiful women, married or
otherwise?

BILL
I suppose, basically, yes.
ALICE
So does that mean you wanted to
screw the two models?
BILL
I did say with some exceptions.
ALICE
And of course you're an exception?
BILL
Yes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALICE
How come?
BILL
Because I love you.
ALICE
Any other reasons?
BILL
Because we're married.
ALICE
Any others?
BILL
And because I wouldn't lie to you or
hurt you.
ALICE
So basically what it comes down to is
that you wouldn't screw the two
models out of _consideration_ for me,
but otherwise you would.
BILL
Hey, is this thing on Court TV?
BILL feigns looking around for cameras.
ALICE
Why don't you just give me a
straight answer?
BILL
Hey, come on, honey. The pot's
making you aggressive.
He takes her cigarette and puts it out.
ALICE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not being aggressive at all - and
how about you not putting out my

BILL
Okay. Okay. Okay.
ALICE
Now try to be honest. When some
really great-looking woman comes in to
your office to have her tits checked out,
don't you ever think about screwing
her?
BILL
Come on, give me a break. I'm a
doctor. It's all very impersonal. And
anyway my insurance requires that a
nurse is always present.
ALICE
You're being evasive. When you're
feeling her tits, is it never any more
than sheer professionalism?
BILL
Basically, that's all it is.
ALICE
Just basically?
BILL
Oh, come on. There are no absolutes
in anything.
ALICE
No absolutes... Okay. Fine... And does
the same thing go for women? While
they're having their tits squeezed, do
you suppose your lady patients ever
wonder what your dick might be like?
BILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definitely not.
ALICE
And why is that?
BILL (laughs)
Because they're too worried about
what I might find.
ALICE
You know what I mean.
BILL
No, again. Not most of them.
ALICE
Why?
BILL
Well, I suppose that most women are
programmed differently from men
ALICE
Oh, yes, I forgot. Millions of years of
evolution - right? Men have to put
their sperm into as many women as
they can, but women stay at home
with pretty pink things and take care of
the children?
BILL
A bit oversimplified but something like
that.
A dispirited smile passes over her face.
ALICE
Oh, if you men only knew.
The look in her eyes changes, becoming cool and impenetrable,
and BILL allows her hands to slip from his.
BILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If we knew -? What do you mean
by that?
ALICE (in a strangely harsh voice)
About what you imagine, my dear.
BILL
Hey, Alice, hey, look at me... The truth.
Is there something you've kept from
me?
ALICE looks down with a strange smile.
BILL (laughs)
You're just trying to wind me up.
ALICE
If you say so.
BILL
If I say so? Wait a minute. I'm not
going to let you get away with that...
Seriously... Is there's something you
haven't told me?
ALICE stops short of saying something.
BILL
Say it.
ALICE nods.
ALICE
Well, last summer at Cape Cod - I
don't suppose you remember one night
in the dining room, there was a young
Naval officer sitting near us. He was
with two other officers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL
As a matter of fact, I don't. But what
about him?
ALICE
The waiter brought him a message
during dinner, at which point he left
the table?
Bill waits for her to continue.
ALICE
Well...I first saw him that morning in
the lobby. He was checking in and he
was following the bellboy with his
luggage to the elevator.
He glanced at me as he walked past
but didn't stop until he had gone a few
more steps. Then he turned and
looked at me.
He didn't say anything. He didn't smile.
In fact, it seemed to me that he
scowled. Maybe I did the same thing.
ALICE stops for a moment.
ALICE
I was very stirred by him. That whole
day I lay on the beach, lost in dreams.
She stops.
BILL
Go on.
ALICE thinks about how to continue.
BILL stares at her.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALICE
That afternoon you and I made love
and talked about our future, and our
child.
Later we were sitting on the balcony
and he passed below us without
looking up.
Just the sight of him stirred me deeply
and I thought if he wanted me, I could
not have resisted. I thought I was
ready to give up you,
the child, my whole future.
And yet at the same time - if you can
understand it - you were dearer to me
than ever, and I stroked your forehead
and kissed your hair, and at that
moment my love for you was both
tender and sad.
At dinner I wore a white rose and you
said I was very beautiful. It might not
have been just an accident that he and
his friends sat near us.
He didn't look up but I actually
considered getting up, walking over to
him and like someone in a movie,
saying, 'Here I am, my love, for whom
I have waited - take me.'
Well, it was about then that the waiter
brought him the envelope. He read it,
turned pale, said goodbye to his friends
- and glancing at me mysteriously, he
left the room.
ALICE stops for a moment.
ALICE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I barely slept that night and woke up
the next morning very agitated. I didn't
know whether I was afraid that he had
left or that he might still be there... But
by dinner I realised he was gone and I
breathed a sigh of relief.
Long silence
BILL
And if he hadn't left?
Alice doesn't reply.
ALICE
I don't know.
BILL doesn't say anything but there is a scornful expression around his
mouth.
The phone rings.
BILL
Hello?...Oh... When did they call?...
No, I have the address...If they call
again say I'm on my way.
He hangs up the phone and starts to put on his shoes.
BILL
Lou Nathanson just died.
ALICE
Oh, that's too bad. But you were
expecting that, weren't you?
BILL
Yes..
Bill starts to get dressed.
BILL
I have to go over there for a while.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALICE
Now?
BILL
I have to show my face.
BILL silently getting dressed.
ALICE
Obviously, it was a mistake to have told
you.
BILL (coldly)
Not at all.. We must always tell each
other everything.
ALICE
It was the pot.
BILL (coldly)
It doesn't really matter. Nothing
happened. Just a passing fancy.
EXT MARION'S APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT
BILL's taxi pulls up to the stylish, lower 5th avenue apartment.
Doorman opens the door.
INT MARION'S LOBBY
Bill walks to the elevator
INT MARION's PRIVATE ELEVATOR LOBBY
Bill exits elevator and find's her door ajar.
He knocks softly and enters without waiting for a reply.
BILL (softly)
Marion?
He walks through the quiet apartment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MASTER BEDROOM
The body of LOU NATHANSON lies on a large bed with an oxygen
cylinder and other medical paraphernalia on tables on each side of
the bed.
MARION, the dead man's daughter, a pretty girl in her late twenties,
sits at the foot of the bed, exhausted, her arms hanging limply at her
side.
She starts to get up but BILL stops her with a movement from his
hand, and she merely greets him with a nod, her eyes large and sad.
BILL moves to the head of the bed and mechanically places his hands
on the forehead of the dead man and on his arms.
He shakes his head a couple of times and his shoulders drop with a
slight expression of regret.
BILL
I hope his last moments were peaceful.
Marion gives him a despairing look.
He puts his hands in his pockets and his eyes wander about the room
until they finally rest again on Marion.
BILL
Well, Marion, at least you weren't
entirely unprepared for this.
She holds out her hand to him. He takes it sympathetically.
Marion sighs, woefully.
MARION
Dad seemed pretty good today. Around
nine o'clock he said he felt like taking a
nap. So I went into the living room to
watch television. I don't think I was out
of his room for more than half-an-hour.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marion starts to weep.
MARION
When I went back, at first I though he
was still asleep... The I realized he
wasn't breathing... I did everything you
had told me but.. he was....
She can't bring herself to say _dead_ and she shakes her head,
despairingly.
MARION
I called the emergency people... But
when they got here they just said he
was...dead and asked whether I
wanted them to take him away?
She breaks down sobbing.
BILL draws up a chair and sits down opposite her.
BILL
Marion, from what you've said, it
sounds like your father died in his
sleep. He wouldn't have suffered.
MARION
Oh, God...I hope not... I've been so
afraid of the actual... dying business...
But he made it _so_ _easy_, just as he tried to
make everything else in my life easy.
BILL takes her hands.
BILL
Have you notified any of your
relatives?
MARION
I phoned Carl - my fiancee.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
She does not look BILL straight in the eye when she says, fiancee/
MARION
He's going to make some calls for me
and then he's coming over.
BILL
Oh, that's good.
MARION
I think you've met Carl here a few
times? We're planning to get married
in April.
BILL
Oh, that's wonderful. I'm very happy
for you.
They sit for a few moments without speaking.
V.O.
I certainly do remember Carl. So she's
going to marry him, Bill thought to
himself. I wonder why? She surely
can't be in love with him. He's nothing
to look at, and he hasn't got any
money... He's just an assistant in
professor of something or other... But
then it's none of my business. Still... if
she were my mistress, her hair would be
less dry and her lips would be fuller and
redder.
Marion suddenly starts to talk.
MARION
Dad had so many worries and
disappointments. My mother was never
well... And my _brother_...he was such a
disappointment... I don't even know
where he is. The last we heard from
him was from some small town in
Mexico. I can't even remember where.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[POSSIBLE MISSING PAGE]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In spite of himself, BILL places his hand on her head, caressing it. He
feels her body begin to tremble and her sobs become louder and
finally quite unrestrained.
All at once, she slips down from her chair and kneels in front of him,
clasping his legs with her arms and pressing her face into them.
She looks up at him with large eyes, wild with grief, and whispers
ardently:
MARION
I don't want to leave here... Even if
you never return... Even if I am never to
see you again... I want, at least, to live
near you.
BILL looks touched rather than surprised.
BILL
Please - get up, Marion.
He says this softly, and bending down he gently raises her up.
He glances at the dead man on the bed and only puts his arms
around her in a very hesitant embrace and kisses her on the
forehead.
At the same time, without knowing why, a sense of anger wells up
against ALICE.
_Jealous fantasy image of Alice and the Naval officer._
The door bell rings.
He hastily kisses Marion's cheek, as if in gratitude, and goes to the
door.
It's CARL standing there - a very ordinary looking man with an
umbrella in his hand and a serious face appropriate to the situation.
The two men greet each other much more cordially than is called for
by their actual state of acquaintance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
They walk to the bedroom and CARL has an embarrassed look at the
deceased.
CARL
Oh, my poor, dear Marion. I am so
sorry.
He puts his arms around her.
BILL goes into the next room to write out the death certificate.
When he finishes, he returns to the bedroom where the engaged
couple sit, hand in hand, by the bed of the dead man.
The door-bell rings.
CARL
I'll get it.
While he is out of the room, Marion, with her eyes on the floor, says,
almost inaudibly:
MARION
I love you.
BILL merely pronounces her name tenderly.
BILL
Marion.
CARL returns with Marion's UNCLE and AUNT, whose
presence gives BILL the opportunity to make his goodbyes and leave.
At the door.
CARL
I hope we'll see you soon.
EXT MARION'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Bill walks outside. It has become even milder. A gentle breeze carries
[illegible] from the nearby park to the street. BILL inhales the fresh air.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOORMAN
Taxi?
BILL
No thanks. I think I'll walk for a bit.
EXT STREET TO PARK - NIGHT
Bill walking.
EXT PARK - NIGHT
Walking through the park, BILL notices on some of the benches in the
shadows, that couples are kissing, just as if Spring had actually
arrived and no danger lurked in the deceptive warm air.
A tramp lies full length on a bench wrapped in newspapers with his
hat over his face.
V.O.
The image of the tramp made him think
of the dead man he had just left,
and he shuddered and felt slightly
nauseated at the thought that decay
and decomposition had already begun
their work in the body he just left.
He was glad he was still alive and in all
probability that these ugly things were
still far removed from him, and that he
was, in fact, still in the prime of life,
had a beautiful wife and could have
several women in addition, if he wanted
to, although doing so would require
more free time than he had.
BILL notices a group of rowdy college boys coming towards him, six
of them taking up the whole walkway.
He moves aside to keep out of their way.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
But as they pass, one of them, a tall boy with an open overcoat,
deliberately bumps into him with his raised elbow.
BILL involuntarily stops.
The tall student takes two more steps and turns.
They glare at each other for a moment with only a short distance
separating them.
Suddenly, BILL turns around again and walks.
He hears a short laugh behind him.
He wants to turn around and fight but he feels his heart beating
strangely.
V.O.
Had he become a coward, he asked
himself, and noticed his knees were
shaking a little bit. Ridiculous! Why
should he get involved in a street fight
with some drunken college student who
had five friends with him.
BILL keeps walking without looking back.
He, a man of thirty-five, a practising
physician, a married man and father of
a child. He might wind up in the
hospital or worse and tomorrow be in
the same position as the man he just
left.. Then he thought about his
profession? There were dangers lurking
there, too, everywhere and at all times -
except that one usually forgets about
them.
EXT STREET - ON WAY DOMINO - NIGHT
BILL walking.
V.O.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surely, it had been nothing but
common sense to avoid a ridiculous
fight with the student... but if he ever
meet the Naval officer with whom
Alice...
JEALOUS FANTASY IMAGE - ALICE AND NAVAL OFFICER
V.O.
But what insanity! After all, nothing
happened... What was he thinking
about?... But then, wasn't it really just
as bad as if she had actually fucked him
- she might just as well have. Wasn't it
even worse, in a way. What a joy it
would be to teach _him_ a lesson.
EXT STREET - DOMINO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Bill passes a young girl, DOMINO, who falls into step beside him.
DOMINO
Hi.
BILL slows down and looks at her. She is very pretty with dark red
lips.
BILL
Hi.
DOMINO
How're you doing?
BILL
Fine. How are you doing?
DOMINO
I'm doing great...Listen, how would you
like to have a little fun?
BILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sorry?
DOMINO
Have a little fun. Come inside with me?
I just live over there.
She points to a nearby doorway.
BILL a little off balance.
BILL
Come inside with you?
DOMINO
Yes. It's a lot nicer than it is out here.
BILL
Do you live there?
DOMINO
Yes.
BILL
By yourself?
DOMINO
I have a roommate but she's not
home.
She gently takes his arm.
DOMINO
It's okay - no one will bother us.
BILL smiles, uncertainly.
DOMINO
Really, it's okay. Come on.
BILL allows himself to be led to the door.
DOMINO (gently)
Come on.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INT DOMINO APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT
She leads BILL through the small, dingy entrance lobby lit by a
flickering fluorescent tube to a ground-floor rear apartment.
BILL
Should we talk about the money?
DOMINO
How does sixty sound?
BILL nods, a little uncomfortably.
BILL
Sixty. Sounds good.
DOMINO laughs.
DOMINO (laughs)
I don't keep track of the time.
She unlocks the door and they go inside.
It's a clean, reasonably tidy, ex cold-water railway flat.
The girl smiles sweetly, and walks ahead of BILL into the narrow
bedroom where there is a neatly made king-size bed without a
bedspread..
BILL
By the way, what's your name?
DOMINO
Domino.
BILL
Domino. That's an unusual name.
DOMINO
Well, it's my, uh...professional name.
BILL
Right.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOMINO
And what's your name?
Bill hesitates.
BILL
Bill.

DOMINO
Hi, Bill.
BILL
Hi, Domino.
DOMINO
Would you like a drink or some grass?
BILL
No thanks. I'm fine.
She puts on some music.
BILL
Nice little place.
DOMINO
Yes, it's okay.
BILL
Is this really your place?
DOMINO
That's the second time you asked.
BILL
No, it just that I was under the
impression that most girls didn't use
their own apartment - too much hassle.
DOMINO
That's true but I don't do this that
much.
BILL
Oh, how's that?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOMINO
I only work when I get too far behind
with my student loan.
BILL is a little surprised.
BILL
What are you school are you going to?
DOMINO
NYU.
BILL
NYU. What are you studying?
DOMINO
Sociology.
BILL
Good sociology department?
DOMINO
Pretty good. Ever hear of Pearlstein
and Johnson?
BILL
To be honest, I'm not much into
sociology.
She slowly starts to undress.
DOMINO
What do you do?
BILL
I'm a doctor?
DOMINO
A doctor?
BILL
Yes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOMINO
GP?
BILL
Yes.
DOMINO
My father's a GP.
BILL (laughs)
No kidding? I hope I don't know him.
DOMINO (laughs)
He practises in New Jersey.
BILL
New Jersey..
She steps out of her panties and tosses them on the table.
BILL
Listen, I know it's a little late for this
but do you mind if I ask how old you
are?
She stands naked before him with her arms outstretched.
DOMINO
How old do you think?
BILL
Well, to be honest, I would have said
sixteen or seventeen but obviously if
you're going to college... eighteen?
DOMINO (laughs)
Nineteen.
She puts her arms around his neck again and gazes into his eyes.
DOMINO
Well, shall we?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Bleep-bleep_.
BILL's cellular phone.
_Bleep-bleep_
He fumbles in his pockets for the phone and DOMINO has to get off
his lap for him to get it out.
BILL
Hello?
It's ALICE.
BILL
Hi, honey. Yes, everything's okay... I'm
not sure... We're waiting for some
relatives to show up... It could be late...
No, don't wait up. Can't really talk...
Okay, as soon as I can... Same here.
He disconnects and puts the phone back in his pocket.
DOMINO
Was that Mrs Doctor Bill?
BILL thinks for a moment and nods. Then he sighs and gets to his feet.
DOMINO (not a question)
You have to go.
BILL
I'm afraid so.
DOMINO
What a shame.
He gets out his wallet and starts to count out sixty dollars.
DOMINO
Oh, look, you don't have to...
BILL
No, that's all right.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOMINO
Really. It's okay.
BILL
No, no. Listen, we need more good sociologists.
They both laugh.
DOMINO
Okay but you've got a raincheck.
BILL
That's deal.
EXT STREET TO CAFE SONATA - NIGHT
BILL walks aimlessly through the wintry night.
V.O.
Where shall I go now, he asked himself?
The obvious thing was home to bed.
But he couldn't persuade himself to do
that.
He thought of going back to the girl
but that somehow seemed ridiculous
now.
He was overcome with a sense that he
was moving farther and farther away
from his everyday existence into a
completely different world.

By the chance, he passes a small nightclub, Cafe Sonata, and
notices Nick Nightingale's name and photograph outside.
He stops and looks at it.
The DOORMAN drifts over.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOORMAN
The band's about to wind up but
they're still serving.
BILL nods and goes in.
INT CAFE SONATA - NIGHT
The place is about a quarter full. BILL sits down at a table near the
band.
Nick sees him and winks.
BILL gestures hello, orders a beer.
The band finishes their last number and take a perfunctory bow to a
scattering of applause.
NICK comes over to the table.
NICK
Hey, Bill!
They shake hands and ad-libs of greetings.
The WAITER swoops in with BILL's beer.
BILL
What are you drinking?
NICK
Scotch and soda.
The WAITER nods and hurries off.
NICK
So what brings you out at this
hour?
BILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just happened to be passing by. I have
a patient in the neighbourhood.
NICK
Do you live in the Village?
BILL
No, we've got an apartment on
Central Park West.
NICK
You're married?
BILL
Nine years.
NICK
That was the great looking woman
you were dancing with at the party?
BILL
Yes.
NICK
Lucky man.
BILL nods.
NICK
Any kids?
BILL
An eight year old daughter. How about
you?
NICK
I've got a wife and four boys in Seattle.
BILL
That's great. So is this your band?
NICK
No, I'm just filling in.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL
Who do you normally play with?
NICK
Anybody. Anywhere. As a matter of
fact, I've got another gig later tonight.
BILL
You're playing somewhere else
_tonight_?
NICK (shrugs)
They only get started there about two.
BILL
In the village?
NICK
I don't actually know the address yet.
BILL
How come?
NICK
It's in a different place every time, and I
only get it about an hour or so
beforehand.
BILL
A different place every time?
NICK
So far.
BILL (laughs)
What's the big mystery?
Nick opens his palms in a parody of innocence.
NICK
I just play the piano.
BILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What kind of a function is it?
NICK
What kind of a function is it?... Well, to
be completely honest, it's not easy to
describe.
BILL
But you've worked there before?
NICK
True.
BILL
And it's not easy to describe?
NICK
I play blindfolded.
BILL
What?
NICK
I play blindfolded.
Something near the entrance door attracts Nick's attention.
NICK (stands up)
Back in a minute.
He walks to the front window of the club and looks out into the
snowy street. He doesn't see what he's looking for and returns.
NICK
Sorry about that. I'm supposed to meet
somebody here.
BILL
With the address?
Nick shrugs, meaning, yes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL
Listen, you're putting me on about
that blindfolded business, aren't you.
NICK
No, that's the truth. They're very strict
about that.
BILL
This is getting curiouser and curiouser.
NICK
Maybe so, but listen, I was sworn to
secrecy, and please, just forget I said
anything at all about it.
BILL
Nick, you can trust me. I won't say a
word about this to anyone but since
you've told me this much, you can't
stop now.
NICK
No, really, this is not a joke. I'm not
saying anything else.
BILL
Nick, you can't do this to me. I'll
wonder about this for the rest of my
life. Trust me.
NICK is very uncomfortable about this but is also dying to talk about
it.
NICK
Okay, well this is just between us.
BILL
Absolutely.
NICK
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well...first of all, although I am
blindfolded I can of course still
hear...and the sounds...
NICK closes his eyes and lets the provocative innuendo sink in.
NICK
_And_...the last time the blindfold wasn't
tied on that well.
NICK also lets that sink in.
NICK
Bill...I've seen a few things in my life
but never anything like this... And I
have never seen such women.
BILL
What does it cost to get into this place?
NICK
Forget it.
BILL
What do you mean, forget it.
NICK
Forget it.
BILL
Look, I don't care what it costs.
NICK
It's not a matter of money. These
people aren't interested in money. It's
a completely closed affair.
BILL
_These_ _people_. Who are _these_ _people_?
NICK
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Put it this way - if I knew their names it
would be worth more than my life to
say them out loud.
BILL
Nick, don't you think you might just be
over-dramatising this a little bit?
There must be some way you can get
me in.
NICK (shakes his head)
It would be too dangerous.
BILL
Dangerous?
NICK
These are not people you fuck with - if
you'll pardon the pun.
Nick sees someone looking through the plate glass window.
NICK
I'll be right back.
He gets up and hurries outside to the street.
BILL watches him through the window, hunched up against the cold,
stamping his feet up and down, talking to a man and writing
something down.
Nick returns blowing on his hands.
Bill gives him and inquiring look.
BILL
Was that the address?
NICK
And the password.
BILL
Password?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NICK
Yes. You can't get in without the
password and they change it every
time.
And. listen, I'm going to have to get
weaving pretty soon.
BILL (said with a smile)
Nick, you son-of-a-bitch, you know
you are definitely going to have to take
me with you tonight. You know that,
don't you.
Nick sighs and shakes his head.
BILL
Look, I'll tell you what - you give me
the password and the address and I'll
go there by myself. There won't be the
slightest connection with you,
whatsoever.
NICK squirms.
NICK
Look, even if I were crazy enough to do
that, you couldn't get in the way you're
dressed, anyway.
BILL
Why not?
NICK
Everyone there is always masked and
in costume.
BILL
Masked and in costume?
NICK
Always.
Bill looks at his watch.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL
Okay. Point taken. _But_ there's a
possibility I know a place that might still
be open.
NICK
Bill, you're out of your mind. No
costume place would be open at this
time of night.
BILL
Look, Nick, what the hell. Just give me
a chance. Let me try. If I can't get the
gear I'll forget about the whole thing.
Scouts honour.
NICK looks ready to give in.
BILL
Okay?
NICK sighs in resignation.
BILL
Okay. So, let me have the address and
the password, and tell me what kind
of costume I need?
EXT BUSY GREENWICH VILLAGE STREET - NIGHT
BILL's taxi pulls up in front of a costume shop. A sign says: 'Formal
Dress and Costumes.
The place is closed.
BILL
Shit.
He thinks for a moment, pays the driver and gets out.
He notices a sign that says: "In case of emergency ring apartment 3."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He looks up and sees a light on in the apartment above the store.
He rings the bell for apartment 3, which has the name _Gibson_
After a couple of rings, a voice comes over the intercom.
GIBSON
Yes, what is it?
BILL talks to the TV security camera.
BILL
Mister Gibson?
GIBSON
What do you want?
BILL
Mister Gibson, I'm very sorry to disturb
you at this hour. I'm a Doctor. My
name is Harford. I need to see you. It's
important.
Bill holds up his New York State Medical Board card to the doorway
TV security camera.
GIBSON
Somebody hurt?
BILL
No one's hurt but it's important.
GIBSON
What kind of important?
BILL
It would really be better if I could come
upstairs for a moment and talk to you.
GIBSON
You better come back tomorrow.
BILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Gibson, tomorrow will be too
late. I really need to see you now. It
won't take long.
Silence.
Then the door buzzer sounds.
BILL pushes open the door and goes upstairs two at a time.
A door opens on the chain and a man in his fifties, wearing flannel
pyjamas and a heavy bathrobe, who has the looks and manner of a
road-company ham actor peers out.
BILL
Mr. Gibson?
GIBSON
Yes.
BILL holds up his New York State medical card again.

BILL
Good evening, Mister Gibson. This is
my New York State Medical Board card,
just so you know who I am.
Gibson looks at the card and at BILL.
GIBSON
Okay, so you're Doctor Harford.
What's this all about?
BILL
Mister Gibson, you may not find it that
easy to understand the urgency of this,
but basically, uhm... I need...a
costume and a tux ...
Gibson stares at him in disbelief.
GIBSON
You need a costume and a tux?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL
Yes.
GIBSON
I'm sorry, but do you honestly expect
me to open my shop for you, at this
hour?
BILL
I can imagine how this may seem to
you, Mister Gibson, and I am
prepared to pay an extra two hundred
dollars for the inconvenience.
Gibson doesn't reply.
BILL
How does that sound to you?
Judging from his expression, this sounds pretty good to Mr. Gibson.
INT COSTUME SHOP - NIGHT
A short while later, Gibson leads BILL through the shop to the dimly lit
costume section.
GIBSON
Okay, now let me get this straight. You
want a tuxedo, a black monk's cassock
and a mask that completely covers your
face?
BILL
That's it.
GIBSON
I have to tell you doctor, I've had some
very strange requests in my day and
this is certainly one of them.
BILL
It's for a good cause.
GIBSON
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, you're the doctor.
GIBSON chuckles at his own witticism.
GIBSON
Now, let me get this straight. You want
a tuxedo, a monks cassock and a mask
that completely covers your face?
BILL
That's it.
Suddenly BILL hears the clink of glasses from somewhere ahead of
him.
GIBSON flips a light switch.
A light come on in a little office at the end of the passage.
The desk is covered with plates, glasses and bottles.
Two JAPANESE MEN, wearing blonde female wigs, naked except for
Japanese kimonos, spring up from their chairs besides the desk.
At the same moment, the semi-naked figure of a graceful GIRL
disappears under the desk.
GIBSON rushes forward with long strides, reaches across the desk
and grabs one of the blond wigs.
Simultaneously, the young GIRL, maybe fourteen, wriggles out from
under the desk and runs along the passage to BILL who catches her in
his arms.
GIBSON drops the wig and grabs the two kimono garbed men.
At the same time he calls out to BILL.
GIBSON
Hold on to that girl for me, please.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GIRL presses against BILL as if now sure of her protection. Her
pretty little face covered with powder and a smile of impish desire in
her eyes.
GIBSON (shouts)
Gentlemen, you will stay here while I
call the police.
KIMONO 1
Gibson, have you gone mad?
KIMONO 2
We were invited by the young lady.
GIBSON
You will have to explain this. Couldn't
you see the girl is unbalanced?
Then GIBSON he turns to BILL.
GIBSON
Sorry to keep you waiting.
BILL
That's okay.
BILL looks down with fascination at the GIRL, who looks up at him
with alluring and childlike eyes, as if spellbound.
The two KIMONO MEN start to argue with each other in Japanese..
GIBSON turns to BILL.
GIBSON
I'm sorry, did you say a brown or black
cassock?
BILL
Black.
YOUNG GIRL (with gleaming eyes)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
No. You must give this gentleman a
cloak lined with ermine and a doublet
of red silk.
GIBSON (to girl)
Don't you budge from there.
(to Bill)
What size are you?
BILL
I take a 38 jacket.
GIBSON picks up a brown monk's cassock hanging nearby and holds
it up for BILL'S approval.
GIBSON
This will fit you.
BILL
Fine.
GIBSON
Okay, let's go and try on the tux..
The two Japanese men are still in the glass partitioned
office.
_GIBSON locks them in._
KIMONO 1
Gibson, this is preposterous!! You will
have to let us out at once.
GIBSON
I'm afraid that's out of the question,
gentlemen. This is now a police matter.
You will kindly wait here until I return.
Ad-libs of further protest from the two men
The girl skips lightly up the stairs ahead of them.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIBSON
Now go to bed at once, you depraved
creature. I'll talk to you as soon as I've
settled with those two.
The girl gives BILL a sad shake of her head and exits.
INT FRONT OF COSTUME SHOP - A LITTLE LATER
Bill has changed into a black tuxedo and waits for Gibson to write up
the bill. His clothes and the costume are in two large plastic shopping
bags.
GIBSON
Okay - that's a hundred and fifty for
the rental. Three hundred deposit. And
the two hundred inconvenience money.
That's six hundred and fifty bucks..
BILL
Okay.
BILL hands him his credit card and his driver's license.
GIBSON
I'd prefer cash.
BILL
Sorry, I don't carry that kind of
money.
Gibson takes the credit card.
BILL
Thanks. And - by the way - I hope you
wont be too hard on the child.
GIBSON
I'm sorry doctor but I'm not sure what
business it is of yours.
BILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, it's just that I first heard you say
the girl was unbalanced, and then you
called her depraved. Those things are
a little contradictory.
GIBSON (a bit theatrically)
Well, aren't insanity and depravity
the same in the eyes of God?
The last thing BILL wants right now is to get into an argument with
GIBSON, so he replies in his most professional manner.
BILL
Well, in any event, there _are_ things
that can be done that might help the
situation. Maybe we can have another
talk about it tomorrow.
Gibson laughs mockingly without uttering a sound.
EXT STREET OUTSIDE COSTUME SHOP - NIGHT
Bill, carrying two plastic shopping bags with his clothes in them, hails
a taxi.
He checks at a slip of paper with the address on it.
BILL
How do you feel about going out to
Sands Point Long Island?
The driver makes a face.
BILL
How about twenty bucks over the
meter?
CAB DRIVER (shakes his head)
I'll have to come back empty.
BILL
How's fifty?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAB DRIVER
Fifty's good.

Bills Thoughts: Variations of, "I must be
mad."
EXT LONG ISLAND MANSION ROAD - NIGHT
The cab drives slowly down a wooded road.
INT CAB
BILL looking out for the house.
Up ahead, he sees a stretch-limo with darkened windows pulling into
a drive protected by iron gates flanked by two gatehouses.
As they drive slowly past the gates, BILL sees a sign that says,
'Bletchly Manor'.
BILL
Okay, driver - that's the place.
Stop a little way down the road.
The car comes to a stop.
The meter says $75.50
BILL takes out his wallet.
BILL
Okay, here's eighty dollars and...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL carefully tears a hundred-dollar bill in half and gives one part to
the driver.
BILL
...I promised you fifty bucks over the
meter but I'll make it a hundred if you
wait for me. Let the meter run and
you'll get the other half plus the meter
when I come back... Okay?
The driver gives BILL a wary look.
CAB DRIVER
How long will you be?
BILL
That's the thing - I'm not sure. I
could be ten minutes. I could be an
hour or so. But look, I'm leaving all my
stuff in the back. Okay?
The cab driver takes half of the torn hundred-dollar bill.
CAB DRIVER
Okay.
BILL gets out of the cab, puts on the monk's cassock, throws his coat
over his shoulders and walks back to the gates.
EXT GATES - NIGHT
The iron gates are closed and no one is in sight.
Security cameras look at him.
The road leading to the Manor House curves away into a small wood
which covers the house.
BILL rings a bell at the side of the gate and two men promptly
come out of the gate house.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GATEMAN 1 (polite and well-spoken)
Good morning, sir.
BILL
Good morning.
GATEMAN 1
Can we be of any help you?
BILL
I suppose you'd like the password?
GATEMAN 1
If you wouldn't mind, sir.
BILL (slowly)
Fidelio Rainbow.
GATEMAN 1
Thank you, sir.
The gate is opened.
GATEMAN 1
Is that your taxi down there, sir?
BILL
Uh - yes. Yes - my chauffeur came
down with the flu at the last minute.
GATEMAN 1
The cabby could have driven you right
to the door.
BILL
Listen, I'm lucky I got here at all. The
guy's straight from Bulgaria.
Bill laughs uncomfortably without getting a penny's change from the
men.
GATEMAN 1 (pointing a car)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you'd like to get in the car, sir. We'll
run you up to the house.
BILL
Okay. Thanks.
They get into the car.
Gateman 2 remains at the gate.
INT CAR
Bill sits silently next to the driver.
POV - THE LONG ISLAND - MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT
INT CAR
GATEMAN 1 (tactfully)
This might be a good time to put on
your mask, sir.
BILL (casually)
Oh, yes. Of course.
BILL takes the mask from his pocket and puts it on.
EXT MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT
The car pulls up and BILL gets out.
BILL
Thanks.
He walks up the stone steps and the front doors are opened before
he reaches them.
INT HOUSE
BILL enters a large, candlelit, mirrored vestibule where two servants
in black suits, their faces covered by grey masks, whisper in unison:
SERVANTS
Password?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL
Fidelio Rainbow.
SERVANT 1
Thank you, sir.
One of them takes his coat, while the other opens a door.
BILL enters a long room, dimly lit with candles, with high ceilings and
walls covered with black silk.
A line of mirrored doors on each side run the length of the room.
There are about fifty men and women dressed as monks and nuns,
their faces completely covered by masks.
Gently swelling strains of Italian liturgical music comes from an organ
playing somewhere.
As his eyes become accustomed to the dim light, BILL sees that the
women are naked beneath the full-length, black veils that flow down
from their head bands.
His eyes wander from voluptuous bodies to slender bodies, from
delicate to richly developed figures, and he is filled with inexpressible
desire.
Occasionally, eyes turn towards him but immediately look away as
soon as he notices them.
A monk brushes against him and nods a greeting, but from behind
the mask BILL sense a searching and penetrating glance.
A strange, heavy perfume, as of southern gardens, pervades the
room.
Again an arm brushes against him, but this time it is that of a nun.
Her face is fully masked, and like the others, naked under the black
transparent lace of her veil.
THE WOMAN
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You don't belong here. There's still a
chance for you to get away.
BILL is momentarily unnerved by this but he is also completely
captivated by the beauty and sensuality of this woman.
BILL
I'm terribly sorry but I think you've
mistaken me for someone else.
THE WOMAN
Please don't be foolish about this. You
must leave at once.
BILL
Who are you?
THE WOMAN
It doesn't matter. You must go.
BILL
Will you come with me?
THE WOMAN
That's impossible.
BILL
Impossible?
THE WOMAN
Impossible.
BILL
Is there someplace else here we could
go?
THE WOMAN
Absolutely not. Please believe me, if
you are discovered it will go hard with
you.
BILL moves closer to her but she steps back.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANOTHER WOMAN
What's the matter. Why don't you
dance?
BILL sees two men watching him from another corner and suspects
that this woman has been sent to put him to the test.
He smiles.
BILL
I would love to dance.
But just at that moment, THE WOMAN returns.
She pretends that she has just noticed him and says in a voice that
can be heard by the two men.
THE WOMAN
Returned at last.
(she laughs)
All your efforts are useless. I know you.
Then turning to the other woman she whispers:
THE WOMAN
Let me have him first - just for a while.
The other woman smiles agreement, and with a light step goes to join
the two men who have been watching.
THE WOMAN
Don't ask any questions, and don't be
surprised at anything. I have tried to
lead them astray but you can't fool
them for much longer. Go before it is
too late, - and be careful that no one
follows you. No one must know who
you are. There would be no more
peace for you. Go!
BILL
[illegible]?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE WOMAN
There is no way.
He takes her hand and draws her closer to him.
BILL
I must see you again.
She whispers, despairingly
THE WOMAN
Go.
BILL
Is there no way I can ever see you
again.
THE WOMAN
No. We must never meet again. It
could cost your life and mine.
Just at that moment, a tall man stops before them, and with a slight
bow, courteous but imperative, says:
TALL MAN
Will you dance with me?
THE WOMAN hesitates but the TALL MAN puts his arm around her
waist and leads her away the adjoining room.
A moment later, a voice whispers behind BILL.
ELEGANT MAN
Password!
BILL turns around and sees two men.
One, heavy-set, the other, slim and elegant.
ELEGANT MAN
Password!
BILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fidelio Rainbow.
ELEGANT MAN
That's right, sir. That's the password
for admittance, but may I ask what is
the password for the house?
BILL is stuck. He takes a deep breath..
ELEGANT MAN
Won't you be kind enough to tell me
the password of the house?
This time it sounds like a threat.
BILL can't think of anything to say. He shakes his head and shrugs.
BILL
Sorry. It looks like I must have
forgotten it.
The elegant man walks to the middle of the room and raises his hand.
Everything gradually comes to a stop.
Blindfolded, Nick stops playing when someone places a hand on his
shoulder and whispers something to him.
With all eyes on him, the two men walk back to BILL.
ELEGANT MAN
The password, sir! I must demand that
you give it.
BILL
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I've told
you, I must have forgotten it.
ELEGANT MAN
That's unfortunate. For here it doesn't
matter whether you have forgotten it or
if you never knew it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The rest of the men slowly gather around BILL.
BILL
Well, gentlemen, I seem to owe you
all an apology.
ELEGANT MAN
It is too late for apologies.
BILL
Well, be that as it may, you have my
most sincere regrets for not
remembering the second password.
ELEGANT MAN
I'm afraid this is not a question of
regret but of _expiation_.
BILL
Well, gentlemen, you must excuse me
now. I am leaving.
ELEGANT MAN
I'm afraid that is no longer possible.
BILL
Gentlemen, don't you think this farce
has gone far enough?
BILL looks for a way out but no one makes way for him.
ELEGANT MAN
You will kindly remove your mask.
BILL looks around at the masked faces surrounding him.
ELEGANT MAN (sharply)
Please remove your mask.
BILL slowly removes his mask and puts it in his pocket.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE WOMAN
I am ready to redeem him.
There is a murmur of surprise in the room.
THE WOMAN reaches for the veil, which is wrapped around her
head, face and neck and unwinds it with a wonderful circular
movement.
It sinks to the floor, leaving her naked, her dark hair falling in great
profusion over her shoulders, breasts and hips.
ELEGANT MAN
You are ready to redeem him?
THE WOMAN
Yes, I am.
There is a low gasp from the assemblage.
ELEGANT MAN
You know what you're taking upon
yourself in doing this?
THE WOMAN
Yes.
Another murmur from the room.
The elegant man turns back to BILL.
ELEGANT MAN
You are free. Leave this house at
once. But first I must warn you that if
you make any further inquiries or
inform anyone about what you have
seen here tonight, there will be the
most serious consequences for yourself
and your family. Do you understand
that?
BILL doesn't reply immediately.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL
How is this woman to redeem me?
ELEGANT MAN
That has nothing to do with you.
BILL shakes his head.
BILL
I can't let this woman pay for me.
ELEGANT MAN
You would be unable, in any case, to
change her fate. When a promise has
been made here, there is no turning
back.
THE WOMAN
_Go! You cannot save me._
As she says this, she tears off the mask, allowing BILL a momentary
glimpse of her face.
Then he is seized by irresistible arms and pushed out.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INT BILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
It is four o'clock in the morning.
BILL, now changed back into his own clothes, enters his apartment.
Everyone is asleep.
He goes into his study and locks the costume and tux in a closet.
In order not to wake ALICE, he undresses before going into the
bedroom.
BEDROOM
ALICE is asleep, lying with her arms folded under her head
Her lips are half open and painful shadows surround them.
It is a face BILL does not know.
He bends down over her, and at once her forehead becomes lined
with furrows, as though someone had touched it, and her features
seem strangely distorted.
Suddenly, still in her sleep, she laughs so shrilly that he becomes
alarmed.
BILL (involuntarily)
Alice.
She laughs again, as if in answer, in a strange, almost uncanny
manner.
BILL
Alice?
She opens her eyes, slowly and with difficulty.
She stares at him, as though she does not recognise him.
BILL (softly)
Alice?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As she wakes up, an expression of fear, even of terror comes into her
eyes.
Half awake, and seemingly in despair, she raises her arms.
BILL
What's the matter?
ALICE stares at him, still frightened.
BILL
Alice, it's me.
ALICE breathes deeply, tries to smile, drops her arms on the blanket.
ALICE (in a far away voice)
Is it morning yet?
BILL
It will be very soon. It's a little past
four o'clock. I've just come home.
She nods but barely seems to have heard or understood him.
She stares into space, as though she can see through him.
He bends over and touches her forehead.
She shudders slightly.
BILL
What's the matter?
She shakes her head slowly and he passes his hand gently over her
hair.
BILL
Alice, you laughed so strangely.
What's the matter?
ALICE (distantly)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've been dreaming.
BILL (gently)
What have you been dreaming?
ALICE
Oh, so much, I can't quite
remember.
BILL (gently)
Perhaps if you try.
ALICE
It was all so confused - and I'm tired.
You must be tired, too.
BILL
Not really. I don't think I'll go to
bed at all. You know, sometimes when
I come home so late it's better to just
go straight to work.
ALICE nods without interest.
BILL
But why don't you tell me about
your dream?
He smiles a little artificially.
ALICE
You really ought to lie down and
take a little rest.
BILL hesitates a moment, then he stretches himself beside her, though
he is careful not to touch her.
They lie there silently with open eyes, and they feel both their
closeness and the distance that separates them.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a while he raises his head on his arm and looks at her for a long
time, as though he can see much more than just the outlines of her
face.
BILL
Tell me about your dream.
Bill says this, once more, as if she had been waiting for his invitation.
She holds out her hand to him, he takes it, and as he had often done
before, he holds it and plays with her slender fingers, more absent-
mindedly than tenderly.
ALICE sighs and begins to speak uncertainly.
ALICE
I think it started in my parents house.
They weren't there. I was alone. That
surprised me because our wedding was
the next day and I didn't have a
wedding dress.
Then you and I were floating above a
ancient city. It was a kind of crazy mix
of ancient architectural styles.
Oriental, Egyptian, Greek and Roman
architecture. And it was completely
deserted. The streets were empty - no
people, no animals. And I remember
thinking, so this is our honeymoon.
Then it was night and the sky was so
full of stars, and so blue and wide it
seemed like it was painted. You said it
was the ceiling of our bridal chamber
and you took me in your arms and
made love to me and said you would
love me forever.
BILL
I hope you loved me, too.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL says this with an invisible, malicious smile.
ALICE
Even more than you did me. We
made love and it was wonderful,
though there was a sadness to it, and a
presentment of sorrow.
Suddenly it was morning and we were
somewhere in the strange city.
We were still completely alone. But
something terrible had happened - our
clothes were gone. I was terrified as I
had never been before, and felt such a
burning shame that it almost consumed
me.
At the same time I was furious with
you because I thought it was your fault.
And this sensation of terror, shame and
fury was more intense than any
emotion I had ever felt before.
You felt guilty and rushed away naked,
to go and get clothes for us.
As soon as you were gone I felt
wonderful. I neither felt sorry for you,
or worried about you. It was heavenly
to be alone.
I was lying in a lush garden, stretched
out naked in the sunlight, and I was far
more beautiful than I ever was in
reality.
And while I lay there, a young man
walked out of the woods. He was the
young Naval officer I told you about
from the hotel.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He looked different but I knew it was
him. He stopped in front of me and
looked at me searchingly.
I laughed seductively and wantonly, as
I have never laughed in my life, and he
held out his arms to me and sank down
beside me.
ALICE falls silent. BILLS throat is parched. In the darkness of the room
he can see she has concealed her face in her hands.
BILL
A strange dream, but that's not the
end, is it?
ALICE doesn't reply.
BILL
Was that the end?
ALICE
No.
BILL
Then why don't you tell me the rest of
it?
ALICE
It's not easy. Some things are not easy
to say.
BILL
It's was only a dream.
ALICE sighs and continues, hesitantly.
ALICE
He looked at me...and slowly took me
in his arms...and we began making
love.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALICE (continuing)
I seemed to live through countless
days and nights - there was neither
time nor space. And the more we
made love the more our hunger for
each other increased.
And just as that earlier feeling of terror
and shame went beyond anything I had
ever felt, so nothing can be compared
with the freedom and happiness and
the..._desire_ that I now felt.
Then I realized there other couples
around us - hundreds of them, and
they too were making love.
Then I was making love to the other
men, and as soon as my longing was
satisfied with one, I wanted another.
I can't say how many I was with.
And yet I didn't for one moment forget
you. And all this time, you were
buying the most beautiful clothes and
jewellery you could find for me.
Then you were being followed by a
crowd of people who were shouting
threats. Then you were seized by
soldiers, and there were also priests
among them. Somebody - a gigantic
person, tied your hands. You were still
naked.
I knew you were going to be crucified
but I felt no sympathy for you. I still
blamed you for everything that had
happened.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I felt that I was far removed from you
but I knew you could see me naked in
the arms of countless men in this sea
of nakedness which foamed around
me.
The soldiers began to whip you and
blood flowed down you in streams. I
saw it without feeling any surprise or
pity.
Then you smiled at me as if to show
you had fulfilled my wish and bought
me everything I wanted. But I thought
your actions were ridiculous and I
wanted to make fun of you - to laugh in
your face.
They began to nail you to the cross
and I hoped that you would be able to
hear my laughter. And so I laughed as
shrill and loud as I could... That must
have been the laugh that you heard
when I woke up.
Neither of them moves or says anything. Any remark at this moment
would seem futile.
BILL realizes he is still holding ALICE'S hand.
She remains silent and motionless.
Ready as he is to hate her, his feeling of tenderness for these slender,
cool fingers is unchanged except that it is more acute.
Involuntarily, he gently presses his lips on the familiar hand before
he lets it go.
ALICE'S eyes are closed and there is the trace of a happy, innocent
smile playing about her mouth.
He feels an incomprehensible desire to make love to her.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He rolls over and puts his arm around her but then checks himself.
He stretches himself out beside ALICE, who now seems asleep.
As he closes his eyes, he thinks:
V.O.
Whore of her dreams.
There is now a sword between us.
We are lying here like mortal enemies.
INT BILL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN
BILL rises at 6 o'clock and dresses while ALICE is still asleep.
He has only had a couple of hours sleep and looks awful.
HELENA'S BEDROOM
On his way out he stops off in his daughter's room. She is asleep in
her bed. He kisses her on the forehead.
STUDY
He collects his costume and leaves.
EXT CAFE SONATA - DAY
Taxi pulls up and BILL gets out.
He takes a cab to the Cafe Sonata where he met Nick Nightingale.
It is closed but he peers in through the window and sees the chairs
are stacked on the tables and the place is being cleaned.
He taps on the glass.
After a couple of "we're closed" wave-offs from the manageress
working at a table in the back, the door is finally opened by one of
the cleaners.
BILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning. I'd like to have a quick
word with the manager, if I may.
CLEANING LADY
Someone for you, Vicki.
MANAGERESS
Okay.
Bill walks to the table she is seated at.
BILL
Good morning.
MANAGERESS
What can I do for you?
BILL
It's very important that I get in touch
with Nick Nightingale.
MANAGERESS
He'll be in tonight.
BILL
It's something I need to see him about
this morning.
MANAGERESS
It's not our policy to give out employees
addresses.
BILL
Of course. I completely understand. But
I'm a doctor...
(shows her his medical card)
...and this is a personal medical matter
I know he'll want to know about as
soon as possible.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXT HOTEL JASON - DAY
BILL's taxi pulls up. It's a small, mid-town hotel.
INT - LOBBY
There is no one in the lobby except for the DESK CLERK, a man in
his early thirties, reading a paperback.
BILL
Good morning.
DESK CLERK
Good morning, sir. How can I help
you?
BILL
Can you ring Mr. Nightingale's room
for me, please?
The DESK CLERK gives him a strange look.
BILL (smiles)
Nick Nightingale?
DESK CLERK
I'm sorry, sir, but he's checked out.
The DESK CLERK has a slight, gay lisp.
BILL
He checked out?
DESK CLERK
Yes.
BILL
Did he leave a forwarding address?
DESK CLERK
No, I'm afraid not.
BILL
When did he check out?
DESK CLERK
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
About five o'clock this morning.
BILL
Five o'clock. That's a pretty early
check out, isn't it?
DESK CLERK
It is a little bit on the early side.
BILL
Did you happen to notice whether
there was there anything strange
about him when he left?
DESK CLERK
You aren't a detective, by any chance?
BILL
No, I'm a doctor. Nick and I are old
friends.
DESK CLERK
Well, since you ask, there _was_
something very strange about the way
Mr. Nightingale left.
BILL
What was that?
DESK CLERK
Well, he came in at about four-
thirty a.m. There were two men with
him - _big-guys_.
The DESK CLERK bends his elbows and clenches his fists to
make a 'big-guy' gesture.
DESK CLERK
And I noticed he had a bruise on his
cheek I'm sure he didn't have the night
before.
The two men with him were
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
well-dressed and well-spoken, but they
weren't the kind of people you'd want
to fool around with, if you know what I
mean.
Mr. Nightingale said he would be
checking out and went up to his room
with one of the men.
The other one stayed in the lobby and
settled his bill, which was a couple of
weeks overdue.
When they came down, I thought Mr.
Nightingale looked...well - _scared_.
Very scared, if you ask me.
He tried to pass me an envelope but
they saw him and took it away and
said any mail or messages for him
would be collected by a person properly
authorised to do so. When they took
him outside, I could see there was a
car waiting for them.
BILL
No idea where they might have gone?
DESK CLERK
None at all.

BILL enters.
INT COSTUME SHOP - DAY
GIBSON
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah-hhh, the good doctor.
BILL
Good afternoon.

GIBSON
Did you enjoy your evening?
BILL
Yes, it was fine.
BILL hands him the clothes. Gibson carefully takes the them out of
the bag and lays them out on the counter to check them.
GIBSON
I think you've forgotten the mask.
BILL
Oh - isn't it there?
GIBSON
It's not here. Maybe you left it at the
party.
BILL
I don't know. I must have lost it. Just
put it on the bill.
GIBSON
Okay and if it turns up just bring it in
and I'll give you a refund?
BILL
Fine.
BILL watches as GIBSON writes up the bill.
BILL
I wonder if this might be a good time to
have a word or two about your
daughter?
The question a peculiar expression about Gibson's nostrils.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIBSON
A word or two about my daughter?
BILL speaks with outstretched fingers resting on the desk.
BILL
Well, it's just that last night I think you
said that your daughter was not quite
normal, mentally. The situation in
which we found her certainly suggests
something like that. And since I took
part in it, or was at least a spectator, I
feel I should recommend that you to
get some medical advice.
GIBSON smiles at BILL, insolently.
GIBSON
And I suppose you yourself would like
to take charge of the treatment?
At this moment, a door which leads to one of the inner rooms opens,
and a young man with a top-coat over his evening clothes steps out.
BILL recognises him as one of the KIMONO men from the night
before.
He also catches a glimpse of the YOUNG GIRL, in bra and panties
getting dressed, behind him before the door closes.
The KIMONO MAN
seems taken aback when he sees BILL, but he regains his composure
at once.
He lights a cigarette with a match from Gibson's counter, waves
goodbye and leaves the shop.
BILL
So that's how it is.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIBSON (with perfect equanimity)
What did you say?
BILL
Last night you were going to call the
police.
GIBSON
We've come to another arrangement.
Gibson slides the credit-card slip across the desk.
BILL looks it over.
GIBSON
Okay. It's a hundred and fifty for the
basic rental. Two hundred for the
inconvenience. Twenty five for the
mask. And I've credited the three
hundred deposit. Okay?
BILL nods.
GIBSON
And if the doctor should ever want
anything again...
(smiles)
...it needn't be a monk's costume.

59th street Bridge.
L.I. Express way.
EXT LONG ISLAND MANSION - DAY
When the cab arrives there, nothing suspicious is in sight, no cars or
pedestrians.
It stops a little past the house and BILL gets out and walks to the
gates.
The big gates are locked and there is no one in sight.
He hears the faint whine of the zoom lens motor on one of the
surveillance cameras.
He looks up anxiously but is determined to carry out his inquiry.
He rings the bell mounted on one of the gate pillars.
He hears the motor of another surveillance camera, as it pans on to
him.
He waits.
A few moments later, a car slowly approaches down the road from
the house and stops at the gate.
An elderly servant gets out and walks slowly to the gate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He holds a letter and without a word pushes it through the iron bars
to BILL, whose heart is beating wildly.
BILL
For me?
The servant nods, walks back to the car and drives back up the road.
BILL looks at the envelope and sees: 'Dr. William Harford' written on
it in a neat, dignified handwriting.
_How did they know his name_?
He opens the envelope and unfolds a sheet of writing paper.
Give up your inquiries which are completely useless, and consider
these words a second warning. We hope, for your own good, that
this will be sufficient.
BILL stands there looking at the note.
EXT CAB - DAY
Driving back to New York
INT CAB - DAY
BILL looks up from the letter, thoughtfully.
V.O.
Second warning -? Why the second
warning - and not the last?.
The tone of the note was strangely
reserved and seemed to show that the
people who sent it by no means felt
secure.
The note disappointed him, though, in a
way, it reassured him, just why he
couldn't say.
But, at least, he now felt the woman
had come to no real harm, and that it
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
would be possible to find her if he went
about it cautiously and cleverly.
INT BILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
BILL is eating. ALICE and HELENA with him, keeping him company at
the table..
Some simple, natural dialog will be worked out for the action, over
which the V.O. will be heard.
V.O.
He had gone home, feeling a little
tired but surprisingly cheerful, with a
strange sense of security, which
somehow seemed deceptive.
He was in an excited and cheerful mood
and he felt unusually fresh and clear in
spite of spending the last two nights
without sleep
At the same time, he felt that all this
order, this normality, all the security of
his existence, was nothing but deception
and delusion.
POV of ALICE smiling.
And, he thought, there she sits with an
angelic look, like a good wife and
mother - the whore of her dreams who
made love to a hundred men the
preceding night and laughed when he
was crucified, and to his surprise he
didn't hate her.
ALICE
Do you have to go out tonight?
BILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm afraid so. I've got some patients to
see in the hospital.
EXT MARION'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
BILL gets out of a cab..
INT MARION'S LOBBY - NIGHT
He meets, her fiance, Carl, on his way out. Carl holds out his hand
cordially and they exchange greetings.
BILL
How is Marion?
CARL
Only so-so.
BILL
I was hoping she would have begun to
come to terms with things by now.
Carl shakes his head..
CARL
She's taken it very hard. And when
came for the body...it was just terrible.
BILL (nods)
I suppose her relatives are with her
now?
CARL
No, they won't be coming until tonight.
She'll be very glad to have some
company. I'm taking her to stay with
my mother in Connecticut tomorrow.
BILL (nods)
That's probably just what she needs.
CARL (putting out his hand)
Well, good to see you again. It's
unbelievable how much there is to do
to arrange a funeral.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INT MARION'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Marion opens the door.
She is dressed in black. Her face becomes slightly flushed.
MARION (smiling wearily)
You made me wait a long time.
BILL
I'm sorry, Marion. This was a
particularly busy day for me.
In the living room, Marion smiles and offers him a seat on the couch,
sitting down next to him.
BILL takes her hand in his and looks at her warmly.
She makes little attempt to hide her desperate love.
BILL
I bumped into Carl downstairs. He said
you're going to Connecticut tomorrow.
She gazes into his eyes, mournfully.
MARION
I won't go if you don't want me to.
BILL gives her a long look, leans forward and kisses her on the lips.
They embrace and fall back on the couch.
MARION
Oh, Bill, I love you. I love you so much.
He kisses her and starts to fondle her breasts and other regions.
MARION (whimpers)
Oh, Bill, I love you. I love you.
BILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marion.
BILL just pronounces her name softly and continues to undo her
clothes.
Then she begins to weep.
BILL tries to ignore this but she doesn't stop.
BILL (whispers)
What's wrong?
At first, MARION doesn't reply.
BILL
What's wrong?
MARION (smiling through her tears)
Nothing.
BILL (coldly)
Nothing.
BILL sits up.
BILL
Martion, what is the matter?
MARION
Oh, Bill, it's just that it all seems so
hopeless.
BILL frowns.
MARION
What's going to happen to us?
This is definitely not what BILL had in mind and he looks away.
MARION
Are you angry with me for saying that?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL
No, of course not.
MARION
You are angry.
BILL
I'm not angry.
She rests her chin on his shoulder.
MARION
Oh, Bill... Say something nice to me. I
am so confused.
BILL doesn't move.
BILL
Marion, I guess this _is_ crazy. I'm a
happily married man with a child, and
you are engaged to Carl.
Marion's shoulders droop.

BILL
I'm sure the best thing for your to do is
to go Connecticut tomorrow with Carl
as you had planned. A complete
change of environment and the fresh
air will do you a world of good.
Marion sits motionless and tears begin to stream down her face.
BILL sits in silence for a few moments, feeling impatience rather than
sympathy.
Then he looks at his watch and gets to his feet.
BILL
Marion, my dear, much as I regret it...
He would gladly say something kinder to her, but finds it difficult to
do so.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL
If we don't see each other before the
wedding, let me offer you my most
sincere congratulations and best
wishes.
She doesn't move, as though she understands neither his
congratulations nor his farewell.
He holds out his hand but she refuses it, and he says almost
reproachfully:
BILL
I hope you'll keep in touch and let me
know how you are.
She sits there as if turned to stone.
BILL
Goodbye Marion.
He leaves the room, stopping for a second in the doorway, as though
giving her a last opportunity to call him back.
But she turns her head away.

parting a little to show her naked underneath.

mind but if it was more than cake,
there's nothing wrong with me.

Was this another and final sign that
everything he put his hand to was
bound to turn out a failure for him?
But why should it be. Wasn't the fact
that he had just escaped a possibly fatal
infection from the girl a good sign?
Everything now seemed so unreal; his
home, his wife, his child, his profession,
and even himself.
Bill felt choked with tears. He had not
slept for two days and his nerves were
gradually giving way.
He intentionally struck up a quicker
pace than he was in the mood for.

She leaves, taking away the menu.
BILL opens his eyes as wide as possible, arches his neck and drinks
some water. He looks terrible.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
He idly picks up the newspaper he just bought and starts to look
through it.
A story catches his eye.
EX-BEAUTY QUEEN IN HOTEL DRUGS OVERDOSE
Kelly Curran, 30, a former Miss Wisconsin, was
taken to New York Hospital this morning in critical
condition after taking a drugs overdose.
She was found unconscious when police broke into
her room at the San Carlos hotel after she failed to
respond to efforts to contact her.
The night manager told police she had returned to
the hotel at four o'clock in the morning accompanied
by two unidentified men.
V.O.
Four o'clock in the morning! The
same time he returned home!
And accompanied by _two men_!
Wasn't it two men who took Nick
Nightingale from his hotel only an hour
later?
There was no compelling reason to
believe that Kelly Curran and a certain
other woman were one and the same.
And yet - his heart throbbed and his
hand trembled.
BILL looks for the waitress to get his check.
At the same time, he notices the man who had been following him
sitting at another table.
The man slowly raises a newspaper, partly covering his face.
BILL pays his check.

At the door, he turns to look for the suspicious character at the table
but he is already gone.

He shows her his identity card.

Okay, thanks, Doctor. What did you

That's right.

I'm sorry, doctor, but I'm afraid she
died this afternoon.

Yes, at three-forty five, p.m.
BILL stares at her.
He feels strangely relieved.
BILL
Is the body in the hospital morgue?
INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR ON WAY TO MORGUE
BILL follows a black male orderly down a hospital corridor.
INT MORGUE
The morgue is a brightly lit, white-tiled room with six autopsy tables
and fifty numbered crypts.
There is no one else working in the room.
The black orderly checks a slip of paper and goes to that crypt.
He opens the door, slides out the pallet and pulls down the sheet
covering the body.
BILL stares down at the naked body of a young woman.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The orderly gives BILL an inquiring look. BILL nods and the orderly
crosses the room and lights a cigarette.
BILL lifts the woman's head a little.
Her face is white. Her half-closed eyes stare at him. The lower jaw
hangs down limply, the narrow upper lip is drawn up, revealing bluish
gums and a beautiful set of white teeth.
He gently lays her head back on the pallet.
His eyes follow the lines of her body.
He touches her forehead and her cheeks, her shoulders and her arms,
doing so as if compelled and directed to by an invisible power.
He twines his fingers about those of the corpse, and rigid as they are,
they seem to make an effort to move, to seize his hand.
He bends over her, as if magically attracted.
V.O.
Was this the woman he was seeking?
Were these the eyes that had shone at
him the day before with so much
passion?
Was this the alluring body for which,
only yesterday, he had felt such
agonising desire?
He bent lower, as if he could extract
an answer from the rigid features.
But he had only seen her face for an
instant, and he knew that if it were
_her_ face, and _her_ eyes, he would not,
could not - and in reality did not want
to know.
He also realized that from the time he
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
read the account in the newspaper, he
had imagined her as having the
features of his wife.
And he shuddered to realise that his
wife had constantly been in his mind's
eye as the woman he had been
seeking.
He frees his fingers from those of the corpse, and taking her thin
wrists, places the ice cold arms alongside the body very carefully.
He looks at the orderly.
BILL
Okay - thanks. I'm finished.
Bill watches the orderly slide the pallet back into the crypt and close
the door.
ORDERLY
Want to wash up, Doc?
He gestures to a row of sinks.
BILL
Thanks.
BILL goes over and carefully washes his hands with disinfectant.
His cellular phone goes off.
BILL
Hello... Yes... That's perfectly all
right... Okay... Oh, I guess about
twenty minutes... Okay... Goodbye.
EXT ZIEGLER MANSION - NIGHT
BILL's taxi pulls up.
There are only a few lights on inside, giving the house a more
sombre appearance from the night of the Christmas party.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The butler opens the door and takes BILL's coat.
Ziegler's assistant, HARRIS, appears.
HARRIS
Good evening, Dr. Harford.
BILL
Good evening.
HARRIS
Thank you for coming over so quickly.
BILL
What seems to be the problem?
HARRIS
I'm afraid I don't know. Will you follow
me, please?
BILL follows HARRIS. Their footsteps sound loud in the quiet house.
They stop in front of the library door and HARRIS knocks.
ZIEGLER (o.s.)
Come in.
HARRIS opens the door for BILL and closes it behind him, remaining
outside.
ZIEGLER gets up from an armchair and shakes hands.
ZIEGLER
Hi, Bill. Sorry to drag you over here at
this time of night.
BILL
No problem.
ZIEGLER
What are you drinking?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL
Well, I suppose a brandy would be
nice.
ZIEGLER (going to the bar)
It was lovely to see you and Alice the
other night.
BILL
It was a wonderful party and we had a
great time.
ZIEGLER
It's a shame you had to leave so early.
BILL
We hated to go but I had a couple of
early appointments.
ZIEGLER hands him his brandy and they touch glasses.
BOTH
Cheers.
BILL
Nice..
ZIEGLER
Napoleon, 1935.
BILL looks suitably impressed.
BILL
So - what seems to be the problem?
Someone under the weather?
ZIEGLER looks into his brandy glass.
ZIEGLER
Can I be frank, Bill?
BILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of course.
ZIEGLER
I'm afraid what I've got to say is a bit
awkward to talk about.
BILL
I'm your doctor.
ZIEGLER rotates his brandy.
ZIEGLER
This isn't a medical problem.
BILL
Oh.
ZIEGLER
No.
BILL looks at him, quizzically.
ZIEGLER nods and returns a tense smile.
ZIEGLER
I'm not exactly sure how to begin this.
But maybe the best thing is to just to
put the cards on the table and say that
I happen to know quite a lot about
what you've been doing for the past
twenty-four hours.
He lets this sink in.
BILL
Sorry, Victor but may I ask what the
hell are you're talking about?
ZIEGLER (quietly)
Bill, please believe me, I know this is
awkward - perhaps as awkward for
me as it is for you. Okay?
Bill says nothing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZIEGLER
Okay?... Now, the reason I wanted to
talk to you is that I think you may be
harbouring one or two
misapprehensions about last night,
which I would like to clear up.
Silence.
ZIEGLER
Okay. I think I should also tell you that
I was there. At the house.
ZIEGLER says this in a very matter-of-fact way.
ZIEGLER
I saw everything that happened.
A long pause.
BILL
Well, what an amazing coincidence.
ZIEGLER
The words practically right out of my
mouth. An amazing coincidence.
That's what I first thought. But then I
remembered seeing you and your
musician friend, Nick, renewing old
acquaintances at the party, and it didn't
take me very long to realize that the
rotten little prick was the reason you
were there.
Bill gets to his feet. There's no point in denying anything and he has
to protect Nick.
BILL
Look, Victor, this was all my fault. Nick
did his best to talk me out of it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZIEGLER
Yes, I know. He told us. But the fact
remains that the little cocksucker told
you in the first place and gave you the
password and the address.
BILL
It was all down to me pressurising him.
ZIEGLER
Maybe so, but I recommended him
to these people and he betrayed my
trust.
BILL hesitates.
BILL
I went to his hotel this morning.
ZIEGLER
I know.
BILL
How's that?
ZIEGLER
That was my man following you. He
told me you spotted him.
BILL shakes his head incredulously.
BILL
Why did you have me followed?
ZIEGLER
For your own good? To avoid any
foolishness?
BILL
The hotel clerk said two men took him
away at five-thirty this morning.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZIEGLER
That's right. They gave him an airline
ticket and took him to the airport. By
now he's probably back with his family
in Seattle.
BILL
The clerk said he had a bruise on his
cheek.
ZIEGLER
Is that all?
BILL
Is he okay?
ZIEGLER
He's a lot better than he deserves to
be.
BILL
Nothing else?
ZIEGLER
He's okay. Phone him in Seattle if
you're concerned. I'll give you his
phone number.
ZIEGLER pours more brandy.
BILL
Nick never said anything about a
second password. Was that what gave
me away?
ZIEGLER
There was no second password. You
gave yourself away as soon as you
arrived. Invited guests come in limos
not taxis, and they don't get out of
their cars half a block from the gate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the servants took your coat, one
of our people went through your
pockets and found the receipt for the
rented tux and cassock made out to
Doctor W. Harford, a name obviously
not on the guest list.
ZIEGLER sips some brandy.
ZIEGLER
Bill, these were not just _ordinary_
people. I don't think you have any idea
how fortunate you are to have got out
of that situation as easily as you did.
Someday you can thank me for that.
BILL
What about the woman?
ZIEGLER
Not at all what you think.
BILL
Why did she try to warn me?
ZIEGLER doesn't answer immediately.
BILL
Why was she willing to sacrifice
herself for me?
ZIEGLER
Bill, are you so sure she was the kind of
woman for whom the things you
imagined were actually a sacrifice?
If she attended these affairs and knew
the rules so well, do you suppose it
would have made any difference to her
whether she belonged to one of the
men, or to all of them?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill, she was just a
thousand-a-night- hooker - no more,
no less.
BILL stares at him blankly.
ZIEGLER
Bill, tell me, did you never consider the
possibility that the whole thing might
have been nothing more than a
charade?... A charade played out for
the benefit of someone who didn't
belong - to frighten them and make
sure they keep quiet?
BILL takes a deep breath and tries to absorb what he has just been
told.
Then takes the newspaper from his pocket with the story about the
drugs overdose.
BILL
What about this?
ZIEGLER
What about it?
BILL
Is it her? I went to the morgue but I
couldn't tell.
ZIEGLER
It is her.
BILL (quietly)
Is this what she meant when she said
she would redeem me?
ZIEGLER

No - it wasn't But I was afraid you

might think it was, and that's why I

wanted to see you. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

BILL

You say it was a charade but isn't a

but strange, a woman offers herself as

a sacrifice and the next morning she's

dead?

ZIEGLER

That _was_ a coincidence. An amazing

coincidence, perhaps but a genuine

coincidence, nonetheless.
Bill, please believe me, nothing happened to her that hadn't happened before. She got a lot of attention, that was certainly true, but nothing she didn't want. And later, when my people left her at the hotel, they said everything was absolutely okay. What then happened in her room, she did to herself, as she had done many times before. But, sadly, this would be the last time. She OD'd on crack, like the papers said. No chance for foul play. Her door was locked from the _inside_ and the police had to break it down. No, I'm afraid for her it was always going to be just a matter of time - you said as much yourself when she passed out in my bedroom at the Christmas party.


BILL

My God, was that her?


ZIEGLER nods, yes.

Several moments of strained silence go by.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then ZIEGLER stands up with a comfortable end-of-conversation-sigh.

ZIEGLER

So, Bill, I hope you understand why I

thought it was important to tidy this

up. But now I think all the dishes are

washed and put away. Nobody killed

anybody. Someone died. That's sad.

But life goes on. It always does. Until it

doesn't. Okay?

INT BILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bill quietly enters and goes to his study to undress, as he did the night

before.

He enters the bedroom as quietly as possible.

He hears ALICE breathing softly and regularly and sees the outline of

her head on the pillow.

Unexpectedly, his heart is filled with a feeling of tenderness and even

of security.

Then he notices something dark quite near ALICE'S face.

It has definite outlines like the shadowy features of a human face,

and it is lying on his pillow.

For a moment his heart stops beating, but an instant later he sees

what it is, and stretching out his hand, picks up the MASK he had

worn the night before.

V.O.

He thought he must have dropped it in

the morning when he packed the

costume away, and Alice had found it

and placed it on the pillow beside her,

as though it signified _his_ face, the face

of a husband who had become an

enigma to her.

All at once he reaches the end of his strength.

Clutching the mask, he utters a loud and painful

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

sob - quite unexpectedly - and sinks down beside the bed, buries his

head in the pillows, and cries.

A minute later he feels a soft hand caressing his hair.

He looks into ALICE'S worried eyes.

BILL

I will tell you everything.

ALICE raises her hand, as if to stop him, but he takes it and holds it.

BILL

No, I will tell you everything.

BEDROOM - IT IS NOW DAWN

The grey light creeps through the curtains.

ALICE sits expressionlessly at a small table near the window, finishing

a cigarette. A full ashtray next to her.

BILL sits miserably on the edge of the bed staring at the carpet..

He sighs and looks at Alice.

She smiles at him sadly and reaches out her hand.

He gets up slowly and goes over to her.

BILL

What are we going to do now?

She gazes into his eyes.

ALICE

I think we should both be grateful that

we have come unharmed out of all our

adventures, whether they were real or

only a dream.

BILL kneels down in front of her.

BILL

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you really sure that?

She takes his hands in hers and looks at them.

ALICE

Only as sure as I am that the reality

of one night, let alone that of a whole

lifetime, is not the whole truth.

BILL

And no dream is entirely a dream.

She presses his head to her breast.

ALICE

But I think we're awake now.. And

for a long time to come.

BILL (whispers)

Forever.

Almost before he finishes the word, ALICE lays her fingers on his

lips.

ALICE (whispers as if to herself)

We should never look into the future.

They kiss tenderly and lie down on the bed, dozing a little,

dreamlessly, close to one another - until with the usual noises from

the street, and a victorious ray of sunlight through the opening of the

curtain, there is a knock on the door and their seven-year-old

daughter, HELENA, runs into the room and, laughing, jumps into

their bed. And a new day begins.
