A STRANGE LANDSCAPE.

Like the surface of some alien planet. CELESTIAL FORMS spin
in the distance.  DROP DOWN over a topography of rolling hills.

ALVIN 5 - THE POD

A titanium alloy sphere; the strongest form to withstand
great pressures. A streamlined mantle houses propellers,
batteries, articulated arms - one containing a carbon-dioxide
laser. Maneuvering thrusters protrude next to antennae.

WEIRD SUBMARINE FORMS

glow in artificial light. We float over undulating undersea
hills. Tendrils of beautiful growths wave in the currents.

	AL (VO)
...one small schlep for mankind...

INT. - ALVIN 5

THE MAN INSIDE is Al Viola, 35, ex-Marine, ex-astronaut.
He holds a doctorate in Medieval Languages from the Sorbonne.
He is worldly, highly trained. Right now he's elated as well.

	AL
...but it means money in
the bank to me.

A VOICE cuts in - The Mission Control Officer - COLIN

	COLIN - VO
Could you to stop counting
your profits long enough for
a systems check...

	AL
This is a small breakthrough.
I've a right to make a statement.

A LAB SOMEWHERE

Technicians cluster around VIDEO SCREENS showing
feeds from LVIN'S MULTIPLE CAMERAS. One shot from the housing
faces forward. Another is of Al at the controls. Exotic equipment
surrounds him. A CLOCK is prominent. It reads: ELAPSED
MISSION TIME - 1 hour, 14 minutes. A third camera fixed to
a long extension arm, articulates 360% and shoots back to
show the POD.

	COLIN
What a pain in the...Where did we
get this prima donna?...(into mike)
Then do try to keep it dignified.
Puns are a sign of oxygen
deprivation of the brain. Now give
us bank three, if you would.

	AL
Alright, alright! Air filtration,
88; battery load, 76;...

Reception is perfect. Al reports full success. He reads off
instrument readings rapidly. His voice is clipped
and precise...a test pilot. Behind him, packed into every corner
of the tiny cockpit, are computers and scientific instruments.

THE LAB TECHNICIANS are taut, organized and highly
disciplined. There is a sense of purpose, of very important business.

THE SUBMERSIBLE swoops through valleys lined with
stranger growths. The craft is perfectly balanced, responsive
to the pilot's lightest touch.

END TITLES

SILICON VALLEY - DAWN

A peaceful setting; flowers on low, rolling hills, a high-tech
building complex - UNITED SYNERGISTIC TECHNOLOGIES.

TWO MEN ON A HILL OVERLOOKING UST.

They are fooling with something. It goes off. A rocket flares out in the
direction of the building, The rocketeer guides the flight of
the Remotely Piloted Vehicle on a video monitor.

ABOVE THE BUILDING, retro jets slow the craft. A small braking
chute blooms. It settles, braking jets fire briefly as it lands
softly on the rooftop air duct.

THE ROCKETEER hits a button; blue flame shoots out
the underside of the vehicle. It burns a tiny pinpoint through
the duct.

INT. UNITED SYNERGISTIC TECHNOLOGIES - A HIGH-TECH LAB

THE SAME ONE, SAME TIME - A TECH turns from the video
monitors and looks through a window into the main experimental
area...A maze of equipment. Some bizarre, tension-filled procedure
is going on.  Techs in the control room smoke like fiends. Others
in the clean-room are enclosed head to foot in sterile coveralls.

CONTROL ROOM

Engineers note and dismiss a READING...

	ENG 1
Air temp just went up.

	ENG 2
We're drawing lots of power.

INT. UST FRONT OFFICE

Salesmen, job seekers crowd the busy
lobby. One applicant, Joe Doakes, 30, has a air of
desperation. His tie is too tight. His hair won't behave. He's
nicked himself shaving. The surveillance cameras make him nervous.
He checks his watch impatiently, rises and crosses to the receptionist.

	JOE
Remember me?

She barely looks up...a 40 watt smile.

	JOE
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...

	RECEPTIONIST.
I'm sorry. We're running behind.
So many applicants...so few jobs...
If you'll just have a seat.

	JOE

I have a seat. I've had it since nine.

	RECEPTIONIST.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as
possible. Will you be able to wait?

	JOE (he turns)
You're just lucky I need this job.

	RECEPTIONIST.
Is there anything else?

	JOE
A drink...

	RECEPTIONIST.
Water fountain's through that door,
down the hall.

	JOE
Thanks.

THE ROOF

The landing craft withdraws its torch,
deploys a nozzle-arm. PSSSSCCCHHHT. A colorless gas is emitted.
- A hallucinogen; debilitating but not fatal...not even
unpleasant. t makes people highly suggestible, pliable, complacent.

INT. LAB AND CONTROL ROOM-

Slowly, almost imperceptibly,
the hubbub and chatter die off. People stand and sit
as before, but slowly slow down...Cigarettes slow halfway to the
mouth...Coffee cups stop in mid-sip. In the lab, procedures just...slow.
A man at a control board looks down as if, suddenly, it's
all Greek...the lights and buttons suddenly foreign to him. Others
seem bemused, daydreaming...They smile at each other and
try to think of something to say. Some of them giggle.

EXT. THE VALLEY

A CHOPPER glides through the pass
and settles on the UST landing pad. Five figures exit the chopper,
all dressed alike; dark coveralls and boots, motorcycle
helmets with reflectored visors...A PRECISION ATTACK.

THE INTRUDERS - walk to the access door. They are
armed, disciplined, well drilled. Movement is unhurried
but efficient. They carry submachine guns. A GUARD eyes them placidly.
Their LEADER speaks through a radio directly into the UST
intercom. He is assured and calm. The GUARD is bemused... drugged.

	LEADER
Hello.

	GUARD
Hello

	LEADER
We'd like to come in.

The guard is lethargic. The gas has sapped his will.
One part of his brain cannot accept what he is about to do. He
giggles softly at the thought of it, even as he is compelled to
obey.

	GUARD
	(giggling)
You'd like...to come in...

	LEADER
Open the door please.

	GUARD
	(still giggling)
Open the door?... Certainly.

The door pops open. They enter and pass the bemused
guard.

	LEADER
Thank you.

	GUARD
My pleasure.

INT. LAB AREA

Everyone is smiling...stoned. The
LEADER speaks to them like children, not to be funny, but because
low-key orders are the most efficient. They are completely
suggestible.

	LEADER
Hello.

	TECH
Hello.

	LEADER
We've come for the PEM114.
Where is it?

	TECH 2
Right there.

	LEADER
Thank you.

The INTRUDERS step up to the lab equipment. Another
tech...steps forward...He is struggling against the effects of
the drug.

	TECH 3
Wait.

	LEADER
Why?

	TECH 3
You can't take that.

	LEADER
Why not?

	TECH 3
The experiment. The danger...

THE VOICE is soothing, calming, hypnotic, but the
submachine guns are always in position.

	LEADER
It's alright.

	TECH 3
It is?

	LEADER
It will be fine. You have another.

	TECH 3
Just one. The back up.

	LEADER
Could I have it, please.

	TECH 3
I can't get it out. It would take hours.

	LEADER
That's alright. Just tear it apart.

	TECH 3
Tear it apart?

	LEADER
Yes.

	TECH 3
Ahhh...Okay?!!!

He tears into a complex web of electronic circuitry,
ripping wires and circuit boards apart. With a POP, the circuits
go out.

The lights dip, the OVERHEAD VIDEO SCREENS go out
as the TECH comes up with the MAIN CIRCUIT BOARD.

THE SHRIEK of an ALARM SIREN. Suddenly a door swings
open. The LEADER'S gun swings on the figure in the doorway...Joe
Doakes. Joe stands in shock, looks at the gun, swings the
door shut behind him. The ALARM CUTS OUT. Everyone in the room
stares at him. he stands there rumpled and bemused, blinking
at them; Dustin Hoffman on drugs. Finally, the LEADER sees
he's no threat, relaxes his grip on the gun. The LEADER snaps out:

	LEADER
What do you want?

	JOE (stoned innocent)
Drink of water...?

A beat, then the LEADER relaxes...He waves Joe away...

	LEADER
Go get a drink.

This has the force of suggestion...Joe turns and
walks through and out of the room...looking for a drink. The LEADER
motions to INTRUDER 2 to continue.

	INTRUDER 2
The PEM114?

	TECH 2
Yes, that's it.

	LEADER
Give it to me.

He does. Another tech offers the Leader the spare.
He holds the tiny circuit board in his palm, removes one chip.

	LEADER
This the only spare?

	TECH 2
Yes.

	LEADER
The other working.

	TECH 2
Perfectly.

The Leader has something in his hand, a CLICK, a
WHOOSH. A butane lighter melts the circuit board to microscopic
slag. The Tech looks at his scorched hand, the destroyed
silicon bead. is voice is still slightly amused.

	TECH 2
Ow?...

	LEADER
It'l be alright.

	TECH 2
It will.

	LEADER
It doesn't hurt.

	TECH 2
No?

The Leader pauses for a moment, amused by their sheep-like
acquiescence. His next suggestion is droll.

	LEADER
It tickles.

The tech looks at his smoking hand in dismay...then
incredibly finds something amusing in his second degree burn.
He starts to laugh...it tickles...The other techs look confused,
then it's contagious. They start to laugh too.

INTRUDER 5, steps into the room full of laughing
idiots. He moves to the LEADER. They speak quickly and both
leave.

INT. HIGH TECH EXPERIMENT AREA

The LEADER is surprised.

	LEADER
What's this?
	INT 5
They're further along
than we thought.

CU - an empty beaker on a pad surrounded by exotic
equipment.

	INT 5
...Looks almost ready to go.

A WALKIE-TALKIE SQUAWKS.

	W/T (V.O.)
...response to door alarm...

	LEADER
Time to go...(looks at the
beaker) It doesn't matter.
We have the PEM.

They turn and exit the room. As they do, the LEADER
notices Joe aimlessly examining the wall of equipment nearby.
Joe is really stoned...He's fooling with a control panel, flicking
switches on and off. He notices the INTRUDERS. Caught, he tries
to make the best of it. He smooths his hair, spins and comes
to a half-assed kind of attention. As he turns, he knocks some wildly
expensive piece of equipment to the floor. Joe grimaces and
straightens his tie, making it much worse. The LEADER comes close
to him, stares at him, thoughtfully. Joe blinks back, trying to
clear his head in case speaking is required...The leader looks at
the smashed equipment. Joe looks at it guiltily. The Radio SQUAWKS.

The Leader decides. Abruptly, he kicks the equipment
out of his way. It smashes against the back wall. Joe winces...the
Leader turns and stalks out of the room. Joe holds his attention
position for a moment, like a good scout, then seems
to find himself lost and alone in a room full of strange
equipment.

MAIN ROOM

OTHER INTRUDERS finish taking apart the equipment.
The LEADER addresses the crowd, a James Mason-ish
air about him.

	LEADER
We must be off. Goodbye.

	TECHS
Goodbye...Goodbye...

They all wish them goodbye...smiles and laughter
all around. The one who struggled steps forward.
He struggles again...

	TECH 3
Who....are...you?

INTRUDER 5 just laughs, but the LEADER turns back to TECH 3.

	LEADER
I'm ...your mother.

CLOSE UP - TECH 3

Stunned and confused...He shakes his head and blinks rapidly.
He rubs his eyes.

TECH 3'S POV

Before his eyes, the IMAGE OF THE LEADER shrinks down
and transforms itself into that of a grey haired old lady.
TECH 3 - can't believe it.

	TECH 3
Mom...what are you doing here?

	LEADER
Leaving, now go to sleep.
...all of you.

Some of them do. The INTRUDERS step back through
the door. The TECHS look at each other blankly. Then they look
at the ceiling ...the walls...their shoes, anything. In the video
monitoring section, others watch the INTRUDERS leave on SCREENS...Their
faces register nothing. The LEADER pauses...A final
command...

	LEADER
Give me the surveillance camera videotapes.

The video tech does.

INT LAB - HOURS LATER

FRANTIC - Crawling with security people.
The scene of the crime. No clues. No leads. A Security
Man, FINNEGAN, interrogates the techs...

	FINNEGAN
...Well who did it look like?

Tech 3 squirms in his seat...embarrassed...humiliated.
He doesn't answer..The interrogator stands over him,
intimidating. Finally, defiantly, the tech states the ludicrous.

	TECH 2
My mother.

INT. CONTROL ROOM

COLIN walks up to the CHIEF DETECTIVE. He shrugs. In B.G.
through a glass partition...and on TV monitors, other security
men question other techs.

	FINNEGAN
Who'd it look like to you?

	TECH 1
My dog.

COLIN turns to the detective.

	FINNEGAN
Mass hypnosis. Short term memory loss.
Some kind of hallucinogenic gas...

	MYER
Kind of stuff the army's been working on.

	COLIN
	Surveillance Cameras?

	FINNEGAN
	They took the tapes.

	COLIN
	You have nothing...

	FINNEGAN
	We don't even know where
	to start. What about these people?
	What do we do with them?

He indicates glass wall through which they can see the
bystanders, including Joe, being questioned one at a time..
Joe looks a little queasy. He burps...an uneasy stomach.

	COLIN
	We'll have to let them go.

	FINNEGAN
	Surveilliance on them all.

COLIN looks uncomfortable at the thought. Tech 2 steps through a
door and catches his eye. He excuses himself as the FINNEGAN
turns back to study his suspects in the window.

INT. LAB. - TECH 2 is panicked. He speaks quietly, intensely.

	TECH 2
	The P.E.M. It's gone...
	They must have it.

	COLIN
	How did they know? No one knew.

	TECH 2
	Whoever has it, can leapfrog
	generations of technology.
	We gotta get it back.

	TECH 3
	Screw the PEM...What about Al...

	TECH 2
	Poor bastard.


AL - IN THE POD

fighting for his life. The pod is slammed and buffeted. Al
struggles with the controls as the POD tumbles..

	AL
	Come in, control...Do you read me?
	Come in...damn!

He flips frantically through the controls.
.
	AL
	Okay guys, what's going on?
	Who turned out the lights?

He tries one system, then the other.

	AL
	This wasn't in the plan.

Then it dawns on him: he may be in big trouble.

	AL (resigned, professional)
	Damn...10:03...Something's gone wrong.
	Experiencing extreme turbulence. Unable
	to control the capsule.. Appear to be
	tumbling. Exterior envirnment dark.
	Lost radio contact. Cause...unknown.
	Power failure?.. maybe...an earthquake.

HE THROWS A SWITCH: SUCCESS! LIGHT FLICKERS ACROSS HIS FACE.

	AL
	Wait a minute...Got power...Going
	to external floods....Holy...Shit!!!

THE POD - A different LAND...Turbulent, convulsive ...alive. THE
POD seems to drop through an enormous tunnel...like a marble in a
sewer.  It churns in a mass of liquid. Semi-solid forms SLAM
against the housing and rush on. They are enormous forms...
balls, discs, rods...chains...They swirl in the ebb, then drop
away before us...WE TUMBLE, GLANCE OFF A WALL, SPIN TO SEE A NEW
WAVE DESCEND UPON US... AND . Al sets his thrusters at full
forward for maximum manoueverability in the flow and powers
through the vortexes...His voice is tight with effort, concern.

	AL
	Where in the....YEAOOOW!!!


THE BOTTOM DROPS AWAY. An abyss opens up before him.

THE POD - plunges through the hole and FALLS...FALLS...FALLS
INTO a smoking churning cavern. It hits the surface of something,
plunges through into the darker depths...of a ROARING, GROANING,
BUBBLING INFERNO....

INSIDE - AL has browned out from the impact. He now comes
around...dazed. He is once more in darkness...The dark masses
block his floodlights, throwing weird shadows...He switches over
to infrared imaging...

Infrared imaging displays THE ENVIRNMENT on his cockpit glass in
a HEADS-UP-DISPLAY.

	AL
	CHRIS, if this is one of your jokes....


SAN FRANCISCO. EXT. STREET - A WORKING-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD -
A UNITED SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY VAN pulls up.

INT. VAN - THE FINNEGAN DRIVES. JOE SITS CONFUSED in the
passenger seat.

	FINNEGAN
	Now remember, your short term
	memory may have been affected.

	JOE
	What?

	FINNEGAN
	Your memory.

	JOE
	What about it?

	FINNEGAN
	It may have been affected.

	JOE
	Oh.

	FINNEGAN
	You may not remember things.

	JOE
	What things?

	FINNEGAN
	I don't know...the last couple
	of hours...last few days.

	JOE
	Oh...that's okay.

	FINNEGAN
	When you do...

	JOE
	Do what?

	FINNEGAN
	When you remember...

	JOE
	Remember what?

	FINNEGAN
	Anything....You call us
	right away. You got that?

	JOE
	Yeah. If I remember anything...
	I call ...you

	FINNEGAN
	Right.

	JOE
	Who...are you?

	FINNEGAN
	Sergeant Finnegan. Name's
	right there on the card. Are
	you sure you're alright?

	JOE
	How do I look?

	FINNEGAN
	Fine. You look fine.

	JOE
	Thanks.

	FINNEGAN
	Well...

	JOE
	Well what?

	FINNEGAN
	We're here.

	JOE
	Here?

	FINNEGAN
	Home. Your home. The address
	on your form.

	JOE
	Oh.

	FINNEGAN
	Don't you want to get out?

	JOE
	Oh....Sure.

	FINNEGAN
	Why don't you lie down until
	you feel better.

	JOE
	I feel fine.

	FINNEGAN
	You'll feel better

	JOE
	I will?

	FINNEGAN
	Look, we'll bring your car home.
	just take it easy until the effects
	wear off. You need anything,
	just call this number.

He offers him a card. Joe turns away.

	FINNEGAN
	Joe.

	JOE
	What?

	FINNEGAN
	Take the card.

	JOE
	Oh yeah, thanks...


The van pulls away. Joe turns, looks up at his apartment house,
seems to forget what he's doing...and wanders off down the
street. He acts strangely. There's an odd whistling in his ear.

INT. AL IN THE POD - INFRARED IMAGING - shows where he is...A
vast submarine cavern. He moves forward, swinging the POD in an
arc through the churning waters. He turns to his computers and
sensors for an answer.

MONITORS. - A diagram appears. A wire-frame representation of
Al's envirnment...

	AL
	What the hell is this?

He programs the computer to manipulate the image. The computer
program turns it inside out; gives it an external, omniscient POV
and we understand: It's a man. The pinpoint representing the POD
is in the stomach.

AL - ALMOST - SHOCKED INTO SILENCE.

	AL
	Alright guys, the joke's
	gone far enough.


MOLLOYS BAR - A NEIGHBORHOOD HANG-OUT. Dazed, Joe enters and
sits at the bar. He's greeted like a regular.

	MOLLOY.
	Joe. How's it going?
	How'd it go with that job?

	JOE
	What job?

	MOLLOY (A beat)
	Hey...look...this one's on me.

He sets a beer in front of Joe, moves off down the bar. On the
TV at the end of the bar...a NEWS REPORT. Joe stares at the TV.

TV - A REPORTER does a STAND-UP in front of U.S.T. MAIN GATE.
.
	REPORTER
	All we know, is that something has gone
	wrong here, but so far...no one is talking
	about it. Ron Golloway, with the ACTIONCAM...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL checks his envirnmental analysers.

	AL
	Stomach acid! This stuff's caustic.


SUDDENLY, THE STOMACH CHURNS...A NEW WAVE OF FOAMY LIQUID ROARS
DOWN THE ESOPHAGUS AND ENGULFS THE POD.

INSIDE - AL - ON THE ANALYSERS - A READOUT: ALCOHOL.

	AL
	You guy's are...DRUNK! (FURIOUS)
	Okay, buster, I don't know who you
	are, but if I ever get out of you,
	you're in big trouble.


INSIDE THE STOMACH - THE POD SPEEDS TOWARD THE STOMACH
WALL...THE CARBON-DIOXIDE LASER FIRES OPENING A HOLE IN THE
STOMACH WALL. THE POD BLASTS THROUGH.

INSIDE A CAPILLARY - THE POD BREAKS THROUGH THE WALL AND IS
CARRIED AWAY IN THE BLOOD FLOW.

INT. POD -

 A WIRE-FRAME REPRESENTATION OF THE BODY
guides Al as he powers the POD ahead. The capillary branches
into larger and larger vessels...The pressure and speed builds
with every branch...Al has to fly like crazy to avoid collision
with solid particles. On the monitors he watchs the sonar/
computer imaging to guide his navigation.

EXT. POD

 He enters a main artery. The walls bulge with each
pump of the heart...then up ahead, the heart. he tries to back
down, reverse his thrust but it's no good; He is being sucked in.
Nowhere to turn...no way to escape...He decides and THRUSTS FULL
FORWARD into the heart.

WHOOSH. He is pulled into a VENTRICAL, spun....THE WORLD BLURRS
as he is expelled in a surge of blood and pushed up the artery.
Spinning wildly, he fights for control, swings into a vein.

THE TUNNEL gets smaller. He checks his navigation aids...It
branches..Al cuts into the --- artery and up the neck into the
base of the head...before him...a barrier...a membrane appears...
INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL pulls up in an eddy and aims the laser at the membrane...It slices a neat hole
through it. The FLOW bursts through the breach and carries the POD with it.

.
OTHER SIDE OF THE MEMBRANE - Al swings the pod around...He is in
another...region...where the water is still. He swings the laser
around again and spot welds the tear in the membrane....before he
can complete the job...a treelike thing is swept into the hole by
the flood. Other debris collect behind it until the hole is
sealed shut...Slowly the current dies.

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD

 Al has just slipped through the BLOOD/BRAIN barrier and has taken up
 residence in the left VENTRICLE - A FLUID FILLED CAVITY in the brain.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL stations himself near a nerve bundle.

	AL
	You'll wish you never
	thought of this.

He sets a contact arm of the POD for high-voltage electrical
charge...picks a nerve at random...an hits the trigger.
ZZZZAAAPPP! A charge hits the nerve.

OUTSIDE - INT. THE BAR

JOE flies off the barstool and hits the floor with a thud. He looks around,
dazed...then slowly climbs back up. Molloy rushes over, concerned, but says nothing.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

 Al's envirnment has been agitated a little, but not much. He takes up position
again at the nerve bundle, selects another nerve...hits the charge trigger.

OUTSIDE - INT. THE BAR -

 JOE shakes his head...He is seeing the weirdest shit on television...
then all over the walls...VISIONS. All of a sudden it's amusing...very funny.
Very very funny. He falls off the stool again in convulsive laughter.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

 Is getting shaken all over the place. He cuts the circuit.

OUTSIDE - INT. THE BAR

JOE, on the floor again, stops laughing as suddenly as he began. He crawls back up
on the barstool, more confused than ever.

	JOE
	Well, think I'll go home.

	MOLLOY
	Are you okay?

	JOE
	Fine...fine. No problem. Just
	tired, that's all...


INSIDE - INT. THE POD -

 AL hits another nerve bundle with the probe. Now he gets DISTORTED SOUNDS...

	TV REPORTER (VO)
	...accident site at UNITED SYSTEMS LABS...

	AL
	Oh, shit.
.
A STRANGE LANDSCAPE - THE SAME AS SCENE ONE.

THE SAME SCENE; THE SAME SHOTS. Suddenly time RUSHES FORWARD.
Al's voice squeaks, the action accellerates.

	LEADER (VO)
	Run past this stuff.

THE VISUALS SPEED EVEN FASTER. SOMEBODY is running the tapes of
the EXPERIMENT right before the attack...FAST FORWARD.

	INTRUDER
	You won't believe this.

INT. LAB -  The INTRUDERS SLOW the tape and watch with interest.

CU.- THE BEAKER on the pedestal surrounded by EXOTIC EQUIPMENT.

	LEADER
	What's the hell is this?

	INTRUDER (AMAZED)
	They've gone ahead. They did it.

SURVEILLANCE CAMERA POV - THE ATTACK. The INTRUDERS - TAPE WINDS
FAST FORWARD - Someone in authority speaks with a Scottish Burr.

	BURR
	The craft, that man....

	INTRUDER
	When we got there, it was gone...


CONTROL ROOM - ANGLE ON COLIN and TECHS.

They look ...drugged.

	LEADER
	What happened?

INT. LAB - PEDESTAL

- Just then, a door in the B.G. opens. Joe, dizzily enters, looks around, grabs the
 first liquid he sees and drinks it down... The BEAKER.

MONITOR - THE IMAGE of Al in the POD breaks up, goes off.

	LEADER (VO)
	That Idiot!

	BURR (VO)
	Who is that?

	LEADER (VO)
	Nobody..just wanted a drink.

	BURR (VO)
	Someone is the idiot...

	TECH 2 (VO)
	What about the pilot?

	BURR (VO)
	How long could his power last?
.
	TECH 2 (VO)
	In that envirnment, I don't think
	it matters.

	INT 3 (VO)
	What a way to go!

	BURR (VO)
	Dead or alive, there's a lot
	that machine could tell us.

	INT 3 (VO)
	We better get to him fast.

	INT 2 (VO)
	Yeah, one pepperoni pizza,
	it might be too late.


EXT. STREET. JOE STOPS AT A BUS STOP - WAITS.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

 AL hears the STREETSOUNDS - Is reprogramming the computer...To transmit.

	AL
	Hello, Hello. Can you hear me?

He throws a few more switches...

	AL
	Hello...Hello. Come in...
	Whoever you are...Hello!


EXT. STREET - A BUS pulls up, JOE gets on it.

INT. BUS-

EMPTY EXCEPT FOR A WOMAN IN THE BACK. Joe sits a few
seats from her, holding his head. As he watches the passing
street scenes through the window, the SOUND gets louder...then
distorted...enhanced...The SOUNDS FOLD BACK, REVERBERATE on
themselves...AN ACID FLASHBACK, is Joe's first thought...The
SOUND is getting very weird. It slows up, speeds down...Filters
chop the highs, the lows off...He's definitely HEARING THINGS.

	A VOICE OVER
	Can you hear me?

Joe looks around...No one in the bus but him and the woman. He
turns to her.
	JOE
Of course, I can.

Her eyes flick to him, nervously...Then her face becomes a mask.
She stares straight ahead, gripping her bag, tightly.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD -

 AL celebrates.

	AL
	Yahooo! It works!!!...

Excitedly, he hits the transmit button again.

OUTSIDE - ON THE BUS -

 JOE stares at his hands...blinking...

	AL (VO)
	You can hear me!

Joe looks up at the woman.

	JOE
	You don't have to yell.

She moves a seat away. Joe is confused and insulted. He turns
back to the window, mumbling.

	AL (VO)
	Then, answer me...

Joe turns to the woman, exasperated...She looks up, worried.

	JOE
	I did. I said I can hear you
	just fine. What do you want?

She turns to him and confronts the problem directly.

	WOMAN
	Who, me?

Joe looks around...yep, there's no one else there.

	JOE
	Yes...What is it?

	WOMAN
	What's what?

	JOE
	What do you want?

	WOMAN
	Nothing.

	JOE
	What did you say?

	WOMAN
	Nothing.

	JOE
	What?

	WOMAN
	I said...I didn't say..anything!

	JOE
	Then who did?

	WOMAN
	You did.
	JOE
	No I didn't. You said	something first.

	AL (VO)
	I said something.

	JOE
	I know you did!

Joe is confused now, because, although she responded to him, her
mouth didn't seem to move. And now, she does it again!

	AL (VO)
	No, not her. Me.

	JOE (SHOUTING. FRUSTRATED)
	Who's you?


The woman's now terrified. She locks eyes with Joe as she
slowing rises and backs away. He shouts after her.

	AL (VO)
	My name is AL.

	JOE
	Al ???!!!

He looks wildly around the bus...under the seats. The woman
scurries to the front of the bus. She has a quick word with the
bus driver. The driver looks up at Joe in the rear view mirror.

JOE - A stupid grin on his face. He knows someone is fucking
with him. Maybe this whole thing is a joke. He baits the voice.

	JOE
	Where are you,...Al?

	AL (VO)
	You're not gonna believe this...

	JOE
	Try me.

	AL (VO)
	I'm...inside you.

A LONG PAUSE WHILE JOE THINKS ABOUT THIS.

FRONT OF THE BUS - The DRIVER and WOMAN stare at this lunatic.

JOE - SUDDENLY, HE JUMPS UP. SCREAMING AND POINTING AT THEM.

	JOE
	Okay...which one of you guy's
	the ventriloquist???!!!

The driver's mouth drops open...He glances back at traffic.
He's about to rear-end a car. He SLAMS the brakes and swerves to
the side...the woman SCREAMS as she's thrown down the stairs.
.
JOE - swings from a pole as the bus SWERVES... HORNS BLAST as
the driver SWINGS back into his lane, barely avoiding a head-on.
Joe rushes up the isle, irate.

	JOE
	You trying to kill us? Cut the shit and concentrate
	on your driving!


INSIDE - INT. THE POD -

 AL is getting bounced all over.

	AL
	Calm down! Don't worry!


OUTSIDE

Joe talks at the driver...who thinks he's got a madman on his hands.

	JOE
	Either drive or talk.
	Don't do both.
	Then I won't worry.


The driver pulls the bus over to the curb. Sets the brake. The
woman painfully pulls herself up.

	AL (VO)
	It's not him.

Joe turns to the woman.

	JOE
	Oh...and who is it!?

	WOMAN
	I didn't say anything.

	JOE (answering Al)
	Why not?

	DRIVER
	Are you alright?

	AL (VO)
	You'll find this hard to accept.

	JOE
	Try me.

The driver thinks this is a challenge.

	DRIVER
	Alright, get off the bus.

	JOE (indignant)
	It's not my stop.

	DRIVER
	You'll have to leave.

	JOE
	What for?

	DRIVER
	...creating a disturbance.

	JOE
	Me?...! You created it. I'm
	the one that's being disturbed.

	WOMAN
	You can say that again.

Joe looks at her, innocent and hurt. He turns back to the
driver. He's gotten up from his seat. He's big and mean.

EXT. BUS

 JOE flys out the door, lands hard on his knees and skids into a bush.

	JOE
	Hey!!!

He jumps up, shakes his fist at the bus as it pulls away.

	JOE
	I'm reporting you to the
	.....transit authority!!!

INSIDE - INT. THE POD -

	AL
	What's going on?

OUTSIDE - EXT. STREET

Joe, points at the retreating bus...

	JOE (furious)
	That fucker...he's...he's...

He stops in mid-sentence as he realizes...THE VOICE...He glances
around furtively...at the voice. Now he's starting to feel that
he may be talking to himself...He mumbles self-consciously.

	JOE
	...reporting....him...
	ventriloquism...On a bus

	AL (VO)
	Don't do that.

	JOE
	Why not.


He stops in his tracks, spins around...Nobody near him. He
groans, puts his head in his hands.

	JOE
	Arrrgh!

	AL (VO)
	It wasn't him.

	JOE
	Who was it?

	AL (VO)
	Me.

	JOE
	Who?

	AL (VO)
	Al.

	JOE (looks around him.)
	Where are you, Al?

INSIDE - INT. THE POD-

AL struggles to find the right words.

OUTSIDE

- JOE goes rustling through the bushes...Passers-by look
at him queerly. He passes a mailbox...stops. Looks at it.

	JOE
	Al.

	AL (VO)
	Yes?

	JOE
	This candid camera?

He peers into the mailbox. Pedestrians look at him strangely.
One man comes up to mail a letter...hesitates.


INSIDE - INT. THE POD

- AL hesitates, not quite sure how to tell him. Finally, he just blurts it out.

	AL (VO)
	I'm in your head.

Joe's reply is flat, toneless.

	JOE
	You're in my head...

	AL (VO)
	Yes.

	JOE
	Your name is Al...

	AL (VO)
	Yes.

	JOE
	I see...


Joe turns to see the letter-mailer staring a him.

	JOE
	No...no...it's nothing..
	Rehearsing a play...
	    (STALKS OFF)
	What light through yonder
	window breaks...It is Al...
	and he's in my head.

	AL (VO)
	What is your name?

	JOE
	You're in my head? You don't
	know my name?

	AL (VO)
	I just got here.

	JOE
	What??? You lose your lease
	on a condo?

	AL (VO)
	Where are we?

	JOE
	Where are we? We're on the street.
	We're walking down the street. We're
	talking to ourselves. People are
	staring at us.

	AL (VO)
	What street?

	JOE
	What street?! We're walking down
	QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive.
	We're about to be put somewhere quiet where
	they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.

	AL (VO)
	Why don't we go home?

	JOE
	Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.

	AL (VO)
	...I need to make a phone call.

	JOE
	Do me a favor, Al.

	AL (VO)
	Yeah?

	JOE
	Shut up!

INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

... that of a semi-impoverished single man.
Pictures of Baseball players taped to the walls. Half broken
electronic gear all over the place. Joe wanders/rushes in, stands
confused amidst the debris.

	JOE
	Somebody's been here.

	AL (VO)
	Where are we now?

	JOE
	My place, can't you see?

	AL (VO)
	No.

	JOE
	You're in my head, you can
	talk to me and hear what I say,
	but you can't see anything.

	AL (VO)
	Right.

	JOE
	Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.

	AL (VO)
	I'm working on it. Soon as I find
	the right nerve bundle.

	JOE
	Nerve bundle! What are you doing?
	You just leave the nerve bundles right
	where they are.


INSIDE - THE POD - AL

 The POD moves slightly in the intercranial fluid. Al senses movement.

	AL
	What are you doing?


JOE'S APARTMENT

 Joe roots through his goods which are strewn all over the floor.

	JOE
	Wait a minute, they didn't take
	anything...I'm not even worth
	robbing...This...they just messed it up
	(HE THINKS)... Maybe I did it.

He turns, goes into the bedroom and roots around in the closet.
A secret hiding hole behind a board, he brings out a small object
wrapped in a cloth. He opens it up...a pistol and shells.

	AL
	Who are you?

	JOE
	Who am I?

	AL
	Yeah...Who?

	JOE
	Well...If you're in my head...
	to you, I'm...GOD!

Unloads clip, checks it.

	AL
	Quit screwing around, this is important.

	JOE
	It's my head, I'll be the judge
	of that. Anyway, who are you?

	AL
	I told you, my name is Al.

	JOE
	What are you doing in my head, Al?

Slams clip in.
	AL
	I'm a test pilot...

	JOE (patronizing)
	...Test pilot. Uh huh.
	What do you test?

	AL
	You've heard of the PEM114...

	JOE
	That a new Datsun?

INSIDE - THE POD - AL

Worried frantic, he jumps to conclusions.

	AL
	Don't screw with me, Buster. I don't
	know how you got into U.S.T. or
	where you got this crazy idea, but
	you get me back to the lab right now.

Joe grabs his head in frustration.

	JOE
	Are you threatening me?

	AL
	I'm trying to get you to
	listen to reason.

Flips off safety.

	JOE (condescending)
	Reason...Ah hah...

	AL (VO)
	Look! I didn't ask to be in you.
	Don't blame me for it. You did it.

	JOE
	Me? What'd I do?

	AL (VO)
	Yeah. What did you do? You explain it.
	...why I'm not at the lab right now,
	in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!

	JOE
	I don't know what you're talking about.

	AL (VO)
	The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't
	heard of that either.

	JOE
	No.

	AL (VO)
	You've heard of U.S.T.?

	JOE
	I just went there for a job.

	AL (VO)
	Then how'd I get here?

Joes thinks he's nuts but finally gets mad, yells at the VOICE.

	JOE
	I don't know. Now Fuck Off!

Strangely, that calms Al down...

	AL (VO)
	I know...it sounds insane.

	JOE
	You said it.

Joe chambers a round...Al HEARS, he senses something.

	AL (VO)
	What are you doing?

	JOE
	Loading a gun.

	AL
	What for?

	JOE
	Kill myself.

	AL
	Are you crazy?

	JOE
	Yep.

	AL
	Don't do it. (thinks a second)
	Don't aim at the head.

	JOE
	Used to be, things were bad.
	No job...no money...no girl.
	Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.

	AL
	You're not crazy.

	JOE
	Hear voices don't I.

	AL
	Of course you do!

	JOE
	Then I'm crazy.


He cocks the gun.

	AL
	You're not crazy. Don't...wait
	a minute, just let me explain.

	JOE
	You're gonna explain.

	AL
	Yeah
	JOE
	Why there's a little man in my head?

	AL
	Yeah.

	JOE
	Why he's argumentative?

	AL
	Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all.
	Just put the gun down.

	JOE (hesitates)
	What's in it for me?

	AL
	You'll be alive.

	JOE
	With a man in my head...

	AL
	Yeah.

	JOE (slowly considers)
	Well...Okay, But this better be good!

INSIDE - THE POD - AL

	AL
	Okay, Now, The Photon Echo Memory
	Chip...You've heard of that?

OUTSIDE - INT. APARTMENT -

 JOE just sits there...gun in hand, staring ahead in disbelief. He nod's slightly in response.

INSIDE - THE POD

 Al lays it all on him: the EXPERIMENT.

	AL
	The Photon Echo Memory chip - the PEM114.
	It's the key. It's magical... It focuses
	massive computing power on one event: the
	creation of a mathematically induced real-
	life simulacrum encoded and synthesized on
	the molecular level with properties of the
	real model...and the transfer of a certain
	imponderable which might be called the life-
	force between the two in direct symbiosis.
	The effect is that man and machine are living
	on the molecular level...Now that's where we
	were when things went wrong. You understand...
	(NO RESPONSE)... Are you listening?

OUTSIDE- Joe, exhausted, mesmerized, has dozed off, gun in hand.

INSIDE - THE POD - AL

	AL
	I am real, Goddamn it. Hello?!!

No response. Frustrated, he hits the charge button...an electric
pulse from a POD arm shoots to a nearby nerve bundle.

JOE'S APARTMENT.

 Joe's limbs shudder. His muscles spasm...ENORMOUS ROAR - THE GUN GOES OFF.
The shell tears through the window, raining glass and plaster...From outside the
window...a STARTLED YELL...Someone falls away from the porch.

INSIDE - THE POD -

 AL - Is buffetted by the ROAR -

	AL
	What was that?

JOE'S APARTMENT - JOE ON THE COUCH...GETS UP, CROSSES TO WINDOW.

	JOE
	Who was that? Somebody out there?

HIS POV - OUT THE WINDOW.

 Movement in the bushes.

	AL
	You weren't listening!

	JOE
	Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.
	       (resigned...He just wants it over)
	Why don't I just take you back to UST?

	AL (VO)
	Why don't you?

	JOE (rhetorically)
	Because they'll think I'm nuts.

	AL (VO)
	No they won't.

	JOE
	Why not?

	AL (VO)
	I'll talk to them.

	JOE
	Oh...Gooood!

	AL (VO)
	I'll tell you what to say.

	JOE
	If I get you back to the lab,
	will you get out of my head?

	AL (VO)
	If I'm real, they'll get me out.
	If I'm not, they'll treat you.
	Either way you'll be better off
	than you are now. You'll get a reward.

Joe looks out the front. Movement in the bushes.

	JOE
	 Let's get out of here.


EXT. APARTMENT.

Joe sneaks out the side window, through the bushes, around to the front.

EXT. STREET

Sitting at the curb. A well-worn old Ford.
He cracks the door, sneaks in...puts the key in, releases the
brake. The car starts to roll down the hill...Faster....Joe
swings into driving position, pops the clutch. The car roars
away. As he cuts the corner, Joe looks back... No one.

	AL (VO)
	Anyone there?

	JOE
	No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
.
EXT. DESERTED ROAD - U.S.T LAB COMPLEX - in the distance.

	AL (VO)
	Behind us?

	JOE
	Still clear. Just a motorcycle.

POV - A LONE MOTORCYCLE RIDER TRAILS THEM

. Joe speeds up. The cycle accellerates, overtaking them. The cyclist is dressed in
black; dark visored helmet. An INTRUDER. Joe doesn't recognize
him. The cyclist glances at Joe, then pulls ahead.

	AL (VO)
	What's that?

	JOE
	Nothing. Just the cyclist.
	He's passed us.

THE CYCLE - The rider reaches for something in his saddlebag.

JOE'S CAR - IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR

A lone van appears behind them. It quickly catches up.

	AL (VO)
	What'd he look like?

	JOE
	He's not the problem.
	It's the van in the back.

Just as he says that...

CYCLE - The cyclist has a cellophane bag. He tosses it behind
him in a sweeping motion.

THE BAG - breaks open as it hits the road spewing 4 point spikes
across the tarmac.

JOE - sees the spikes, hits the brakes.

	JOE
	I take that back.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Joe's car runs over the spikes. All four
tires blow. Joe fights the swerve as the car threatens to go off
the road. The VAN rushes up to meet them.

THE CYCLE - in front, is joined by another...an ambush.

	AL (VO)
	What's happening?

Joe fights the car down to 30. The van pulls off on the
shoulder, around the spikes and pulls up in back of Joe.

	JOE
	What do I do?

	AL (VO)
	Outrun them.

	JOE
	This is a Fiesta!

UP AHEAD - another VAN cuts them off.

	JOE
	Now what?

	AL (VO)
	Whatever you do, just...don't stop.

Shredding his tires, he heads for a small gap between the van
and the guard rail. He shoots through it, tearing off both side
mirrors. Shots fly. The windshield SHATTERS. The car rolls down
an embankment...pastured countryside...a GOLF COURSE.

THE VAN AND CYCLES follow them at high speed through the trees.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

 AL is slammed around.

THE VAN

PULLS UP right behind...Slams into their bumper.

Joe cuts left, the van tries to follow. SPRANG! It catches,
wedged between two trees. A rider flies through the windshield.

JOE HITS SOMETHING. It rolls to a stop. Joe sits there, dazed.

	AL (VO)
	Are we safe?

As the engine dies...HEAR motorcycles.

	JOE
	I wouldn't say that.

	AL (VO)
	Then what are you stopping for?


JOE IS OUT -  running through the dark fields. Cycles,
headlights off...pursue. They circle him.

He sneaks along a ridge. A ROAR! - A cycle BLASTS out of the
trees, headlight impaling him.

Terrified, Joe jumps over the ridge.. The cycle leaps over him.
BLAAAT! It hits the ground, stops dead. The rider is thrown over
the handlebars. The cycle dies, mired in a sand trap.

JOE - runs through the woods. It grows quieter.

	AL (VO)
	Get your breathing down. You
	sound like a cement mixer.

	JOE
	Can't see a Goddamn thi..

He turns...BLAM! Something knocks him down. A man. Joe rolls
away. The man comes at him again. Joe tries to back away. The man
tackles him, driving him back into the bushes.

	JOE
	Help!

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL's helpless.

OUTSIDE

JOE - his arms are pinned. Under his helmet, the man's
neck is bare. Joe bites him. The man SCREAMS. He slugs Joe hard
in the face. Joe grabs for him again. The man kicks Joe in the
side of the head. Joe spins away. The man comes at him again but
slips. Joe catches him in the nuts with a boot. He groans and
sinks to the ground. Joe escapes.

Running full bore, he turns to look behind, stumbles, turns back
around, hits something.

	JOE
	Ooofff!

SIRENS - LIGHTS - he's caught on a chain link fence. Figures run
up, hard to see in the GLARE. A badge...UST SECURITY.

	SECURITY
	Stand where you are.

Joe turns, looks behind. The pursuers melt back into the trees.

	JOE
	I'm not going anywhere.


GOLF COURSE - NIGHT

The PURSUERS regroup.

	INTRUDER 1 (indicates UST)
	He's in there.

	LEADER (turns to 2)
	Call it off. Sterilize this area...

	INTRUDER 2
	That's it? We pull out?

	LEADER
	Let him go. We've got the PEM.


INT. UST

COLIN, OTHER TECHS seen through a lab window, confer
intently. Joe bursts in, scared, whispering frantically to Al.

	JOE
	I want out.

	AL (VO)
	Too late...They want you.

	JOE
	Why?
	AL (VO)
	You know too much.

	JOE
	I don't know anything. I just want to go home.

	AL (VO)
	You have no choice, you're involved.
	Will you help?

	JOE (yells)
	No!

Security people move in quickly.

	AL (VO)
	Calm Down! Act rational.

	JOE
	How do you act when someone
	trys to kill you?

The guards think he means the TECHS tried to kill him. FINNEGAN
recognises Joe. He pulls him away.

	FINNEGAN
	Now, Joe, you know it was all a
	mistake, don't you?

	JOE
	No, it wasn't, It was intentional.

	FINNEGAN
	Why would we want to hurt you?

	JOE
	Not you. Them.

	FINNEGAN
	Who?

	JOE
	I don't know Who.

	FINNEGAN (condescending)
	Do you know why?

	JOE
	I don't know...To get Al.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL (VO)
	No. Don't tell the guards.

OUTSIDE - THE LAB

	FINNEGAN
	Al?
.
	JOE
	The little man in my...
	(sees he's in trouble.)
	...head...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	Oh shit.


OUTSIDE - THE LAB - The guards exchange looks: another nut case!

	AL (VO)
	He doesn't know about the experiment.
	He'll just think you're nuts.


COLIN enters, glances at Joe, OTHER TECHS COME UP TO COLIN.

	TECH 3
	The Emergency committe...


INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	The Emergency Committee!

OUTSIDE - THE LAB

	TECH 3
	...will meet at Four.

	AL (VO)
	Four! Why not wait till Spring!
	I have to talk to them.


Joe tries to approach them, but the guard prevents him from
getting close. COLIN glances at Joe, pulls FINNEGAN aside.

	JOE
	I have to talk to them.

	COLIN
	What is it., Sergeant?

	FINNEGAN
	Must be delayed effects of the drug...
	I'll get him out of here.

	COLIN
	He work for us?

	FINNEGAN
	Ah...no sir. He was here for a job
	interview.

	COLIN (thinks for a moment)
	Give him a job.
.
	FINNEGAN
	What Job?

	COLIN
	Doesn't matter. Then put him away.

	FINNEGAN
	Sir?

	COLIN
	Private clinic. Best of care. Total
	privacy. We'll pay all costs.

	FINNEGAN
	Bit expensive, sir.

	COLIN
	It's the least we can do. After all,
	it's our responsibility.

Finnegan sits Joe at a desk as he fills out forms.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL (VO)
	Did you hear that?

OUTSIDE - THE LAB - JOE

	JOE
	Yeah. (to them) Al wants
	to talk to you!

THE TECHS, exhausted, look more worried...They speak furtively.

	TECH 2
	What'd he say, how's he
	know about Al?

	TECH 3
	What does he know?

	TECH 2
	Too much.

COLIN ignores it, continues his discussion.

	COLIN
	...You know the implications
	for the lab.

	TECH 2 (sarcastic)
	You mean that we lost the PEM and
	the POD and Al right out of the lab?
	Try to get a security clearance after
	that. The next government contract we
	get will be for urinal handles.

	TECH 3
	Look, nobody knows we did it.
.
	TECH 2
	Whoever took it does.

	COLIN
	They're not gonna tell.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL (VO)
	Hey, wait a minute. They don't
	have a clue who led the attack.
	Or who has the PEM. I don't like
	the sound of this.


OUTSIDE

 COLIN notices Joe evesdropping and moves the TECHS
into the next room. Joe can see them through a window, but cannot
hear them.

	JOE
	I get the idea they're writing 	you off.

INSIDE - THE POD - AL goes crazy...Flipping dials, cutting in
amplifiers and filters...no good. He cannot pick them up.

	AL
	What is it? What happened?

THE LAB -

 The guard watches Joe closely. He can't respond. He
sees the TECHS SPEAKING: Vital stuff, but we cannot hear it.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

- AL thinks frantically, mumbling to himself. He cranks up the main thrusters...

	AL
	I'll be out of touch for a bit.

INT. THE LAB

JOE shows surprise and confusion in as restrained
a manner as possible. The guard looks over, shifts his weight.

	JOE
	Going somewhere?

The guard just looks at him, curiously.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	I'll be right back. Don't go away.

INT. THE LAB

JOE - wants to respond, but can't.

INSIDE - EXT. - THE POD

Moves through a GIANT, FLUID FILLED CAVERN - THE INNER EAR.
 The SOUND is louder now...it rattles the POD. Al manouvers to the ORGAN
 OF CORTI, a ledge resting against a set of hairs sticking out of nerve cells.
 This is the organ where fluid vibrations are converted to electrical signals to the brain.
.
INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL triggers the SONOBUOY RELEASE.

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD -

 A SONOBUOY releases from a hatch.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD -

 AL programs...trying to pick up better sound. He INCREASES THE GAIN
and starts to HEAR THE TECHS.

	TECH 3
	It'l take months.

	TECH 2
	So we better get started.


OUTSIDE - THE LAB - THE TECHS SPEAK SOFTLY, BUT NOW WE CAN HEAR.

	TECH 3
	What about Al...

	COLIN
	...If he was right here, what
	would we do? What would we tell him?

	TECH 3
	You're glad to get rid of him!

	COLIN (ignores that)
	We tell him we don't have the PEM,
	we can't get you back to size...?

	TECH 2
	We can build another.

	COLIN
	Look at this mess. That would 	take months.

JOE - He's amazed, Al's enhancement lets him HEAR it too.

	AL (VO)
	It can't take that long.

	JOE
	Why?

JOE'S POV TECH 3-

	TECH3
	We have to get the PEM and
	reverse the process...before...

JOE
	AL (VO)
	...the POD looses power and can
	no longer maintain life support.

JOE'S POV - COLIN -

	COLIN
	How soon?
.
	TECH 2
WITHIN 92 HOURS...

JOE
	JOE
	Or what?

	AL
	I don't know. I don't want to find out.

COLIN looks over in Joe's direction.

	AL (VO)
	They'll find a way.

	COLIN (dismissive)
	Forget it...Al's dead. It's better...in a way.


INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL (indignant scream)
	BETTER! You son of a bitch!

	COLIN (coldly)
	Beyond our control...an accident.
	Nothing we can do. In a way, you
	might say...Al was lost ...at Sea.


Joe HEARS a gasp of frustration from Al. He tries to make the
best of it, tries to put the best face on it, to calm Al down.

	JOE
	They could put you back in the tube..

	AL (VO)
	I'd be helpless and useless.
	They don't have the PEM.
	Without that...there's no chance.

	JOE
	Well...they sure as hell aren't
	gonna get it for you.

	AL (VO)
	They're busy covering their
	asses. They're not the type
	of people we need."

	JOE
	Yeah...Who is?

	AL (VO)
	I am. You are.

	JOE
	You are CRAZY!

	AL (VO)
	You're the one talking to
	a little guy in your head.
	      (JOE SULKS)
	...We'll have to do it on our own.

	JOE
	What do you mean we.

	AL (VO)
	You gotta help.

	JOE
	I did. I brought you back here.

	AL (VO)
	We're a team...My...talent.
	Your... mobility.

	JOE
	Thanks.

	AL (VO)
	Think of the scientific data
	we'll gain. Come on, lets
	get out of here.

	JOE
	I'm not leaving until you do.

FINNEGAN steps in.

	FINNEGAN
	Nobody asked you to.

	AL (VO)
	You tell them about me,
	they'll put us both away
	for sure. Get out...now.

	JOE
	I'm not going anywhere until
	you get this guy out of my head.

	FINNEGAN
	Of course you're not.
	We'll take good care of you.

The guard grins at him. Joe doesn't like the way he grins.


	AL (VO)
	Ever think of what they might
	have to do to find me?

	JOE
	Find You?
.
	AL (VO)
	I'm not gonna make it easy.

JOE looks away. The guard slowly pulls out his cuffs.

	AL (VO)
	They'll have to take you apart.
	...piece by piece.

	JOE
	Why don't you just get out,
	leave me alone.

The guards think he means them. They turn and laugh at him.

	AL (VO)
	I got nowhere to go. Neither
	do you. You're either crazy, or...
	you got a little man in your head.
	Either way, they're gonna hold on
	to you.

Joe looks worried. The guard moves on him, he backs away.

	AL (VO)
	Do these guys look like they've
	got your best interests at heart.

As this thought settles into Joe's brain, one of the TECHS takes
an interest in him. He moves to Joe.

	TECH 3
	What seems to be the problem.

	AL (VO)
	Now's your chance. You want out,
	just tell him.

	JOE
	Ahhh...nothing.

	FINNEGAN
	Been complaning of hallucinations.

	JOE
	Not...complaining, actually.

	FINNEGAN
	Been hearing voices.

	TECH 3
	What kind of voices?

	JOE
	Oh...quiet ones...you would'nt
	be interested, actually.

	FINNEGAN
	Was quite excited, when he came in...
.
	JOE
	Much better now, thank you.
	Just sit here quietly...see there's
	nothing to worry about...just be
	my old self again....soon...

	TECH 3
	The gas did that

FINNEGAN nods yes. TECH 3 shakes his head...

	TECH 3
	Better keep an eye on him...

	JOE
	I'll be fine...fine..

	FINNEGAN
	What about all that stuff
	about a man in your head?

	TECH 3
	Aftereffects of the gas?

	AL (VO)
	Sue them.

	JOE
	I'll sue.

	FINNEGAN
	Sue who?

	JOE
	You...him...UST.

	TECH 3
	Look...don't worry. You're upset.
	There's no need to sue. We'll see
	that you don't leave here until
	you're perfectly okay.

	JOE
	Great!?

They leave, the door locks behind them, Joe sits alone.

	JOE
	I don't like the sound of that.

	AL (VO) (VO)
	We have to get out of here.

	JOE
	Door's locked.

	AL (VO) (VO)
	See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993

Joe tries it. The door clicks open.
.
	JOE
	Now what.

	AL (VO)
	Go out, take your first left.

	JOE
	Just walk down the hall?

	AL (VO)
	With Authority!

THE HALL - Joe steps out of the room and strides purposefully
down the hall. There are people in sight, but they don't seem to
notice him. He comes to a junction.

	JOE
	Which way do I go?

	AL (VO)
	What does it say.

	JOE
	Corridor A.

	AL (VO)
	Take a left and your next right.

	JOE
	Where are we going?


ANOTHER CODELOCK - JOE'S HAND PUNCHES IN. THE DOOR CLICKS OPEN.
JOE SLIDES THROUGH.

INT. ANTEROOM. THE BACK WAY INTO THE LAB. JOE snakes through
equipment. through a window we can see the MICROLAB, THE PEDESTAL
AND EMPTY BEACON. THROUGH AN OPPOSITE GLASS WINDOW, MORE TECHS IN
THE CONTROL ROOM. TV MONITORS SHOW CLOSEUPS OF EMPTY BEAKER.

	AL (VO)
	What do you see?

	JOE
	A lab and equipment.

	AL (VO)
	Is it familiar? Have you been
	here before.

	JOE
	I was thirsty. He told me to
	get a drink.

	AL (VO)
	Who did?

	JOE
	The man.

.
He looks at the monitors. Suddenly it comes to him.

	JOE
	Oh my God.


INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL echoes Joe.

	AL (VO)
	Oh my God...What did he
	look like, the man?

	JOE
	I can't remember..

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL triggers an electrical charge. JOE STARTS TO FLASH BACK.

	AL (VO)
	Concentrate. What did he
	look like?

Finally, Joe gets an image.

	JOE
	Like the guys that attacked us.

	AL (VO)
	What do you mean?

	JOE
	Black suits and helmets.

	AL (VO)
	That's it. They know I'm in here.
	We've got to find them.

	JOE
	That's not a good idea.

	AL (VO)
	They think we're safe here.
	They don't really need us.
	They're probably long gone.

	JOE
	Gone where?

	AL (VO)
	Don't know.


INT. LAB LOCKER ROOM - A LOCKER - JOE punches in code. The lock
snaps open. Joe finds a wallet crammed with ID, credit cards.

	JOE
	You need ID in there?
.
	AL (VO)
	You do. To get out of here.
	You're gonna be me.

	JOE
	I don't wanna be you.
	I wanna go home.

	AL (VO)
	You can't go home. When UST finds
	we're gone, they'll come after
	you and put us away.


GOLF COURSE - DAYBREAK.

 They wander through the scene of their attack...Everything is gone.
Only tire tracks and gashed trees attest to the chase.

	JOE
	Hopeless. Nothing here.

INSIDE INT. THE POD

AL tries to pick up something on his sensors -different patterns of brainwaves
- anything! But there is nothing. Desperate, he quizzes Joe, trying to zero in on wispy
feelings...to make them into hard data by computer searching.

	AL
	Anything...A feeling...a smell..?

	JOE
	Nothing!

For a moment, we are inside Joe's mind...jumbled images,
memories... feelings...vague and disjointed......the lab, the
bar, the chase, the attack, then it's gone.

	AL
	Wait a minute. The fight.
	Where did he get you?

	JOE
	Just scratched my arm, why?

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD -  THRUSTERS KICK IN - IT PULLS AWAY FAST.

	AL (VO)
	I'll be out of touch for a while.
	Just get to the airport.

OUTSIDE - JOE

	JOE (VO)
	The airport! Hey, wait a minute.


INSIDE - EXT. THE POD -

It pulls into the bloodstream....Is whisked at HIGH SPEED through the arteries.
 The trip is not far...He pulls into an area of great activity: A BATTLEFIELD.

THE WOUND - White blood cells and antibodies rush past. Invading
viral agents are hunted down and destroyed.
.
MICROSCOPIC BITS OF MATTER - dirt carried into the wound - now
relatively ENORMOUS - Loom over him as he powers through a
FANTASTIC INNERSPACE of organic and inorganic matter.

MASSIVE MOUNTAINOUS BOULDER - scene of a RAGING BATTLE between
invading viruses and antibodies. It writhes with the ebb and flow
of the battle as Al comes in closer...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL takes videos of the virus. He records
the structure of the rock. He hits the rock with his laser and
does a spectrum analysis. He analyses on the computers.

WHAWMMM. HE is slammed and jostled....as the POD is caught in an
ebb. He looks out the windows. Things are rushing madly past.

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD

 Antibodies are trapping the last of the
viruses as they try to make a getaway....Suddenly, one of the
Antibodies slows...turns...swings back at the POD.

INT. AL

. He drops everything and turns to escape.

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD

Al tries to outrun...dodging, getting
other particles between himself and his hunters...But it's no
good. There's no escape. Other killers bunch to cut the POD off.
Al swirls away., swings round a bit of matter. There it is...

GIANT ANTIBODY - COMING RIGHT FOR HIM. A rushing sound...like
being run down by the Queen Mary. This is it.

He closes his eyes and braces. Nothing happens. He looks.

It has rushed past. Ignoring him, it hits a mass of toxins and
shatters them. It breaks apart, small components attach to the
germs and kill them.

	AL
	Under the threshold, I'm too
	small to do damage.to the body
	...or they'll get to me later.

He looks up, looming over him like a vast tent...is SOMETHING.

NEAR THE SKIN SURFACE

 Diffused light sparkles off of blue veins and red capillaries...A sparkling field of motion..
The THING is a deep GREEN with purple highlights...It once was alive
and maybe still is...Tendrils of waving streamers trail out
behind it...As antibodies attach to it...Slowly it changes, dies,
becomes absorbed. It seems familiar to him...

INT. AIRPORT - LATER -

JOE sits, uncomfortable.

	AL (VO)
	I'm back.

	JOE
	I'm at the airport.

	AL (VO)
	Good. Get to a phone.

Joe is up and moving.

	AL (VO)
	Call this number in Washington.

He reaches a phone. Dials the number.

	JOE
	Who is it?

	AL (VO)
	Not who. A data bank. Just keep
	your ear to the phone and don't
	make a sound.

INSIDE INT. THE POD

 AL plays the computers. Rapidly punching
in, he connects to a Data Bank and downloads some programs.

OUTSIDE

Joe notices a man waiting for the phone.

	JOE
	Al..

INSIDE INT. THE POD

The program aborts. He quickly reboots it.

	AL
	Don't talk, I told you.
	You just screwed it up.

	JOE (VO)
	What am I supposed to do?

	AL
	Nothing. You just do nothing.

OUTSIDE

The man grows impatient. He looks at his watch,
pointedly. Joe points at the phone, helplessly. He does a dumb
show of getting berated. Meanwhile, all he HEARS is the high
pitched whistle of digital data transmission.

INSIDE INT. THE POD

AL downloads:

INSERT - SCREENS - A BOTANNICAL INDEX ; A GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX.

OUTSIDE

 Joe cups his hand over the phone. Whispers
conspiratorially to the impatient man.

	JOE
	Sorry. She's out of her mind!

	MAN (hesitates...then)
	It's okay. I've got one like that.

Joe smiles at him. Hand over the phonespeaker, he mumbles...

	JOE
	Yes dear..yes dear...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

 AL takes a spectrum analysis. This composition data, he feeds into
a data bank for corelation. He does some quick and elegant analyzing.
.
	JOE
	What is it?

	AL (VO)
	Composition of the sand,
	...trace elements..unique...

INSERT - THE SCREEN - A STARTLING ANSWER -  THE GOTO

OUTSIDE -
	JOE	 (surprised)
	Go to, What the Hell does
	that mean?!!

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	GO-TOE. It's some islands.

OUTSIDE -
	JOE
	What does some island have
	to do with this? It's a mistake?

	AL (VO)
	It's all we've got.

	JOE
	What do we do?

	AL (VO)
	Send a man there. A secret agent.

	JOE
	Who?... (He balks) Wait a minute!
	I'm no agent, secret or otherwise.
	And..I'm alone.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	You are not alone. But you are incon-
	picuous...and, with our abilities...

OUTSIDE -
	JOE
	What abilities...?

	AL (VO)
	Face it, we're the men for the job.
	Besides, if someone is really chasing
	you, the best way to avoid them is to
	keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.

	JOE (VO)
	You mean...just leave.

	AL (VO)
	We get on a plane.

	JOE
	We get on which plane?
.
INSIDE INT. THE POD

AL finds the answer in the GEO-DATA BANK:
GOTO are beautiful islands at the southern tip of JAPAN.

	AL
	The one for...JAPAN

OUTSIDE


 JOE spots a sign: NORTH/NORTHWEST ORIENT - NONSTOP

	JOE
	What about money?

	AL (VO)
	What about it?

	JOE
	I don't have any.

	AL (VO)
	Use my credit cards.

	JOE
	I can't do that.

	AL (VO)
	Why not?

	JOE
	It's illegal.

	AL (VO)
	Who cares?

	JOE
	I'll get in trouble.

	AL (VO)
	You are in trouble. Now do it.

INT. PLANE - FIRST CLASS LOUNGE.

 JOE watches the inflight movie.
Someone chases Cary Grant across a cornfield in a cropduster.

INSIDE INT. THE POD

AL munches trailmix while he rags Joe.

	AL
	Thus Joe Doakes, chronic under-
	achiever, becomes Secret Agent 001..
	with a desperate assignment...

OUTSIDE

- Joe is not in the best of moods.

	JOE
	...and a license to kill...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	Well, if not to kill,
	then to bother and annoy.

OUTSIDE

- Suddenly a thought occurs to Joe. He sits up and speaks loudly.
.
	JOE
	Hey...You forgot something.

The lady in the seat next to him has forgotten nothing, is
startled by Joe, looks at him uneasily...He indicates he was
talking to Cary Grant on the screen. Speaks under his breath.

	JOE
	They'll know who I am.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	We'll change your appearance.

INT. PLANE LAVORATORY - MIRROR - Joe combs his hair differently.

	JOE
	It's just not enough.

	AL (VO)
	It's attitude...how you carry
	yourself.

	JOE
	What's wrong with how I carry myself.

	AL (VO)
	Nothing, but it's yours. Change it.
	Change your whole persona.

	JOE
	Oh yeah, to what?

	AL (VO)
	You'll be me.

	JOE
	I don't want to be you. I don't even
	like you, why would I want to be you?

	AL
	Because you got my ID. Now
	brace yourself. I'm gonna try
	something with your glands.

	JOE
	You leave my glands alone!

A KNOCK ON THE DOOR - Joe yelps in alarm.

	STEWARDESS (VO)
	Are you alright in there?

	JOE
	Fine...fine.

As he says that, he looks in the mirror: his face starts to
change form...the tissues in his cheeks swell just a bit.
-- a subtle but startling change...not enough to fool a close
friend but enough enough to fool a casual glance.



GOTO - KUJUKUSHIMA -

An incredibly beautiful tropical island on
Japan's South Pacific coast. Joe crashes through the shoreline.

	JOE
	Now what?

	AL (VO)
	The beach.

	JOE
	The beach?

	AL (VO)
	How else do you get seaweed
	under your nails?

	JOE
	Eating sushi?

	AL (VO)
	Just get there.

EXT. DAY

Joe emerges from the jungle onto a pristine, lovely
beach. Other small, pine covered islands dot the sparkling sea.

	JOE
	Holy shit!

	AL (VO)
	What is it?

	JOE
	...Just beautiful.

He runs down to the shoreline, excited.

	AL (VO)
	Do you notice anything.

	JOE
	The sky, the sun, the sea...
	There's no one here.
	It's deserted. What now?

	AL (VO)
	Swim.

	JOE
	Good Idea!

He tears off his clothes, charges into the surf. He pulls out into the lagoon.

INSIDE INT. THE POD

AL monitors Joe's exertion.

	AL (VO)
	Take it easy, now. Don't want
	you in over your head.

	JOE
	Little late for that.

He takes a breath and dives.

UNDERWATER - JOE swims through submarine grottos grabbing
bunches of seaweed. He surfaces, pulls for the shore. He stumbles
up the beach covered with seaweed.

	JOE
	Here...all the seaweed you want.
	Now, what?

	AL (VO)
	You eat it.

	JOE
	You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL (VO)
	I'm living on freeze dried
	limas and ham. Just eat it.

OUTSIDE

 Chastised, Joe considers the seaweed, then stuffs some
of it in his mouth.

	JOE
	Now what?

	AL (VO)
	The sand.

	JOE
	Eat it?

	AL (VO)
	Eat it.

	JOE (VO)
	I don't want to eat it.

	AL (VO)
	Why not?

	JOE
	It's sand.

	AL (VO)
	For chrissakes, it's only sand. You
	should see some of the stuff that's
	floating around in here. That sand's
	the cleanest thing in you, including
	me. Now EAT it!

OUTSIDE

 Joe puts some on his tongue, makes a face.

	AL (VO)
	Now lie down somewhere quiet and
	rest, I'll be back in a while.

	JOE
	Where are you going? Wait!

But Al is gone.

INSIDE EXT. THE POD

AL powers through the throat region to his
palate...He ZOOMS through what look like floating gardens -
microscopic bits of seaweed, big as the Hindenberg to Al.

INSIDE INT. THE POD

 AL compares the seaweed and silicon structures.

	AL
	It matches.

OUTSIDE

Joe looks around the deserted beach.

	JOE
	Good. Now what?

INSIDE INT. THE POD -

 AL, for once, doesn't know what to say.

THE BEACH - SUNSET

 Joe wakes, finds himself alone. In the
distance a figure runs down the beach toward him. He can't make
it out too well in the backlight. It gets closer...It becomes
clear: an incredibly beautiful girl in a bikini - RENE.

	JOE
	Al, are you doing anything in there?

	AL (VO)
	What? What do you mean?

	JOE
	Are you screwing with any nerves?


INSIDE INT. THE POD - AL

- busy working at DATABASES, glances
nervously at his elapsed time digital clock...44 hours gone.

	AL (VO) (brusque)
	What are you talking about?

OUTSIDE -

Joe shades his eyes.  He sees her clearly. She is the
most beautiful girl he's ever seen. She notices him.

	JOE
	My god...She's real!

She flashes a shy smile as she lopes by. He sits up.

	AL (VO) (exited)
	Your heartrate went up.
	What is it?

	JOE
	Beautiful!

	AL (VO)
	What was?

	JOE
	A girl.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	Al
	Never mind that. Get back to business.


OUTSIDE - Joe is just stunned by the receding image of beauty.

	JOE
	This must be business,
	there's nothing else here.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	Follow it.

OUTSIDE - he takes off after her, down the beach.

	JOE
	Good idea!

THE GIRL - She runs fast and easy. Perfect body in perfect
shape. She runs up, over the rocks on the headland. The sun
glimmers through pine covered islets across the lagoon.

JOE - He starts off fast and quickly slows.

INSIDE INT. THE POD

 AL monitors Joe's body.

	AL (VO)
	What is it?

OUTSIDE - JOE

- straining. Far ahead, she glances back.

	JOE
	She's...pretty fast.

	AL (VO)
	You're out of shape.

Joe is half dead. He may not catch her at all.

INSIDE INT. THE POD -

 AL stimulates his brain, releasing an
organic speedlike chemical...His fatigue drops away, oxygen
conversion increases...

	Al
	Catch up to her.

	Joe
	That's what I'm trying..
	...Hey, what's going on?

JOE - GOING SO FAST he seems ready to explode. He burns right up to her
like she's standing still. Surprised, she stumbles. He slows, matches stride with her.
 He GASPS:

	AL (VO)
	What is it?

	JOE
	She's beautiful...!
	What do I do?

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL ponders...

	AL
	Tell her.

OUTSIDE -

 Joe is starting to pant...He looks a little crazed.
She's starting to wonder about this guy. She keeps running.

	JOE
	You're beautiful..

	AL (VO)
	What's happening?

	JOE
	She doesn't seem to understand.

	AL (VO)
	Try another language.

	JOE
	Which language?


INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	How should I know?

OUTSIDE - She watches Joe curiously.

	JOE
	Vous etes tres beau.

	RENE (she laughs)
	Thanks, you're handsome too.

	JOE
	Now what?

She looks at him strangely... Is he some weirdo?

	JOE
	Help me out, will you?

INSIDE INT. THE POD - AL

	AL (VO)
	What can I do? You're on your own.

	RENE
	How can I help you?

	JOE (answers them both)
	Tell me what to say.

She starts to turn away, Joe panics.

	JOE
	Wait. Don't go...There's..more!

	GIRL (turns back, half amused)
	More?

An awkward silence.

	JOE
	What do I do?

INSIDE INT. THE POD - AL -

	AL (VO)
	Don't just stand there, say something.

	JOE
	What?

	AL (VO)
	Anything. Aw hell...Just tell
	her the truth.

OUTSIDE - RENE

	RENE
	What do you do about what?

	JOE
	...I'm looking for someone.

INSIDE INT. THE POD - AL

	AL (VO)
	Not that truth!

OUTSIDE - THE GIRL

	RENE
	Aren't we all.

	JOE
	Come on...it's going to take
	two of us to make this work.

The girl looks at him curiously.

	JOE
	...at least two.

Now she is confused.

	RENE
	Is someone else here?

	JOE
	No. No one to speak of.

	RENE
	I am confused. Or maybe it's you.


INSIDE INT. THE POD - AL is ripping through data banks.

	AL (VO)
	How about a quotation...?  A poet...Blake!

OUTSIDE - Joe is babbling.

	JOE
	...Blake

	RENE
	Blake?

	JOE
	The poet...something he said...

	RENE
	Yes?

Joe looks at her helplessly.

INSIDE INT. THE POD - AL finally finds the quotation...

	AL (VO)
                           .

	JOE
                            .

	RENE
	Blake said that?

	JOE
	Yeah. One of the corniest lines
	I ever heard.

	AL (VO)
	Sorry...

	RENE
	It'll remind me of you.

INSIDE INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	Works like a charm when I use it.
	You didn't say it right.

OUTSIDE -
	JOE
	You won't need to be reminded.

	RENE
	Why not?

	JOE
	I'll be right there.

	RENE
	Where?

	JOE
	Dinner...tonight.

	RENE
	Oh...I can't. Business.

She turns to go.

	AL (VO)
	Wait.

	JOE
	Wait.

She turns back.

	AL (VO)
	Where is she staying?

	JOE
	Where are you staying?

	RENE
	Right here.


UP THE BEACH - AN EXCLUSIVE HOTEL - set back among the trees.

	RENE
	And you.

	JOE
	...right here too.

	RENE
	Haven't seen you around.

She's pulling away.

	JOE
	I just got here. (to Al)
	She's getting away.

INSIDE INT. THE POD - AL - an idea:

	AL (VO)
	Touch her.

OUTSIDE - JOE

	JOE
	What?

	AL (VO)
	Touch some part of her body.
	Trust me. It works.

She slows to a walk. Joe joins her. He looks at her body...Up
and down.  She sees him looking at her.

	JOE (confused)
	What part?

	AL (VO)
	Doesn't matter.

	RENE
	What part what?

INSIDE INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	The best part. She'll love it.

OUTSIDE - Her body. Then Joe's face.

	JOE
	I can't do that?

	RENE
	Do what?

	JOE
	Let you leave without it.

	RENE
	Without what?

He grabs her hand, she is startled, pulls back, He kisses
it...her hand. She flinches, then breaks into laughter.

	RENE
	I've seen that before.
	Never had anyone actually do it.

INSIDE INT. THE POD - AL

	AL (VO)
	Do what? What'd you do?

OUTSIDE - JOE
	JOE
	I saw it in a movie.

	AL (VO)
	Saw what?!

	RENE
	What is your name?

INSIDE INT. THE POD - AL

	AL (VO)
	Don't give her your name.

Joe is dumbstruck for a moment.

	JOE
	...Joe.

INSIDE INT. THE POD - AL

	AL (VO)
	No...you idiot!

OUTSIDE - She holds half a crooked smile as she measures him.

	JOE
	Or better yet,...Al.

She starts giggling.

	JOE
What's so funny?

	RENE
	Nothing...Al. Why do you talk 	that way?

	JOE
	What way?

	RENE
	Like there's someone else here.

Joe has lost it. Al is mumbling hints and encouragements into
his ear. Joe starts to babble. It starts off as bullshit, but
gradually his sincerity becomes endearing.

	JOE
	It's...all the sun...No...
	its the beach...The light....
	and the water...

	RENE (kidding)
	I know...the flowers, the air...

	JOE
	Naw...It's just you.


She smiles, turns, runs up the beach.

	JOE
	Wait. What's your name?

	RENE
	...Rene.

	AL (VO)
	What happened?

	JOE
	...Rene...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD -

 AL'S alarm panel flickers on, then off.

	AL (excited)
	What happened?

	JOE (VO)(alarmed)
	What is it?

	AL (sarcastic)
	I think your heart stopped.

NEARBY HOTEL - A little known resort for the cognoscenti. A
place of beauty and solitude. Joe starts to follow her.

	AL
	Where are you going?

	JOE
	To the hotel. To register.

	AL
	Without your pants.

	JOE
	Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.


He stops, turns and heads back up the beach.

	AL
	Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.

	JOE
	Yeah. Some help. That poetry
	really killed her.

	AL
	It worked.

	JOE
	I made it work.

	AL
	You stumbled around. Remember,
	you've got my ID, you've got to
	be me, not some stumblebum.

	JOE
	Rene...


	JOE
	I'm not some hot shot test pilot.
	I'm not some playboy. I don't
	usually pick up girls.

	AL
	Well you did it today.

	JOE
	Yeah. I did it.

	AL (VO)
	But, you've got to have...
	sophistication ...savoir faire.

	JOE (pissed)
	Here, savor this.

Joe goes nuts...He screams, hops around, shakes his head.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL is being rattled all over the place.

OUTSIDE

Joe vents his frustration. He howls, punches himself in the
head...He runs down the beach, flips, lands in the surf.

	JOE
	Now, fuck off.

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD

Bucked all over the place by Joe's gyrations. It slams into
nerve bundles, glances off.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL fights for control. Consoles are lit up. Relays are sparking.
Al is suitably panicked.

	AL
	Mayday! Goddamn it. Stop!

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD

trampolines off a membrane, comes to rest wedged into a nerve
bundle.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL - The Monitors start sparking. He's picking something up. The
SCREENS show new, strange information. Al forgets his anger,
everything else in his growing excitement.

	AL
	What is this? What is this?
	Joe! Joe, are you there?

OUTSIDE - EXT. THE BEACH

JOE floats at the shoreline.

	JOE
	Now, where would I be?

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	What are you looking at?

OUTSIDE

Joe scans the beautiful inlet. The pine covered islets are
silhouetted by the waning sun that glints off the azure sea.

JOE - A BEAT

	JOE
	Nothing.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL - mounting excitement.

	AL
	But what's it look like?

OUTSIDE - JOE

	JOE
	What's nothing look like?
	...it looks like nothing.

	AL (VO)
	Is something glinting?

JOE

The sun is right in his eyes. He shields them with his hand.
He's tired and cranky; more than a little annoyed at Al.

	JOE
	Sure something's glinting.

	AL (VO) (practically shouting)
	What is it?

	JOE
	What is it, it's nothing...
	It's just the sun.

Suddenly it dawns. On Joe.

INSIDE  INT. THE POD

AL squints at:

INSERT - THE MONITOR

Very low resolution, but it's there. Breaking up; all the wrong
colors; but you can make it out. Definitely...an image.

	JOE (VO)
	What is it?

	AL
	Looks like...the optic nerve.
	I can see out!

OUTSIDE

Joe sits on the beautiful, deserted beach. The sun; the rocks;
the glinting waves. Suddenly...he's got to share it.  It, and
everything else.

	JOE (ruefully)
	Oh...swell!

THE INN - THAT EVENING - EXCLUSIVE MEN'S SHOP

Joe's wearing a new sports coat; very expensive. He holds up a
tie, regards it in the mirror. A slight facial tick at the
intrusive voice:

	AL (VO)
	You really like that shirt?

	JOE
	This...is not going to work out.

	SALESMAN
	Sir?

Joe is distracted...He stumbles:

	JOE
	Ahh...ahh...ahh...The shirt!...

	SALESMAN
	The shirt?

	AL (VO)
	Much too blue.

	JOE
	Not blue enough.

The salesman...a minute hesitation.

	SALESMAN
	Not blue enough, sir. Right it is.

He zips off toward the shirt racks. Joe turns to the mirror.

	JOE
	Mind your own business.

	AL (VO)
	It is my business. It's my name.

	JOE
	But the rest is me.
	I'll dress like I want.

He notices someone. The salesman has returned carrying blue
shirts to find his customer mumbling to himself.

	SALESMAN
	How about these, sir?

	JOE
	...just like I want..

He turns back, holds up another tie.

	AL (VO)
	Not that tie with that coat.

	JOE
             (Exasperated, blurts out.)
	Why not?!

	SALESMAN
            (thinks he's speaking to him)
	Why not, indeed, Sir!

 	AL (VO)
	It's much too loud.

	JOE
	So are you.

	JOE
         (indicates tierack)
	And all these, too.

Salesman turns back. Joe glances up.

HIS POV - THROUGH THE WINDOW TO THE LOBBY

Rene, another woman, and three men; a slight blond; a tall,
powerful, dark-haired man; and a well-dressed Japanese, walk
toward the LANAI.

JOE

turns to salesman, grabs a blank bill.

	JOE
	Send it to my room.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY

Joe exits shop, moves to the LANAI.

EXT. LANAI

A Bouganvilliaed veranda overlooking the Sea. Joe appears at the
door, checks out Rene's party as he waits.

	AL (VO)
	What did that cost?

	JOE
	You want sophistication,
	it don't come cheap.

	AL (VO)
	Doesn't.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL/JOE'S POV

Both women are pretty.

	AL
	Which one is she?

	JOE (VO)
	The beautiful one.

The Maitre'D approaches, checks out Joe's clothes approvingly.

	AL (VO)
	They both look good to me.

	JOE
	You have no taste.

	MAITRE'D
	Sir?

	JOE
	I'd like a place. For one.

	MAITRE'D
	Yes Sir. Right this way.

	AL (VO)
	Get close to them.

	JOE
	That place. By the window.

Joe indicates a large table next to Rene's party.

	MAITRE'D
	I'm sorry, Sir. That's for
	four persons.

	JOE
	I'll be four persons.

	MAITRE'D
	Excuse me, Sir?

Joe strides towards his objective. The Maitre'D scurries behind.
He stops at the table, pulls out the chair with the best angle
on Rene. The Maitre'D is about to object. Joe cuts him off.

	JOE
	If they don't show up, charge me
	for four. Send the bill to my room.

A HESITATION. Joe acts assured. The Maitre'D checks his clothes
again. Very expensive. He pulls out Joe's chair.

	MAITRE'D
	Yes Sir! Four it is!

Joe sits with aplomb. Grabs the plum from the bowl of fruit and
takes a big, satisfied bite. The Maitre'D bows and backs off. Joe
glances at the other table. Rene looks up, sees him, seems
surprised. He gives her a big smile, but his words are for Al.

	JOE
	How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!

	WAITER
	Sir?

Joe turns, the waiter looms over him. He thinks fast.

	JOE
	How's that Trucklhouser Beer?

	WAITER
	We have Henekin, Kirin...(Joe nods)
	Very good, sir.

	JOE
	This sophistication ain't tough.
	All it takes is a credit card.

He smiles a bigger smile over at Rene.

	AL (VO)
	Don't overplay it.

The waiter comes back with the beer. Joe looks up at him,
smiles, delivers a line meant for Al.

	JOE
	If it's sophistication you want,
	I'm the man for it.

The waiter's smile freezes in place. He backs off a bit.

	AL (VO)
	That's Rene?

Rene, turns, sees Joe, flashes him a quick smile of recognition.

INSIDE INT. THE POD

AL - picks her up on his MONITOR. In that moment, he falls for
her; an audible GROAN escapes him.

	JOE (VO)
	Now you know what I know.

	WAITER (VO)
	Sir?

OUTSIDE

The waiter. Again Joe's caught mumbling.

	JOE
	About cholesterol...You know what
	I know, you'd have the seafood.

	WAITER
	Ahhh. Good choice, sir.

He turns away.

	AL (VO)
	You're not just after
	this girl, are you?

	JOE
	Who, me?

	AL (VO) (exasperated)
	Goddamn it, there are 52 hours gone!

	JOE
	You got a better idea, you
	tell me. Other than her, there's
	no one here I know.

	AL (VO)
	Pan the group, will you. If
	you're right, at least one
	of them...is involved.

	JOE
	That's a big if.

HE pans the group. The second woman talks to the slight, blond
man. Rene talks to the Japanese. Joe stops on the ROUGH LOOKING
MAN, who sits, silently watching them.

	AL (VO)
	Wait. I think I know that guy.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL enhances Joe's audio input and they hear snatches of
conversation... Tech-talk.

OUTSIDE

Joe's eyes keep straying to the women. They are beautiful.
They're talking about perfume in French.

	AL (VO)
	Shit. Pay attention!

The group goes merrily about their business of coctails and
lunch as the Waiter and Captain fuss about them.

	AL (VO)
	Who are they? Stay on them, will you.
	How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.

	JOE
	What glasses.

	AL (VO)
	The drinks...Stay on them.

The busboy clears the drink glasses.

	AL (VO)
	Follow that busboy.

	JOE
	Are you serious?

	WAITER
	About what sir?

The waiter has appeared. Hovers...

	JOE
	The fresh tuna?..

	WAITER
	Yessir...very good sir.

Joe is up, following the busboy...hands the menu to the waiter.

	JOE
	I'll have it.

HALLWAY

He grabs the busboy, spins him, grabs the glasses, and ducks
into the men's room. The boy is terrified, then confused.

BATHROOM

Joe ducks into one of the stalls.

	JOE
	I feel like an idiot.

	AL (VO)
	Just hold them close and stay still.

Mumbling to himself, Joe sits on the toilet holding a cocktail
glass to his eye. He feels pretty silly.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL trains his ARGON LASER, it shows  fingerprints refracted off
the glass surface.

MONITOR SCREEN - LATER - INTERPOL DATA BANK

One of the men's pictures comes up...along with a string of
aliases and his dossier. A rough character: Jan GRUNER.

	AL
	Well, we know one of them's
	a danger.

Joe is on the phone, listening.

	JOE
	Will you hurry up, I'm hungry.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL downloads data bank info.

	AL
	One of these guys is on file.

OUTSIDE

Another patron enters, looks at Joe, at the glass. Joe puts it
down. It's one of Rene's party; GRUNER.

	JOE
	Which one?

	AL (VO)
	The blond...GRUNER. A killer.

	JOE
	Killer!

	GRUNER (threatening)
	What?

	JOE
	That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!

	GRUNER
	I noticed you staring.

	JOE
	Couldn't help it. No offense.
	She's not your wife is she...?

GRUNER seems to lose interest...He turns away.

	GRUNER
	Enjoy your lunch.

LANAI

Joe reenters. Rene and the others look up at him.

	JOE (mumbles)
	I'm out of my league.

	AL (VO)
	Just don't show fear.

	JOE
	I don't know what's going on.

	AL (VO)
	It lends you an air of mystery.

As he walks by their table, Rene speaks to him.

	RENE
	Thought we lost you.

The older man turns around - DIETER - he's friendly.

	DIETER
	Who is your friend?

	RENE
	We met on the beach.

	DIETER
	Join us.

	JOE
	I don't want to intrude.

	DIETER
	We insist.

Seated, he feels all eyes on him; an object of study.

	JOE
	Al Viola.

	DIETER
	That name's familiar.

	JOE
	It is to me too.

	DIETER
	You remind me of someone. You
	from the west coast?

	AL (VO)
	He recognises you, throw him off.

	JOE
	My coast is Maine, actually. We
	have a place in Bar Harbor...And
	a bar in Sutton Place.

	AL (VO)
	Don't get too cute.

	DIETER
	And what do you do?

	AL (VO)
	Let's make 'em nervous.
	Tell them you're
	CIA, see what they do.

	JOE
	...Foreign service.

	DIETER
	And how do you service foreigners.

	JOE
	Well...I try to give them whatever
	they want.

	RYUJI
	Must be a fulfilling occupation.

	JOE
	It keeps me busy. Everybody always
	wants something.

	DIETER
	What brings you here?

	JOE
	I came for a rest. As, I imagine,
	you did. To get away with it all.

	RENE
	You mean from it.

	JOE
	Yes, of course.

The Japanese has an air of expectancy...as if he is waiting for
someone, but he doesn't know whom....

	AL (VO)
	Could be him. Look at that watch.

Joe looks. The man wears a high tech-programmable wrist watch.

	JOE
	Look at that watch...

Ryuji is pleased, quietly proud of his nation's accomplishments.

	RYUJI
	CMOS chips. The latest thing.
	Ryuji Obe. Pleasure to meet you.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL runs RYUJI's responses through a Voice Stress Analyzer...
RYUJI is hiding quite a lot,

	AL (VO)
	High Tech Japanese. Highly Suspect.

OUTSIDE

Dieter turns from Gruner to introduce him.

	DIETER
	And...you know Jan Gruner?

	JOE
	I think I've heard of you.

	RYUJI (laughs)
	Unsavory reputation. Tech dealer.

	GRUNER (no sense of humor))
	I break no laws.

	RENE
	His country has no laws
	against dealing in
	strategic technology.

	GRUNER
	I provide service to my customers.

	AL (VO)
	At least he's telling the truth.

Joe turns to Rene.

	JOE
	And you?

	RENE
	I just work for the travel firm.

	AL (VO)
	She's hard to read, but she's
	hiding something too.

Joe's gaze wanders.

	GRUNER
	And you, there are many places
	to get away. Why here?

	JOE
	A little voice in my head.

	AL (VO)
	Joe, be careful!

	JOE
	...I've lost something. I must
	get it back.

	RYUJI
	What could you find in this place?

	JOE
	...Piece of mind.

Gruner's had enough. He gets up abruptly...leaves...

	GRUNER
	You may you find all the
	solitude you want.

	JOE
	Thanks, I appreciate that.

Then, abruptly, it's over. Gruner, Ryuji get up.

	RYUJI
	We have some work..
	Please excuse us.

He takes the other woman, they depart. Rene smiles at Joe. He
grabs his check from the waiter and signs it.

Rene has wandered over to the far end of the Veranda. Alone. Joe
looks at her in the moonlight, slowly makes his way over to her.
	AL (VO)
	They're all in it.

	JOE
	How do you know?

	AL (VO)
	Voice stress analyzer.

	JOE
	Your data must be bad. Everyone
	can't be lying all the time.

	Al
	Where have you been?

	JOE
	Even Rene?

	AL (VO)
	She's the toughest to read.

	JOE
	Maybe she's telling the truth.

	AL (VO)
	Can't tell. Every time I try her,
	you look away. Or you make noises.
	Maybe you don't want to know.

	JOE
	Come on...look at her. Don't you
	know anything about women?...
	The data is skewed. We might as
	well go with instinct...

They come up to her, lovely in the moonlight.

	AL (VO)
	I know what your instinct is.

She turns, she is smiling for him.

	RENE
	You again.

	JOE
	Me still. They left you alone?

	RENE
	I waited for you.

	JOE
	Why?

	RENE
	...I...don't know.

	AL (VO)
	You believe that, I've got a bridge
	in Brooklyn for you.

This breaks the mood, Joe starts to get pissed.

	JOE (to Rene)
	Well...make something up.

	RENE
	I guess it's a combination you
	don't often see. Apparent attraction..

	JOE
	It's not apparent.

	RENE
	...and sort of...disinterest.

	JOE
	Disinterest?

	RENE
	As if your mind's not all there.

	JOE
	I am sort of scattered.

	RENE
	Can I help?

	JOE
	You are.

	RENE
	Are you alright?

	AL (VO)
	Yeah, are you? You're
	talking nonsense.

	JOE (a pause)
	I'm fine, never better.
	I'll get us some drinks...
	Excuse me.

Steps away.
	AL (VO)
	What is it, your charm?

	JOE
	This just won't work.

	AL (VO)
	You're doing great with her.

	JOE
	Not her. You!

	AL (VO)
	What is it?

	JOE
	You can't listen.
	You can't watch either.

	AL (VO) (outraged)
	Why not?.

	JOE
	It's embarrassing.

	AL (VO)
	What if she says something important?

	JOE
	I'll be right here. I'll keep
	it in mind. I'll get a lot more
	from her without you butting in.

	AL (VO)
	What am I supposed to do?

	JOE
	You got any books in there?

	AL (VO)
	Oh come on.

	JOE
	You shut down your sensors.

	AL
	Joe! It's 56 hours!

	JOE
	I mean it. You watch old tapes of
	the ballgame, I'll fill you in...
	later. I mean it.

He(they) look over at her. She is looking in Joe's direction
curiously. Al thinks it over.

	AL (VO)
	...Okay...okay. Just...don't
	take all night!

ANGLE - RENE

She turns, he's returned with the drinks.

	RENE
	Promise me something.

	JOE
	Okay, no more poems.

She laughs.
	JOE
	Promise you what?

	RENE
	That you're not crazy.

	JOE
	I promise you that. I am
	not crazy. Course, if I was,
	I'd be the last to know.
	Why do you ask?

	RENE
	You talk to yourself.

	JOE
	But I don't listen...then
	I'd be crazy.

	RENE
	Why do you do it?

	JOE
	If I was with you, I wouldn't

	RENE
	You did.

	JOE
	That was then. This is now.
	Who am I talking to?

	RENE
	You're talking to me.

	JOE
	And how'm I doing?

	RENE
	You're doing...Okay.

	JOE
	Just Okay...

All of a sudden, you can see it in her eyes. More than Okay. Joe
can't quite believe it, but he's not going to deny it. He is,
after all, a secret agent and she's got some wonderful secrets.
He moves closer...She eases back into the Bougainvillea. They go
through the dialogue, but their minds are on something else.

	RENE
	...Ummm, you really work
	for the foreign service?

	JOE
	...Naw. Made that up.

	RENE
	Who do you work for?

	JOE
	No one. No one at all.
	I'm unemployed. Who do you?

	RENE
	Trans Ocean Travel.

	JOE
	Is that Ryuji?

	RENE
	No. Ryuji just hires us.

	JOE
	Hires you for what?

	RENE
	To organize things. Meetings
	and travel...Whenever they come
	here, I handle details.

	JOE
	How often they come here?

	RENE
	He likes the quiet. They were
	here last week.

	JOE
	And you, what do you like?

	RENE
	That depends...

They can't hold out a second longer. Joe cannot believe his good
luck...her beauty, his attraction...when they kiss.

ON THE BEACH. MORNING

JOE WAKES AT A VOICE YELLING IN HIS EAR.

	AL (VO)
	Wake up. Time to wake up.
	Sixty four hours...Shit!

Joe sits up, groggy. Looks around, no one.

	AL (VO)
	What Happened?

	JOE
	I don't know!

	AL (VO)
	What she say. What'd you
	get out of her?

Half asleep...pleasantly dazed, he just grins and mumbles to
himself.

	JOE
	Ahhh...works...Ryuji...
	travel...just business...She's..
	Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..

	AL (VO)
	Is that all?

	JOE
	Oh, you were right. They've
	all been here before...
	met just last week.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL is excitedly irate.

	AL (VO)
	Anything else!

OUTSIDE

Joe thinks...finally...

	JOE
	She's got the most beautiful...s

	AL (VO)
	Shit! You're in love.

	JOE (not convincing)
	I'm not in love.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

pissed.

	AL
	And on my time.

	JOE(VO)
	It's not your time. I get time off.

	AL
	You get time off to sleep.

OUTSIDE -
	JOE
	That's what I was doing..mostly.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

The frustration's getting to him. Or is something else? He's
starting to rant.

	AL (VO)
	I've got twenty hours left.
	I could die in here. And
	you're falling in love.

OUTSIDE -
	JOE
	It's not love. It's like. It's real
	strong like. And I got your
	information. Now, get off my back!

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	Some friend you are! You know what
	I hope?

	JOE (VO)
	No. What do you hope?
	AL (VO)
	I hope. I just hope. That someday,
	you're real small, and you've got
	no time. And you got no one to help
	you. And you depend on me. And you
	know what I'll do?

	JOE
	No. What will you do.

	AL
	I...I'll got to the movies.
	That's what I'll do!

Joe just stares ahead. He holds his head. Then he shakes it to
clear it. He gets up, and walks up the beach. Joe's in love. Al
is disgusted. And RENE is gone.

HOTEL DESK - SHORT TIME LATER

	CLERK
	Sorry sir, they checked out.

	JOE
	Forwarding address?

	CLERK
	Sorry, sir. Nothing.

INT. JOE'S ROOM

Joe enters, stops short. All his clothes have been scrambled...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	You been had. We have.

	JOE
	It wasn't like that.


LANAI - LATER

Joe sits alone. Brooding. Holding a phone to his ear. He winces
at the WHISTLE of data transmission. Finally he can speak to Al
as if to someone on the phone.

	AL (VO)
	Some agent you are.

	JOE (VO)
	Why don't you get out of my face.

Al runs the data...They get into the airline's computer and find
passenger lists leaving GOTO...A name pops out. R. OBE. His
destination: Osaka,

	AL
	Bingo.

	JOE (VO)
	You found her.

	AL
	Better. I found Ryuji.

OUTSIDE - JOE.

	JOE
	That's good. It's not better. Where?

	AL (VO)
	Osaka.

	JOE
	Osaka?

	AL (VO)
	Fountainhead of High-Tech.

OSAKA - LATER - MERCANTILE, INDUSTRIAL CENTER

Home of Matsushita, Panasonic, Technics, Sharp etc. JOE jogs
down the street, listening to his walkman and apparently singing
along with it.  He towers a foot taller than everyone else.

	JOE (VO)
	Don't you think I stand out like this.

	AL (VO)
	We are trying to stand out. Right near
	his address. Easier to get them to
	come to us, than to try and find them.
	..now keep your eyes open,
	something might present itself.

	JOE
	I'm running in circles in the middle
	of some foreign country. I don't speak
	their language, they don't speak mine.
	I don't even know where I am. What's
	going to present itse........

A Sportscar cuts across his path. The driver is RENE.

	JOE
	What do I do?

	AL (VO)
	Follow her.

	JOE
	On what?

	AL (VO)
	Run, stupid!

He follows her, running.

	AL (VO)
	Come on, she's getting away.

	JOE
	I can't keep up.

He collapses in exhaustion and she gets away.

	AL (VO)(disgusted)
	Your body sucks. You're out of shape.

	JOE
	I gotta sit down.

Joe collapses into a chair at a sidewalk cafe.

	AL (VO)
	I'm putting you on a training
	regimen...right now.

The waiter comes.

	JOE
	Beer. And cakes...cookies
	..anything bad.

	AL (VO)
	That's not funny.

The waiter has no idea what Joe wants.

	JOE
	Sapporo..(waiter nods, walks off)

	AL (VO)
	Just stay here and rest.

	JOE
	Where are you going?

	AL (VO)
	Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean
	some fat out before you drop on me.

	JOE
	Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
	Al, you leave my heart alone...

Another customer looks over at him...Joe points to his walkman
and nods like he's hearing a country song.

	AL
	While I'm away, just do something
	safe and calm....

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - LATER

AL blasts some of the fat from the veins around the heart.

OUTSIDE

Joe sits in the Plaza drinking coffee. He notices suspicious
characters...tattood toughs; slicked hair, mean looks.

	JOE
	Al...can you hear me, Suspicious
	characters. Al!!! Shit!

They are surrounding him and moving in. The waiter has dis-
appeared. He's alone. Joe gets up. He calmly walks away.

SIDE STREET - EMPTY.

They follow him.

	JOE
	Al. Help!

The attackers look around. No Al.

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD

Joe's body reacts. The muscles tense..The blood vessels
constrict - the Fight-or-Flight syndrome. The blood flow speeds
up...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL senses something's up.

	AL
	Joe, what is it? Hang on.

OUTSIDE

Joe takes off. They block him. He takes the KUNG FU stance. The
attackers take their own stances, each scarier than the other.
Joe tries an attack. It is slapped aside with contempt. Joe tries
another tack: He runs...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Blood flow drives Al away from the brain.

	AL
	Slow your pulse.

OUTSIDE

Joe being chased down alleys.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
`	I gotta get to a vein taking
	blood to the brain or I won't
	be able to help.

OUTSIDE

Joe trips, crashes into something, cuts himself.

INSIDE

The skin is broken, Joe's systems go on general alert. Vessels
constrict.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL struggles to escape being drawn to the wound as:

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD

Antibodies rush into the fight against blood loss and infection.

OUTSIDE

Wounded, Joe hides from his attackers...They come closer...He
holds his breath...as one plants a foot near his face. The thug
hesitates, then walks on...Joe tries rise, but dizziness
overcomes him and he is spotted. He faints...His head falls lower
than his body.

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD

Blood rushes to his head carrying Al.

THE VENTRICAL - THE POD ENTERS.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL takes charge. He stimulates Joe's brain to produce
adrenaline...He gets Joe out of physical shock.

OUTSIDE

Joe wakes.

	AL (VO)
	`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.

	JOE (GROGGY)
	What do I do?

	AL (VO)
	Relax. Let me do this.

OUTSIDE

The attackers are shocked, as Joe MOVES, RISES. They come at him
in Kung Fu attitudes. Terrified, Joe turns to run...

	AL (VO)
	Relax. Make your mind a blank.

	JOE
	It is a blank. This is no
	time for Zen.

One guy attacks; Kung Fu. In a flash, Joe blocks it with a rapid
combination. He is as surprised as anybody. Without warning, his
arms fly out in Karate blows. Joe looks at his hands - now deadly
weapons - He can't believe it. No one is more surprised than Joe
when he tears into the middle of the men and takes them apart
with rapid kicks...After a while, he starts to really enjoy
it...He makes threatening growls and struts around like Toshiro
Mifune. Then, he counterattacks viciously. The attackers, shocked
by Joe's speed, strength and fighting ability, retreat...they
melt back into the alleys. He chases.

SIDE STREET - HEAVY NEON

Joe stops, finds himself in front of a PUNK CLUB - nearby, he
notices a familiar Sportscar.

SOME KIDS Come out, look at his bruised and bleeding face, his
torn and bloody clothes. A girl nods approvingly. He's perfectly
dressed. He enters, bulls his way through the crowd.

INT. PUNK CLUB

LOUD JAPANESE ROCK MUSIC. Everyone is dancing..including a
familiar figure: RENE.

	AL (VO)
	What are you doing? Wait a minute.
	Lets think this through.

	JOE
	You think. That's what you're good at.

He crosses the floor, grabs Rene. He spins her around. When she
sees it is him, she is shocked.

	RENE
	Joe! What happened to you?

	JOE
	Why'd you run off?

She sees someone over his shoulder.

	RENE
	I didn't run off.

Joe turns, it is Riuji. He is surprised to see Joe.

	RYUJI
	Joe! Hey...I like your outfit..

	JOE (to Rene)
	I got into a fight.

	RYUJI
	What are you doing here? You
	shouldn't wander around alone...

He looks from Joe to Rene and back.

	RYUJI
	Oh, I see. Hey...were going to my
	place for a late dinner, why
	don't you join us?

EXT. THE CLUB

People disperse. Joe pulls Rene aside.

	JOE
	Why did you leave?

	RENE
	They left. I had to go with them.

	JOE
	Why didn't you tell me?

	RENE (guilty)
	I hate good-byes.

Joe takes her keys, unlocks the door to her car for her. They
get in. She drives. Joe turns to her.

	JOE
	Why did you stay with me?

	RENE
	Wanted to get to know you.

	JOE
	Why?

	RENE
	You seemed interesting.

	JOE
	Who else is interested in me?

	RENE
	What do you mean?

	JOE
	Your friends, did they ask about
	me?

	RENE
	They kidded me a little.

	JOE
	What did you tell them?

	RENE
	There's not much to tell.

	JOE
	Why did they leave?

	RENE
	I don't know, Ryuji said there was
	a change of plans.

	JOE
	You work for Ryuji?

	RENE
	Sometimes. I told you I did.

	JOE
	Were you working for him last night?

	RENE
	Last night?

	JOE
	Did he put you up to it?
	Did he ask you to sleep with me?

	RENE
	No, he didn't do that.

	JOE
	He didn't.

	RENE
	No.

	JOE
	Who did?

	RENE
	You did.

A long beat.  She smiles. Inside his head, Al is laughing at
him.

KYOTO -  the Ancient Capital. Palaces and Shrines - LATER

INT. - A GEISHA HOUSE

A banquet on tatamis. Ryuji and the others drink Sake and speak
in Japanese.

ANTEROOM

Joe's on the phone...apparent long distance.

	AL (VO)
	I've run checks, there's nothing
	on her. That along is suspicous.

	JOE (angry)
	Run some checks on me. I'm sure
	I'm worse.

	AL (VO)
	Yeah...You've fallen for her.

	JOE
	I told you, I have a feeling...

	AL (VO)
	One of your instincts?

	JOE
	I know she's not with them.
	I know something else. What's
	bothering you isn't her.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al glances at the clock: 63 hours elapsed.

OUTSIDE

Rene comes along and pulls Joe away from the phone.

	JOE
	Bye Mom..

He hangs up. She escorts him to the dining room.

DINING ROOM

Joe and Rene sit, talking quietly. Joe is trying to make up with
her. He looks over. Dieter is happily stuffing himself. He winks
conspiratorially at Joe and Rene. Ryuji, Gruner and others are
talking with other Japanese. They smile at Joe whenever their
eyes meet, but Al is suspicious.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al works a JAPANESE LANGUAGE DATA-BASE..

	AL
	I think I've got it.

INSERT - MONITOR - JOE'S POV

Ryuji and another Japanese speak in Japanese - Al does a
simultaneous translation.

	RYUJI/Al
	But who does he work for?

	JAPANESE/Al
	He may be freelancing. It
	shouldn't interfere with our
	business.

	RYUJI/Al
	I'll see that it doesn't

He calls a servant, speaks in his ear. The servant's glance
flicks in our direction, then he is gone. Ryuji smiles at us then
laughs at something Dieter says. Joe's gaze swings to Rene.

	AL
	Joe, pay attention!


OUTSIDE - THE BANQUET

JOE and RENE fool around.

	JOE
	Now, what?

Another course of strange wiggling food. Joe looks alarmed.

	AL (VO)
	Don't touch a thing.

	JOE
	Don't worry!

	RENE
	I'm not worried, I'm not
	going to eat it.

	JOE
	This is a tough place to
	keep Kosher.

A funny SOUND in his head. Al's voice BREAKS UP.

	JOE
	What is it?

Across the table, Ryuji proudly answers him.

	RENE
	Hakasuti!

As he slides the wriggling fish down his throat.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al is tense, momentarily distracted. He is having trouble with
the pod. Sixty-four hours on the clock.

	AL
	The batteries are dropping.
	Got to recharge them somehow.

OUTSIDE - BANQUET - RYUJI pours the wine.

	RYUJI
	In honor of our...unexpected guest.

Joe picks up his wineglass. RYUJI pours.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al looks up, spots a powder on the inside of the glass dissolve
in the wine. He tries to warn Joe.

	AL (VO)
	No..Don't...

OUTSIDE

Joe already swallowing it.

	AL (VO)
	...drink it.

	JOE
	Too late.

	RYUJI
	Excuse me?

	JOE
	Could have been drunk a little
	sooner, but excellent...good
	character...What is it?

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	You just got a Mickey.

OUTSIDE -
	RYUJI
Bandaio. Grown near here.

	JOE
	What next!

	AL (VO)
	Drink lots of water.

Joe gulps down lots of water. They look at him strangely.

	RYUJI
	What next, Indeed.

	AL (VO)
	Now get out of here.

	JOE
	I can't...

	AL (VO)
	You have to! Quickly!

	JOE
	...imagine a better grape
	for the region.

He reaches for the bottle, spilling it over himself...

	JOE
	Oh, no! I'll go wipe
	this off. Excuse me.

INT. JOE'S ROOM

Joe rushes in, holding his stomach.

	JOE
	What are you doing?

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	Trying to analyze this stuff.
	Now...go to the medicine shelf
	and take ---- and ----.

OUTSIDE - Joe does.

	JOE
	Now what? Oh,No?

He runs to the bathroom and throws up.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	And after that,lie down
	for a while.

AL biochemically blocks the spread by tightening muscles or
rushing antigens to the proper organs.

	AL (VO)
	If they wanted us out,
	they must be up to something.

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD - LATER

AL TRAVELS TO JOE'S EYE.

EXT. NIGHT - KYOTO - JOE'S POV

A DARKLY WOODED TRAIL OUTSIDE RIUJI'S HOUSE leads to back alleys
and shrines. Stone gargoyles appear out of the mist.  SOUNDS ARE
ENHANCED...PART OF THE TRAIL SEEMS TO GLOW DIMLY...TO THE LEFT.

	AL (VO)
...To the left. To the left.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al studies the MONITOR.

INSERT - MONITOR

The same wooded scene seen as an infrared scan...Warmer areas
show in lighter colors.HE SCANS THE INFRARED SPECTRUM through the
clear lens of Joe's eye.

	AL
	They passed this way,
	the trail is warmer...Quietly now.

Joe and Al follow the residual heat trail to:

A SMALL CABIN

A workshop and Communications shack. Inside, RIUJI, GRUNER and
other suspicious men.

	AL (VO)
	Now, be careful.

The window he's leaning on swings in. Off balance, Joe topples
after it. He lands with a crash at the feet of the men. He takes
the table lamp with him, plunging the room into darkness.
SHOUTS and CURSES as everyone CRASHES into EVERYTHING.

JOE - on the floor, crawing.

	AL (VO)
	To the left, to the left.

Joe crashes into the wall.

	JOE
	Ow!

	AL (VO)
	A hard left. A hard left.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al tries to guide him by infrared.

	AL
	Door to the right. Get up and run.

	JOE (VO)
	I can't see a thing.

	AL
	Neither can they.

OUTSIDE

Joe gets up and runs, blind.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al sees the dim door grow closer. A figure enters and blocks it.

	AL
	Shit ! Look  out!

OUTSIDE

At full speed, Joe tucks and hits a giant thug right in the
chest. They both go down. The lights go on...RIUJI and The others
stand over him.

FISTS IN THE GUT - JOE is slugged around. Strangely, it doesn't
seem to bother him.

	JOE
	What are you doing?

The giant thug, an "animal" looks down, smiles.

	THUG
	I'm beating the shit out of you.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	Blocking pain impulses with
	Endo-Morphins. You'll be alright.

OUTSIDE - JOE

doubles up under another blow.

	JOE
	I won't look so good.

Another thug takes up the conversation.

	THUG 1
	Hell, when we get through,
	you'll look like him.

He indicates the "Animal". They all laugh...as RIUJI enters. Joe
leaps up and nails the Animal with a haymaker. He goes down hard.
The others start to close, but Ryuji stops them. He pulls a gun
out, holds it on Joe.

	RIUJI
	No. Never mind him, Where
	is GRUNER?

	THUG 1
	No sign of him.

	RYUJI
	Keep looking.

The thugs depart. RIUJI's mood changes. He crouches close.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al works on RIUJI's identity.

OUTSIDE - RIUJI -

	RIUJI
	Now, who do you work for?

	JOE
	What can I say?

	AL (VO)
	I'm working on it.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al finds info in a NSA data bank.

	AL
	Here it is..(Japanese phrases).

OUTSIDE - JOE

	RYUJI
	Who are you? What do you want?

	AL (VO)
	(Japanese phrase)

	JOE
	What?

	AL (VO)
	Never mind, just say it.

	JOE

RYUJI is taken aback.

	RYUJI
	How do you know that? CIA?


INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	I think he deals in...

OUTSIDE - JOE
	JOE
	...you deal in stolen technology.
	...from...Glomsui.

	RYUJI
	(Shows him ID)
	I am GLOMSUI! Corporate Security.

	AL (VO)
	 (denying it)
	He was with Gruner!

	JOE
	You were with GRUNER!

	RIUJI
	 (exasperated)
	And now he's gone!  What do you
	think you're doing, stumbling
	through this case. I almost had
	the goods in my hand!

	JOE
	You know what he's got?

	RIUJI
	Whatever it is, he's
	still got it.

	JOE
	You going after him?

	RYUJI
	I can't. He didn't do anything.
	Thanks to you.

	JOE
	Why are you on to him?

	RYUJI
	We've had thefts of our new stuff
	...GRUNER deals in this...
	A big deal is going down now. I went
	to see if GRUNER had anything to sell.
	But he didn't make any moves...And
	when you arrived, he backed off.

	JOE
	Why'd you invite me here?

	RYUJI
	Someone is selling. You followed us.
	If it's not him, it must be you. If
	it's not you, it must be him...
	You scared him off.

	JOE
	What about the others.

	RYUJI
	I don't know.

Ryuji puts the gun away, Joe turns to go.

	JOE
	Would you have bought it from him?

	RYUJI (inscrutable)
	We don't need to steal anything...

EXT. HOUSE -NIGHT

RENE appears.  There is a disarming dizziness about her.

	RENE
	You're leaving.

	JOE
	Food doesn't agree with me.

	RENE
	I'm leaving too.

	JOE
	Why?

	RENE
	This business is over.

	JOE
	I'm sorry. What will you do?

	RENE
	Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another
	tour....You're following GRUNER?

	JOE
	I'm just on vacation.

	RENE
	Now, so am I...What's so
	interesting about him?

	JOE (blurts it out)
	Why don't you come and find out?

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	No!

OUTSIDE -

	RENE
	Oh, I can't.

	AL (VO)
	Good.

	JOE
	I need a guide and you
	need a client...and $1000.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	No. You can't trust her.

OUTSIDE - Joe counts out fistfull of money.

	JOE
	You know where he went?

	RENE
	What's he done?

	JOE
	He stole something. From
	a friend of mine.

	RENE
	He must be a good friend.

	JOE
	We're very close.

	RENE
	What'd he steal?

	JOE
	A chip. Goes in a computer.

	RENE
	One chip?

	JOE
	The most important one.
	Can you help me find him?

	RENE
	 (looks at money)
	How do you know you can trust me?

	JOE
	Got to trust someone.

	AL (VO)
	Who says so?

RENE is skeptical, but fascinated.

	RENE
	I don't know. He mentioned a city.

	JOE
	What is it?

	RENE
	Hiroshima.

	JOE
	Get your things.

She runs into the house.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	Hiroshima! She's going, with us?
	Are you out of your mind.

	JOE (VO)
	Probably.

	AL
	I don't trust her.

	JOE
	Then why let her out of our sight?
	Besides, she's all we've got...

OUTSIDE

 She reappears, throws her bag in the car, hops in. Joe
gets in after her. She laughs at him...As they pull away.

	JOE
	You don't believe me.

	RENE
	Oh sure.

	JOE
	Then why are you smiling like that?

	RENE
	Lots of my clients are rich guys...
	They like danger..like playing
	with drugs and things...running
	around, acting mysterious.

	JOE
	You think I'm like that?

She shruggs.

	JOE
	What's Gruner like?

	RENE
	They'd never talk in front of me.
	They'd walk away up the beach.
	Nervous about something.

	JOE
	Who was?

	RENE
	Ryuji and Gruner.

	JOE
	And Dieter.

	RENE
	Friend of Gruner. Just went
	along for the party.

	JOE
	And you?

	RENE
	It was a good job. Not many ways
	for a foreigner to make money here.
	Ryuji hires me to organize business
	meetings...take care of things.

Up Ahead - a dark Mercedes. A lone figure drives, Gruner. She
turns off her headlight, pulls in close behind the moving car.

HIROSHIMA - A PORT ON THE INLAND SEA - LATER THAT NIGHT -

Gruner's car pulls into a dockside warehouse. A figure emerges
and crosses to a gangway. The FIGURE boards a SHIP. Joe(Al) and
RENE watch from a distance.

	RENE
	I can't even see in this light.
	How do you know it's him?

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL works the infrared monitor.

	AL (VO)
	It's him.

OUTSIDE

	JOE
	Come on.

	RENE
	Where we going?

	JOE
	Beats me.

INLAND SEA - THE BOAT IS A PLEASURE CRUISER

Crowded with tourists taking pictures of everything in sight.

TOPSIDE

GRUNER sits in the sun, listening to his Walkman as the islands
move by. Nearby, wearing a hat and dark glasses, Joe/Al tries to
stay close without being recognized. RENE slips into the seat
beside them.

	RENE
	This boat doesn't go anywhere.
	Just toots around the Inland Sea.

	JOE
	Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.

	RENE
	Then where's the chip.

	AL (VO)
	If you were going to smuggle a
	chip, where would you put it.

She looks over to GRUNER, he has stripped to his shorts and
digital watch. He applies oil. JOE focuses on the Walkman.

	AL (VO)
	Plenty of circuits in a
	Walkman...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	I've got an idea.

OUTSIDE

	JOE
	I was afraid of that.

	RENE
	What?

	JOE
	He plays it all the time.

RENE AT THE BAR

The waiter brings GRUNER's drink for a refill. Rene loads it
with Vodka when the waiter turns away.

BELOW DECK LOUNGE

Filled with Japanese tourists...Joe stands uneasy...Looking
sweaty and fearful.

	JOE
	You sure this will work?

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	Not sure at all.

OUTSIDE

	JOE
	Well at least talk it up, then.
	I feel like an idiot.

	AL (VO)
	Just say the words. Just like I
	told you.

Joe gets up his courage and blurts out:

	JOE
	(Japanese phrase...)

Everyone turns to him with interest.

	JOE
	What was it? What'd I say?

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	You said 100,000 yen
	for the right Sony Walkman.

The people sit, frozen...

	AL (VO)
	haka xuki.

OUTSIDE -

	JOE
	haka xuki. What's that mean?

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	Cash.

OUTSIDE

They rush him. He is mobbed. Each Japanese waves his
walkman...explaining in rapid Japanese the merits of their own
model. Walkmans wave before his face like a field of corn.

TOPSIDE - AT THE BAR - THE WAITER AND RENE

	WAITER
	...It's Thrirrer, Micaer Jaksin.

She hands him a big tip.

ANOTHER SLAP of cash in a hand. A CASSETTE OF "THRILLER" is
passed back.

INT. PASSAGEWAY

A teenager takes off with his profit, but Joe's got the Music.

DECK - UNDER THE BLAZING SUN

GRUNER's nodded off. The walkman plays on the deck beside
him...Joe has eased up behind him...lying on the deck, apparently
sunning...Rene is with him, in sunglasses and big hat...She
covers his actions with erotic sun oil spreading of her own.
Joe's got his cassette with the music rolling... and two
headsets...He puts his identical walkman next to GRUNER'S. He
plugs one headset into his walkman. The other, he eases into the
B headset port in GRUNERS...

HEAR the two tapes, out of sync. Rapidly jockeying, Joe matches
cassettes so the tapes play in sync. He nods to Rene. She gets
up, walks to the Bar entrance, knocks over a tray as she exit.

AT THE CRASH, Joe switches plugs on the walkmans, rolls over,
out of the way and feigns sleep, all in one motion.

GRUNER rouses for a moment, looks around: nothing. He grabs
(his) walkman, holds it on his belly and slumps down again.

INT. SHIP - JOE'S CABIN

They stare at the Walkman.

	RENE
	Now what?

	JOE
	We figure out if it's in here.

	RENE
	How?

	JOE
	Why don't you get us some food.
	This may take some time.

She's pissed, but she takes some cash and leaves.

	JOE
	How?

INT. PASSAGEWAY - OUTSIDE THE DOOR

RENE listens for a moment, hears nothing, departs.

INT. CABIN - LATER

The walkman lies in hundreds of pieces. Rene finishes dinner
while Joe stares at the main circuit board.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL's sensors scan a technological terrain; the walkman circuits.
He gives Joe instructions.

	AL
	Left...The one with
	the red dot.

OUTSIDE - JOE

	JOE
	Well...?

	AL (VO)
	It's not the one...Wait...
	there's a label.

Joe's eye fixes on a circuit,

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al scans in on it. It looks promising... Then he sees it on the
casing... microetching... letters...a message; in Dutch. Al
translates:

	AL
	So Long, Suckers!

OUTSIDE

JOE jumps up, darts out the door. Rene follows.

	JOE
	We been had.

TOPSIDE - NIGHT

A speedboats wake fades in the distance. Rene questions a
deckhand, turns to Joe.

	RENE
	That must be him. Water taxi.

	JOE
	Get us one.

	RENE
	Too late, they won't come back
	out till morning.

They slump into deck chairs.

	JOE
	He hung us up dry.

	AL (VO)
	While he makes the run.

	JOE
	Where?

	RENE
	Where what?

	JOE
	Where would you go to sell a chip?

	AL (VO)
	We've ruined his market in Japan..
	Where's Dieter?

	RENE
	Dieter?

	JOE
	If Gruner led us away, Who'd
	he lead us away from?

	RENE
	Hong Kong.

	JOE
	What?

	RENE
	Dieter's gone to shoot a
	still job. Hong Kong.

HONG KONG. DAY

Joe and Rene rush up the main street. Suddenly Joe gets a
thought. He grabs Rene.

	JOE
	Wait a minute! How'd you know
	Dieter was coming here?

	RENE
	I asked him.

	JOE
	Oh.

	AL (VO)
	See...I don't trust her.

Stops her again.

	JOE
	Why'd you ask him.

	RENE
	He's a client of mine! What's the
	matter. You can't suspect Dieter.
	He's a famous photographer.
	He makes millions.

	JOE
	Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't
	be here.

STREET

They turn the corner into an area blocked off for a still shoot.
Lights are set covering a car: the famous BMW M2 prototype, RENE
walks in ahead. Joe lurks in the B.G.

RENE walks up to Dieter and is greeted and hugged.

	DIETER
	What are you doing here,
	where've you been?

	RENE
	I have a new client.

	DIETER
	That crazy guy?

	RENE
	Yes. Joe.

Joe watches her walk away with Dieter.

	AL (VO)
	She thinks a lot of you.

	DIETER
	Where is he now?

	RENE
	Oh...I came on ahead.

They set the scene.

	DIETER
	Well, I'm glad to see you.
	Sorry things broke up like that.

	RENE
	It's just money.

	DIETER
	Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you
	a fee. Make up for what you lost
	on the tour.

IN THE CROWD

Joe spots someone in the B.G.

JOE'S POV - GRUNER

He scans the scene...Joe pulls back into the shadows, unseen.
GRUNER moves to Dieter. They shake hands, say a few things we
don't get. Dieter hands him a small package.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL enhances the audio. We hear one phrase. Sounds like "Chiang
Cho".

	DIETER
	You know Rene.

He moves, revealing Rene in the passengers seat. GRUNER'S
surprised. He pulls Dieter away.

	GRUNER
	There was a mixup. I got your
	wristwatch.

	DIETER
	I knew it wasn't mine. Must have
	switched them swimming.

They exchange wristwatches. As Dieter straps his on, his
assistant approaches him with the camera...He takes it and starts
to go to work. Joe watches Gruner back out of the lights.

	AL (VO)
	It's in the watch. He lead us
	on that chase while Dieter
	brought the chip into Hong Kong.

	JOE
	And Dieter?

	AL (VO)
	He must not know. GRUNER just
	made the switch back.

Suddenly, GRUNER senses something. He looks directly at them.

	JOE
	Then, why'd he lead us here.

	AL (VO)
	He didn't. He left us that
	walkman chip to confuse us.
	Would have kept most people
	busy. We were too fast for him.

Suddenly, GRUNER's gone...into the shadows.

	AL (VO)
	...Until now.

They take off in pursuit.

From an alley, a Porsche blasts past - GRUNER.  Joe looks
around. Nothing to chase it in, just the M2.

	AL (VO)
	Do it.

	JOE
	I can't handle that thing.

	AL
	Don't worry, I can.

Joe knocks over the male model, hops in the M2. Starts it up,
Blasts it out through the set, through the lights and falling
backdrops, and out onto the crowded, narrow street. He careens
from side, to side...out of control; Al yelling in his head...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al working feedback motor controls...

	AL (VO)
	Don't fight me. Just relax...

OUTSIDE

Joe careening down the street...out of control.

	JOE
	RELAX?!!!

RENE emerges from the pile of haut couture into which she was
thrown by his takeoff and adds her screams to his.

	RENE
	What?

	JOE
	I said just relax. I'm in full
	control.

He loses it on the turn, takes out a peddler's stand.

ON THE CORNICHE

A Hundred mile-an-hour chase. RENE is terrified. So is Joe, but
it's Al's reflexes that are doing the driving. Rene tries to
speak calmly through gritted teeth.

	RENE
	Done much high-speed driving?

	JOE (struggling with the controls)
	A bit. Why do you ask?

	RENE
	Oh...nothing....Why do you
     	scream on the turns?

A particularly nasty switchback, a truck in the other lane, the
rear end breaks loose...He screams again, then looks at her.

	JOE
	Oxygen. Good for the brain.

She seems to accept that.

They almost catch up with GRUNER when an obstruction in their
lane forces them off the road...Only great skill and luck enables
them to swerve back on. They round a blind corner. The PORSCHE,
dead in their track. Both cars SLAM TOGETHER, careen off the
road, hit a bank, separate. The PORSCHE rolls, destroying itself,
PRANGS into a tree. The M2 goes through a bush, comes to rest
upright.

RENE - covered with dirt and debris, looks at him, stunned.

	RENE
	I'll walk from here.

Joe spots GRUNER climbing out of the PORSCHE.

	AL
	Are you alright?

	JOE
	Just fine. I'll do the driving
	from now on.

	RENE
	Not with me, you won't. He
	does'nt seem to like you either.

GRUNER crawls from his car, homocide on his mind. Joe slams his
shoulder into his door. It swings open dumping him in the mud,
tangled in his seat belt.

JOE'S POV

GRUNER stands over him with a gun. Joe struggles to his feet.
Rene joins him. GRUNER holds the small package in one hand and
the gun in the other. He holds the gun lazily...not really aimed:
arrogance and a challenge.

	JOE (to Al)
	Do something!

	RENE
	Who, me?

	GRUNER
	Do nothing. Just give me the keys.

	AL (VO)
	Aim just in front of his face.

	JOE
	Aim what?

GRUNER thinks he means the gun.

	GRUNER
	At this distance, there's no
	aim involved

	AL (VO)
	Get ready!

	JOE
	Don't do it!

	GRUNER
	Just give me the keys.

	JOE
	Whatever it is, don't do it.

	GRUNER (exasperated)
	I'm just taking your car.

	JOE (to AL)
	He's got a gun!

It's said with such conviction, that GRUNER goes for it;  His
gaze flicks to the side, At that moment. AL attacks. Joe springs
at him, flips.

GRUNER'S POV

Joe's boots catch him in the face. BOOM! The gun goes off. They
land in a pile. No one can believe it, least of all, Joe. As Joe
looks up, stunned, GRUNER slugs him.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al is stunned by the blow.

OUTSIDE

A fight through the bushes..GRUNER attacks, fiercely. Joe
defends himself, badly at first; Then Al recovers, takes a hand
and smashes GRUNER..too hard.

	RENE
	He's out. Come on...We don't
	want to be found here.

He takes his watch and wallet.

	AL (VO)
	What about the chip?
	Open the package..

OUTSIDE

Joe opens the package...

	JOE
	Holy...

	AL (VO)
	...Shit! It's just money.

Joe pries the watch open, exposing the innards. He holds it
close to his eye...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD -

 AL scans the chips...

	AL
	Nothing. It isn't here!

OUTSIDE - Slowly, it dawns:

	JOE
	He aready made the deal..

	AL (VO)
	The man we want has the PEM,
	and is across the border by now.

	JOE
	Dieter!

	AL (VO)
	GRUNER switched the chip to him,
	not from him, then he led us
	away again...to Chiang Cho.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

72 Hours Elapsed - Al's situation is becoming grave, battery
power running low...time is essential.

	RENE (VO)
	Chiang Cho?

	JOE (VO)
	...across THE BORDER. Come on!

OUTSIDE

	RENE
	That's not this direction.
	It's back the other way.

	JOE
	You've  been there?

	RENE
	I know the territory.

	JOE
	You coming along?

	AL (VO)
	I'm against it.

	RENE (VO)
	I insist.

	JOE
	So do I.

A SHADY HOTEL ROOM - ON THE BORDER.

	RENE
	This going to work?

	JOE
	Maybe they're expecting Gruner.
	I'm gonna be him.

	RENE
	He's Dutch. You can't even
	speak Dutch.

	JOE (Dutch)
	Sdkjfls fjslkdjl;

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al looks up, annoyed.

	AL (VO)
	Quit showing off.

OUTSIDE

Rene looks at him with new...(maybe even) respect.

	JOE
	There's a lot you don't know.

	AL (VO)
	And don't let her know, either.

INT. BATHROOM

Joe looks in the mirror.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al works the computer...zapping various...nerves...

	AL
	This may hurt.

	JOE (VO)
	Well, don't let it. What are
	you doing?

OUTSIDE

Joe's face swells until it has the same general configuration as
GRUNER's.

	AL
	Retention of fluids...The rest
	is...

INT. BEDROOM - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Joe catches her looking at him, in awe at his physical
transformation...

	JOE (lamely)
	...Muscle control...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al is busy downloading GRUNER's Dossier.


THE BORDER - LATER - JOE

undergoing a skin search. JOE yawns, as if bored by the whole
thing.

	GUARD
	We know who you are, GRUNER.

	JOE
	I've got a permit for the cash.

	GUARD
	We'll just make sure.


EXT. BORDER POST

Free to go, they walk a few meters; unsure . A huge black car
SCREECHES UP, DOOR OPENS. RENE pulls back.

INT. THE CAR

An Oriental man. He squints at the daylight and beckons them in.
Joe and Rene enter. The car pulls away. Under his robe, the man
has a gun. He looks suspicious. When he speaks we are startled to
hear a familiar BURR.

	BURR
	You didn't tell us you were coming?

	JOE
	Then how did you know?

BURR snorts derisively. Rene starts to sweat it...

	JOE
	Is something wrong?

BURR looks at him oddly, finally speaks his suspicion.

	BURR
	 (guessing)
	You've cut your hair?

	JOE
	I dyed it. We're all getting old.

	BURR (unsure, suspicious)
	Some more than others.


BURR accepts RENE's presence at face value.

	BURR
	Why are you here?

Joe, thinking fast, shows him his watch. He cracks it open,
shows him a chip; not the chip, but how is BURR to know?

	JOE
	PEM115!

	BURR
	**?!! (CHINESE EXCLAMATION)

	JOE
	Newer, more powerful design.

BURR gets excited. He pats the driver, speaks rapid Cantonese.
Joe looks over, smiles broadly at Rene, touches her knee.

	JOE
	What's happening?

She smiles, but it is Al who answers.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	We're onto something.
**?!! is Cantonese for Lab.

OUTSIDE - INT. CAR

Joe seems to be commenting on Rene's smile.

	JOE
About time.

LANDING PAD

The car pulls up near a familiar-looking Black Helicopter.

EXT. HIGH TECH COMPLEX - LATER

The chopper lands. They exit.-

INT. RESEARCH LAB

Nearly identical to U.S.T. Guards greet them. One speaks to BURR
in Chinese as RENE and GRUNER/JOE are escorted to the lab.

	JOE
	Pretty advanced, isn't it?

	AL (VO)
	Ought to be, they stole everything
	and reverse-engineered it. Looks
	like all they need is the chip.


INT. LAB

A BLACK COVERALLED figure appears. As he moves, we recognize him
as the LEADER of the INTRUDERS. He turns to them, it's Dieter.
He glances at Gruner/Joe, surprised, He speaks to Joe in rapid
Dutch.

	DIETER
	(What are you doing here?
	Where's Joe?)

Joe responds: in dialect...Then watches for approval.

	JOE
	(He had another chip.)

Dieter nods and turns away. He speaks softly and rapidly to
another technician in Cantonese.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al picks the sound up, runs it through a translation program. It
starts to read out.


OUTSIDE - Joe HEARS the translation.

	AL (VO)
	He's up to something.
	I have the real chip.

Slowly, Joe backs away. The chip is inserted, programming
starts. The tech speaks to the guards who edge toward Joe...They
grab him.

	JOE
	 (under his breath)
	Do something.

	AL (VO)
	What exactly?

	JOE
	I don't know.

As Joe is hustled out, he struggles, stalls...

	JOE
	(weird Chinese double-talk)

Whatever that means, it freezes them for a moment. They look to
Dieter. Joe goes BERSERK. HE goes for the chip, but they tackle
him. They slam him against the console, immobilizing him. One
guard reaches for restraints.

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD - IN JOE'S EYE

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al sees his chance.  The POD'S LASER swings round...

THE CONSOLE

open near the PEM114. The laser sweeps over the microcircuitry
fusing new connections.

INSIDE

Al works frantically, surgically...one final sweep.

THE CIRCUIT BOARD

POP! - An electrical surge BLASTS through.

THE LAB

SCREAMING AND SHOUTING. Dieter lunges at Joe. An electrical
chain reaction sparks. The techs kill the power.

IT GOES BLACK - In the confusion, Joe tears the chip from the
console. He grabs Rene, slips out.

EXT. THE CHOPPER

They run across the tarmac, hop in.

	RENE
	Can you fly this?

	AL (VO)
	Don't worry.

	JOE
	Why not?

	RENE
	Can you?

	JOE
	Sure I can, can't I?

	AL (VO)
	Sure.

He starts it. The pursuers are coming fast. They lift off just
as the pursuers reach them. They swing over the lab and off
toward the border.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al flies, but the laser has drained him, he loses power..THE
MISSION CLOCK FLASHES 90 HOURS PLUS...

OUTSIDE

Suddenly, Joe loses coordination. The chopper plunges...Al's
voice is fading.

	AL (VO)
	Hang on!..

Joe goes limp. Then recovers, tries to coordinate flight. The
chopper swoops all over the sky, out of control.

	JOE
	What happened?

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	Losing power. The laser
	drained it.

THE CIRCUITS FAIL.

OUTSIDE

Al no longer controls it; the chopper stalls.

	RENE
	What happened?

	JOE
	I can't fly it.

	RENE
	What'd...you forget?

They CRASH within sight of the lab. Joe barely manages to get it
down without killing them. RENE is confounded by his Jeckyl/Hyde
characteristic.

	RENE (VO)
	What is wrong with you?

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD

Barely under power, Al grapples the POD to a junction in a vein.
He turns his rudders to angle the props into the fast flowing
blood stream...The props spin in the flow.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - THE MONITOR

The batteries charge.

OUTSIDE

Joe and Rene, struggling to escape the wreckage.

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD

The physical activity increases the blood flow and aids
recharging. But they are easily captured...

INT. RESEARCH CENTER

Dieter's men separate them and throw Joe in a cell.

	JOE (VO)
	I'll tell you nothing.

	GUARD
	Who asked?

They slam the door, it's dark and scary. Joe calls after them.

	JOE
	Don't you want to torture me?.

	GUARD
	Later.

	AL (VO)
	Be quiet.

	JOE
	Where've you been?

	AL (VO)
	Never mind that, where are we now.

	JOE
	We are in a dungeon. How do we
	get out?

	AL (VO)
	Gimme a minute.

	JOE
	Looks like you can have all
	you want.

LATER - Joe sits brooding in the semi-darkness.

	JOE (VO)
	I can always flush you
	down the toilet.

	AL (VO)
	Keep thinking.

	JOE
	I have been... I think you're
	right.

	AL (VO)
	About what?

	JOE
	Dieter asked where I was.
	He expected me here. Maybe
	someone was assigned to bring
	me here.

	AL (VO)
	Rene?

	JOE
	She works for them.

	AL
	Now, you're too suspicious.

	JOE(VO)
	You were the one who was always
	suspicious of her!

	AL (VO)
	I was wrong. She tried to help
	us get away.

	JOE
	No. She just stayed with us.
	Like she did all along.

WHANG! The door slams open. They throw RENE in.  She hits the
floor hard...

	RENE
	You let me out of here!!
	You son of a...

WHANG! The door slams shut, cutting her off. She picks herself
up, looks at Joe...He glares back at her, suspicious. She's just
a bit hurt...expected a bigger reception than this.

	RENE
	Well, thanks. Nice to be
	here too!

He tries to be angry with her, then seems to weaken.

	JOE
	Are you alright?

	RENE
	Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't
	do this. They can't hold us here.

	JOE
	Looks like they can.
	What did they do?

	RENE
	They asked about you.

	JOE
	What did you tell them?

	RENE
	That I really don't know.

	JOE
	Now what?

	RENE
	They'll listen to what
	we say in here.

RENE, lovely in a single shaft from a crack in the casement.

	AL (VO)
	She is beautiful.

	JOE
	You've changed your mind.

She turns to him.

	RENE
	What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes.
	It was him. Gruner works for him.

	JOE
	Why?

She shrugs but Al answers him.

	AL (VO)
	Not really. Truth is...I was
	..jealous. Of you.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	Thing is...I think I'm
	in love with her.

OUTSIDE - JOE

	JOE
	Oh no!

	RENE
	What?

She turns, crosses to him.

	JOE
	What a mess.

	RENE
	You can say that again.
	What do we do?

	JOE
	Nothing we can do.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	I know it's no good.  I've
	no right to be jealous.

OUTSIDE

	AL (VO)
	She's in love with you.
	Anyone can see that.

OUTSIDE - JOE

	JOE
	They can?

	RENE
	What?

	JOE
	They can hold us here forever.
	Nobody knows about us.

	RENE
	Can't you do something?

	AL (VO)
	It's a real mess. I'm sorry
	I got you into this.

Joe - trying to assimilate it all and master the tripartite
conversation, just repeats Al's thoughts.

	JOE
	I'm sorry I got you into this.

	RENE
	It was my choice.

	AL (VO)
	You're a lucky man.

	JOE
	Yeah, sure.

	RENE
	Don't blame yourself, I didn't
	have to come along.

	JOE
	Why did you, then?

	RENE
	For you.

	AL (VO)
	She's so lovely. It's all
	my fault...I was wrong.

	JOE
	You're lovely.

	RENE
	I'm...scared.

	AL (VO)
	Look, I don't know how we're
	gonna get out of this.

	JOE
	I don't know how we're
	gonna get out of this, but
	we will, somehow.

	AL (VO)
	I want you to know how much I
	appreciate what you've done.

	JOE
	I want to thank you for what
	you've done.

	RENE
	I didn't do anything.

	AL (VO)
	I know we fight, but I don't mean
	it. You're quite a guy. No one else
	could have dealt with this.

	JOE
	Awwww...

	AL (VO)
	I mean it!  No one else would have
	helped. I take it all back,
	everything I've said about you.

	RENE
	I encouraged you to come here.
	My fault as much as yours.

	JOE
	I was...crazy...desperate. I took
	it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know
	what she sees in you. You're kind and
	you're brave. If I ever get out of you,
	I'll be glad to call you my friend.

	JOE
	I've learned a lot. I don't
	regret a thing. If it ends
	here, with you that's okay with me.

	RENE (holds him)
	It's okay with me too.

	AL (VO)
	Don't worry, I owe you a lot.
	I'm not gonna let us rot here.
	I'm gonna find us a way out.

	JOE
	I'll get us out of here.

	AL (VO)
	Don't worry about me. You take this
	time for your own, you two.....

	RENE
	How?

	JOE
	What?

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	Take her hand.

OUTSIDE - Joe does.

	JOE
	Now what?

	RENE
	I've never met anyone like you.

	AL (VO)
	Kiss her.

He does, gently.

	AL (VO)
	In a way, we're like brothers...
	I can't have her. I want you to.

	JOE
	That's nice.

	RENE
	Nice?

	AL (VO)
	In my own way...I want you to know
	that...I love you.

	JOE
	Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange,
	but in my own way, I love you

	RENE
	 (softens)
	I love you too.

She slides into his arms. The kiss.

	JOE
	Could we be alone?

She looks up and giggles at him.

	RENE
	If this isn't alone, I don't
	know what is.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

AL turns off his circuits.

OUTSIDE

Joe seems just a touch confused; preoccupied. She takes matters
in hand. He resists only momentarily when she seduces him. In the
dark, they make love.

MORNING - The cell door slams open. Guards enter.

	JOE
	Don't worry.

	RENE
	Why not, what are you
	going to do?

	JOE
	Escape.

As they drag him out, he seems to Rene, strangely confident.

	RENE
	Just like that?

	JOE
	I'll come back for you.

	RENE
	Aren't you a little optimistic?

EXT. COURTYARD

Joe is led through an exercise yard. He is joyed at the sight of
a fifteen foot wall.

	JOE (whispers)
	Look at that wall! When I
	 say "Now", give me some
	adrenaline. Give me
	everything I've got. ....NOW!

He breaks from his guards, dashes across the yard and leaps.

SMASH...He hits the wall hard...four feet below the top. Slides
to the bottom, lies in a crumpled heap, stunned.

	JOE
	What happened?..must have slipped...

Joe falls back, they chase him around...He is startled by the
fact that he's starting to get winded.

	JOE (Annoyed)
	Al, come on...

They corner him...He turns and takes a Kung Fu stance. They stop
apprehensively, then come on. He takes an awkward swing and they
beat the crap out of him. He looks up, dazed and bleeding.

	JOE
	What happened?..Al, what the
	hell are you doing?


FROM INSIDE - Al'S POV

He focuses the Monitors, sees a Room, but another room. People.
Dieter and the others...they are congratulating each other. His
P.O.V.is that of a willing participant. Dieter turns to (him).

	DIETER
	What do you think, Rene?

The girl, RENE. Al's now in her.

	RENE (hesitant)
	There's...something about him.

	DIETER
	What?

COURTYARD - JOE

struggling with the guards.

	JOE
	Come on, Al! Quit fooling around
	I know you're in there...
	I haven't so much as spit...

The look on his face! He just thought of something else.

	JOE
You son of a bitch! You conned me!

OFFICE - RENE

	RENE
	You're gonna laugh.

	DIETER
	Yes?

	RENE
	He's not an ordinary man.

	DIETER
	Enough ROmance.

	RENE
	He's...more. Somehow, enhanced...
	He's...zxflbbgt!

She blinks. That didn't make any sense.

	DIETER
	He's what?

She smiles, embarrassed, tries again.

	RENE
	He's...sigmmoflbbbwwggpp....

Embarrassed, confused, she sighs...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al is hitting all triggers; sending all kinds of currents
through her brain, releasing chemicals that confuse her... to
keep her from talking.

OUTSIDE

One more time...she tries to continue.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al lets off a charge in her brain that disrupts her motor
reflexes.

OUTSIDE

She drops like a rag-doll, passes out.

	DIETER
	He must have drugged her.

INT. LAB - LATER - DIETER AND BURR

Rene sleeps on a gurney nearby. Joe is strapped to an Operating
table. Techs prep him for an experiment.  Tech1 runs a CAT scan
on Joe.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al listens as they speak over her.

	BURR (Indicates Joe)
	You knew about him. You used him.

OUTSIDE -

	DIETER
	I knew he was following us.
	He diverted attention,
	exposed Ryuji's trap..

	BURR
	Rene?

	DIETER
	She found out what she could
	...and delivered him here.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL listens.

They replace the circuit board, insert the chip, and power up.

	TECH 1
	Tests are negative.

	DIETER
	He still has the POD.

	BURR
	Impossible.

	DIETER
	I'll prove it. We'll repeat their
	procedures...put a man in our POD,
	bring it down, and then...inject him.

They look over at JOE. He knows they're talking about him.

INT. LAB - LATER

Their POD is heavily armed.

	DIETER
	If there is a POD inside him, We'll
	find it, and bring it out for study.

	BURR
	Who's our little man?

	DIETER
	Me.

	BURR
	No. If anything happened, you'd
	be stuck in there like he was.

	DIETER
	I take the last chip in with me.
	I use it, to control re-enlargement,
	from inside.

OPERATING TABLE - LATER

JOE is given the intravenous shot.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - DIETER

makes directly for the brain.

LAB - HOURS LATER

JOE on the Gurney. The techs are picking something up on the
cranial monitors. Joe's leg twitches. then his body leaps into
spasm. The techs are alerted...A few rush out of the control room
into the lab. They lean over the unconscious form, restraints and
syringes at the ready.

Suddenly his eyes snap open. His head turns, he fixes them with
a riveting stare. They are taken aback. When it finally comes,
his voice is amazingly calm, authoritarian, familiar.

	JOE
	Well, don't just stand around,
	let me up.

It's Joe's face, but it's Dieter speaking. BURR is amazed.

	BURR
	Dieter?

	JOE/DIETER
	Who do you think? Now let me up,
	and I'll show you what this
	thing can do.

The techs are perplexed. They look to BURR for instructions.
Amazed and exultant, BURR presses his face against the glass.
DIETER/JOE raises his thumb and shakes it at him in a victory
sign.  Quickly, they turn and releases the restraints on DIETER/
JOE. He gets up.

	BURR
	Go ahead. What can it do?

Joe hesitates only a moment. Then his face lights up. He says
one word:

	JOE
	Escape!

WHAM WHAM WHAM. Karate blows...The tech's lie on the floor.
Joe's out the door.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - DIETER

still in the artery. Get's tumbled by the sudden activity.

	DIETER
	Hey, what's going on? Answer
	me...Rupert.

OUTSIDE

Joe goes berserk, smashes computers and makes an escape. He has
been faking it.

INSIDE JOE

Dieter is trapped in a runaway subject - Joe. Dieter tries to
hamper him...slow his breathing, put him to sleep etc. Joe fights
him.

BACK IN THE LAB

ALL is confusion around the sleeping RENE.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al is trapped as long as RENE is unconscious. He stimulates her.

OUTSIDE

	She wakes, groggy.

	RENE
	What happened?

	BURR
	Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.

	RENE
	In him?

	BURR
	It's a long story.

	RENE
	ya hyutn slulptsa?

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al has hit the wrong nerve bundle. He cuts power.

OUTSIDE -

	BURR
	What?

Shakes her head to clear it.

	RENE
	I said...He'll head for the border.

EXT. WOODS

Rene and the others pursue Joe.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al sows confusion. He stimulates parts of her brain.

OUTSIDE

She starts to act psychotic, sees everything upside down, right
to left...She speaks in Navaho. Then she runs into the bush. They
crash into the bush after her. She pulls out in front of the
other pursuers. Soon she is alone. Far ahead, she glimpses Joe
pulling away.

	RENE
	I know you're in there.
	I'll make you a deal.

She slows, breathing hard...stops in a clearing...finally...the
answer

	AL (VO)
	What kind of a deal?

	RENE
	Let us get to the border!

	AL (VO)
	Then what?

	RENE (kidding, sarcasting)
	I'll give you three wishes.

	AL (VO)
	I knew you were trouble.

	RENE
	Trouble...is, if we both get
	stuck here.

She leans against the trunk of a tree, exhausted...finally:

	AL (VO)
	Deal.

A moment's pause, then, new life in her body, she takes off
fast.

WARNING SIGNS show she is near the border when she spots a
stumbling figure ahead. Joe seems dopey and dizzy yet he
struggles forward.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

DIETER tries to stop him...His blood pressure is down, brain
chemicals acting up...

OUTSIDE

His mind reels. He tries to press on, but instead, staggers
around in confusion. He sees a vision, makes for it.

	JOE
	Rene!

The OTHERS catch up. They bring up their guns.

	JOE
	You work for them?

BURR comes up to take him. RENE acts funny, an internal struggle
of her own. When she speaks, it isn't her.

	RENE
	Kiss her you fool.

	JOE
	Her?

Then, he realizes: Al is in her...Suddenly, he moves on her. He
kisses her passionately. She struggles against his embrace but he
won't break the kiss.

INSIDE

Al makes a run for her mouth..too late...as:

OUTSIDE

BURR moves forward and breaks it up, pulling Joe away from her.
Joe slips from his grip, staggers back looking at her.

	JOE
	I don't care if you do work
	for them. I doesn't bother me.

RENE looks at Joe for a moment, then laughs. She turns and grins
at BURR. She motions BURR forward to take Joe. As he passes in
front of her, she turns, clips BURR below the ear, knocking him
out. Joe is surprised. She moves to him.

She's got a knife...She slashes Joe's wrist. She wants him to
bleed to death. No. She slashes her own...presses their wrists
together. She understands...and is trying to help. They sink to
the ground together.

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD

In a flash, Al is through...He's into Joe's bloodstream...
Chasing down Dieter...A terrific chase through the body...

OUTSIDE

Joe's on the move...with RENE.

INSIDE - EXT. DIETER'S POD

Dieter fires his laser.

OUTSIDE

Joe goes down...Rene grabs him, pulls him up, forward.

	JOE
	Who are you?
	Who do you work for?

	RENE
	Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.

	JOE
	I knew it. I told him.

	RENE
	Now what?

	JOE
	We just don't stop.

CRASHING THROUGH THE BUSH BEHIND THEM - THE BAD GUYS.

INSIDE - EXT. THE PODS

Dieter tries to slow Joe down. Al tries to speed him up...

OUTSIDE

They come upon the DENUDED ZONE near the BORDER - a killing
ground laced with minefields, automatic shotguns, infrared
scanners, radar, sonar etc...The pursuers draw closer.

INSIDE JOE

Dieter hunts Al. ..

OUTSIDE

The pursuers catch up just as they reach the minefield. Just
when Joe needs his help the most:

INSIDE - EXT. THE POD

Al is ambushed by Dieter... A HIGH SPEED DOGFIGHT through the
body. Dieter FIRES at Al, misses, hits a nerve and sets off a
muscle seizure...not the best thing to have in a minefield...

OUTSIDE...Joe can't control his body.

	JOE
	Al, Help.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al's got his hands full.

	AL
	Can't help you now. You're on
	your own.

OUTSIDE

He turns...he's stuck halfway to freedom with the girl and with
no one to save him but himself; HIS OWN ABILITIES...
He moves at them. They fall back momentarily...afraid he'll
trigger the automatic guns.

	BURR
	Give up, save yourself
	You're in a killing zone.

Joe bluffs...buying time.

	JOE
	How about a deal?

	BURR
	We'll let you go. You leave
	the pods and the PEM.

A STAND OFF - The pursuers hesitate,

	JOE
	(under his breath)
	Do something. Gimme some power.
	I'm in a minefield.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al desperately trying to repair the damage, while avoiding
Dieter. At the same time, he is analyzing the controls for the
border defenses. It doesn't seem there's much he can do, but then
he gets it:

Al starts to transmit ultrahigh frequency bursts.

	JOE (VO)
	What are you doing?

	AL
	Sending what we know
	back to U.S.T. via satellite.

INT. DIETER'S POD

Dieter sets his own transmitter to the same frequency and blasts
forth...jamming Al's transmission.

It's a trick. Al adds to the radio chaos, transmitting on other
frequencies...a battle of the wavelengths. Then someone hits it,
a frequency that:

OUTSIDE

sets off the automatic shotguns. Everyone dives for the dirt.
The air above them EXPLODES - shredding the trees. Joe looks up,
sees a lane of guns clicking empty...

INSIDE

Dieter gets in a lucky shot and Al's POD is damaged.

OUTSIDE

Joe hears it.

	JOE
	Al...you there, Al?
	Now's the time. Help us.

No answer. Maybe Al's dead. Now Joe knows: If they're to be
saved, it's his body and his brain that has to save them...
The awful truth...It's up to him.

	JOE
	He can't help us.

	RENE
	Do something!

	JOE
	Do what? I don't know.
	I'm no good at this.

	RENE
	You are, I've seen you.

	JOE
	It wasn't me. It was him.

	RENE
	It was you.

	JOE
	He told me what to do.

	RENE
	But you did it. It was you.


Joe tries to deny it.

	RENE
	I know one thing. If it wasn't
	you...we're in big trouble...

She sees them bringing up submachineguns. She turns to Joe. His
face takes on a look of resolve.

	JOE
	It was me. He just told me
	how...I wish he could tell me now.

	RENE
	If he was able, what would he say.

He gathers himself, takes her hand.

	JOE
	He'd say..."Don't stop now.."

He's up and running for it, with RENE close behind.

THROUGH THE MINEFIELD

He rips open barbed wire, they come to it:

THE FENCE

A LIVE WIRE - He's got to think quickly. He takes off his belt,
loops the buckle on a conductor and pulls it across until two
wires make contact. A BLAST OF SPARKS, the wire grounds out,
shorts, overloads and goes dead. ALARMS GO OFF.  From the other
side, Border Police rush up, but can do nothing to help them.

	JOE
	Come on.

	RENE
	That's twenty feet high.

	JOE
	Like Al says..."Under stress,
	the human body is capable of
	impossible feats.

WHAM WHAM WHAM WHAM WHAM...Submachinegun fire rattles off the
fence above them.

	JOE
	This...is stress.

Rene agrees. She puts her foot in his hands, he vaults her to
the top of the fence. She swings over.

He backs off...a BURST OF FIRE spurs him. He runs, leaps for the
fence, barely catches the top, tries to pull himself up. He
can't. Caught, he hangs there, watching the bad guys move up.

	JOE
	Al, this is your last chance..

The bad guys take aim.

	BURR
	Three seconds to decide. Then
	we will shoot.

Caught, under their guns...Joe looks at them.

INSIDE - EXT. AL'S POD

is hit, mortally damaged...losing pressure.

INT. DIETER'S POD -

	DIETER
	Give up! Tell Joe to give up!

INT. AL'S POD

Desperation...to get enough power, to aim the laser. As Al
swings it around,Dieter fires again. At the same moment, Al fires
at Dieter. It misses...but hits a NERVE BUNDLE!

OUTSIDE

Joe breaks into laughter...The Tickle-Response.

INSIDE

The paroxysm of laughter spoils Dieter's aim...His POD is drawn
into the throat by the convulsions, where it is battered.
Desperate, Al brings HIS dying POD alongside, pops the hatch,
swims to Dieter's pod, just as Dieter's pod is swept away, out of
control.  A vortex tries to tear his grip away. He hangs tough
against the violent wrenches of the current, as the pod swoops
out from under him and spins away. Hand over hand, he reaches a
hatch and enters. Dieter, panicked, at the controls, turns on
him. They fight. The pod tumbles. They tumble. Dieter grabs a
wrench, raises it to slug Al, when the pod hits something solid.
Dieter is slammed against the bulkhead, knocked out.  Al gains
control of the pod, wedges it into a crevice and waits for the
paroxyms to die away.

OUTSIDE

JOE'S ON THE WIRE, laughing at something terribly funny. RENE
thinks he's finally gone mad. He may have. The pursuers think so.
They are so amazed by his attitude...his courage...HIS HEART in
the face of death, that when he tumbles off the fence into the
FREE ZONE, they don't even fire.

THE FENCE

The border police come up and cover them. They are safe and
free. Incredibly, Burr shouts through the fence:

	BURR
	They have stolen state property.

	RENE
	What a nerve!

	BORDER GUARD
	What kind of property?

	RENE (to Joe)
	Just ignore them. Walk away.

	BURR
	I insist. Return the POD.

Joe starts to walk away, then turns to BURR.

	JOE
	Okay, if you really want it.

He hawks and spits through the wire onto the man's shoe. The
guards lock their weapons expecting a firefight at this insult.

BURR's assistant leans down, scrapes the lunger off BURR's foot.
BURR, realizing, scrapes the slime from the other's hand and cups
it in his...He turns away, looking for a vessel. The border
guards are flabbergasted.

They look at Joe, Joe shrugs at them as he and RENE walk away.
Toward a familiar Oriental man who waits for them, in front of an
idling helicopter.

	JOE
	Riuji?

	RENE
	I told you, I work for him.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD

Al is anxious to get home.

	AL
	Hurry up...before this guy wakes.

OUTSIDE

Rene turns to him..He is mumbling.

	RENE
	What is it?

	JOE
	We're not moving fast enough
	for him.

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
	I'll punch up your adrenaline...

OUTSIDE

Joe walks unsteadily off with RENE...past the guards. He seems
insane...arguing with himself.

	JOE
	You leave my adrenaline alone.

RENE just looks ahead; a crazy-amused smile on her face.

It ends as it began, with Al and Joe bitching at each other, but
all anyone hears is Joe's side:

	Joe
	Who's slow? ...I figured
	it out...

INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL

	AL
Well, you should have said it
	in Cantonese...

OUTSIDE

Joe, outraged, babbles away. The Border guards look worried,
like they may have to throw a net over him. Rene starts to giggle
at the whole thing.

	RENE
	He wants to apologise.

	RENE
	He should do it in person
	...I mean ex person.

	JOE
	Yeah...I have to get away.

	RENE
	I know a nice island.

	JOE (to Al)
	What? I told you she was allright.
	Who knew it right away?...and I
	found the chip. Who figured out
	it was Dieter?..Alright then. I ran
	through the minefield, where were
	you then? AW...will you get out
	of my face...etc. etc.
