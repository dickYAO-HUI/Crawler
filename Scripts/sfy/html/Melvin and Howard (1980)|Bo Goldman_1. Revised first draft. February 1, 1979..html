FADE IN 

TITLES 

1	WATERHOLE - STONEWALL PASS, NEVADA - LATE DAY 

The desert between Las Vegas and Tonopah, nothing but sage
and greasewood.  Sound in the distance, a motor.  It comes
closer then fades, comes closer, fades.

Pan off the waterhole in the direction of the sound.  It
approaches again, a figure appears in the distance.


2	ON THE MOTORCYCLE

Only the rider's back, silver-streaked hair.  This gaunt figure 
circles lazily in the moonlight, motorcycle tires rumbling over
the alkali.  The circles get bigger and now bigger, and as he
comes around this time, the moonlight catches his face, aristo-
cratic cheekbones, a stringy beard, a pilot's light windbreaker. 
This is Howard, age 62, looks over 70.


3	ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD

sweeping under the moon, wider and wider and now he speeds 
towards the waterhole, giving the Harley full throttle.


4 	ON THE WATERHOLE 

A knoll running up to the edge of it.


5	ON HOWARD 

heading straight for the knoll, the chopper kicking up sage
and greasewood and alkali behind it.  Tremendous speed -- it
hits the knoll.


6	ON THE MOTORCYCLE

Howard flying through the air, his knees clutched around the
machine, his eyes wide with joy, laughter ringing through the 
desert.

The motorcycle clears the waterhole on the leap, Howard snug
in the saddle, lands in the mud on the other side, skids,
churns, the tires spitting mud, now he rolls out on the
desert again.


7	ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD

sweeping into a figure eight, testing his motor now, picking 
up speed once more, heading straight for the knoll.


8	ON THE KNOLL 

The motorcycle invisible, only the sound blasting through the 
night, louder, louder, and now the motorcycle hits the top of
the knoll.  A rock, a stone, something, it kicks, it stutters, 
it flies short.


9	ON HOWARD 

His face exactly the same as before, exultation at the leap, 
but there is no motorcycle under him now, only air.


10	ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD 

His momentum carrying him over the water and he lands with a 
crunch on the other side, his head hits the mud, a flare of 
blood spurts from his ear.


11 	HOWARD'S POINT OF VIEW 

His eye catching sight of his motorcycle fluttering down, 
landing with a splash, bubbling as it disappears into the
waterhole. 

TITLES OUT


12	EXT. DESERT - DUSK - ON HOWARD

picking himself up, stumbling across the desert, nothing but 
silence around him, his feet kicking over the alkali.  He 
trips, rights himself, moves on.


13	ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD

faltering, falling.

He picks himself up, his face scratched, his lips crusted 
with saliva, blood caked around his ear.


14	HOWARD'S POINT OF VIEW 

Way in the distance, the headlights of a car.


15	ON HOWARD 

He starts to raise his hand, almost furtively, but then he
draws it back.  He does not want to wave.

He looks towards the moon, spins once like a shot-putter. 
Now he falls.

The headlights pass on down the Interstate.  Darkness.


16	EXT. NEVADA HIGHWAY - NIGHT - LONG SHOT 

Two headlights, one dimmer and more yellow than the other, 
are coming down the Interstate now.  Sound -- a man singing. 
The song is horrible, the voice joyous.

			MELVIN (v.o.) 
		(singing) 
	'Well, he called his elves together 
	To soup up his old sleigh 
	So Rudolph and the other reindeer 
	Could rest on Christmas Day....'


17	INT. CAR - NIGHT - ON MELVIN DUMMAR

a face with no secrets, a cowlick and sideburns, looking 
younger than his thirties; Montgomery Ward pants and a 
shirt with cowboy roses.

			MELVIN 
		(singing) 
	'He's got a million miles to travel
	And he'll do it in one day 
	Oh that's because old Santa Claus 
	Got a souped-up Santa sleigh.'

The song trails off into a hum as Melvin pulls off onto the 
side of the road.


18 	ON MELVIN 

undoing his fly.  As he reaches into his pants, the sound of 
a car in the distance, he quickly turns to hide himself, the 
car passes.

Now he reaches in again, but another car catches him in its 
lights.

			MELVIN 
	Jeesuz.

He climbs back into his car, stomps on the gas, and he zooms 
off the highway and on to the alkali, up an old cattle road. 
Now he scuds to a stop, steps out onto the emptiness of the 
desert.


19	ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN

pissing, sighing with relief, his sigh mingling with the 
crackling of his urine as it hits the desert crust.


20	ON MELVIN'S FACE

Pleasure.  The same pleasure he feels at eating, sleeping, 
defecating, copulating.

Climbs back into his car.  Starts up the motor, backs around, 
and the headlight catches a body lying in the deserted cattle
road.


21	ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN

blinks.  Squints, now he throws the car into low gear, rolls 
slowly towards the body, stops a few feet away.


22	ON MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW 

The body doesn't move.  Limp, dead.


23 	ON MELVIN

following the shaft of the headlight, moving towards the body. 
Poised a step away.

Now he crouches over it.  A grunt.  Melvin rolls it over.  A 
beard, Howard's long hair.  He lifts him, the headlight shines 
full into Howard's eyes, they open, flicker.  Howard grunts
again.

			MELVIN
	Whut?

Howard doesn't stir, doesn't answer.  Melvin cradles Howard's
head, and the ear comes into view, fresh blood trickling over 
the clotting.  Melvin heaves Howard up, half-stumbling, half-
carrying him towards the car, opens the passenger side and
shovels him in.


24	ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN

slamming the door shut.  Now Melvin looks out towards the
desert.


25	MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW 

Only blackness and silence.


26 	ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN 

climbs into the car on the driver's side, looks over at his 
passenger.  Howard has scrunched himself into a corner, his 
eyes are wide open now, and wild with terror.  Melvin catches
it.

Melvin smiles, nothing from Howard.  Melvin smiles again.

			MELVIN 
	Whut's the matter, ol' buddy?

Howard doesn't answer.  He turns his head a little but as he 
turns, blood oozes.

			MELVIN
	Whut are you doin' out here?

Silence again.  Howard doesn't take his eyes off Melvin. 
Melvin leans toward him.  Howard braces himself against the
door.

			MELVIN 
		(peering into
		Howard's face)
	That ear don't look too good to me. 
	You want a doctor?

Howard shakes his head.

			MELVIN (Cont'd) 
	There's a doctor in Beatty.  That
	ain't but a few miles.  Want to go
	to Beatty?

Howard doesn't answer, just holds himself stiff against the
door.

			MELVIN 
	We'll go to Beatty.  Okay?

He throws the car into gear, spins around and heads off to-
wards the interstate.

					
27	INT. CAR - NIGHT

Melvin at the wheel, Howard hiding in the corner of the seat 
offering Melvin as narrow a view of his face as possible. 
Suddenly a clatter, Melvin's head whips around, Howard has 
been taken with the shakes, terrible heaves, his teeth chat-
tering.

Howard doubles over trying to warm himself, clutching both 
shoulders cross-handed.  Melvin reaches for the heater, 
clicks it on, nothing happens.

			MELVIN 
	This ain't but a '66 -- damn heater
	never did work.

Howard shudders again, a terrible whistling through his teeth. 
Melvin bangs the heater with his fist.

			HOWARD
	It's okay.

			MELVIN 
	What do you mean it's okay?  Now 
	you just hold on there.

Melvin pulls over to the side of the road.


28	ON MELVIN

climbing out, opening the trunk.  The trunk light shows two 
giant plastic bags full of white powder, some horse harness, 
a bow and arrow, a fishing rod, stuffed animals and pull-toys, 
a ratty blanket and a pillow.

He fishes out the blanket and pillow.


29 	TWO-SHOT - HOWARD AND MELVIN 

Melvin leans towards Howard, drapes the blanket over him, but
does not drape.  It is about the size of a shirt and the pil-
low he places under his head would fit a doll.

Howard regards them.

			MELVIN
	They belong to my little girl. Can't 
	sleep without her bumby.

Melvin laughs.

			MELVIN
	Shit.

Howard shivers, the tiny blanket falls off him. He doesn't
have the strength to pick it up,  Melvin bends over to re-
trieve it, as he does his head hits the dashboard and the 
heater whirrs on.

			MELVIN
	Well, damn!  Damn!


29-A	INT. CAR NIGHT

He laughs again.  Nothing from Howard, still underneath the
baby blanket, but now allowing his head to ease back ever so 
slightly into the pillow.

Melvin reaches his hand under the heater.

			MELVIN 
	Warm as toast!  You brought me luck,
	ol' buddy.  That heater ain't worked
	since my wife kicked it last time I 
	undressed her in the car.

Howard stirs slightly, Melvin squints over at him.  Melvin
reaches across Howard, flips open the glove compartment --
a torrent of bills and kleenex, a flashlight, half-eaten 
candy bars, some knitting needles, a pair of scissors, old 
Dixie cups.

Melvin rummages around in the mess.

			MELVIN 
	I was lookin' for a band-aid.

			HOWARD 
	Keep your eye on the road.

			MELVIN 
	How's that?

			HOWARD 
	I said keep your eye on the road.

			MELVIN 
	Well, up yours, ol' timer.

			HOWARD 
	What?

			MELVIN 
	I said 'Up yours.'

Melvin rummages some more, more papers fall out, Howard half-
tries to pick them up.

			MELVIN 
	Leave 'em.  They ain't but a bunch
	of collection notices.

He snaps the glove compartment shut, looks over at Howard's
ear.

			MELVIN 
	We ain't gonna get to Beatty any 
	too soon.

			HOWARD 
	No doctors.

			MELVIN 
	There ain't no doctors there.  Just 
	a public health nurse.

			HOWARD 
	No nurses.

			MELVIN 
	You don't like nurses? 

			HOWARD 
	No, I don't.
 
			MELVIN 
	Okay, okay. 

They ride in silence.

Howard is heaving now, Melvin watches him closely.

			HOWARD 
	I'm not going to Beatty.

			MELVIN 
	Where <u>are</u> you going?

			HOWARD 
	Where are <u>you</u> going?

			MELVIN 
	Aw, Jeezus.

			HOWARD 
	I'm sorry ---

			MELVIN 
	Don't apologize ---

			HOWARD 
	I never apologize but I'll try to 
	explain ---

			MELVIN 
	Don't explain!

			HOWARD 
	You want to stop at Beatty, fine. 
	I don't.  I'm going to Vegas ---

Howard is silent.  Melvin grits his teeth.  Howard shrugs.

			MELVIN 
	Man, you sure beat it, don't you? 
	Squirrelly ol' wino layin' out 
	there in the west 40, nobody sees 
	you 'til kingdom come -- I pick you
	up and what do you do?  Rag me.

			HOWARD 
	I'm sorry.

			MELVIN 
	What?

			HOWARD 
	Nothing. I just think I'll rest a
	while.

			MELVIN 
	You do that.  You lay back now --
	we're coming up to Beatty now --
	you still don't want to stop?

			HOWARD 
	No, no stops, please.

			MELVIN 
	You'll be sorry, you're gonna miss 
	the knockers on the public health
	nurse there.

Howard smiles.

			HOWARD 
	Nice, huh?

			MELVIN 
	Do we stop at Beatty or no?

Howard sighs. 

			HOWARD 
	No.

Melvin stomps on the gas.

			MELVIN
	Vegas, here we come. 

They drive for a long while in silence.


30	HOWARD 

is silent, always watching Melvin, shifting, shaking some, 
Melvin loose at the wheel.

			HOWARD 
	You're not a bad driver.

			MELVIN
	I been driving since I was seven 
	years old.

			HOWARD 
	How'd you reach the pedals?

			MELVIN
	Make it nine.  I had most of my
	growth by nine.

			HOWARD 
	I'll bet you did.  Jacking off in 
	that trailer.

			MELVIN
	How'd you know I lived in a trailer?

			HOWARD 
	Didn't you say so?

			MELVIN
	They was my three brothers in the 
	trailer with me.

			HOWARD 
	In one trailer?

			MELVIN 
	Two of us slept on cots and two on
	the old dinette table.  We didn't
	have nothing but an outhouse.  I 
	remember the first day I went to 
	school I peed in the water fountain.

			HOWARD 
	Interesting.

			MELVIN 
	Took me right down to the Salvation 
	Army, bought me shoes and carted me
	back to school.

			HOWARD 
	What'd you say your name was?

			MELVIN 
	Melvin Dummar.

			HOWARD 
	You're kidding me, Melvin.

Melvin smiles, looks over at Howard.

			MELVIN 
	Hey, ol' buddy.  You want to do me 
	a favor?

			HOWARD 
	Depends on what it is.

			MELVIN 
	I've written a song.

			HOWARD 
	No ---

			MELVIN 
	It's a Christmas number -- 'Santa's
	Souped-Up Sleigh.'

			HOWARD 
	Oh God.

			MELVIN 
	I sent it to Hollywood Music. 
	You know you give them the words 
	-- they write you the music --
	seventy dollars and worth every
	penny -- you want to hear it?

			HOWARD 
	No.

			MELVIN 
	Here's how it goes --
		(sings) 
	'Well, he called his elves together 
	To soup up his old sleigh 
	So Rudolph and the other reindeer 
	Could rest on Christmas Day

	'He's got a million miles to travel 
	And he'll do it in one day 
	Oh that's because old Santa Claus 
	Got a souped up Santa sleigh'

			HOWARD 
	Enough, sir ---

			MELVIN 
	Wait till you hear the talk part 
	-- a dramatic narration like Red 
	Sovine --
		(speaks)
	'Now listen there fat man
	Just because you're Santa Claus 
	That don't give you the right 
	To come around and making all
		 that noise
	In the middle of the night. 
	Now I don't care who you are, 
		 fat man 
	You get those reindeer off my 
		 roof --'

			HOWARD 
	Please stop ---

			MELVIN 
	What's the matter?

			HOWARD 
	My ear.

			MELVIN 
	Told you we should have stopped
	at Beatty.

			HOWARD 
	It's the sound.

			MELVIN 
	What do you mean, the sound?

			HOWARD 
	Your song.

			MELVIN 
	You're cruel, man, you know that? 
	You're a cruel man.

			HOWARD 
	I have an aversion to song.

			MELVIN 
	You never sung in your life?

			HOWARD 
	Not if I could help it.

			MELVIN 
	That's how you got to be an ol' 
	asshole.  Now you come along on 
	the chorus --
		(sings)
	'He's got a rocket burnin' mighty 
		 quick
	Turnin' souped up Santa's sleigh 
	He'll come in like a streak of light 
	And he'll blast off right away...' 
	You got that?

			HOWARD 
	I don't know.

			MELVIN
	Now sing along with me.  Or you
	gonna walk to Vegas. 
		(sings) 
	'He's got a rocket burnin' mighty 
		 quick'

Motions to Howard to join in.

			HOWARD 
		(mumbling; gingerly 
		singing) 
	Turnin' souped up Santa's sleigh'

			MELVIN
	Now you're gettin' it!  Once more ---

Howard starts to sing.

			HOWARD 
		(singing) 
	'He's got a rocket burnin' mighty
		 quick
	Turnin' souped up Santa's sleigh....'

			MELVIN
		(speaking)
	'Now now, Mr. Fat Man, what are 
	you trying to do?  Now that 
	chimney's too small and you might 
	fall -- so you just get down off
	that roof'

Melvin points to Howard and Howard joins in.

			HOWARD AND MELVIN 
		(singing) 
	'When you hear those rockets roar 
	You'll know Santa's on his way
	But he'll be back again next year 
	In his souped up Santa's sleigh!'

Howard seems pleased with himself.

			MELVIN
	You done it!  And you want to know
	something?

			HOWARD 
	What?

			MELVIN
	You weren't bad.

			HOWARD 
	Come on.

			MELVIN
	Now you sing me one of your songs ---

			HOWARD 
	I don't know any songs ---

			MELVIN
	Anythin'.  'Stop And Smell The
	Roses,'  'My Woman, My Woman, My 
	Wife' -- whatever you like --

			HOWARD
	I don't know any songs.  My father
	was the singer in the family, 
	'When The Sunset Turns The Ocean's 
	Blue To Gold,' 'Bill Bailey.'
		(imitates)
	'Sonny, you do the verse, I'll 
	take the chorus.'  And off he'd 
	go.

			MELVIN
	What songs do you know?

			HOWARD
	Me?  Nothing --  
		(shrugs) 
	'Bye Bye Blackbird.'

			MELVIN
	There you go!

Melvin punches Howard in the arm.

			MELVIN 
	Lay it on me, ol' timer.

			HOWARD
	Don't be crazy.

			MELVIN 
	'Ladeez and gentlemen -- to wind 
	up our program tonight -- and I 
	want y'all t'drive home safely -- 
	y'hear? -- we got a brand new 
	number by an ol' ol' timer --
	he's been a pickin' and a strummin' 
	for many a year -- so let's hear it
	for this little ditty -- the ol'
	timer and "Bye Bye Blackbird!" 
	-- take it, ol' timer!!'

Howard looks at him.

			HOWARD
	Let me out.

Melvin winks.

			MELVIN 
	Come on.

Howard starts to hum a little.

			MELVIN 
	Ooh, that's nice -- did I hear a
	word?

			HOWARD
	'Bye, Bye, Blackbird.'

			MELVIN 
	There she goes.

			HOWARD
		(starting to sing 
		faintly) 
	'Pack up all my cares and woes 
	Here I go 
	Singing low'

			HOWARD AND MELVIN 
		(singing)
	'Bye, bye, blackbird!'

Howard is gaining strength.

			HOWARD 
		(singing) 
	'Where somebody waits for me 
	Sugar's sweet
	So is she'

			HOWARD AND MELVIN 
		(singing) 
	'Bye, bye, blackbird!'

Melvin turns to Howard, presenting him like an emcee.

			HOWARD 
		(singing) 
	'No one here can love and understand
		 me
	Oh what hard luck stories they all
		 hand me

	Make my bed and light the light
	I'll arrive
	Late tonight 
	Blackbird ---'

			MELVIN 
		(singing)
	'Blackbird!'

			HOWARD AND MELVIN 
		(singing 
		together)
	'Blackbird
	Bye!  Bye!'

Howard's face is aglow with joy, but no more so than Melvin's.

			MELVIN 
	Hey!

Melvin reaches out his hand -- Howard gives it a boogie
slap.

			MELVIN 
	I like that song -- clean up 
	that lyric a little and she'll
	take right off.

Suddenly Howard withdraws -- dim and distant.  They ride 
again in silence.

Melvin looks over to him.

			MELVIN
	How're you doin'?

			HOWARD 
	I'm fine.
		(after a moment) 
	So where are you going now?

			MELVIN 
	Home to Gabbs.  Bringin' back 
	some stuff for our trailer my 
	sister wanted to get rid of.

			HOWARD
	What do you do in Gabbs?

			MELVIN
	I work in the Mag Ox Plant.  You
	know -- Maalox -- you get an ulcer ---

			HOWARD
	I know, I know ---

			MELVIN
	You know what?

			HOWARD
	I know Maalox comes from magnesium
	oxide.  All the Jews in New York
	drink it.

Melvin looks at him.

			MELVIN
	Well that's more than most people
	know.

			HOWARD
	Thank you.

			MELVIN
	I wasn't complimenting you.  That 
	was just a comment.

			HOWARD 
	Still I appreciate it.

Silence.

			MELVIN 
	Don't bother me, dirty work or no. 
	Was a milkman once -- used to 
	stink of sour milk.  Now I smell 
	like Maalox.

			HOWARD 
	What a shame.

			MELVIN 
	I remember once -- I was delivering 
	milk in the middle of the night --
	and it come to me -- why don't I 
	get a job on graveyard like some 
	of them old gals' husbands -- so 
	I went around to McDonnell Douglas 
	and Hughes --

			HOWARD 
	And what happened?

			MELVIN 
	Nuthin.'

			HOWARD 
	What a shame.

			MELVIN
	You keep saying 'what a shame' ---

			HOWARD 
	I might have done something.

			MELVIN
	Done what?

			HOWARD 
	I'm Howard Hughes.

Melvin's head swivels, he squints over at Howard beside him. 
Now he looks back at the road.  Suddenly he turns back
to Howard.

			MELVIN
	How's that?

			HOWARD 
	I said I'm Howard Hughes.

Melvin stifles a smile, tries to look very serious, steals 
another look over at Howard, now he shakes his head to 
himself.

			MELVIN
	Well I believe in anybody callin' 
	themselves anything they want to.

			HOWARD
	I appreciate that.


31	MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW

Windshield, a raindrop, then another.  Then a sudden 
downpour, a desert shower, stopping almost as soon as
it starts.


32	ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW

The rain clearing, just a gray sky.  He opens the window. 
Howard opens his window.

			MELVIN 
		(breathing in)
	Greasewood.

			HOWARD 
		(breathing in)
	Sage.

			MELVIN
	Nothing like the smell of the
	desert after the rain.

			HOWARD 
	Greasewood and sage. 

They roll along for a while.


33	HOWARD AND MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW - NIGHT

Way in the distance, the casinos and hotels rising out of the 
desert -- Las Vegas.


34	OMITTED


35	MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW - NIGHT

rolling into Las Vegas on the boulevard.  The blaze of neon 
lighting up his and Howard's face.

			MELVIN 
	Can I let you off at the Salvation
	Army?

			HOWARD 
	No thanks. What are you going to 
	do?

			MELVIN
	We'll keep pluggin'.


36	ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN AND HOWARD

			HOWARD 
	Let me off at The Sands.

Melvin drives down Las Vegas Blvd., and pulls in at The Sands. 

			HOWARD 
	Over there.

Melvin drives around the back, towards the bungalows, slowly, 
about 10 MPH.

			HOWARD 
	Stop ---

			MELVIN
	Right here?

			HOWARD 
	This is the place.

Melvin stops, looks over at Howard. 

			MELVIN 
	You got a friend in the kitchen? 
	Give you some money to get that 
	ear attended to?

Howard doesn't answer, fiddling with the door handle.

			HOWARD 
	How do you get out of this thing?

Melvin reaches across Howard, flips the door handle, the door 
opens.

			MELVIN 
	Well I enjoyed it, ol' buddy.

He smiles at Howard, swings the door wide open, Howard hesi-
tates.

Suddenly ---

			HOWARD
	You got any money?

Melvin sighs, reaches in his pocket, fumbles. 


37	CLOSEUP - HOWARD 

waiting, watching. 


38	ON MELVIN

fishing in his pocket.

			MELVIN 
	Ain't got but a quarter change ---

Howard doesn't answer, holds out his hand, Melvin drops the 
quarter into it.

Howard gets out now, shuts the door.

			HOWARD
	Thank you, Melvin.

And he is gone.


39	EXT. GABBS, NEVADA - BEFORE SUNRISE

The middle of nowhere.  In the distance, dense, white chemical 
smoke curling up off the ridge where a magnesium plant hovers. 
Down below, almost a mile away, the town, rutted dirt streets
lined with trailers.


40	OMITTED


41 	ON MELVIN

driving down a baked-clay side street, dirty dogs clearing 
out of the way.  A battered Airstream trailer lies ahead on
the right.  Pulling into the yard, grassless and sandy, a
plastic pool caked with mud.  A pull toy straddling an old 
clothes wringer.  A clothesline, a child's snowsuit pinned 
to it.


42	ON MELVIN

climbing out of the car, picking his way to the door of the 
trailer, past a new Honda leaning against the air drums.


43	INT. MELVIN'S TRAILER - DAWN

A dinette set fighting for space with a child's bicycle and 
toys.  A new TV, a dishrag from the evening meal draped over
it.

Melvin moves to a partition, a blanket strung on a piece of 
twine.


43-A	MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW

Darcy, a nymphet 10 years old, sound asleep.  He bends to kiss 
her, tucks the blanket around her.  She smiles.  Melvin adjusts 
the heater, then moves off, pulling the partition closed.


44	ON LYNDA

in her middle twenties, hunched sexy shoulders of an ex-cheer-
leader, busky and redolent with sleep now.  Melvin peels off 
his clothes, they drop at his ankles as he climbs into bed.

ON MELVIN AND LYNDA

He touches her.  And she stirs.  Melvin is glazed with the
heat of her sleep, the warmth of the bed, Lynda's proximity. 
He rustles, she tries to quiet him, but now he moves over
her.  Excited by her, and now she by him, their intimacy
always contained, conscious of Darcy beyond the curtain.


45	LATER

Melvin falling asleep. Lynda awake beside him.  The sound of 
a car pulling up.  Lynda freezes.  A car door opens, shuts.

Another car door opens, shuts.


ON LYNDA

She doesn't move, tuned into the sounds, familiar with them 
almost, dreading them.  Now she gets up and goes to the win-
dow, looks out.


46	EXT. MELVIN'S YARD - EARLY MORNING - LYNDA'S POINT OF VIEW

A jump cable being connected to a battery in Melvin's car. 
A spark flies, the car starts.  Repossession men in their 
Montgomery Ward suits, flip the cable off, throw it in the
trunk of their car.  One starts to close the trunk, the 
other stops him.


ON MELVIN'S MOTORCYCLE

One lifts the handlebars, the other the rear wheel, and they 
heave it into their trunk.


47	INT. TRAILER - EARLY MORNING - ON LYNDA

She starts for the door, then stops.  She lifts the curtain of 
the other window.


48	EXT. MELVIN'S YARD - EARLY MORNING - LYNDA'S POINT OF VIEW

Melvin's car driving down the dusty street.  Following it the
repo car, the trunk lid catching the dawn light as it bobbles 
over the motorcycle.


49	CLOSEUP - LYNDA

turning back to Melvin.  He sleeps soundly, oblivious, beati-
fic.

Lynda reaches for the telephone.


50	ROAD TO GABBS - DAWN - A PICKUP
							 
jaunting down the road.  At the wheel in a straw cowman's hat, 
Clark Taylor.  Stashed in a rack behind him, like a shotgun, 
his guitar.


51	INT. MELVIN'S TRAILER - DAY - LYNDA
												 
pressing a doll of Darcy's into a little wicker suitcase. 
Darcy dressed and scruffy, wiping the sleep from her eyes. 
They hear Clark's truck pull up  Lynda goes to the door, 
makes a motion for Clark to wait.

		
51-A	EXT. MEL'S YARD - DAY - CLARK

reaching for his guitar, opening the case, starts to noodle 
as he waits.


52	ON LYNDA 

frantically finishes throwing clothes into a bag as Melvin
begins to stir.  She half-pulls, half-pushes Darcy out the
door.  Darcy heads for the pickup.

Lynda reaches for her own bag, and she sees Melvin turn over. 
She rushes out the door, then stops.  Goes back.


53	ON LYNDA AND MELVIN 
For an instant, the feeling she might want to climb into bed
with him.  She reaches down, jostles him awake.  Melvin
looks up.

			LYNDA
	Good-bye, Melvin.

She leaves.


54	ON MELVIN 

He blinks, sits up.

			MELVIN
	Hunh?


54-A	MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW

The partition pulled, Darcy's bed empty. 


55	ON MELVIN 

He throws himself out of bed, dives out the door. 


56	MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW - THE PICKUP TRUCK

already disappearing up the road, Darcy's face pressed to the
rear window.  She waves.

The old dog sitting where Melvin's car was.  Melvin spins
for his motorcycle.  Nothing there but an oil rag in the dust.


57	CLOSEUP - MELVIN

blinking, bewildered.  He looks down the road, the smoke
ever curling up from the magnesium plant.


58 	EXT. RENO, NEVADA - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT


59	EXT./INT. MOTEL ROOM - RENO - DAY

Clark Taylor exits a motel room and heads for his truck. In-
side, Lynda lies in the shards of a glass coffee table as 
Darcy creeps out of the bathroom where she has been hiding.

Lynda and Darcy stare at the doorway for a long time.

			LYNDA 
	Musicians stink.

Darcy moves to Lynda now, sinks in her mother's arms, now she 
turns and helps her mother up on the couch.  She examines 
Lynda's face, touching a bruised cheek; licks the blood from 
a scratch on her forehead.

They just lie there.

			DARCY 
	It's my fault.

			LYNDA
	What are you talking about?

			DARCY
	He didn't want a kid around.

			LYNDA
	He said he wanted a kid. He said
	he wanted you. Been after me for
	months.  I would divorce Melvin
	and he would adopt you.

			DARCY
	Didn't Johnny Pike say that?

After a moment.

			LYNDA
	Yeah. 

			DARCY
	What did Johnny Pike play?

			LYNDA
	Bass.

Lynda gets up wearily from the couch, picks up the pieces of
glass.  Darcy helps her.

			DARCY
	How're we gonna pay for this?

			LYNDA
	With a job.

			DARCY
	What job?

			LYNDA
	I don't know -- a job. 

			DARCY
	At the donut shop?

			LYNDA
	Maybe not a donut shop again.
		(smiles) 
	Maybe a donut shop.

			DARCY
	It doesn't matter, Ma.

Lynda sighs.

			LYNDA
	Or cocktail waitress ---

			DARCY 
	I'll have to help you.

			LYNDA
	What are you talking about?

			DARCY
	Don't you remember?  Last time you 
	flunked.  You thought a Moscow Mule 
	was a King Alfonse and a King 
	Alfonse was a Moscow Mule?  And 
	then you had the fight with the
	bartender?

A heel is broken in Lynda's shoe. She throws it against the
wall.

			LYNDA
	I remember.

			DARCY
	I think I want to go home.

Silence.

			LYNDA
	I can't go home, honey.

			DARCY 
	I know it's hard without a car for
	you.  But you know I only have to
	walk to school.

Lynda looks at her.

			LYNDA
	You miss school.

			DARCY  
	I miss my friends.

			LYNDA
	And Daddy?

After a moment.

			DARCY
	I don't miss him.
		(after another
		moment) 
	Yeah, I miss him.

			LYNDA
	Me, too ---

			DARCY
		(jumping up)
	Good!

			LYNDA
		(jumping up) 
	But, I wouldn't go back to that
	sonofabitch if he were the last man
	on earth!

			DARCY
	Don't swear, Mama.

			LYNDA
	I'm sorry. 

She touches Darcy.

			LYNDA
	C'm'on, I'll walk you to the bus.

Lynda makes her way across the room, picks up the broken shoe, 
strips the padding off the sole, takes out a ten-dollar bill.


60	INT. BUS TERMINAL - RENO - DAY

Lynda coming away from the ticket window, counting her change,
a couple of dollars.  She presses the ticket into Darcy's hand. 
Now she moves to the lunch counter.


61	LYNDA'S POINT OF VIEW - A LUNCH COUNTER CUSTOMER

Sitting at the counter, chewing on a ham sandwich.  Lynda 
looks at the sandwich warily.

			LYNDA
	You're not eating here.  Take a 
	seat, honey, I'll be right back.


62	ANOTHER ANGLE - LUNCH COUNTER

Lynda undoing a grocery bag.  Pulls out a loaf of Italian 
bread.

			LYNDA
		(to the 
		Counterman)
	Hey, you got a knife?

He turns around from the sandwich board, Lynda smiles.  He 
hands her the knife.  She cuts the loaf in half.

Reaches for a jar of mustard resting on the counter.  Smears 
the bread.

Now she removes a packet of ham from the grocery bag, lays 
the whole, thick stack on one of the slabs of bread.  She 
steals a leaf of lettuce from a plate that hasn't been 
cleared, presses it on the ham, covers the concoction with 
a second slab of bread.  Wraps the sandwich up in the waxed 
bread paper.

			COUNTERMAN 
	Now how about something to drink?

Lynda opens her palm to the nickel and dime that remain.

			LYNDA 
	Give us a Milky Way.

The Counterman flips her a Milky Way, she opens it, breaks it
in half, hands half to Darcy.  They walk out, munching on
their halves of candy bar.


63	EXT. BUS BAYS - RENO BUS STATION - DAY

Lynda kisses Darcy at the door.  Darcy climbs up, moves to a
seat on the bus, Lynda following her from the platform.  Darcy 
takes a seat, opens her brown bag.


64	ON DARCY 

waving to Lynda, reaching into the bag, lifting out the sand-
wich, takes a huge bite. 

She flashes the "okay" sign.


65	ON LYNDA 

The bus is thrown into gear, Lynda waves hysterically as the 
bus backs out.

And then all of a sudden it disappears.


66	EXT. RENO STREET - GO-GO SALOON - DAY - LYNDA

walking down a Reno street.  The sound of music coming from a 
doorway.  She looks through the window.


67	OMITTED 


68	EXT. GABBS - BUS STOP - DAY

The bus arrives.  Darcy gets off -- runs to Melvin.  They hug.


69 	BAGGING ROOM - BASIC MANUFACTURING - GABBS, NEVADA

Melvin is seated astride a crate in front of a bagging machine. 
He holds open the bag, the magnesium oxide powder pours out,
the machine seals the bag.  Melvin heaves it on a treadmill
behind.

At the base of the treadmill is Little Red, sacking the bags 
on a pallet as they come off.  A forklift reaches in, plucks 
the pallet, and shovels it onto a trailer outside.

The whistle blows.  Melvin hits a button -- the machine stops.

Melvin reaches for his lunch pail.  Opens it.  The remains of 
a sandwich, encrusted with staleness.  He snaps it shut, 
follows Little Red out onto the loading platform.  They jump 
down, move into the weigh-shack.


70	INT./EXT. WAREHOUSE AREA - DAY

A gauge for a scale, a radiator, a five-gallon coffee urn.

It is cold out and when they enter the shack, their breath 
vaporizes.  They sit on the edge of the radiator.

			MELVIN
	Your coffee's on.

			LITTLE RED
	I always leave it on.

			MELVIN 
	How long's it been on?

			LITTLE RED
	What's the date today?

			MELVIN 
	Twenty-fourth, twenty-fifth ---

			LITTLE RED 
	Twenty-four, twenty-five days.  I
	start it on the first of the month.

Little Red looks at Melvin.

			LITTLE RED 
	You can't go on like this, Mel.

			MELVIN 
	Like what?

			LITTLE RED
	Moonin' like a baby.  Lynda'll
	come back.  They always do -- take
	me, I can't stand my wife.

			MELVIN 
	You told me.

			LITTLE RED
	But I always go back.  I'm going
	back this weekend.  You wanna
	come?

			MELVIN 
	See your wife?

			LITTLE RED
	I got a sister.

			MELVIN 
	You got a sister?

Little Red reaches for a coffee cup.

			MELVIN 
	She short like you with red hair?

			LITTLE RED
	Tall with blue.  Takes tolls on
	the Golden Gate Bridge.  You'll
	like her.

Little Red places the cup under the coffee spout.  It doesn't 
flow.  He tips the urn, now releases the spigot, the coffee 
spurts out.

Follow the coffee from the spout to the floor.  On the floor, 
a hole has been worn, like a crater, from the drippings of 
the coffee.

			LITTLE RED
	What do you say, Melvin?

Melvin sighs, looking at the hole in the floor.

			MELVIN 
	I don't want to go to San Francisco, 
	Red.  But I'll hitch a ride with 
	you to Reno.


71 	EXT. GABBS HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

Melvin driving, Little Red beside him.  Little Red is drunk. 
He reaches for his bottle, takes a pull, tries to hand it to 
Melvin.

			LITTLE RED
	Here you go, Mel.

			MELVIN
	Put that stuff away.

			LITTLE RED
	You sure are good, Mel.


72	ON LITTLE RED

half-asleep, occasionally lighting a cigarette, smoking it 
dreamily.


73 	ANOTHER ANGLE 

Little Red sleeping in the front seat.  Suddenly he leaps up, 
Melvin almost swerves off the road.

			LITTLE RED
	What happened?

			MELVIN 
	You dropped your cigarette!

Smoke pours up from under Little Red.  He jumps out of the
car.

			MELVIN 
	You little red asshole!

Melvin whips off his jacket, starts beating away at the 
smoking seat.  Little Red is running around outside of the
car, cooling himself.  Finally, Melvin who is making no
headway, rips the whole seat out from its slides, throws
it in the road.

			MELVIN 
	Now you drive.  And stay awake!

Little Red dutifully climbs into the driver's seat.  Melvin
lays down in the rear, goes to sleep.


74 	EXT. MUSTANG RANCH - NIGHT 

The car is stopped.  Melvin coughs, wakes up.


75	MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW 

Little Red is gone.  It is night.

Nothing around but desert.  Melvin peers in another direction. 
A barbed-wire fence, a group of trailers, elevated guard 
tower, spotlights.

			MELVIN 
	Oh, no.


76	ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN

climbing out of the car, walking slowly to a high gate made
of hurricane fencing.  He tries the knob, nothing happens. 
Jiggles it.

A Voice booms out over the desert.

			VOICE 
	Yes?

			MELVIN 
	You got a little red-haired guy in 
	there?

			VOICE
	Name?

			MELVIN
	Little Red.

			VOICE
	Just a minute.

Melvin cups his hands, blows air through them, stomps his 
feet in the cold.

			VOICE 
	He's here.

Melvin jiggles the gate again.

			VOICE
	What do you want?

			MELVIN
	Him.

			VOICE
	Are you a customer?

			MELVIN
	No, sir, I'm not.

			VOICE
	'Ma'am'---

			MELVIN
	No, ma'am, I'm not.

			VOICE
	We can't let you in unless you're 
	a customer.

			MELVIN 
	I don't want to get laid, ma'am. 
	I just want my buddy.

			VOICE
	Hold on.

The wind whistles, a coyote calls.  Melvin stomps his feet.

			VOICE
	Sorry ---

Melvin looks around the desert, shrugs.  He walks back to 
the car, climbs into the driver's seat, reaches for the 
ignition. 

No key.


77 	ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN 

climbing slowly out of the car, jiggling the gate again.

			VOICE
	What do you want?

			MELVIN 
	I'd like to get laid.

The gate buzzes, Melvin moves through, walks up to the 
trailer.  He presses a buzzer, a face appears at the window, 
lets him in.


78 	INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

			MADAM
	Welcome to the Cottontail Ranch.

			MELVIN
	Thank you, ma'am.

There are a couple of security men lolling in the lounge.

			MADAM
	Your friend's with Tina in 4, right 
	down the hall.

Melvin starts down the hall.

			MADAM
	Just a minute --

Melvin keeps walking, the security man blocks his path.

			MADAM
	It'll cost you twenty-two fifty.

			MELVIN
	You're kidding.

The security man moves a step closer.

			MELVIN
	I got a problem ---

			MADAM 
	What's your problem?

			MELVIN 
	I don't have twenty-two fifty.

			MADAM
	What have you got?

			MELVIN 
	I got shit.  My wife's left me, my 
	little girl's home with my brother's 
	family, I almost got burned up in 
	a car, and now my best buddy's 
	crapped out in a cathouse in the 
	middle of the desert!

After a moment.

			MADAM
	I see.

			MELVIN
	Let me get my buddy.

			MADAM
	You can't go back there for less 
	than twenty-two fifty.

			MELVIN 
	All I want's the key to the car. 
	You can have <u>him</u>.

			MADAM
	I don't know what to tell you, son. 
	We don't make the rules.  The
	county does.  Twenty dollars for the
	trick.  A dollar for a towel.  A
	dollar-fifty deposit on the towel.

Melvin looks at his watch.

			MELVIN 
	Lynda give this to me for my thirtieth 
	birthday ---

She takes the watch from him.

			MELVIN 
	You get the phases of the moon ---

			MADAM
	Our girls know the phases of the 
	moon.

She hands the watch back.  Melvin shifts, parts a curtain on 
the window.

			MELVIN 
	Tell you what.  He's got a brand new 
	spare tire on the Monaco -- four-ply
	radial -- non-skid -- whitewall ---

			MADAM
	What am I going to do with a tire?

			MELVIN
		(points at the
		security man)
	I don't know, maybe you can hang it 
	on his dick!

The security man smiles.

			MELVIN 
		(to the Madam)
	Help me, lady.

She drums her fingers.

			MADAM
	Go get your friend.


79	INT. TRAILER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The security man buzzes Melvin through a door, and Melvin 
moves down the curtain corridor, opens the door to number 4.

														 
79-A	INT. TRAILER ROOM #4 - NIGHT

A pretty girl, Tina, is practicing tap dancing on a practice
board in a corner of the room.  Little Red is resting on the
edge of the bed, his head slumped on his chest.  All his 
clothes are off except one shoe and a sock.  He holds the 
shoe in one hand.  He is fast asleep.

			TINA
	That's as far as he got.  Our license 
	requires we give him thirty minutes 
	-- he's got seven to go.

Melvin looks down at Little Red.

			MELVIN
	Give me a hand here.

Tina gets up, Melvin lays Little Red on his back, together 
they start to dress him.

			MELVIN
	You married, Tina?

			TINA
	I got a kid in Carson City, my hus-
	band's in Reno.  My mother's in Vegas
	and you just passed my father out in 
	the hallway.

			MELVIN
	Lord.

Tina is struggling with Little Red's pants.

			TINA
	You do his fly.  I don't want to
	catch him in it.

Melvin sighs.

			MELVIN
	You sure got a sense of humor.  My
	name's Melvin Dummar.  Let me shake 
	your hand, Tina.

Tina shakes Melvin's hand.  Their eyes meet.

			TINA
	You married, Melvin?

Melvin beams, looks down at Red, dressed all lopsidedly, 
still sound asleep.

			MELVIN 
	Where could we put this if we wanted 
	to share a few minutes together?

			TINA
	In the hallway.  No one will know
	the difference.

They heave Little Red onto a chair outside the crib.  Prop 
him up, and close the curtain on him.

			MELVIN
	There's only one problem.

			TINA
	What's that?

			MELVIN 
	I haven't got twenty-two fifty.

			TINA
	That's all right, he's still got 
	seven minutes.  And besides, my watch 
	just stopped.


79-B	RENO - NIGHT - MELVIN AND LITTLE RED

speeding along, approaching Reno, the neon beckoning.


80	EXT. MOTEL - RENO - NIGHT

Melvin exits Little Red's car and enters the motel office. 
Little Red drives off.


81	LYNDA'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Melvin enters, looks into the unmade bed, checks the sheets. 
Now moves into the bathroom.  Spies some false eyelashes on
the shelf.  Examines them between his fingers.

Now he sits down on the commode.  As he does, he sees the 
fringe and tassels of a go-go costume, lovingly laid out to
dry on a towel.  He picks it up, holds it away from himself. 
Now he brings it close, smells it, buries his nose in the 
tiny swatch of material.


82	INT. GO-GO SALOON - RENO - NIGHT - MELVIN

muscling his way through the crowded casino, up to the 
scattered characters at the bar.


83	LYNDA

dancing go-go, kind of enjoying it.


84 	GO-GO DANCER 

next to Lynda; her name is Lucy and her arm is in a cast. 
She pokes Lynda's elbow, tries to yell over the noise.

			LUCY
	A guy's waving at you over there.

Lynda looks down.

			LYNDA
	Oh my God, it's Melvin.

She dances off in the other direction, but Melvin runs around 
the bar following her.  She dances back the other way now, but 
Melvin has leaped up on the stage and pulled the plug on the 
speaker.  He carries a suitcase.

Silence in the bar.  Two security men head towards Melvin.

			MELVIN
	You come home with me, Lynda.  Get
	out of this place and come home 
	with your husband, Melvin Dummar.

A Voice from the crowd.

			VOICE 
	<u>You</u> go home, Melvin.

			ANOTHER VOICE
	Yeah, go on home, Melvin.

Lynda looks on helplessly.

			MELVIN 
	Lynda, you're my wife!  Now come
	home!

The security men leap on the bar.

			MELVIN 
	Git outa these bars, Lynda, and 
	come back where you belong.

			LYNDA
	I won't! 

			MELVIN 
	You gotta! 

			LYNDA
	I can't! 

			MELVIN 
	Why not?!

			LYNDA
	I love to dance!

			LUCY
		(hugging Lynda) 
	Oh, Lynda!  You make me feel so
	good.

Melvin throws off the security men, and rips open the suitcase.

			MELVIN 
	All right, you like these damn
	bars?!  Then you can live in these
	damn bars!

			LYNDA
	How's Darcy?

			MELVIN 
	She's fine!

Melvin strews Lynda's clothes on the bar, shirts, pants,
underwear.

			LYNDA
		Oh Jeezus, Melvin.

Now as the security men charge Melvin a last time, he leaps 
off the bar, at the same time throws a torrent of fringe and
tassels at Lynda.

Lynda catches them in the face, they stop her. She reaches 
down and picks a few up.

			LYNDA
	He cut up my best Day-Glo.

The owner plugs in the music, instantly the girls resume 
dancing.  Melvin threads his way out to catcalls and a
single "Attaboy, Melvin!"

The owner beckons Lynda.

			JERRY 
	How often does this happen, Lynda?

			LYNDA
	I'm sorry, Jerry.

			JERRY
	I feel for you and everything, but 
	you know it's not the best thing 
	for business --

			LYNDA 
	I know, I know.
		(sighs) 
	I was quittin' anyway. 

She heads for her dressing room.


84-1A	EXT. GO-GO CLUB - NIGHT - MELVIN

stomps off into the night.

him this time.


85	INT. CLUB 29 - RENO - LATE AFTERNOON

Another saloon -- Lynda in another go-go costume, serving
drinks now.  The Owner leans over her shoulder.

			OWNER
	Someone here to see you.

Lynda looks up.  It is Melvin.

			LYNDA 
	Oh God.

She walks right up to him.

			LYNDA
	What do you want, Melvin?

			MELVIN 
	No fights, no bickering -- just 
	carrying out the law, plain and 
	simple.
		(hands her
		a paper)
	Interlocutory decree.  She's final 
	in six weeks.
		(hands her
		a ring) 
	And my wedding ring -- keep yours 
	if you like.

			LYNDA
	Aw, Melvin.

			MELVIN 
	I'll be seein' you, Lynda.

He stalks off.  She unfolds the document.

			LYNDA
	Hey, wait a minute!  What's it say
	about Darcy in here?

			MELVIN 
	I get custody.

			LYNDA
	What do you mean, you get custody?

			MELVIN 
	No daughter of mine's going to 
	hang around these bars.

Lynda throws the tray of drinks she is carrying in his face.

Melvin comes up spitting, reaches over the bar for a customer's
glass of beer and throws it at Lynda -- The Owner jumps on the 
bar, grabs Melvin by the neck.

			OWNER
	Now, wait a minute!

			MELVIN 
		(loosing himself) 
	I was goin' anyway.

Melvin turns on his heel and walks out.

			OWNER
		(exasperated) 
	Hey, look, Lynda --

			LYNDA
	Never mind.  I quit.

She draws the string on her go-go costume, it drops to the 
floor in front of the astounded Owner and patrons.  And now, 
with the utmost dignity, Lynda, all naked, strides to the 
dressing room past the gawks of the bewildered customers.


85-A	EXT. CLUB 29 - MAGIC HOUR 

Melvin leaps into Red's car beside Darcy, roars off with
tires smoking.  A fender falls off into the street.  Melvin
keeps going.


86	EXT. RENO STREET - LUCY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A house on a side street, the Reno neon glitter burning bright 
in the b.g.  Lynda walks to the door.

									 
86-A	INT. LUCY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Lucy picks up Lynda's bag, leads her to a bedroom.


86-B	INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lucy turns on the light. The room is a mess, but cozy. 

			LYNDA
	Gee -- and I almost had to spend 
	the night with some sonofabitch 
	lawyer.

			LUCY
	Are there any other kind?

			LYNDA
	I just want to get my little girl 
	back.  My husband's divorcing me.

			LUCY
	Why?

			LYNDA
	Because he can't make any money and
	it makes him feel bad.

Lynda pitches her bag on the bed, starts undressing.  Lucy
hangs up her clothes.

			LYNDA
	So I can stay here as long as I
	want?

			LUCY
	Long as you want.  Until your baby
	comes.  Don't ask me how, I always 
	know.

			LYNDA
	And did you know I'll never see the
	father again?

			LUCY
	Don't worry, kid.  You'll get an 
	abortion, it'll all be over ---

			LYNDA
		(interrupting) 
	Oh, no, I had one of those. I kept
	dreaming of bunnies drowning.

Lynda climbs under the covers.

			LUCY
	I'll bet I know what that means ---

			LYNDA
	Don't tell me.  I'm just not going
	to do it again.

			LUCY
	Melvin knocked you up.  That
	bastard.

			LYNDA
	Maybe Melvin.  Maybe not Melvin. 
	Melvin's okay.

			LUCY
	You mean we like Melvin?  A few 
	kind men left in this world, right? 
	But we're leaving him, right?

			LYNDA
	Melvin's left me.

			LUCY
	What are you going to do now?

			LYNDA
	Same thing I always do.  Go home 
	to Mother.

88	BEHIND DISNEYLAND - LYNDA'S MOTHER'S HOUSE

A sea of tract houses.  Zoom in on one, any one.  The Sisk's

and two boys tossing a football.


89	INT. LYNDA'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY 

Lynda sits on a couch in a pair of pregnant hot pants and a 
bra watching television.

Lynda is eight months pregnant.  Her mother, Mrs. Sisk, sits
beside her.  The dog, "Tramp" wanders in.

			MRS. SISK 
	You want something cold to drink, 
	Lynda?

			LYNDA 
	No thanks, Ma.

			MRS. SISK 
	I'm going out for a few minutes.

			LYNDA
	Okay, Ma.

			MRS. SISK 
	Anything happens, call a cab to

	Nothing's going to happen, Ma.

The door slams. 


90	OMITTED 


91	LYNDA ON THE COUCH

watching the TV set.  She reaches for a book, "The Magic of
Believing."   Glances at it, then back at the TV set. 

Now she looks at the phone.


92	INT. MELVIN'S TRAILER - DAY 

Melvin is fixing breakfast.  Chaos.  Toasters, griddle cakes,
pop up tarts.  Bubbling coffee pot.  Whirring milkshake
blender.  Vegamatic.  Darcy is watching "Easy Street" on
television.  Melvin has his eye on it.


93	ON THE TV

			WALLY 
	And here we go with the Gateway to 
	Easy Street!

A lady dressed like a phonograph record can't decide which
gate to choose.


94	ON MELVIN AND DARCY 

			DARCY
	Gate number 2.

			MELVIN
	Gate number 1.

The lady chooses door number one -- she wins.  Melvin's face
lights up.

			WALLY 
	And you've entered it, madam, the
	Golden Gate!  Inside....

The gate swings open.

			WALLY 
	A brand new camera and! -- a trip 
	to Hawaii on United Airlines --
	United, the <u>friendly</u> airline ---

			MELVIN 
	I told you!  I told you!

Melvin claps his hands with delight.

			DARCY
	Geez --

			MELVIN 
	Whatsa matter?

			DARCY
	I'm jealous, Daddy.

			MELVIN 
	Aw no, honey, it's a wonderful 
	thing -- lookit that -- Hawaii --
	the friendly skies -- look! --
	look how happy she is! -- aw
	gee, she's embarrassed -- Wally
	kissed her ---

The telephone rings.

Darcy turns the television set off, tumbles outside and
climbs on her bike.  Past the windows of the trailer, riding
lazily in the dusty twilight, past dogs, past a kid on a
wagon, past a basket of laundry.

Melvin picks up the phone.   Darcy keeps riding around the
trailer.

			MELVIN
	Hullo?

			LYNDA
		Hello, Melvin?

				MELVIN
	Hey, Lynda.  How's it going? 

			LYNDA
	How's what going?

			MELVIN 
	I dunno, whatever you got going.

			LYNDA
	Could Darcy come down and see me?

			MELVIN 
	You pregnant?

			LYNDA
	What do you mean, am I pregnant?! 
	What do you say a thing like that
	for?!!

			MELVIN
	I dunno.  You sound pregnant.  For
	what other reason would you ask me 
	to let Darcy go down there and hang 
	around them bars?

			LYNDA
	I don't go to bars, Melvin.

			MELVIN
	And that air in L.A.  All that 
	smog.  All them people.  How preg-
	nant are you?  For your sake, you 
	better hope it's a girl.

			LYNDA 
	What are you talking about, Melvin?

			MELVIN 
	Because if it's a boy and it looks 
	like Clark Halsted, I'm going to
	kill it.

			LYNDA
	I just want to see Darcy.

			MELVIN 
	And then I'm going to kill you. 
		(after a moment) 
	I'd rather have you come up.

			LYNDA
	Where?

			MELVIN 
	Las Vegas.  We'll do it in Las Vegas. 
	I'll marry you there.

			LYNDA
	You just divorced me, Melvin.  What
	do you want to marry me for?

			MELVIN
	I don't want my little girl having
	illegitimate kin.

			LYNDA
	Melvin?

			MELVIN
	Yes, honey?

			LYNDA
	I've been reading this book 'The 
	Magic of Believing.'

			MELVIN
	Yeah, what's that?

			LYNDA
	It's about you.

			MELVIN
		(smiling) 
	Hey.

			LYNDA
	It says you can be anything you 
	want to be if you'll just believe 
	in yourself.  And you believe in
	yourself -- it's just the believing
	hasn't been enough to let you become 
	what you believe you can be.

			MELVIN 
	Rome wasn't built in a day.  We'll 
	keep plugging.

			LYNDA
	I've been thinking, Melvin.  I 
	haven't been good to you.  I
	haven't believed in you like you
	believe in you.

			MELVIN 
	How's insurance sound to you?

			LYNDA 
	Insurance.  Real estate.  Anything
	but bagging at Basic.

			MELVIN 
	Yeah, the ol' paycheck-to-paycheck. 
	Frustratin', when I know I was born
	for something else.

			LYNDA
	You really want to marry me, Melvin?

Mrs. Sisk enters (she's been eavesdropping) and frantically,
silently, signals "No!  Not again!"

			MELVIN
	I heard you was livin' with whores
	over in Reno.

			LYNDA
	I knew you didn't.

			MELVIN 
	But I want you to know I'm not going 
	to hold it against you, however ---

			LYNDA
	Melvin, don't start gettin' around 
	me now ---

			MELVIN 
	Aw, honey, I <u>want</u> to get around you. 
	I been missin' you.  Miss your lovin' ---

He starts to sing over the telephone.

	first time?   We've had a lot of 
	repeaters -- repeaters are our 
	favorite folks.

			MELVIN
	No, ma'am.

			OWNER 
		(to Lynda) 
	Would you like a veil?

Lynda looks over at Melvin.

			MELVIN
	How much is a veil?

			OWNER 
	Four dollars.

Lynda motioning "don't."

			MELVIN
	We'll take a veil.

Owner hands Lynda a pink veil.

			LYNDA
	Ya got a blue one?  To go with
	my suit?

			OWNER 
	I've got white.   The second time 
	around the girls like a color.

			MELVIN
	We'll take white.

			OWNER 
	Now, on the music ---

			MELVIN
	What have you got?

			OWNER 
	We have Inspirational, 'Because,' 
	we have Hawaiian, the 'War Chant,' 
	we have ---

	LYNDA                        MELVIN
'Because.'                 'Hawaiian War Chant.'

They look at each other.

			LYNDA
	'Hawaiian War Chant.'

			OWNER 
	Very good.  That's five dollars on 
	the veil, five dollars on the music, 
	fifteen dollars for the ceremony, 
	four dollars for the license, ten 
	dollars for the witnesses -- thirty-
	nine dollars all together.

Melvin reaches in his pocket, pulls out all his money.

			OWNER 
	Thirty-nine out of forty.  Thank
	you.

She hands Melvin a dollar back.

			MELVIN
	That don't leave us much for break-
	fast.  I wasn't counting on the
	witnesses.

The Owner indicates a terribly decrepit old couple, waiting 
in an ante-room in two chairs, wearing their Sunday best.

			OWNER 
	Well, they've got to make a living,
	too.

Darcy tugs on the Owner's arm who is pressing button behind 
her desk.

			DARCY
	A bag of rice, please.

			OWNER 
	Well aren't you sweet, honey?

She hands Darcy a bag of rice and collects fifty cents.

The Hawaiian War Chant starts.  The lights lower.  A Justice
of the Peace materializes behind the pulpit.  And Lynda and
Melvin, with Darcy behind then, move stately down the aisle.


100	PULPIT - JUSTICE OF THE PEACE

			JP 
	'Til death do us part.'

			MELVIN 
	'Til death do us part.'

			JP 
	Lynda and Melvin, I now pronounce 
	you man and wife.

Melvin and Lynda kiss.

			LYNDA
	This is it, Melvin.

He hugs her tight.

			MELVIN 
	Ooh, you got a fat belly, woman.

The witnesses come forward.  The old Lady kisses Melvin and
the old man busses Lynda -- a long long time.  They all start
up back the aisle -- Darcy is throwing rice.

The old man falters.  The wedding party stops.

			OLD LADY 
	What's the matter, George? 
		(to Lynda and Melvin) 
	He gets weak in the heat -- I better 
	take him home.

They turn to go, the Owner pays them off at the desk and they 
leave.

			OWNER 
	Now what am I going to do?  I got 
	three couples coming in at eleven ---


101 	MONTAGE - MELVIN, LYNDA AND DARCY

Outside, Melvin and Lynda saying good-bye to Little Red; 
inside, witnessing a dozen marriages.  Kissing their opposites. 
Darcy scattering bags of rice.  Melvin enjoying immensely.


102	EXT. SILVER BELL CHAPEL - THAT NIGHT

Melvin is drying himself with a towel, Lynda has loosened her 
suit and her stomach hangs over pants, Darcy asleep in the 
car.

	each -- 120 dollars --

Melvin walking to the Cashier's window, pushes a stack of 
bills through the cage.

			MELVIN
	That's 225, Bonnie.

She counts it.

			BONNIE 
	225 is right.

			MELVIN 
	I tell you I'm going to win that 
	color TV.  I'm going to be Milkman 
	of the Month.

			BONNIE 
	Well, you're in the lead, Melvin. 
		(smiles) 
	And you want to know something?
	I'm rooting for you.

She blushes.

			MELVIN 
	You married, Bonnie?

But Bonnie doesn't answer, folds up the money, starts to turn 
back to her desk.

			BONNIE 
	Hey -- almost forgot -- Bill wants
	to see you.


112-A	INT. BILL'S OFFICE - DAIRY - DAY - MELVIN

Walks down the hall, enters an inner office.  A sign
"JIM DELGADO, Assistant Manager."

			JIM 
	Listen, Melvin, I just want to tell
	you, you been doin' real good!

			MELVIN 
	Why, thank you.

			JIM 
	Only thing is -- you know that 
	engine that blowed up your first 
	week -- I talked to Mr. Rockwood 
	-- there's just no way we can see 
	to doing anything but deducting it ---

			MELVIN 
	Now, wait a minute ---

			JIM 
	We'll take it real slow, just a 
	few dollars a week ---

			MELVIN 
	That wasn't my fault -- you give 
	me that old junker -- the motor 
	was shot.

			JIM 
	You signed the note, Melvin ---

			MELVIN 
	Didn't you know I was in the lead 
	for the Zenith 197K with the tri-
	focus picture tube?

			JIM 
	What can I tell you, Melvin?  We 
	figure Driver of the Month on net 
	-- and with your deductions coming 
	up ---

He shrugs.  Suddenly, Melvin reaches across and grabs him by
the shirt.

			MELVIN 
	Listen, you sonofabitch, that color 
	TV is mine!  That's for me!  My 
	wife and my little girl!  Deduct 
	whatever the hell you want, but 
	you know it and I know it -- I am 
	the goddamn Driver of the Month!

Bill is choking.

			JIM 
	Let go, Melvin.

Melvin doesn't let go.

			JIM 
	Let go, or don't come back tomorrow.

Melvin releases him.

			MELVIN
	What do you say?

			JIM 
	You're a good driver, Melvin ---

			MELVIN
	Driver of the Month!  Twenty new
	damn accounts!

			JIM 
	I'm sorry about the engine, Melvin 
	but it's your responsibility ---

			MELVIN
	Am I or am I not?!

Jim waits.

			JIM 
	You'll pay for the engines?

			MELVIN 
	I asked you, you bastard, am I
	Driver of the Month?!

			JIM 
	You are.

			MELVIN 
	And do I get the color TV?

After a moment.

			JIM 
	Okay.

Melvin nods.

			MELVIN 
	Deduct your goddam engine.

114	CLOSEUP - MELVIN

registers nothing.


115	INT. LYNDA'S ROOM - DAY - LYNDA

Waiting, looking up at the ceiling.  Melvin enters.  There is 
a long silence.  Two other women lie quietly in their beds.

			LYNDA
	I'm sorry, Melvin.

			MELVIN 
	He's got them beady eyes and that 
	slack tongue.  Looks just like 
	Clark Taylor.

			LYNDA
	He could be yours, Melvin.

			MELVIN
	Mine!

			LYNDA
	You remember the morning the car
	was repossessed?

			MELVIN 
	You mean the morning you woke me 
	up to say good-bye?

Silence.

			LYNDA
	I am sorry, Melvin.  I prayed.  I
	prayed for a little girl.

Lynda doesn't move.

			MELVIN 
	Jee-zus!

He strides into the bathroom.  The sound of him urinating. 

Two nurses appear.  One has a stack of photographs.

			NURSE BURNS
	Hello, everybody!  What we have here
	is a few pictures taken at delivery 
	-- Miss Crockett and I work together 
	-- she photographs -- I process.

			MELVIN 
		(returning) 
	I'll bet you do.  You married,
	Miss Crockett?

			NURSE BURNS
	I'm Miss Burns.  My partner's
	Miss Crockett.

			MELVIN 
	How do you do, Miss Crockett.

			LYNDA
	No thank you, Miss Burns.

			MELVIN
	How much?

			NURSE CROCKETT
	A hundred and twenty dollars for 
	five beautiful color prints.

			LYNDA
	A hundred and twenty dollars!  You 
	got some racket!  Git outa here!

			MELVIN 
	Wait a minute -- let me see 'em.

Miss Burns shows him the pictures.   Melvin giggles -- then he
giggles some more.  Miss Crockett exits the room.

			MELVIN 
	Belly button looks like a corkscrew.

			LYNDA
	Tell her to go away, Melvin.

Melvin looks some more.

			MELVIN
	How much you gettin' for 'em?  A
	hundred and twenty?

Nurse Burns clears her throat.  Melvin looks at her nameplate 
heaving on her breast.

			MELVIN 
	Did I ask if you was married, 
	Miss Burns?

			LYNDA
	Melvin!

			MELVIN 
	We'll take 'em.  I'll give you the 
	cash tomorrow.

He snatches the pictures, grabs a pen from her breast pocket, 
scribbles something on the clipboard.

			MELVIN 
	And my boy's name is Faron Dummar.

Hands her the clipboard.

			MISS BURNS
	What a good name.

			MELVIN
	He's a good boy.

Lynda smiles. Miss Burns goes.

			LYNDA
	Melvin?

			MELVIN
	Yes, Lynda? 

			LYNDA
	How's Darcy?

			MELVIN
	She's waiting downstairs.  They 
	won't let her come up.

			LYNDA
	Why not?

			MELVIN
	Hospital rules.

But the first nurse, Miss Crockett, reappears with Faron.

			NURSE CROCKETT
	Dairy-time!

			MELVIN
	Gimme that baby and forget them 
	jokes!

He snatches Faron, carries him gingerly over to Lynda, lays 
him beside her.  She uncovers a breast.

Melvin watches tensely.  The two nurses leave the room.

Now Melvin seems to relax.  He starts to hum, he begins to
sing a lullaby of his own making.

Everything peaceful.  Darcy appears secretively at the door. 
He motions her to come in.  He is still singing as Darcy 
climbs on his lap to watch her mother nurse.


116	EXT. CHURCH OF THE LATTER DAY SAINTS - ANAHEIM - NIGHT

God."

	'On earth is not his equal.' 
		(speaks) 
	That's it for tonight, folks. 
	See you on Sunday.

The group breaks up.  Bonnie heads straight for Melvin,
bumping into him accidentally.  They walk to the parking
lot together.


119-A	EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - NIGHT

			BONNIE 
	You have a lovely baritone, Melvin.

			MELVIN
	Why thank you, Bonnie.

			BONNIE 
	Everybody thinks so, we're so 
	pleased you joined us.

			MELVIN 
	I dunno, I felt like getting back 
	to the church.  I tried them all 
	when I was a kid, Nazarene, Four 
	Square Gospel, Church of Christ, 
	but Latter Day Saints -- I was 
	born Mormon, you know -- only 
	one ever made me happy.

			BONNIE
	Are you happy now?

			MELVIN 
	Can't seem to get ahead, Bonnie. 
	The job 'n everything, <u>you</u> 
	know -- bought too much car, I
	guess.  Can't stand living under
	the same roof with my mother-in-
	law and not paying the mortgage 
	-- baby clothes, baby furniture --

			BONNIE 
	The Church will help you.

			MELVIN 
	I know, Bonnie.  Mormons are kind. 
	You got that Mormon aura, Bonnie.

They arrive at Melvin's truck.

			MELVIN 
	Well, we'll just keep pluggin'

			BONNIE 
		(radiant) 
	What a beautiful attitude, Melvin.


120	INT. LYNDA'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - MORNING

Melvin staggers in wearing his work clothes. The TV is 
switched to "Easy Street."  Mrs. Sisk bustles around.  Baby 
Faron is crying, Darcy is holding him, Lynda sips a drink. 
A neighbor can be seen outside mowing his lawn.

			MELVIN 
	What are you doing?

			LYNDA
	Just a little brandy.  They 
	repossessed the car today.

Melvin shrugs.

			MELVIN 
	It's okay.

			LYNDA
	Sure.

Faron starts to scream. Lynda takes him from Darcy, puts
him on the breast.

Melvin takes off his shirt.

			MELVIN 
	Whaddya got for supper?

			LYNDA
	Bell peppers.

			MELVIN 
	I hate bell peppers.

			LYNDA
	I got bell peppers. How was God
	tonight?

			DARCY
	Ssh! -- it's the Gateway to 'Easy
	Street!'

Melvin's face lights up, looks at the screen.

	and ---

Suddenly, Melvin jumps out of his chair.


121-A	HOLLYWOOD - TVC STUDIOS - DAY

Melvin and Lynda run through the main gate to TVC Studios, 
late.  They rush towards the rear entrance of a sound stage,
following the signs pointing to "Easy Street:"

			LYNDA
		(running) 
	I'll never do it.

			MELVIN 
		(pulling her along)
	You'll do it.  I got confidence in
	you.  Now remember, once you're at 
	the Gateway, keep on betting <u>up</u>. 
	Settle for <u>nothing</u>.

They enter the stage door and find themselves:

123	INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY

Passing ballerinas, comics, rope dancers, torch singers, 
jugglers, jews harp players putting last minute touches on 
their act, signing releases.

	we could do with a few hundred 
	dollars.

			MELVIN
	Try a few thousand?!  Try them on 
	for size!  We'll be flying to
	Hawaii with cash besides!  Be bold,

Lynda looks at the Gateway, then at the money in Wally's hand.


125	MELVIN - IN THE AUDIENCE

trying valiantly to get Lynda's attention.  Nodding his head
like a marionette.  The audience yelling "No!  No!"

	And with that new piano, you're

			LYNDA
	If we're very, very careful ---

			DARCY

			LYNDA
	I think so.

pulls a boat cradle.  On it rests a twenty-five-foot outboard.


137	EXT. HOUSE - DAY - LYNDA 

dazed by the sight of Melvin's possessions, staggers outside
with Faron in her arms.

Over the fence, the neighbors are having a barbecue.  The 
mother is taking pictures.

			MELVIN 
	Hey, Ortiz!  Give us a picture!

Mrs. Ortiz swings her camera around.  Melvin poses proudly by 
the boat and the new car.  Darcy and Lynda and Faron creep out 
to explore them.

Now Lynda straightens up.

			LYNDA 
		(suddenly)
	Take 'em back, Melvin!

			MELVIN 
	I can't, I'd lose my down payment.

Melvin, with great proprietariness, slaps the fender of the
Cadillac.

			MELVIN 
	We got a lotta horses here, honey.


138	EXT. BACKYARD - DAY - MELVIN

is at the tiller of his boat.  He wears a duck-billed cap,

	Come in Long Beach, come in...come 
	in Long Beach Coast Guard, this is 
	Country Roads ---

He looks up as the back door of the house opens, Lynda is
holding a suitcase in one hand, Faron in the other.  A taxi
appears at the end of the driveway.

			MELVIN 
	Where you goin'?

			LYNDA
	I'm leaving you, Melvin.

			MELVIN 
	You can't leave me ---

			LYNDA
	Oh yes I can ---

			MELVIN 
	You leave me now, I'm never takin' 
	you back, Lynda.

			LYNDA
	I'm never coming back.  And remember,
	half of the house is mine.  I spoke
	to the real estate man ---

			MELVIN 
	It was me got you on the show.

			LYNDA
	It was me won the money -- I get
	half.

			MELVIN 
	You're gettin' nuthin'!

			LYNDA 
	Melvin, you're an asshole ---

			MELVIN 
	Don't call me no asshole ---

			LYNDA
	Then what are you?!  The first 
	time we have a prayer of getting 
	ahead, you go out and buy a big 
	fancy car, a big, fancy boat ---

			MELVIN 
	You can't take it easy on 'Easy 
	Street.' 

			LYNDA 
	Huh?

Melvin turns to Darcy.

			MELVIN 
		(to Darcy) 
	You like this boat, Darcy?

			DARCY 
	I do, Daddy.

			MELVIN 
	You like that car?

			DARCY
	I love it, Daddy.

			LYNDA
	Cut it out, Melvin ---

			MELVIN 
	I seen cars like that boil by on 
	the way from Reno to Vegas when I
	was a little kid.  I'd be cleanin'
	out the goddam tar heater while my
	father was layin' road for them to
	drive by on, and now I've got one!

			LYNDA
	You got me cryin', Melvin.

			MELVIN 
	Don't make fun, Lynda.

			LYNDA
	We're poor, Melvin -- poor!

			MELVIN 
	Lynda, we're on Easy Street.

			LYNDA
	I'm on Easy Street!  I won!

Melvin climbs down from the boat.  There is a terrible silence. 
It seems for the moment as if he might hit her.  But he can't.

			MELVIN 
	Lynda -- don't go ---

She puts Faron down, turns back to him.

			LYNDA
	Melvin, you are an asshole -- but 
	I love you.

			MELVIN 
	Now wait a minute ---

			LYNDA
	Aw, c'est la vie.

			MELVIN
	What does that mean?

			LYNDA
	It's French.  I used to dream I'd 
	be a French interpreter.

			MELVIN 
	You don't speak French ---

			LYNDA
	I told you it was a dream.

She goes.  Melvin watches emptily as Lynda climbs into the
taxi with Faron.  Darcy comes running out of the house.

			DARCY
	G'bye, Daddy.  Will I see you?

			MELVIN 
	You'll see me, honey.

Darcy chases out front and the taxi disappears with Darcy 
waving to Melvin through the rear window.

Melvin rushing up with his delivery. From out of the dark-
ness ---

			MRS. WORTH
	Is that you, Melvin?

Melvin stops.

			MELVIN 
	Yes, ma'am.

She appears at the doorway in her bathrobe.

			MRS. WORTH
	I thought it was you.

			MELVIN 
	Yes, ma'am, two quarts of Hy-line, 
	a Garden Cottage and 25-pound 
	laundry compound.

			MRS. WORTH
	Sounds right, Melvin.  Wouldn't you
	like a nice hot cup of coffee.

			MELVIN
	Oh I dunno, ma'am -- I got my whole
	route ahead of me.

			MRS. WORTH
	It's cold out, Melvin -- don't you 
	want a cup of coffee?

Melvin looks back at his truck.

			MRS. WORTH
	A nice-hot-cup-of-coffee.

Melvin takes a deep breath.

			MELVIN 
	Well, don't mind if I do, Mrs. Worth.

			MRS. WORTH
	Melva. 

			MELVIN 
	Melva.


139-E	MELVIN

He brings her order inside.

			MRS. WORTH
	Mel<u>va</u> -- Mel<u>vin</u> -- get it?

Melvin smiles.

			MELVIN
	Yes, ma'am, I do.

She turns around.

			MELVIN
	I mean Melva.

She pours some coffee, sets it on the kitchen table.

			MRS. WORTH
	Cream?

			MELVIN
	Yes, ma'am.

			MRS. WORTH
	Sugar?

He looks at her, her parted bathrobe.

			MELVIN
	Four.

She scoops them in.  They sit down.

They drink in silence, Mrs. Worth watching Melvin.

			MRS. WORTH 
	Why don't we take our coffee in-
	side?  Where it's warmer.  Would 
	that suit you, Melvin?

			MELVIN 
	Suits me fine.


139-F	MRS. WORTH

leads the way into a May Company living room.  They sit.

			MELVIN
		(brightly)
	Where's Mr. Worth today?

			MRS. WORTH 
	He's working graveyard.  He won't
	be home for an hour.

			MELVIN 
	A tough shift, graveyard.

			MRS. WORTH 
	He doesn't have any choice.  Neither 
	do I.  If you know what I mean, 
	Melvin.

			MELVIN
	Yes, ma'am, I do.

			MRS. WORTH 
	Makes for a long night.

			MELVIN 
	You bet.

			MRS. WORTH 
	I thought you'd never come, Melvin. 
	I lay in bed waiting all night. 
	Then finally -- you came.

			MELVIN
	Yes, I did.

Melvin smiles.

			MELVIN 
	You got any more coffee there, Melva?

			MRS. WORTH 
	Do you want any more coffee, Melvin?

			MELVIN 
	No, Melva, I don't.

			MRS. WORTH 
	So what do you say, Melvin?

			MELVIN 
	You know what I say, Melva?

			MRS. WORTH
	What?

			MELVIN
	Let's get to it.

Mrs. Worth takes off her robe.  They sink to the living room 
floor.

hustling into a house with an order.  Hustling out.


140	EXT. ROCKWOOD DAIRY - LOCKERS - DAY

Christmas lights strung around the lockers.  Melvin unloading 
full cases of milk, tamping ice around them.

His movements are slower now, the enthusiasm is gone.  Some 
ice won't chop for him.  He leaves it in a block on top of 
the milk.  It perches precariously.


141	INT. ROCKWOOD DAIRY - JIM DELGADO'S OFFICE - A CHRISTMAS TREE 

on Jim's desk.  Melvin looking through it at Jim.

			JIM 
	After 'Easy Street,' you paid us 
	a thousand dollars.  Rather, your
	wife did.  You still owed us twenty-
	four hundred. That's back to thirty-
	four now --

			MELVIN
	No kiddin'?

			JIM 
	I've got a note here for 3500 dollars 
	-- plus another note for 2500 -- the 
	balance you owe us on the truck --

			MELVIN 
	I told you about that truck!

			JIM 
	On your uniforms, 250 dollars --
	we'll take that out of next week's
	earnings -- a total of six thousand 
	and fifty dollars -- Sign where the 
	x's are ---

He passes some papers over to Melvin.  Melvin reads them
quietly. Bonnie enters and delivers some paperwork to Jim.

			MELVIN 
	You got me paying a hundred and
	ninety-five dollars a week interest
	-- for God's sake -- I'll never 
	catch up ---

			JIM 
	It's up to you, Melvin.

Melvin blinks.

			MELVIN 
	I got to get me another job.

			JIM
	Wherever you go, you'll be working 
	for us.

Melvin bends his head over the paper.

			JIM
	Did you sell your boat?

			MELVIN 
	I sold it.

			JIM
	What about the Cadillac?

			MELVIN 
	They took it.

			JIM
	That's right they did, didn't they? 
	Well you just got to hustle a little
	more, kid ---

Bill looks up at the route map behind him.

			JIM 
	We got Ralph over here in Artesia --
	he could use a little help ---

			MELVIN 
	My God, that's clear across the 
	county -- I can't make it, Bill, 
	the milk gets warm --

			JIM 
	Get up a little earlier.

			MELVIN
	I'm up at 2 now --

			JIM 
		(shakes his head
		sincerely)
	Tough.

			MELVIN
	I used to collect in the afternoon. 
	I don't even have time to get my
	money out of my customers.  You got
	me running in circles ---

			JIM 
	Planning's the name of the game. 
	You got to organize your time, 
	Melvin.

Bill waits.  Now he holds out his hand, Melvin signs the
papers which are well-crumpled.  Hands them over.

			MELVIN
		(sags, tries 
		to brighten) 
	'We'll keep plugging.'


142	LA HABRA - TIKI RESTAURANT

A Polynesian place, strobe-lite and palms and grass skirts.
Christmas trees, a Christmas party.

Familiar faces from The Rockwood Dairy dancing up a storm, 
the music loud.

Melvin gets up, goes to a pay telephone.  Dials, drops coins.

			MELVIN
	Lynda?

			LYNDA 
	Hello, Melvin.

			MELVIN
	How're you doin'?

Lynda is back home in Anaheim with Mother, Darcy is there and 
so is the dog "Tramp."

			LYNDA 
	I'm doing okay. What do you want,
	Melvin.

			MELVIN
	I was calling about Christmas.

			LYNDA
	Oh yeah, Christmas.

			MELVIN
	What does Darcy want?

			LYNDA
	I'm getting her a Barbi. You can
	get her Ken.

Silence.

			MELVIN
	How about Faron? I was thinking
	about an airgun.

			LYNDA
	Faron's nine months old, Melvin.

Silence.

			MELVIN
	Lynda?

			LYNDA
	Yeah?

			MELVIN
	You still there?

			LYNDA
	I'm still here.

Silence.  Jim Delgado approaches, waits impatiently as 
Melvin resumes his conversation.

			LYNDA
	Melvin, tell you what -- you buy 
	Darcy what you wanna buy her --
	and I'll buy her what I wanna buy 
	her -- okay?

			MELVIN
	I was hoping you'd say that.

			LYNDA
	Good-bye, Melvin.

			MELVIN
	Good-bye, Lynda.

Melvin hangs up slowly, turns to Jim.

			JIM 
	You said you were a big Country 
	and Western singer -- we built our 
	entertainment around you -- Are you 
	going to or aren't you, Melvin?

			MELVIN
	I'm sorry, Jim, I don't feel like
	singing tonight.

			JIM
	I knew you'd crap out.

			MELVIN 
	Now wait a minute ---

			JIM
	Never mind, Ralph will whistle 
	through his belly button.

Jim walks off. 


143	OMITTED 


144	ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN 

seated in a corner by himself. One of the drivers comes over,
Ralph.

			RALPH
	Gee, Mel, we heard you wasn't going 
	to sing ---

			MELVIN 
	New Year's maybe ---

			RALPH
	I told my wife you sang Country. 
	She's crazy for Country.

			MELVIN 
	I'm real sorry, Ralph.  And tell 
	your wife I'm sorry too, will you?

Another old-timer comes by, George, a veteran of the driver's
locker room.

			GEORGE 
	Delgado was saying how you was 
	yellow ---

			MELVIN 
	Did he?

			GEORGE 
	I said if Melvin don't want to sing, 
	that's his right.

			MELVIN
	What'd he say?

			GEORGE 
	It's not what he says, Melvin.
	It's what he don't say, y'know
	what I mean?

There is a sudden fanfare from the band.


145	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE STAGE

Jim Delgado at the microphone.

			JIM
	Ol' Melvin Dummar promised us a 
	song tonight -- but I'm afraid --
	or am I thrilled? -- he's chickened 
	out.

Melvin stands up.

			MELVIN
	Who says?! I got a song!  I got a
	song right here!

Applause and cheers as Melvin makes his way to the stage.

			JIM
	I guess I had it wrong -- take it, 
	Melvin.

Melvin moves out in front of the band.

			MELVIN 
	These Japs here probably don't 
	know 'Six Days On the Road.'
		(turns to
		the band) 
	You know 'Six Days On the Road?'

They shake their heads.

			MELVIN 
	Well this song I written is sung
	to 'Six Days On the Road.'  And
	now I'm going to sing it.

He grabs a guitar from a startled Polynesian musician.

			MELVIN 
		(sings) 
	Well I pulled out of Rockwood
	Headed down the Santa Ana Freeway
	I got my Divco wound up and 
	I guess it's running okay.

	Well I know it's the middle of the night
	But heck that's all right 
	'Cause I'm a milkman for Rockwood, 
	So everything's okay.

	Well my truck's kind of old 
	And man it's awful slow 
	The temperature is hot and the oil 
		pressure is low 
	If I make it to my route tonight 
	Everything will be all right 
	Ten hours on the road -- I just hope I 
	Make it home by tonight.


146	ON THE AUDIENCE

They are getting with it, starting to clap in rhythm.


147	ON MELVIN 

He looks toward Jim.

			MELVIN
		(singing) 
	I know Jim Delgado will be checking 
		my books today 
	'Cause a big milk bill he said I 
		have to pay 
	But that don't bother me tonight 
	'Cause I can dodge ol' Jim all right 
	Twelve hours on the road I just hope 
		I make it home today. 

	Well it seems like the price of milk 
		gets higher every day -- 
	But us poor milkmen don't get no 
		raise in pay ---

The guys boo along with their wives.  Jim doesn't smile. 
Melvin smiles down at his friends, looks to them as he sings. 
The crowd is really with him.

Melvin spots Bonnie down in the audience.  She is smiling up 
at him worshipfully.  He sings to her now.

			MELVIN
		(singing) 
	Well it seems like a week since I 
		left my house last night 
	You know I could have a lot of 
		women but somehow it don't seem right 
	Yeah I could find some to hold me tight 
		but I'd never make my deliveries all right 
	Fourteen hours on the road man I hope 
	I make it home today.

The place is absolutely quiet now, the people all on his side. 
Melvin sees Jim Delgado leave. He points at him.

Melvin takes it real slow for a finish.

			MELVIN 
		(singing) 
	Now I work like a dog trying to
		collect my pay
	But all my customers say -- can't 
		you come back some other day 
	Boy I just know that there's an
		easier way
	Twenty hours on the road I just know 
		I'm going to make it home today.

Dead silence, then applause and cheering erupts.  Melvin is 
shy on the stage, his friends, Pete and Ralph and George rush
over to him, lift him off the stage, the band strikes up --
Bonnie rushes to Melvin.

She throws her arms around him.

			MELVIN 
		(all embarrassed) 
	Hey, that was nice.  You married, 
	Bonnie?

Bonnie steps away from Melvin, looks him in the eye.

			BONNIE
	No I'm not, Melvin Dummar.  And
	neither are you any more.

Melvin waits.

			BONNIE
	So what do you say?

			MELVIN 
		(shrugs) 
	Gee, I don't know, Bonnie.

			BONNIE
	I'll take care of you, Melvin --
	til you get on your feet. I got my
	kid's child support money saved up ---

			MELVIN 
	You got kids, Bonnie --- ?

			BONNIE
	I got two kids ---

			MELVIN 
	Oh my Lord ---

			BONNIE
	Listen, Melvin, I got a cousin up 
	in Utah -- lost his lease on a gas
	station -- we run it right we get 
	a thousand a month clear -- I've 
	been waiting for this moment -- and 
	the moment is now -- so what do you 
	say?!

Melvin hesitates.

			BONNIE
	Or don't you come swinging your 
	dick around the cashier's office 
	no more!

			MELVIN 
	Bonnie?  A Mormon girl -- swearing?!

			BONNIE
	Bet your ass!

Melvin looks over at Jim Delgado who is dancing with a 
Japanese hostess.  Melvin shakes his head.

			MELVIN 
	When do we leave?

			BONNIE
	Tonight.


148	EXT. SERVICE STATION - WILLARD, UTAH - DAY

Melvin's milk truck rolls in with a U-Haul behind it.  The 
U-Haul is jammed with bedding, Melvin's "Easy Street" 
furniture, the Kimball French Provincial piano, a goat, a
lamb, and some rabbits.  Bonnie tumbles out with her two tow-
headed kids.

Melvin leads the goat out, ties it to one of the gas pumps. 
He looks around, exhilarated by the new surroundings, the 
sense of a fresh start.


149	EXT. GAS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON 

Melvin hustling around the pumps, handling two cars at once,
flipping hoods, washing windows, collecting cash.  Terry and
Bonnie help out.

			DRIVER 
		(smiling) 
	You're goin' to get a coronary running 
	around like that.

			MELVIN
	Better than starving to death!

He grabs the man's cash, locks up the pumps now.  The man 
drives off and Melvin trudges up to the house behind the 
station.


150 	INT. MELVIN'S HOUSE - DAY

A pathetic place, the "Easy Street" furniture squeezed
in on top of the Kimball piano.  A television set drones away.

The telephone rings.  Melvin and Bonnie look at each other. 
Bonnie grabs the phone.

			BONNIE 
		(on phone) 
	I'm sorry, Mr. LaMar, Mr. Dummar 
	is in Salt Lake today.  Yessir, 
	yessir, I understand -- yes, I'll 
	give him the message.

She hangs up.

			BONNIE 
	He's not going to make the gasoline 
	delivery next week -- unless he has 
	a check.

			MELVIN
	Well, we'll give him a check.

			BONNIE 
	What check?

			MELVIN
	Well, I can't pump gas unless I 
	give 'em a check, can I, honey?

			BONNIE 
	But our check's no good, Melvin.

			MELVIN
	Easter weekend.  Oughta pump a
	thousand gallons.  Give 'em a check 
	tomorrow, we'll have it covered by 
	Monday.

Melvin sniffs.

	Chicken?

All earnestness, his ready smile.

	Nowadays they want brown ones or 
	thin ones or long ones, lo-tar, 
	no-tax -- lemme see --

Ventura hands him a dollar.  Melvin goes to make change.

			VENTURA
	Say, if I was heading down to Las

			MELVIN 
	Catch Interstate 15, take her

Melvin hands him the change, sits back down to his books. 
Terry can be seen outside.

	Sure, you could do that ---

Stays with his book.

			MELVIN
	Gee, it's nice to meet you again,
	Fred -- I haven't seen you since I
	met you at your mom's wedding --
	When was that, two years ago?

			FRED
	First thing, Melvin, is a press
	conference ---

			MELVIN
	No press conference, Fred, please.


192	EXT. MELVIN'S GAS STATION - DAY

The next day. On the hill behind Melvin's gas station is a
sea of reporters and TV cameras.   Fred Smith is lecturing them.
Melvin's family is there along with Roger Dutson.

			FRED
	There'll be no litigation questions 
	-- questions only on the basis of 
	the will -- no litigation questions ---

standing on the summit of the hill. Melvin in his best cowboy
roses shirt.

			REPORTER
	Mr. Dummar, the relatives of
	Howard Hughes claim this will is
	a forgery

Fred Smith puts his hand over the lens of the Reporter's 
camera.

A scuffle, then Fred pulls the second plug.  A suspicious man
is noticeable among the onlookers.


194 	ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE

			MELVIN 
	He was just an ol' wino -- asked me 
	for some money -- I give him a 
	quarter -- I told him I once applied 
	for a job at Hughes Aircraft -- He 
	told me he owned Hughes Aircraft ---


195	ANOTHER ANGLE  

			REPORTER
	Melvin, did you ever believe a 
	dream like this could come true?

			MELVIN 
	In the dream, there's no hassle.

Later -- a TV screen.

			JIM DELGADO 
	He may be getting 156 million
	dollars -- I'd just like to see the 
	4500 that he owes our dairy -- of 
	course, I wish him good luck and 
	everything.'


200	EXT. MELVIN'S GAS STATION - DAY

Vans pulling away, cars pulling away, reporters vanishing.

Melvin pumping gas again, comes around to collect money from 
a Driver.  He's the same suspicious individual seen earlier 
in the crowd.

			MELVIN 
	That'll be four-fifty.

The door opens slightly.  The Driver pulls a gun.

			DRIVER
	You remember me, Melvin?  I was
	with you.  We were all together.
	You and me and Howard.  But it was 
	<u>me</u> that give him the quarter!

Melvin slams the door on the Driver's arm, the gun fires and 
shatters the car window, Melvin wrestles the Driver from the 
car, pinning him to the ground. Terry and Bonnie jump into 
the scuffle.


201	ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN 

watching as the Box Elder Sheriff's car drives away with the 
Driver, handcuffed in back.


202	AT HOME - MELVIN AND BONNIE 

A stack of mail, Bonnie is reading to Melvin, Melvin is watch-
ing "Gunsmoke."

			BONNIE 
		(reading) 
	'...Some of the money will pay for 
	me to help my parents, some pay
	debts --- '

			MELVIN 
	Let's go on to the next.

			BONNIE 
	'Dear Mr. Dummar -- I have my own 
	wealth so I do not want a thing --- '

			MELVIN 
	Haven't we heard that one?

			BONNIE
	'Dear Mr. Dummar --- '

			MELVIN 
	Skip to the end, okay?

			BONNIE
	'P.S.  Do not give away the money
	until you have settled all your
	tax obligations to Uncle Sam.  Re-
	member Joe Louis.'

Melvin yawns.

			MELVIN 
	I think that's enough for tonight, 
	Bonnie.

He gets up.

			BONNIE
	Where you going?

			MELVIN 
	To bed.

			BONNIE 
	You're going to bed so early?

			MELVIN 
	I'm opening at six tomorrow.

			BONNIE 
	At six?

			MELVIN 
	I was talking to this guy from the 
	highway department -- he said they 
	may jog the new freeway by here --
	Labor Day, we'll never see another 
	car ---

			BONNIE 
	By Labor Day, you'll be a million-
	aire.

Melvin smiles.

			MELVIN 
	Turn out the lights when you go to 
	bed, will you, honey?


203	EXT. RESIDENTIAL AREA - CALIFORNIA - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING
SHOT

Lynda and her new husband Bob's house.  The lights are out 
in most houses.


204 	INT. LYNDA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 

Lynda asleep next to her new husband Bob.

The telephone rings with a chime.  Lynda wakes up, picks up
the phone.

			LYNDA
		(into phone)
	Hello?  Who's that?  Is that you,
	Melvin?


205 	INT. MELVIN'S GAS STATION - NIGHT

Melvin is seated in the darkened office of the gas station, 
phone in hand.

			MELVIN
		(into phone)
	Yeah, it's me.

Intercut:

			LYNDA
	God, Melvin, what happened?

			MELVIN
	I dunno.  I guess that old wino
	really was Howard Hughes.

Silence.

			LYNDA
	Are you all right, Melvin?

			MELVIN
	Yeah, I'm all right.  How's Darcy?

			LYNDA
	She's real proud.

Silence.

			MELVIN
	Don't let any of the kids at school 
	make fun or anything.

			LYNDA
	Don't worry, Melvin.  Melvin?

			MELVIN
	Yeah?

			LYNDA
	Melvin, I'm sorry I didn't believe 
	you.

			MELVIN
	Aw, Lynda, that's okay.

			LYNDA
	Melvin?

			MELVIN
	Yeah?

			LYNDA 
	Why did you call me?

			MELVIN 
	I dunno...I better go now.  Good-
	bye, Lynda.

			LYNDA 
	G'bye, Melvin.

Bob, who has not stirred, moves as Lynda hangs up the phone.

			BOB 
		(drowsy)
	What was that?

			LYNDA 
	Nothing....

Bob rolls over.  Lynda lies there staring at the phone.


206	EXT. CLARK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISH


207	INT. CLARK COUNTY COURTROOM - LAS VEGAS - DAY - MELVIN

seated in the modern witness chair.  A spotlight set in a 
cave in the ceiling.  The cave comes down to meet the witness 
chair -- it gives the feeling the witness might be sucked up 
into it.


208	COURTROOM - SPECTATORS

The gallery filled, up front is Melvin's family, sisters,
brothers, mother and father.  On another bench, Lynda with 
Faron and Darcy.  Beside them, Bonnie with her children. 
Other spectators, Lucy from Reno, Little Red, Mrs. Worth, 
Tina from the Cottonwood Ranch and Fred Smith.


209	ON THE BENCH 

Judge Hayes, a short, unhealthy-looking young man.  He bends 
down towards Melvin.

			JUDGE HAYES 
	Melvin, turn your chair around and 
	face me.

Melvin turns his chair around.

			JUDGE HAYES 
	Are you lying, Melvin?

			MELVIN
	No, sir.

			JUDGE HAYES 
	Melvin, I want you to know there is 
	a still, small voice that many 
	people are blessed with that tells 
	them when the truth is being spoken. 
	It has been said, 'What doth it 
	profit a man if he gain the whole
	world yet lose his own soul?'  If
	you are lying, Melvin, which you 
	are, in my opinion, your soul may 
	be in jeopardy, but I am not con-
	cerned about your soul, Melvin, 
	right now I am concerned about your 
	hide, because if I find that you 
	are lying before this Court, I will 
	make it a special duty to have a 
	piece of your hide.  I will direct 
	that the district attorney bring a 
	criminal prosecution against you and 
	I will make it my special project 
	that if you are convicted I will 
	recommend that you do prison time. 
	And I want you to know Nevada State
	Prison is no country club like the
	Gabbs local jail or wherever you 
	have served time.  If you're lying,
	you're going straight to Nevada 
	State Prison.  All right, Melvin?

			MELVIN
	You bet, Your Honor.

			JUDGE HAYES 
	Brother Dummar, I want the truth.
	Where did that will come from?

			MELVIN
	A man brought it to the station.

			JUDGE HAYES 
	You persist in the answers that
	were elicited from you this morning?

			MELVIN
	I do, Your Honor.

			JUDGE HAYES 
	Do you know who wrote the will?

			MELVIN
	I do not know.

			JUDGE HAYES 
	Did you in any way participate in 
	the preparation of that will?

			MELVIN
	No, I did not.

			JUDGE HAYES
	Do you know of anyone else who
	participated in the preparation 
	of that will?

			MELVIN
	No, I don't.

The Judge looks down at the battery of lawyers.  He sighs.

			JUDGE HAYES 
	Gentlemen, I've done my best.


210	CORRIDOR - COURT HOUSE 

Melvin surrounded by his relatives and Bonnie and Lynda and
the children.  Syvella, his sister, holds up a sign "We're 
with you, Melvin!"

The court bell rings, everybody hustles back, Melvin finds 
himself standing for a moment with Lynda and Darcy and Faron.

			LYNDA
	You're doin' good.

			MELVIN
	You think so?

			LYNDA
	Real good.

Lynda hesitates.

			LYNDA
	Bob ---

			MELVIN
	Who's he?

			LYNDA 
	My husband wishes you luck. 

			MELVIN
	Well, you thank him.

The bells rings again.  Melvin picks up Faron.

			MELVIN
		(to Darcy)
	You hold on to Faron, honey.  Give
	your mama a rest.

Darcy takes Faron.

			LYNDA 
	What happens now?

			MELVIN
	I got to face the meanest lawyer 
	in the whole damn world.


211	INT. COURTROOM

Harvey Maxwell, an urbane five-foot seven-inch man from Los
Angeles, is examining Melvin.

			MAXWELL 
	How did you open the envelope?

			MELVIN
	Steamed it open.

			MAXWELL 
	Why didn't you take a knife or a 
	letter opener and open it the way 
	everybody else opens an envelope?

			MELVIN
	I was scared.

			MAXWELL 
	What were you scared of?

			MELVIN
	That it might actually be true.

			MAXWELL 
	Why was that frightening?

			MELVIN
	I don't know.

			MAXWELL 
	Had you ever performed this little
	act before of steaming open an
	envelope?

			MELVIN
	Yes.

			MAXWELL 
	What were the occasions for this 
	activity?

			MELVIN
	Looking at letters that my ex-wife 
	had written to her boyfriend and 
	what have you, before she could
	mail them.


212	LYNDA

She smiles at Melvin reassuringly.  Syvella raises the sign.


213	ON MELVIN AND MAXWELL

			MAXWELL
	Why did you take the will to the 
	church?

			MELVIN 
	Because I was too afraid to take it 
	anywhere else.

			MAXWELL
	Say that again.

Melvin hesitates.

			MELVIN 
	I thought they would help me.

			MAXWELL
	Mr. Dummar, you believe, do you 
	not, that if in the name of God, 
	you lie, God will hear you and 
	you will incur his wrath.  You 
	believe that don't you, Mr. Dummar?

			MELVIN 
	Yes, I do.

Suddenly Maxwell darts across the room, snatches up from the 
counsel desk a weather-beaten Bible.

			MAXWELL
	Mr. Dummar, I have a Bible here. 
	Please stand up.

Melvin stands.

			MAXWELL
	Put your hand on it, raise your 
	right hand.

Melvin raises his hand.

			MAXWELL
	Do you swear before God that this
	story about how that will was left
	to you is the truth?

			MELVIN
	I do.

			MAXWELL
	All right, sit down.

Melvin sits.

			MAXWELL
	That's all for now.  Mr. Frost?

Frost, a Los Angeles lawyer for Hughes' relatives, heads 
straight for Melvin.

			FROST
	Can you give me one reason on earth 
	why this strange man would have left 
	that will with you, Melvin Dummar?

			MELVIN
	No, I don't.  I've been wondering
	that myself.

			FROST
	Did you come up with an answer?

			MELVIN
	No, I haven't.

			FROST
	Melvin, isn't it true you can't 
	come up with an answer because it
	never happened that way?

			MELVIN  
	That is the way it happened.

			FROST
	Well, Melvin, if it meant eternal 
	damnation in hell would you just 
	say it still happened that way?

			MELVIN  
	Yes, I would.

			FROST
	Melvin, you know, don't you, that 
	perhaps other than your relatives,
	there is nobody in this courtroom
	who believes you.  You know that,
	don't you?

			MELVIN 
	I don't know what people believe. 
	And I don't care.  People have
	been calling me an asshole all my
	life.  And it don't matter either
	way.

The courtroom erupts, Judge Hayes slams his gavel. 

Melvin leans back.  Darcy waves.  Melvin waves back.

			FROST 
	Let's go back to when you got the
	will, and everybody celebrated and
	you were a national hero, Melvin. 
	And they asked you about your
	getting over a hundred million
	dollars and I think you sobbed, 
	choked, went into a sort of deep, 
	heavy mood.  I was kind of caught 
	by it as I watched it on TV, but 
	then my wife said, 'My God, it is 
	just like the women on the game
	shows!'  I don't watch the game
	shows myself, but soon after I 
	learned you had gotten your wife
	on one.

Melvin looks at Lynda.  She waves.

			FROST
	Let's go through the Golden Gate
	together, Melvin.  Tell us the real
	truth.  I know the dream is so much 
	better -- My God, I was a child in 
	Minnesota during the Depression and 
	I can remember, kind of hoping one 
	of those trucks going by might have
	a box of chewing gum on it and it 
	would fall off.  That was the dream 
	-- it never happened.  And I never 
	tried to make it happen.

Frost takes a deep breath.

			FROST
	Let's make a deal, Melvin.  Tell 
	us the truth and you know what I'll 
	give you -- I'll plead in your be-
	half a whole day to have the judge 
	give you probation.  But if you don't 
	tell the truth, I'll do my utmost 
	to see you never breathe another 
	free breath in the state of Nevada.

Silence.

			JUDGE HAYES 
	Mr. Dummar, do you wish to make any 
	response to what I would characterize 
	as an offer from Mr. Frost?

			MELVIN 
	I would like to say I don't know if
	the will is a forgery or not.  If
	it is, I didn't do it.  And if it
	isn't --
		(shrugs) 
	I guess it's for real.

			FROST
	That's no deal, Melvin.

			MELVIN 
	I know that. 

			FROST
	And I'm sorry. 

			MELVIN 
	Yes, sir.

Frost stalks back to the counsel table.  He is exhausted. 
Pilbrow, another lawyer, rises unsteadily.  Looks at Melvin.


214	PILBROW'S POINT OF VIEW - MELVIN

Fresh as a daisy, his head tucked into his neck, he is snapping 
his fingers, trying to get a rise out of Faron.

												
215	MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW - LYNDA

raises Faron's hand with hers, waves to Melvin.


216	INT. MELVIN'S HOTEL ROOM - LAS VEGAS - DAY

Melvin is packing, Roger Dutson, Melvin's lawyer enters, a 
broad smile on his face.

Melvin looks up.

			ROGER
	You did it, Melvin.  The Judge set 
	a trial for July 6 ---

			MELVIN
	What does that mean?

			ROGER
	That means he believes you.  On 
	July 6th, they're going to deter-
	mine the validity of the will. 
	Like he said, 'It's the only will
	we've got,' plus the positive
	testimony by the handwriting ex-
	perts.  I think the will is going
	to be admitted to probate.  You're 
	going to get your inheritance.

			MELVIN
	You think so?

			ROGER
	Of course it's going to be a long,
	long road -- but we've won the
	first battle.  I can tell -- the 
	T-shirt people called again --
	Rockwood Dairy says they'll lift 
	the garnishes on your entire
	earnings at the filling station ---

			MELVIN
	Really?

			ROGER
	The T-shirts are an easy fifteen 
	thousand.  What do you say?

			MELVIN
	No, thanks ---

			ROGER
	But you can use the cash ---

			MELVIN
	You want to get paid?

			ROGER
	No no no -- it's just they started 
	paving the freeway today down from 
	the gas station -- within two weeks, 
	you're going to be pretty lonely up 
	there.

			MELVIN
	Don't worry about me.

Roger sighs.

			ROGER
	Well, you won, Mel --

			MELVIN 
	Then what are you so sad about?

			ROGER
	I just hope you don't have any
	illusions.  They'll fight it 
	through every court they can --
	the relatives -- Summa -- 
	meanwhile the government'll be 
	taking out taxes -- the states'll 
	be taking out taxes -- the 
	lawyers'll be taking out legal 
	fees -- the money's going to 
	be siphoned off --

			MELVIN 
	I knew all that the day I found 
	the will.

			ROGER
	You're kidding.

			MELVIN 
	Melvin Dummar's never going to 
	see 156 million dollars -- in 
	fact he's never going to see 
	a dime.

Melvin closes his suitcase, puts it on a cart and pushes
it out the door.

			MELVIN 
	But Howard Hughes sang Melvin 
	Dummar's song.   Howard Hughes 
	sang 'Santa's Souped Up Sleigh.'

The door slams.

			ROGER
		(bewildered) 
	'Santa's' what, Melvin?

Melvin has gone.


217 	EXT. CLARK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

Melvin rolls up in Little Red's old car, Lynda is standing
on the sidewalk with Faron and Darcy.

			MELVIN 
	Sorry --

			LYNDA
	It's okay.  Gave me a chance to
	get them fed.  You really want 
	to do this?

			MELVIN
	See my kids?  Get them out of
	that smog?  You kiddin'?

Lynda looks at the car doubtfully.

			MELVIN
	Little Red lent it to me for
	the trip.  He went back up with
	Bonnie in the tow truck. 
		(to Darcy) 
	Hop in, kids.  There's Lifesavers 
	and comic books back there.

Darcy pushes Faron into the back seat.

			MELVIN
	I bought a pair of shoes for 
	Faron -- help him try them on, 
	Sister.

Darcy takes Faron's shoes off.

			MELVIN
	You got money to get back to 
	L.A.?

			LYNDA
	Don't worry about me, Melvin.

			MELVIN
		(smiles) 
	It's in my blood.

			LYNDA
	You're not going to hassle me 
	when I want them back end of
	the summer?

			MELVIN
	You've got my word.

			LYNDA
	That's what I'm afraid of.

			MELVIN 
	Howsa bout <u>you</u> takin' <u>me</u> back
	the end of the summer?

Lynda smiles.

			LYNDA
	You're married, Melvin.

Melvin shrugs.

			MELVIN 
	So are you.

Lynda smiles again.

			LYNDA
	I do miss it sometimes, Melvin 
	-- it was always exciting.
	Lousy -- but exciting.

			MELVIN 
	We could make it that way again.

			LYNDA
	It is now.

Lynda smiles once more.

			LYNDA
	Give us a kiss.

She kisses him hard.  He blushes.

			MELVIN
	End of the summer? 

			LYNDA
	Maybe.

Now he piles into the car.

			LYNDA
		(yelling)
	G'bye, kids!

But Darcy is reading a comic book out loud to Faron. They
don't even look up.


218	EXT. TONOPAH HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

Melvin rolling along in Little Red's car.  Darcy and Faron
have moved into the front seat, sound asleep.

Melvin rests his hand on Darcy's forehead.


219	ON MELVIN THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Windshield, a raindrop, then another.  Then a sudden 
downpour, a desert shower, stopping almost as soon as it
starts.


220	ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW

The rain clearing, just a gray sky. He opens the window.
Howard opens his window. They're in Little Red's car.


221	ON MELVIN

breathing in the desert after the shower.

			MELVIN 
	Greasewood.

			HOWARD 
		(breathing in)
	Sage.

			MELVIN 
	Nothing like the smell of the
	desert after the rain.

			HOWARD 
	Greasewood and sage.

They roll along for a while.

			HOWARD 
	How about letting me drive?

			MELVIN 
	You?

			HOWARD 
	Just for a little while.

			MELVIN 
	Drive?

			HOWARD 
	I'm a goddamn good driver ---

			MELVIN 
	You haven't driven a car since 
	they put out the last Hudson.

			HOWARD 
	I'm a goddamn good driver.  I'll 
	bet you.


222	ON MELVIN 

He looks at Howard.


223	ON HOWARD 

waiting.


224 	ON MELVIN 

Smiles, pulls off the road.

			MELVIN 
	When we get to Vegas, I'll run 
	her into town.

Howard hesitates.

			MELVIN 
	Take the wheel, ol' timer.

Howard gets out and Melvin slides over.


225	MELVIN'S POINT OF VIEW

Howard looking carefully at the dashboard.  Very slowly
he puts the car into gear, very slowly he releases the 
brake, and very slowly he rolls it out onto the road.


226 	ON MELVIN AND HOWARD

Melvin watching as Howard drives.  Howard watching 
Melvin watching him.  Now Melvin's head begins to nod. 
His eyes close.


227	ON HOWARD

Driving, now he turns, sneaks a look at Melvin who is
sound asleep beside him.  Gives the car a little gas
and begins to sing.

			HOWARD
		(singing quietly) 
	'Make my bed 
	And light the light
	I'll arrive
	Late tonight 
	Blackbird! 
	Blackbird! 
	Bye!  Bye!'

Howard props his arm out the window, adjusts the mirror, 
now he gives the car more gas. 

He is very happy.


228	MELVIN'S CAR 

rolling down the highway to Las Vegas.  From it --

			HOWARD (v.o.)
		(singing)
	'Pack up all my cares and woes 
	Singin' low 
	Here I go 
	Bye bye blackbird....'

The car becomes a dot.  It never disappears, nor does 
the music end.

				FADE OUT
