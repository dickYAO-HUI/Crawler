<i>This is the original shooting screenplay. It contains some scenes which where cut from the final film.</i>
<p><b>EXT. STREET. DAY</b><br><br>
<p><i>Legs run along the pavement. They are Mark Renton's.</i><br>
<p><i>Just ahead of him is Spud. They are both belting along.</i><br>
<p><i>As they travel, various objects (pens, tapes, CDs, toiletries, ties, sunglasses, etc.) either fall or are discarded from inside their jackets.</i><br>
<p><i>They are pursued by two hard-looking Store Detectives in identical uniforms. The men are fast, but Renton and Spud maintain their lead.</i><br>
RENTON<br>(voice-over)
<blockquote>Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family, Choose a fucking big television, Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players, and electrical tin openers.</blockquote>

<p><i>Suddenly, as Renton crosses a road, a car skids to a halt, inches from him.</i><br>

<p><i>In a  moment of detachment he stops and looks at the shocked driver, then at Spud, who has continued running, then at the Two Men, who are now closing in on him.</i><br>

<p><i>He smiles.</i><br>


<b>INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT ROOM. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>In a bare, dingy room, Renton lies on the floor, alone, motionless and drugged.</i><br><br>

RENTON
(v.o)

<blockquote>Choose good health, low cholesterol and dental insurance. Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose your friends.
</blockquote>

<b>EXT. FOOTBALL PITCH. NIGHT</b><br><br>


<i>On a flood lit five-a-side pitch, Renton and his friends are taking on another team at football.</i><br><br>

<i>The opposition all wear an identical strip (Arsenal), whereas Renton and his friends wear an odd assortment of gear.</i><br><br>

<i>Three girls -- Lizzy, Gail, and Allison and Baby -- stand by the side, watching.</i><br><br>

<i>The boys are outclassed by the team with the strip but play much dirtier.</i><br><br>

<i>As each performs a characteristic bit of play, the play freezes and their name is visible, printed or written on some item of clothing. (T-Shirt, baseball cap, shorts, trainers). In Begbie's case, his name appears as a tatoo on his arm.</i><br><br>

<i>Sick Boy commits a sneaky foul and indignantly denies it.</i><br><br>

<i>Begbie commits an obvious foul and make no effort to deny it.</i><br><br>

<i>Spud, in goal, lets the ball in between his legs.</i><br><br>

<i>Tommy kicks the ball as hard as he can.</i><br><br>

<i>Renton's litany continues over the action:</i><br><br>


RENTON
(v.o)

<blockquote>Choose leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose a three piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing sprit-crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing you last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats you have spawned to replace yourself. Choose your future. Choose life.</blockquote>

<i>Renton is hit straight in the face by the ball. He lies back on the astroturf. Voice-over continues.</i><br><br>

<blockquote>But who would I want to do a thing like that?</blockquote>

<b>INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>Renton lies on the floor.</i><br><br>

<i>Swanney, Allison and Baby, Sick Boy and Spud are shooting up or preparing to shoot up. Sick Boy is talking to Allison as he taps up a vein on her arm.</i><br><br>

RENTON
(v.o)

<blockquote>I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin? </blockquote>

SICK BOY

<blockquote><i>Goldfinger's</i> better than <i>Dr. No</i>. Both of them are a lot better than <i>Diamonds are Forever</i> a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, <i>Thunderball</i> was a notable success. </blockquote>

RENTON
(v.o)

<blockquote>People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget -</blockquote>

<i> Spud is shooting up </i><br><br>

<blockquote>is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking winds, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.</blockquote>

SICK BOY

<blockquote>I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.</blockquote>

RENTON
(v.o)

<blockquote>The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -</blockquote>

<b>INT. PUB I. NIGHT</b><br><br>

<i>Begbie, smoking and drinking, speaks to camera.</i><br><br>

BEGBIE
<blockquote>No way would I poison my body with that shite, all they fucking chemicals, no fucking way.</blockquote>

<b>INT. PUB I. NIGHT</b><br><br>

<i>Tommy sits beside Lizzy. He speaks to camera.</i><br><br>

TOMMY
<blockquote>It's a waste of your life, Rents, poisoning your body with that shite.</blockquote>

<b>INT. RENTON FAMILY HOME, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT</b><br><br>

<i>Renton's father and mother sit at the table eating. </i><br><br>

<i>Renton is seated but not eating.</i><br><br>

FATHER
<blockquote>Every chance you've ever had, you've blown it, stuffing your veins with that filth.</blockquote>

<b>--------</b>

<br><br><b>INT. ELECTRICAL RETAILERS. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>Gav wears the corporate jacket.</i><br><br>

GAV

<blockquote>Get off that stuff, Rents and get a job. It's not as bad as it looks. While you're here, you don't fancy buying a cooker, do you?</blockquote>

<b>--------</b><br><br>

<b>INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>Sick Boy and Spud lie drugged up. Allison and Baby wait while Swanney cooks up.</i><br><br>

<i>Renton is standing up.</i><br><br>

RENTON
(v.o)

<blockquote>From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.</blockquote>

SWANNEY

<blockquote>Are you serious?</blockquote>

RENTON

<blockquote>Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.</blockquote>

SWANNEY

<blockquote>Well, it's up to you.</blockquote>

RENTON

<blockquote>I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.</blockquote>

SWANNEY

<blockquote>Sure, sure. I've heard it before.</blockquote>

RENTON

<blockquote>The Sick Boy method.</blockquote>

<i> They both look at Sick Boy</i><br><br>

SWANNEY

<blockquote>Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.</blockquote>

RENTON

<blockquote>He's always been lacking in moral fibre.</blockquote>

SWANNEY

<blockquote>He knows a lot about Sean Connery.</blockquote>

RENTON

<blockquote>That's hardly a substitute.</blockquote>

SWANNEY

<blockquote>you'll need one more hit.</blockquote>

RENTON

<blockquote>No, I don't think so.</blockquote>

SWANNEY

<blockquote>To see you through the night that lies ahead.</blockquote>

<i>Freeze Frame on Swanney.</i><br><br>

RENTON
(v.o)

<blockquote>We called him the mother superior on account of the length of his habit. He knew all about it. On it, off it, he knew it all. Of course I'd have another shot: after all, I had work to do.</blockquote>

<b>INT. RENTON'S FLAT ROOM. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>The door opens and Renton enters carrying shopping bags. He empties them on to a mattress beside three buckets and a television.</i><br><br>

RENTON
(v.o)

<blockquote>Relinquishing junk. Stage One: preparation.

People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.</blockquote>

Obviously fancied himself. Starts looking at me. Right fucking at me. Trying to put off, like, just for kicks. Looking at me as if to say, 'Come ahead, square go.' Well, you know me, I'm no looking for trouble but at the end of the day I'm the cunt with the pool cue and I'm game for a swedge. So I squared up, casual like. So what does the hard cunt do, or so-called hard cunt? Shites it. Puts down his drink, turns around and gets the fuck out of there. And after that, the game was mine.</blockquote>

So he's got the hump, right, but finally I manage to set it up so all he's go to do is pot the black to win one game and salvage a little pride and maybe not kick my head in, right. So he's on the black, pressure shot, and it all goes wrong, big time. What does he do? Picks on this specky wee gadge at the bar and accuses him of putting him off by looking at him.

The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?</blockquote>

TOMMY
<blockquote>It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.</blockquote>

<b><br><br>INT. GAIL'S BEDROOM. MORNING</b><br><br>

<i><br><br>Spud opens his eyes. With his fingers, he feels crusted liquid around his mouth.</i><br>

<i><br><br>Abruptly he turns around: the bed is soaked in vomit.</i><br>

<i><br><br>He looks under the cover and drops it again in revulsion.</i><br>

<b><br><br>INT. DIANE'S HOME, HALL/KITCHEN. DAY</b><br><br>

MAN
<blockquote>Good Morning.</blockquote>

WOMAN
<blockquote>Come in and sit down. You must be Mark.</blockquote><br>

GAIL
<blockquote>Good morning, Spud.</blockquote><br>

SPUD
<blockquote>Morning, Gail. Morning, Mrs. Houston, Mr. Houston.</blockquote><br>

MOTHER
<blockquote>Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.</blockquote><br>

SPUD
<blockquote>Sorry about last night -</blockquote><br>

GAIL
<blockquote>It's all right. I slept fine on the sofa.</blockquote><br>

SPUD
<blockquote>I had a little too much to drink. I'm afraid I had a slight accident.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>Oh, don't worry, these things happen. It does everyone good to cut loose once in a while.</blockquote><br>

GAIL
<blockquote>This one could do with being tied up once in a while.</blockquote><br>

SPUD

MOTHER
<blockquote>No problem for me either.</blockquote><br>

MOTHER
<blockquote>Spud, they're my sheets.</blockquote><br>

DIANE
I don't see why not.<br><br>

RENTON
<blockquote>Because it's illegal.</blockquote><br>

DIANE
<blockquote>Holding hands?</blockquote><br>

RENTON
<blockquote>No, not holding hands.</blockquote><br>

DIANE
<blockquote>In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.</blockquote><br>

RENTON
<blockquote>And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.</blockquote><br>

<i><br><br>They stop at the school gates.</i><br>

DIANE
<blockquote>Calm down. You're not going to jail.</blockquote><br>

RENTON
<blockquote>Easy for you to say.</blockquote><br>

DIANE
<blockquote>Can I see you again?</blockquote><br>

RENTON
<blockquote>Certainly not.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>If you don't see me again I'll tell the police.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>This had better be good.</blockquote><br>

TOMMY
<blockquote>It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.</blockquote><br>

SICK BOY
<blockquote>If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.</blockquote><br>

TOMMY
<blockquote>Such as?</blockquote><br>

SICK BOY
<blockquote>Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?</blockquote><br>

<i><br><br>They sit in silence.</i><br>

<b><br><br>EXT. STATION. DAY</b><br><br>

<i><br><br>The station is in the middle of a moor. There appears to be no habitation around. In the distance are some hills.</i><br>

<i><br><br>The train stands at the station.</i><br>

<i><br><br>As it pulls away, Renton, Spud, Tommy and Sick Boy are left standing on the platform, looking around.</i><br>

SICK BOY
<blockquote>Now what?</blockquote><br>

TOMMY
<blockquote>We go for a walk.</blockquote><br>

SPUD
<blockquote>What?</blockquote><br>

TOMMY
<blockquote>A walk.</blockquote><br>

SPUD
<blockquote>But where?</blockquote><br>

<i>Tommy points vaguely across the moor.</i><br>



























































TOMMY
<blockquote>There.</blockquote><br>

SICK BOY
<blockquote>Are you serious?</blockquote><br>

<i>They step across the tracks toward the vast moorland. They stop.</i><br>

<i>All but Tommy sit down on rocks or clumps of heather.</i><br>

TOMMY
<blockquote>Well, what are you waiting for?</blockquote><br>

SPUD
<blockquote>I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.</blockquote><br>

<i>A group of three serious Walkers trudge past from the other end of the platform, decked out in regulation Berghaus from head to foot. They tramp off towards the wilderness. The boys watch them go.</i><br>

<i>Spud opens a can.</i><br>

TOMMY
<blockquote>It's the great outdoors.</blockquote><br>

SICK BOY
<blockquote>It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?</blockquote><br>

TOMMY
<blockquote>It's fresh air.</blockquote><br>

SICK BOY
<blockquote>Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.</blockquote><br>

TOMMY
<blockquote>Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?</blockquote><br>

RENTON
<blockquote>I hate being Scottish. We're the lowest of the fucking low, the scum of the earth, the most wretched, servile, miserable, pathetic trash that was ever shat into civilization. Some people hate the English, but I don't. They're just wankers. We, on the other hand, are colonized by wankers. We can't even pick a decent culture to be colonized by. We are ruled by effete arseholes. It's a shite state of affairs and all the fresh air in the world will not make any fucking difference.</blockquote><br>

We stole drugs, we stole prescriptions, or bought them, sold them, swapped them, forged them, photocopied them or traded them with cancer victims, alcoholics, old age pensioners, AIDS patients, epileptics and bored housewives. We took morphine, diamorphine, cyclozine, codeine, temazepam, nitrezepam, phenobarbitone, sodium amytal dextropropoxyphene, methadone, nalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocine, buprenorphine, dextromoramide chlormethiazole.

<b><br><br>EXT. STREET. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>Renton and Spud are running, pursued by the Two Store Detectives.</i><br>

RENTON
(v.o)

Nor did I. Our only response was to keep on going and fuck everything. Pile misery upon misery, heap it up on a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile, then squirt it into a stinking purulent vein and do it all over again. Keep on going: getting up, going out, robbing, stealing, fucking people over, propelling ourselves with longing towards the day it would all go wrong.

<i>As seen in the opening scene, Renton is nearly hit by a car that screeches to a halt as he crosses a road.</i><br>

<i>He looks at the driver, at Spud running away and the Store Detectives approaching.</i><br>

(v.o)
Because no matter how much you stash or how much you steal, you never have enough. No matter how often you go out and rob and fuck people over you always need to get up and do it all again.

<i>Renton smiles and waits.</i><br>

(v.o)
Sooner or later, this sort of thing was bound to happen.

<i>One of the Detectives runs straight past him, after Spud.</i><br>

<i>The other Detective crashes into Renton with a mighty punch in the stomach.</i><br>

<b><br><br>INT. COURT. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>Spud and Renton stand in the dock. Renton's Mother and Father, Sick Boy, Begbie, and Spud's Mother (Mrs. Murphy) are among those in the gallery.</i><br>

<i>The Sheriff delivers his sentence.</i><br>

SHERIFF
<blockquote>...because shoplifting is theft, which is a crime, and, despite what you may believe, there is no such entity as victimless crime. Heroin addiction may explain your actions, but it does not excuse them. Mr Murphy, you are a habitual thief, devoid of regret or remorse. In sentencing you to six months' imprisonment my only worry is that it will not be long before we meet again. Mr Renton, I understand that you have entered into a programme of rehabilation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin. The suspension of your sentence is conditional upon your continued cooperation with this programme. Should you stand guilty before me again, I shall not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence.</blockquote><br>

RENTON
<blockquote>Thank you, your honour. With God's help, I'll conquer this affliction.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Sheriff and Renton stare at one another for a moment. Renton turns to look at Spud, then back towards the Sheriff, who is now leaving the court.</i><br>

(v.o)
<blockquote>What can you say? Well, Begbie had a phrase for it.</blockquote><br>

<b><br><br>INT. PUB I. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>The pub is crowded. Around Renton are his mother, Father, Begbie, Sick Boy and Gav.</i><br>

BEGBIE<br>
<blockquote>It was fucking obvious that that cunt was going to fuck some cunt.</blockquote><br>

<i>There is a round to nodding and 'poor Spud'ing. Everyone begins to talk at once.</i><br>

FATHER<br>
<blockquote>I hope you've learned your lesson, son.</blockquote><br>

MOTHER<br>
<blockquote>Oh, my son, I thought I was going to lose you there. You're nothing but trouble to me, but I still love you.</blockquote><br>

BEGBIE<br>
<blockquote>Clean up your act, sunshine. Cut that shite out for ever.</blockquote><br>

MOTHER<br>
<blockquote>You listen to Francis, Mark, he's talking sense.</blockquote><br>

BEGBIE<br>
Fucking right I am. See, inside, you wouldn't last two fucking days.<br><br>

SICK BOY<br>
There's better things that the needle, Rents. Choose life.<br><br>

<i>He winks.</i><br>

MOTHER<br>
I remember when you were a baby, even when you would never do what you were told.<br><br>

BEGBIE<br>
<blockquote>But he pulled it off, clever bastard, and he got a result.</blockquote><br>

<i>They laugh, then fall silent.</i><br>

<i>Renton turns around. Behind him stands Spud's mother.</i><br>

RENTON<br>
Mrs Murphy, I'm sorry about Spud. It's wasn't fair, him going down and not me --<br><br>

<i>Tears in her eyes, Mrs Murphy turns and walks away.</i><br>

<i>Renton watches her go. Behind him Begbie shouts.</i><br>

BEGBIE<br>
<blockquote>It's no our fault. Your boy went down because he was fucking smack-head and if that's not your fault, I don't know what is.</blockquote><br>

<i>Begbie turns back to Renton.</i><br>

<blockquote>Right. I'll get the drinks in.</blockquote><br>

<i>He moves towards the bar.</i><br>

<i>Renton slips away.</i><br>

<i>Renton walks through the bar towards the toilets, then out of a back
door.</i><br>

<b><br><br>EXT. YARD. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>Renton emerges into a narrow yard surrounded by a high wall. He looks around. The steel back gate is locked.</i>

RENTON
(v.o)
<blockquote>I wished I had gone down instead of Spud. Here I was surrounded by my family and my so-called mates and I've never felt so alone, never in all my puff. Since I was on remand they've had me on this programme, the state-sponsored addiction, three sickly sweet doses of methadone a day instead of smack. But it's never enough, and at the moment it's nowhere near enough. I took all three this morning and now I've got eighteen hours to go till my next shot and a sweat on my back like a layer of frost. I need to visit the mother superior for one hit, one fucking hit to get us over this long, hard day.</blockquote>

<i>Renton climbs the wall. He stands on top, then dives off the other side, executing a somersault in mid-air.</i>

<b><br><br>INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. NIGHT</b><br><br>

RENTON
<blockquote>What's on the menu this evening?</blockquote>

SWANNEY
<blockquote>Your favourite dish.</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>Excellent.</blockquote>

SWANNEY
<blockquote>Your usual table, sir?</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>Why, thank you.</blockquote>

<i>Renton sits on his usual cushion on the floor.</i>

SWANNEY
<blockquote>And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>Stick it on my tab.</blockquote>

SWANNEY
<blockquote>Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>In that case --</blockquote>

<i>He produces twenty pounds.</i>

SWANNEY
<blockquote>Oh, hard currency, why, sir, that'll do nicely.</blockquote>

<i>He swipes the notes underneath a UV forgery checker.</i>

<blockquote>Can't be too careful when we're dealing with your type, can we?</blockquote>

<i>Renton begins his search for a vein.</i>

<blockquote>Would sir care for a starter? Some garlic bread perhaps?</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.</blockquote>

SWANNEY
<blockquote>As you wish.</blockquote>

<i>He hands Renton the syringe. Renton inject, then lies back on the dirty, red, carpeted floor.</i>

<i>He lies completely still. His pupils shrink. His breathing becomes slow, shallow and intermittent.</i>

<i>He sinks into the floor until he is lying in a coffin-shaped and coffin-sized pit, lined by the red carpet.</i>

<i>Swanney stands over him.</i>

SWANNEY
<blockquote>Perhaps sir would like me to call for a taxi?</blockquote>

<i>An ambulance siren becomes faintly audible.</i>




<b><br><br>INT. SWANNEY'S STAIRWELL. NIGHT</b><br><br>

<i>The siren is a little louder.</i>

<i>Swanney holds Renton under his arms and drags him backwards down the steps.</i>

<b><br><br>EXT. STREET. NIGHT</b><br><br>

<i>As Swanney emerges, still dragging Renton, the siren grows louder and then an ambulance speeds by without stopping.</i>

<i>Swanney drags Renton across the pavement and into the open door of a waiting taxi.</i>

<i>Swanney then steps out of the taxi's other door, pausing only to tuck a ten-pound note into Renton's pocket before closing the door.</i>

<b><br><br>INT. TAXI. NIGHT</b><br><br>

<i>Renton lies on the floor of the taxi, as Swanney left him, rolling slightly as the taxi takes a corner.</i>

<b><br><br>EXT. HOSPITAL/TAXI. NIGHT</b><br><br>

<i>The taxi is stationary.
</i>
<i>We do not see the driver's face but his hand opens the door and then drags Renton out on to the pavement by his ankles before taking the ten pound note, getting back in the cab and driving away.</i>

<i>Renton lies on the pavement.</i>

<i>Two Porters life him by arms and ankles on to a trolley.</i>

<i>We do not see the Porters's faces as they wheel Renton into the hospital.</i>

<i>Renton is wheeled through the department, then into a bay surrounded by a white nylon curtain.</i>

<i>The Porters lift Renton from one trolley on to another, then leave him alone in the bay surrounded by the curtain.
</i>
<i>Renton lies alone. His breathing is still shallow and erratic. Around him is the usual accident and emergency paraphernalia: blood pressure machine, oxygen tap, bandages, etc.</i>

<i>A Doctor comes in and gives Renton an injection, then leaves.</i>

DOCTOR
<blockquote>Wake up. Wake up.</blockquote>

<i>Renton breathes more easily.</i>

<b><br><br>INT. OTHER SIDE OF RENTON'S BEDROOM DOOR. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>Renton's Father's hand slides three bolts across to lock the door.</i>

<b><br><br>INT. RENTON'S BEDROOM. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>Renton lies on the bed.</i>

RENTON
(v.o)
<blockquote>I don't feel the sickness yet, but it's in the post, that's for sure. I'm in the junky limbo at the moment, too ill to sleep, too tired to stay awake, but the sickness is on its way. Sweat, chills, nausea, pain and craving. Need like nothing else I have ever known will soon take hold of me. It's on the way.</blockquote>

<i>The door opens. Renton's Mother walks in with a bowl of soup and a piece of bread. Father watches from the doorway.</i>

MOTHER
<blockquote>We'll help you, son. You'll stay with us until you get better. We'll beat this together.</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>Maybe I could go back to the clinic.</blockquote>

MOTHER
<blockquote>No. No clinics, no methadone. That made you worse, you said so yourself. You lied to us, son, your own mother and father.</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>At least get us some Tempazepam.</blockquote>

MOTHER
<blockquote>No, you're worse coming off that than you are with heroin.
Nothing at all.</blockquote>

FATHER
<blockquote>It's a clean break this time.</blockquote>

MOTHER
<blockquote>You're staying where we can keep an eye on you.</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>I do appreciate what you're trying to do, I really do, but I need just one score, to ease myself off it. Just one. Just one.</blockquote>

<i>Mother retreats past Father, who closes the door. The bolts go home again.</i>

<i>Renton lies back and closes his eyes. His forehead is damp with sweat.</i>

<i>He begins to shake.</i>

<i>He tosses and turns, becoming wrapped up in a swathe of blankets. As he unravels them, he is astonished to find a fully clothed Begbie in the bed with him.</i>

BEGBIE
<blockquote>Well, this is a good laugh, you fucking useless bastard. Go on, sweat that shite out of your system, because if I come back and it's still there, I'll fucking kick it out.</blockquote>

<i>Begbie laughs and covers himself up.</i>

<i>Renton rips away the blankets, but Begbie has gone.</i>

<i>Renton looks up.</i>

<i>Baby Dawn is crawling across the ceiling.</i>

<i>Renton looks down to see Diane sitting on the end of the bed.</i>

<i>Diane sings 'Temptation' by New Order.</i>

DIANE
<blockquote>'Oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got red eyes, and I've never met anyone quite like you before.'</blockquote>

<i>Renton looks back up. Dawn continues her slow crawl, leaving behind a thick rail of unidentifiable slime.</i>

<i>Renton looks down. Sick Boy sits on the end of the bed, holding a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit.</i>

<i>Mother stands behind him.</i>

SICK BOY
<blockquote>It's a mug's game, Mrs Renton. I'm not saying I was blameless myself, far from it, but there comes a time when you have to turn your back on that nonsense and just say no.</blockquote>

<i>Sick Boy takes a bit of his biscuit.</i>

<i>Dawn crawls on. She has fangs now.</i>

<i>Spud sits on the end of the bed, in a caricature prison uniform with arrows on it, plus a ball and chain.</i>

<i>Dawn has claws as well.</i>

<i>Tommy sits on the end of the bed. He looks terrible.</i>

TOMMY
<blockquote>Better than sex, Rents, better than sex. The ultimate hit. I'm a fucking adult. I'll find out for myself. Well, I've found out all right.</blockquote>

<i>Renton looks up again just as the baby drops on to his face. He tears her off and throws her into a corner.</i>

<i>Renton's Mother and Father are washing him. Mother bends down and picks up the large, damp sponge from the corner, where it landed. She wipes her son's face with it.</i>

FATHER
<blockquote>Mark, there's something you need to do.</blockquote>

<i>A Doctor stands up as Renton enters.</i>

DOCTOR
<blockquote>Come in. Sit down, please.</blockquote>

<i>They both sit down.</i>

<blockquote>Well, you've already spoken to one of our counsellors, but before we go on there're just a few questions I'd like to ask you.</blockquote>

<b><br><br>INT. RENTON FAMILY HOME, LIVING-ROOM. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>Renton, his mother and Father sit watching television.</i>

<b><br><br>INT. STUDIO. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>Renton is sitting inside a plastic booth shaped like a giant syringe.</i>

<i>The Doctor, now dressed as a game-show host, stands in front, with Renton's Mother and Father beside him.</i>

DOCTOR
<blockquote>Question number one:  the human immunodeficiency virus is a - what?</blockquote>

FATHER
<blockquote>Retrovirus?</blockquote>

DOCTOR
<blockquote>Retrovirus is the correct answer.</blockquote>

<i>Fanfare</i>.

<blockquote>Question number two: HIV binds to which receptor on the host lymphocyte? Which Receptor?</blockquote>

<i>Mother and Father confer.</i>

FATHER
<blockquote>CD4.</blockquote>

DOCTOR
<blockquote>CD4 receptor is the correct answer.</blockquote>

<i>Fanfare.</i>

<blockquote>And now, question number three: is he guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>

MOTHER
<blockquote>He's our son.</blockquote>

DOCTOR
<blockquote>Is the correct answer.</blockquote>

<i>Fanfare.</i>

<blockquote>And now it's time to 'Take the Test'.</blockquote>

<i>Lights flash. Music. A garish Hostess walks on with two envelopes. She holds them out for Mother to choose one.</i>

<b><br><br>INT. CONSULTING ROOM. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>The Doctor watches in silence as the Hostess, now dressed as a medical technician, draws blood from Renton's arm and puts it into a tube. She marks the tube with a pre-printed, numbered label.</i>

<b><br><br>INT. STUDIO. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>Mother opens one of the envelopes. She is speechless with joy.</i>

<i>The plastic booth opens up. Lights flash again, etc.</i>

<i>Renton steps out.</i>

<b><br><br>INT. SOCIAL CLUB. NIGHT</b><br><br>

<i>Renton, his Mother and Father sit at a table in the local social club. It is a Saturday night and the club is busy.</i>

<i>Everyone sits in rapt silence. It is not initially clear what is going on. Near the bar a Caller with a microphone calls over the PA - Two and four, twenty-four...seven...fifteen...clickety-click, sixty-six -</i>

<i>And so on, as he draws the numbers from the drum.</i>

<i>Everyone studies their cards, except Renton, who studies the people instead, his drink untouched.</i>

<i>The number-calling continues until suddenly interrupted by Mother's voice.</i>

MOTHER
Mark...Mark, you've got a house. House! House! For goodness's sake, Mark.

<i>They bustle around him and pass his card to the front.</i>

RENTON

<blockquote>It seems, however, that I really am the luckiest guy in the world. Several years of addiction right in the middle of an epidemic, surrounded by the living dead, but not me -- I'm negative. It's official.

<i>On the door of a flat 'plaguer', 'HIV', and 'junky AIDS scum' are daubed on the walls.</i>

<i>The sound of a ball being regularly bounced against a wall can be heard.</i>

<b><br><br>INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT</b><br><br>
























<i>It is poorly furnished. Tommy is seated.</i>

<i>Renton has the football, which he kicks against the wall and catches, then drops and kicks again, and so on. The ball is slightly flat.</i>

RENTON
<blockquote>Are you getting out much?</blockquote>

TOMMY
<blockquote>No.</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>Following the game at all?</blockquote>

TOMMY
<blockquote>No.</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>No. Me Neither.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Aye.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Have you got any gear on you?</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>No, I'm clean.</blockquote>

TOMMY
<blockquote>Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque.</blockquote>

<i>Renton produces some of his bingo win.</i>

<i>As he hands the notes over, their eyes and hands meet for a moment.</i>

<i>Tommy puts the money away.</i>

TOMMY

<blockquote>Thanks, Mark.</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>No problem.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.</blockquote>

<b><br><br>INT. HOSPITAL. NIGHT</b><br><br>

<i>Renton walks along a corridor and into a ward.</i>

<b><br><br>INT. WARD. DAY</b><br><br>

<i>Sheets cover the lower half of Swanney in bed.</i>

<i>They are thrown back to reveal the stump of an above-knee amputation.</i>

SWANNEY
<blockquote>Surprise! Pa-pah!</blockquote>

<i>Renton sits down and takes it in silence.</i>

<blockquote>Hit the artery by mistake. Common enough error, or so the quack tells us, as though that's going to make my leg grown back. Still, it could have been worse, it could have been my fucking dick. And I tell you what, in this place you get looked after: clean sheets, regular meals and all the morphine you can eat.</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>Great.</blockquote>

SWANNEY
<blockquote>And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>Sure.</blockquote>

SWANNEY
<blockquote>The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>Sounds great, Swanney.</blockquote>

SWANNEY
<blockquote>Yeah.</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>You'll have to send us a postcard.</blockquote>

SWANNEY
Sure will, pal, sure will.

<b><br><br>EXT. PARK. DAY</b><br><br>

It wasn't that bad.

You know.

<blockquote>When are you going to visit him?</blockquote>

SICK BOY
<blockquote>Don't know. Maybe Thursday.</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?</blockquote>

<i>Sick Boy is silent. He stiffens as he avoids Renton's gaze. They shift fractionally apart.</i>

<i>RENTON tuts.</i>

SICK BOY
<blockquote>Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>You're all hear.</blockquote>

SICK BOY
<blockquote>I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.' Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
</blockquote>

RENTON
<blockquote>Fuck you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Solid silver, my arse. I took it to a fence -- it's trash, pure trash.  There's young couples investing all their hopes in that stuff, and what are they getting?</blockquote>

RENTON
(v.o)
<blockquote>Now, I've justified this to myself in all sorts of ways: it wasn't a big deal, just a minor betrayal, or we'd outgrown each other, you know, that sort of thing, but let's face it, I ripped them off. My so-called mayes. But Begbie, I couldn't give a shit about him, and Sick Boy, well, he'd have done the same to me if only he'd thought of it first, and Spud, well, OK, I felt sorry for Spud -- he never hurt anybody.</blockquote>

<blockquote>So why did I do it? I could offer a million answers, all false. The truth is that I'm a bad person, but that's going to change, I'm going to change. This is the last of this sort of thing. I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on, going straight and choosing life. I'm looking forward to it already. I'm going to be just like you: the job, the family, the fucking big television, the washing machine, the car, the compact disc and electrical tin opener, good health, low cholesterol, dental insurance, mortgage, starter home, leisurewear, luggage, three-piece suite, DIY, game shows, junk food, children, walks in the park, nine to five, good at golf, washing the car, choice of sweaters, family Christmas, indexed pension, tax exemption, clearing the gutters, getting by, looking ahead, to the day you die.</blockquote>
