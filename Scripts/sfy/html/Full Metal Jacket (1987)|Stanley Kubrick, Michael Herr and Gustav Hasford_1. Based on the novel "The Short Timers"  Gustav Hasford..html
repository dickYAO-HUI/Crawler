FADE IN:
1 INT. BARBERSHOP--PARRIS
ISLAND MARINE BASE--DAY

Marine recruits having their heads shaved
with electric clippers. The hair piles up on the floor.


2 INT.
BARRACKS--DAY

Marine recruits stand at attention in front of their
bunks.

Master Gunnery Sergeant HARTMAN walks along the
line of blank-faced recruits.

		HARTMAN
	I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, your Senior
	Drill Instructor. From now on, you will speak
	only when spoken to, and the first and last
	words out of your filthy sewers will be "Sir!"
	Do you maggots understand that?


		RECRUITS
		(in unison)
	Sir, yes, sir!


		HARTMAN
	Bullshit! I can't hear you. Sound off like you
	got a pair.

		RECRUITS
		(louder)
	Sir, yes, sir!


		HARTMAN
	If you ladies leave my island, if you survive
	recruit training ... you will be a weapon, you
	will be a minister of death, praying for war.
	But until that day you are pukes! You're the
	lowest form of life on Earth. You are not even
	human fucking beings! You are nothing but
	unorganized grabasstic pieces of amphibian
	shit!
	
	Because I am hard, you will not like me. But
	the more you hate me, the more you will
	learn. I am hard, but I am fair!
	There is no racial bigotry here! I do not look down on
	niggers, kikes, wops or greasers. Here you
	are all equally worthless! And my
	orders are to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack
	the gear to serve in my beloved Corps! Do
	you maggots understand that?


RECRUITS
      (in unison)
Sir, yes, sir!



HARTMAN
Bullshit! I can't hear you!


      RECRUITS

(louder)
Sir, yes, sir!


Sergeant HARTMAN stops in front of a
black recruit,
Private SNOWBALL.


      HARTMAN
What's your
name, scumbag?

      SNOWBALL
      (shouting)
Sir,
Private Brown, sir!

      HARTMAN
Bullshit! From now on
you're Private
Snowball! Do you like that name?


SNOWBALL
      (shouting)
Sir, yes, sir!


      HARTMAN

Well, there's one thing that you won't like,
Private Snowball! They
don't serve fried
chicken and watermelon on a daily basis in
my
mess hall!

      SNOWBALL
Sir, yes, sir!


      JOKER

(whispering)
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?


HARTMAN

Who said that? Who the fuck said that? Who's
the slimy
little communist shit twinkle-toed
cocksucker down here, who just
signed his
own death warrant? Nobody, huh?! The fairy
fucking
godmother said it! Out-fucking-
standing! I will P.T. you all until
you fucking
die! I'll P.T. you until your assholes are
sucking
buttermilk.


Sergeant HARTMAN grabs cowboy by the shirt.



HARTMAN
Was it you, you scroungy little fuck, huh?!


COWBOY
Sir, no, sir!


      HARTMAN
You little piece of
shit! You look like a fucking
worm! I'll bet it was you!


COWBOY
Sir, no, sir!

       JOKER
Sir, I said it, sir!


Sergeant HARTMAN steps up to JOKER.


      HARTMAN
Well ...
no shit. What have we got here, a
fucking comedian? Private Joker? I
admire
your honesty. Hell, I like you. You can come
over to my
house and fuck my sister.

Sergeant HARTMAN purnches JOKER in the
stomach.
JOKER sags to his knees.

      HARTMAN
You little
scumbag! I've got your name! I've
got your ass! You will not laugh!
You will not
cry! You will learn by the numbers. I will
teach
you. Now get up! Get on your feet! You
had best unfuck yourself or I
will unscrew
your head and shit down your neck!

      JOKER

Sir, yes, sir!

      HARTMAN
Private Joker, why did you join
my beloved
Corps?

      JOKER
Sir, to kill, sir!


HARTMAN
So you're a killer!

      JOKER
Sir, yes, sir!


HARTMAN
Let me see your war face!

      JOKER
Sir?


HARTMAN
You've got a war face? Aaaaaaaagh! That's a
war face.
Now let me see your war face!

      JOKER
Aaaaaaaagh!


HARTMAN
Bullshit! You didn't convince me! Let me see
your real
war face!

      JOKER
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!


HARTMAN
You didn't scare me! Work on it!

      JOKER

Sir, yes, sir!

Sergeant HARTMAN speaks into cowboy's face.


HARTMAN
What's your excuse?

      COWBOY
Sir, excuse for
what, sir?

      HARTMAN
I'm asking the fucking questions
here,
Private. Do you understand?!

      COWBOY
Sir,
yes, sir!

      HARTMAN
Well thank you very much! Can I be in
charge
for a while?

      COWBOY
Sir, yes, sir!


HARTMAN
Are you shook up? Are you nervous?

      COWBOY

Sir, I am, sir!

      HARTMAN
Do I make you nervous?


COWBOY
Sir!

      HARTMAN
Sir, what? Were you about to
call me an
asshole?!

      COWBOY
Sir, no, sir!


HARTMAN
How tall are you, Private?

      COWBOY
Sir,
five foot nine, sir!

      HARTMAN
Five foot nine? I didn't
know they stacked shit
that high! You trying to squeeze an inch in
on
me somewhere, huh?

      COWBOY
Sir, no, sir.


HARTMAN
Bullshit! It looks to me like the best part of
you ran
down the crack of your mama's ass
and ended up as a brown stain on
the
mattress! I think you've been cheated!

      HARTMAN

Where in hell are you from anyway, Private?


      COWBOY

Sir, Texas, sir!

      HARTMAN
Holy dogshit! Texas! Only
steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy! And you

don't look much like a steer to me, so that
kinda narrows it down!
Do you suck dicks!

      COWBOY
Sir, no, sir!


HARTMAN
Are you a peter-puffer?

      COWBOY
Sir, no,
sir!

      HARTMAN
I'll bet you're the kind of guy that would
fuck
a person in the ass and not even have the
goddam common
courtesy to give him a reach-
around! I'll be watching you!


Sergeant HARTMAN walks down the line to another
recruit, a tall,
overtweight boy.

      HARTMAN
Did your parents have any
children that lived?


      PYLE
Sir, yes, sir!


HARTMAN
I'll bet they regret that! You're so ugly you
could be
a modern art masterpiece! What's
your name, fatbody?


PYLE
Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir!

      HARTMAN
Lawrence?
Lawrence, what, of Arabia?

      PYLE
Sir, no, sir!


HARTMAN
That name sounds like royalty! Are you
royalty?


PYLE
Sir, no, sir!

      HARTMAN
Do you suck dicks?



PYLE
Sir, no, sir!

      HARTMAN
Bullshit! I'll bet you
could suck a golf ball
through a garden hose!

      PYLE

Sir, no, sir!

      HARTMAN
I don't like the name Lawrence!
Only faggots

shoots me. I

Before God I swear this creed. My rifle and

rifle is only a tool. It is
a hard heart that kills. If your killer
instincts
are not clean and strong you will hesitate at
the
moment of truth. You will not kill. You

will become dead marines.
And then you will

      PYLE
Sir, yes,

      HARTMAN
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut in

your footlocker, Private Pyle?

      PYLE
Sir, because I was
hungry, sir!

      HARTMAN
Because you were hungry?


Holding out the jelly doughnut, HARTMAN walks
down the row of recruits
still standing with their
arms outstretched.

      HARTMAN

Private Pyle has dishonored himself and
dishonored the platoon! I
have tried to help
him, but I have failed! I have failed because

you have not helped me! You people have not
given Private Pyle the
proper motivation!
So, from now on, whenever Private Pyle

FADE TO BLACK


32 INT. BARRACKS--NIGHT

We see a towel on a bed. A bar
of soap is tossed
on the towel. The towel is folded over the soap

forming a weapon.

A hand picks up the towel-weapon and bangs it
on
the mattress making a dull thud.

PYLE is asleep in his bunk.

The
platoon silently slip out of their beds and
form up around PYLE.

A
blanket is thrown over PYLE, each corner held
down by a recruit,
pinning PYLE to the bed.

COWBOY shoves a gag in PYLE's mouth.

PYLE
is helpless.

The platoon files past beating PYLE with the bars
of
soap wrapped in towels.

PYLE's screams are muffled by the gag.


JOKER is the last one. He stands back from the bed.

      COWBOY

(to JOKER)
Do it! Do it!

JOKER hesitates, then moves forward and
hits
PYLE hard several times.

Then JOKER jumps into his bunk.

The
recruits yank the restraining blanket of PYLE
and run back to their
bunks.

      COWBOY
      (removing gag)
Remember, it's
just a bad dream, fatboy.

PYLE sobs loudly and sits up, holding
himself in
pain.

Lying in, his bunk, JOKER covers his ears.


FADE
IN:


33 EXT. PARADE DECK--DAY


The platoon is lined up.


HARTMAN
Port... hut! Left shoulder ... hut! Right
shoulder ...
hut! Port ... hut! Do we love
our beloved Corps, ladies?


RECRUITS
      (shouting in unison)
Semper fi, do or die! Gung
ho, gung ho,
gung ho!

PYLE says nothing, just stares straight
ahead.

      HARTMAN
What makes the grass grow?


RECRUITS
Blood, blood, blood!

PYLE stares. Does not join in the
shouting.

      HARTMAN
What do we do for a living, ladies?


RECRUlTS
Kill, kill, kill!

PYLE remains silent.


HARTMAN
I can't hear you!

      RECRUITS
Kill, kill,
kill!

      HARTMAN
Bullshit! I still can't hear you!


RECRUITS
Kill, kill, kill!

PYLE continues to stare blartkly
ahead.


34 EXT. BLEACHERS--DAY

The platoon sits on bleachers facing
HARTMAN.

      HARTMAN
Do any of you people know who Charles

Whitman was?

No response.

      HARTMAN
None of you
dumbasses knows?

COWBOY raises his hand.

      HARTMAN

Private Cowboy?

      COWBOY
Sir, he was that guy who shot
all those people
from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir!


HARTMAN
That's affirmative. Charles Whitman killed
twenty
people from a twenty-eight-storey
observation tower at the
University of Texas
from distances up to four hundred yards.


HARTMAN looks around.

      HARTMAN
Anybody know who Lee
Harvey Oswald was?

Almost everybody raises his hand.


HARTMAN
Private Snowball?

      SNOWBALL
Sir, he shot
Kennedy, sir!

      HARTMAN
That's right, and do you know how
far away
he was?

      SNOWBALL
Sir, it was pretty far!
From that book
suppository building, sir!

The recruits laugh at
"suppository. "

      HARTMAN
All right, knock it off! Two
hundred and fifty
feet! He was two hundred and fifty feet away

and shooting at a moving target. Oswald got
off three rounds with an
old Italian bolt action
rifle in only six seconds and scored two
hits,
including a head shot! Do any of you people

know where
these individuals learned to
shoot?

JOKER raises his hand.


HARTMAN
Private Joker?

      JOKER
Sir, in the Marines,
sir!

      HARTMAN
In the Marines! Outstanding! Those

individuals showed what one motivated
marine and his rifle can do!
And before you
ladies leave my island, you will be able to
do
the same thing!

Camera slowly moves in on PYLE staring at
HARTMAN.



35 INT. BARRACKS--DAY

Recruits standing at attention in two facing
rows.
HARTMAN walks between the rows, leading them

HARTMAN & RECRUITS
Happy Birthday to you,

Happy Birthday to you!


HARTMAN
Today ... is Christmas! There will be a
magic show at
zero-nine-thirty! Chaplain
Charlie will tell you about how the free

world will conquer Communism with the
aid of God and a few marines!


God has a hard-on for marines because we
kill everything we see! He
plays His games,
we play ours! To show our appreciation for
so
much power, we keep heaven packed
with fresh souls! God was here
before the
Marine Corps! So you can give your heart
to Jesus,
but your ass belongs to the Corps!
Do you ladies understand?


RECRUITS
Sir, yes, sir!

      HARTMAN
I can't hear you!


RECRUITS
Sir, yes, sir!


36 INT. BARRACKS--NIGHT

The recruits
are seated on footlockers, cleaning their
rifles. HARTMAN prowls among
them, watching.

PYLE talizs softly to his rifle.

JOKER looks at him
uneasily.

      PYLE
      (to his rifte)
It's been
swabbed.... and wiped. Everything
is clean. Beautiful. So that it
slides perfectly.
Nice. Everything cleaned. Oiled. So that your

action is beautiful. Smooth, Charlene.


DISSOLVE TO:


37 INT.
BARRACKS--NIGHT

A few recruits, including PYLE, are mopping the

floor.


38 INT. LATRINE--NIGHT

In the latrine COWBOY and JOKER are
also mopping
the floor.

JOKER stops, looks around to be sure they
are alone,
and turns to COWBOY.

      JOKER
Leonard talks
to his rifle.

COWBOY keeps mopping.

      COWBOY
Yeah!


JOKER
I don't think Leonard can hack it anymore. I
think
Leonard's a Section Eight.

Pause.

      COWBOY
It don't
surprise me.

They both go back to mopping.

JOKER speaks again after
some silence.

      JOKER
I want to slip my tubesteak into
your sister.
What'll you take in trade?

      COWBOY

What have you got?


39 EXT. FIRING RANGE--DAY

HARTMAN kneels behind
PYLE, looking on with
approval.

PYLE finishes a good group and
reloads his M-14.

      HARTMAN
Outstanding, Private Pyle! I
think we've
finally found something that you do well!


PYLE
Sir, yes, sir!


40 EXT. PARADE DECK--DAY

HARTMAN inspects
the recruits.

      HARTMAN
      (to JOKER)
What's
your sixth General Order?

      JOKER
Sir, the private's
sixth general order is to
receive and obey and to pass on to the
sentry
who relieves me ... all orders ... Sir, the
private's
sixth ... Sir, the private has been
instructed but he does not know,
sir!

      HARTMAN
You slimy scumbag, get on your face and
give
me twenty-five!

      JOKER
Sir, aye-aye, sir!


HARTMAN walks to PYLE.

      HARTMAN
How many counts in that
movement you've
just executed?

      PYLE
Sir, four
counts, sir!

      HARTMAN
What's the idea of looking down in
the
chamber?

      PYLE
Sir, that is the guarantee that
the private is
not giving the inspecting officer a loaded

weapon, sir!

      HARTMAN
What's your fifth general order?


PYLE
Sir, the private's fifth general order is to quit
my post
only when properly relieved, sir!

      HARTMAN
What's this
weapon's name, Private Pyle?

      PYLE
Sir, the private's
weapon's name is Charlene,

      HARTMAN
Private Pyle, you
are definitely born again
hard! Hell, I may even allow you to serve
as a
rifleman in my beloved Corps.

      PYLE
Sir, yes,
sir!

41 EXT. PARRIS ISLAND STREET--DAY

HARTMAN double-timing the
recruits, calling
cadence.

      HARTMAN
I don't want no

HARTMAN
I just want my M-14.

      RECRUITS
I just want
my M-14.

      HARTMAN
If I die in the combat zone.


RECRUITS
If I die in the combat zone.

      HARTMAN
Box

      RECRUITS
Box me up and ship me
home.

      HARTMAN
Pin my medals upon my chest.

DISSOLVE TO:


42 EXT. FOREST--DAY

Woods. For the
first time the platoon marches in
full combat gear carrying rifles.


JOKER

They are
ready to eat their own guts and ask
for seconds.


43 EXT.
FIELD--DAY

In full combat gear and with fixed bayonets, the
recruits
charge through green smoke.

      JOKER
      (narration)

The drill instructors are proud to see that we
are growing beyond
their control. The Marine
Corps does not want robots. The Marine

Corps wants killers. The Marine Corps wants
to build indestructible
men, men without fear.


44 INT. BARRACKS--DAY

HARTMAN talks to the
recruits formed up in a
school-circle.

      HARTMAN
Today

Today you are marines. You're part
of a
brotherhood.


45 EXT. PARADE GROUND--DAY

Graduation. A
marching band. Spectators.
Hundreds of marines parade by in dress
uniform.

      HARTMAN
      (voice over)
From now on,
until the day you die, wherever
you are, every marine is your
brother. Most of
you will go to Vietnam. Some of you will not

come back. But always remember this:
marines die, that's what we're
here for! But
the Marine Corps lives forever. And that
means
you live forever!

DISSOLVE TO:

HARTMAN

You gotta

      JOKER

Sir, I wrote for my high school newspaper, sir!

      HARTMAN

Jesus H. Christ, you're not a writer, you're
a killer!


JOKER
A killer, yes, sir!

      HARTMAN
Gomer Pyle!


PYLE doesn't answer.

      HARTMAN
Gomer Pyle!

We see PYLE
in close-up, now completely with-
drawn, barely able to answer HARTMAN.


PYLE
Sir, yes, sir!

      HARTMAN
You forget your
fucking name? O-three-
hundred, Infantry. You made it. Perkins!


PERKINS
Sir, yes, sir!


47 INT. BARRACKS--NIGHT

The platoon
sleeps. JOKER walks slowly down the
squad bay with a flashlight.


JOKER
      (Itarration)
Our last night on the island. I draw
fire
watch.

JOKER hears a muffled sound. He isn't sure where
it
comes from. He slowly enters the latrine.


48 INT. LATRINE--NIGHT


Running his flashlight across the room JOKER Sees
PYLE sitting on a
toilet, loading a magazine for
his M-14 rifle.

PYLE looks up at
JOKER and smiles. It is a
frightening smile.

      PYLE

(strange voice)
Hi, Joker.

JOKER stares at PYLE for a few
seconds.

PYLE has suite clearly snapped.

      JOKER
Are
those ... live rounds?

      PYLE
Seven-six-two millimeter,
full metal jacket.

PYLE smiles grotesquely.

      JOKER

Leonard .. . if Hartman comes in here and
catches us, we'll both be
in a world of shit.

      PYLE
I am .. . in a world . . . of
shit!

PYLE gets to his feet, snaps his rifle to port arms,
and
starts executing the Manual ofArms.

      PYLE

(shouting)
Left shoulder ... hut! Right shoulder ...
hut! Lock
and load! Order ... hut!

PYLE picks up the loaded magazine, inserts it
into
the rifle and smartly brings the rifle down to the
order arms
position.

      PYLE
      (shouting)
This is my rifle!
There are many like it, but
this one is mine.


49 INT. BARRACKS
HALLWAY--NIGHT

By now the platoon is awake.

HARTMAN bursts from his
room, wearing his
skivvies and D.I. hat.

      PYLE

(offscreen)
My rifle is my best friend! It is my life!


HARTMAN
Get back in your bunks!

      PYLE
      (o.s.)

I must master it as I must master my life!
Without me ...


50 INT.
LATRINES--NIGHT

HARTMAN Storms into the latrine.

      HARTMAN

What is this Mickey Mouse shit? What in the
name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals
doing in my head?
      (to JOKER)
Why is
Private Pyle out of his bunk after
lights out?! Why is Private Pyle
holding that
weapon? Why aren't you stomping Private
Pyle's
guts out?

      JOKER
Sir, it is the private's duty to inform
the
Senior Drill Instructor that Private Pyie has a
full
magazine and has locked and loaded, sir!

HARTMAN and PYLE look at each
other. PYLE Smiles
from the depths of his own hell.

HARTMAN focuses
all of his considerable powers of
intimidation, into his best John-
Wayne-on-Suribachi
voice.

      HARTMAN
Now you listen to
me, Private Pyle, and,you
listen good. I want that weapon, and I
want it
now! You will place that rifle on the deck at
your feet
and step back away from it.

With a twisted smile on his face pyLE
POintS his
rifle at HARTMAN.

HARTMAN look suddenly calm. His eyes,
his manner
are those of a wanderer who has found his home.


HARTMAN
What is your major malfunction, numbnuts?!!
Didn't
Mommy and Daddy show you enough
attention when you were a child?!!!


BANG!

The round hits HARTMAN in the chest.

He falls back dead.


JOKER and PYLE stand looking at the body.

Then PYLE looks at JoKER and
slowly raises his rifle.

      JOKER
       (trembling)

Easy, Leonard. Go easy, man.

PYLE breathes heavily, and Keeps the
rifle aimed at
JOKER.

JOKER is scared shitless.

PYLE looks at
JOKER for several seconds and slowly
lowers the rifle. Then he stumbles
back a few steps
and sits down, heavily on the toilet.

PYLE turns
away from JOKER and stares into space,
a strangely peaceful look
transforming his face.

He places the muzzle of the rifle in his mouth.


JOKER
No!!!

BANG!

PYLE pulls the trigger and blows the back of
his
head over the white tiled wall behind him.


SCENE FADES TO BLACK


FADE IN:


51 EXT. DA NANG STREET, VIETNAM--DAY

Motorcycles, cars,
Vietnamese civilians. Swinging
her hips ruith exaggerated sexiness, an
attractive
HOOKER in a mini-skirt walks toward a cafe' table
on the
pavement ulhere JOKER and RAFTERMAN are
seated.

Music: Nancy
Sinatra's "These Boots Are Made
for Walking."

The girl stops at
JOKER's table.

      HOOKER
Hey, baby, you got girlfriend
Vietnam?

      JOKER
Not just this minute.


HOOKER
Well, baby, me so horny. Me so horny. Me
love you long
time. You party?

      JOKER
Yeah, we might party. How much?


HOOKER
Fifteen dolla.

      JOKER
Fifteen dollars for
both of us?

      HOOKER
No. Each you fifteen dolla. Me love

      JOKER
Fifteen dollar

      HOOKER
Me

      JOKER
Five dollars
is all my mom allows me to

      HOOKER
Okay! Ten
dolla each.

      JOKER
What do we get for ten dollars?


HOOKER
Everything you want.

      JOKER
Everything?


HOOKER
Everything.

      JOKER
Well, old buddy, feel
like spending some of
your hard-earned money?

      RAFTERMAN

Just a minute.

RAFTERMAN raises his Nikon and starts
photographing
JOKER and the HOOKER.

The girl strikes quick poses for the camera and

coughs.

JOKER puts his arm around her.

      JOKER
You
know, half these gook whores are serving
officers in the Viet Cong.


The girl coughs again.

      JOKER
The other half have got
T.B. Make sure you
only fuck the ones that cough.

A young
vietnamese boy walks up behind
RAFTERMAN and grabs the Nikon camera
from his
hands.

The boy runs to an accomplice sitting on a waiting

motorbike and tosses the camera to him. Then in
mockery the BOY
excecutes a few, Bruce Lee moves
before jumping on the bike and zooming
off:

JOKER laughs.

DISSOLVE TO

JOKER and RAFTERMAN walk down the base street
past rows of

      JOKER
That little sucker really had some
moves on
him, didn't he?

      RAFTERMAN
Yeah ... You
know what really pisses me off
about these people?


JOKER
What?

      RAFTERMAN
We're supposed to be
helping them and they
shit all over us every chance they get ... I

just can't feature that.

      JOKER
Don't take it too hard,
Rafterman. It's just
business.

      RAFTERMAN
I hate Da
Nang, Joker. I want to go out into
the field. I've been in this
country almost
three months, and all I do is take handshake

shots at awards ceremonies.

      JOKER
You get wasted your
first day in the field and
it'd be my fault.

      RAFTERMAN

A high school girl could do my job. I want to
get out into the shit.
I want to get some
trigger time.

      JOKER
If you get
killed, your mom will find me after
I rotate back to the world and
she'll beat the
shit out of me. That's a negative, Rafterman.


54
INT. SEA-TIGER HUT--DAY

A Quonset hut. An editorial meeting of The Sea

Tiger, the official marine newspaper, is in progress
presided over by
LIEUTENANT LOCKHART.

JOKER, RAFTERMAN, and six other marine

correspondens are seated around a large messy
table covered with
cameras, photographs,
newspapers artd magazines.

      LOCKHART

Okay, guys, let's keep it short and sweet
today. Anybody got
anything new?

      JOKER
There's a rumor going around that
the Tet
ceasefire is gonna be cancelled.

      LOCKHART

Rear-echelon paranoia.

      JOKER
A bro in Intelligence says
Charlie might try to
pull off something big during the Tet holiday.


LOCKHART
They say the same thing every year.

      JOKER

There's a lot of talk about it, sir.

      LOCKHART
I
wouldn't lose any sleep over it. The Tet
holiday's like the Fourth
of July, Christmas
and New Year all rolled into one. Every

zipperhead in Nam, North and South, will be
banging gongs, barking
at the moon and
visiting his dead relatives.

      LOCKHART

All right ...Ann-Margret and entourage are
due here next week. I
want someone to be
there on the airfield and stick with her for a

couple of days. Uh, Rafterman, you take it.

      RAFTERMAN

Aye-aye, sir.

      LOCKHART
Get me some good low-angle
stuff. Don't make
it too obvious, but I want to see fur and early

morning dew.

      RAFTERMAN
Yes, sir.

      LOCKHART

(reading)
"Diplomats in Dungarees--Marine engineers
lend a
helping hand rebuilding Dong Phuc
villages . . ." Chili, if we move
Vietnamese,
they are evacuees. If they come to us to be

evacuated, they are refugees.

      CHILI
I'll make a note of
it, sir.

      LOCKHART
      (reading)
"N.V.A. Soldier
Deserts After Reading
Pamphlets --A young North Vietnamese Army

regular, who realized his side could not win
the war, deserted from
his unit after reading
Open Arms program pamphlets." That's good,

Dave. But why say North Vietnamese Army
regular? Is there an
irregular? How about
North Vietnamese Army soldier?


DAVE
I'll fix it up, sir.

      LOCKHART
Lawrence Welk
Show's gonna go out on TV in
two weeks. Dave, do a hundred words on
it.
AFTV'll give you some background stuff.

      DAVE

Yes, sir.

      LOCKHART
      (reading)
"Not While
We're Eating--N.V.A. learn
marines on a search and destroy mission
don't
like to be interrupted while eating chow."
Search and
destroy. Uh, we have a new
directive from M.A.F. on this. In the
future, in
place of"search and destroy," substitute the
phrase
"sweep and clear." Got it?

      JOKER
Got it. Very catchy.


LOCKHART
And, Joker ... where's the weenie?

      JOKER

Sir!

      LOCKHART
The Kill, JOKER. The kill. I mean, all
that fire,
the grunts must've hit something.

      JOKER

Didn't see 'em.

      LOCKHART
Joker, I've told you, we run
two basic stories
here. Grunts who give half their pay to buy

gooks toothbrushes and deodorants--Winning
of Hearts and
Minds--okay? And combat
action that results in a kill--Winning the
War.
Now you must have seen blood trails ... drag
marks?


JOKER
It was raining, sir.

      LOCKHART
Well, that's
why God passed the law of
probability. Now rewrite it and give it a
happy
ending--say, uh, one kill. Make it a sapper or
an
officer. Which?

      JOKER
Whichever you say.


LOCKHART
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

      JOKER

Okay, an officer. How about a general?

A few laughs.


LOCKHART
Joker, maybe you'd like our guys to read the
paper and
feel bad. I mean, in case you didn't

know it, this is not a
particularly popular war.
Now, it is our job to report the news that

these why-are-we-here civilian newsmen
ignore.

      JOKER

Sir, maybe you should go out on some ops
yourself. I'm sure you
could find a lot more
blood trails and drag marks.

Some laughs.


LOCKHART
JOKER, I've had my ass in the grass. Can't say
I liked
it much. Lots of bugs and too
dangerous. As it happens, my present
duties
keep me where I belong. In the rear with the
gear.

Aw, you weren't

Payback. You weren't even in country.


PAYBACK
Eat shit and die, you fucking Spanish-

JOKER

Don't listen to any of

You listen to Joker, new guy. He knows

Very little. You know he's never been in the
shit,'cause
he ain't got the stare.

      RAFTERMAN
The stare?


PAYBACK
The thousand-yard stare. A marine gets it
after he's
been in the shit for too long. It's like
... it's like you've really
seen beyond. I got it.
All field marines got it. And you'll have it
too.

      RAFTERMAN
I will?

      STORK
Hey,
Payback. How do you stop five black
dudes from raping a white chick?


PAYBACK
Fuck you, Stork.

      STORK
Throw'em a
basketball.

Laughter.

They are startled by the dull boom of mortar
shells
outside.

      DAVE
Incoming.

      PAYBACK

Oh, shit!

      CHILI
They're outgoing.

      DAVE

That ain't outgoing!

Some closer explosions, much louder.


CHILI
That ain't outgoing!

      DAVE
Now what I just
say?

The men grab their helmets, flak jackets and
weapons and run
outside.

      RAFTERMAN
Joker, is this for real?


JOKER
Yes, it is, Rafterman.


57 EXT. DA NANG BASE--NIGHT

Men

lands in the distance, then
others nearer. Fires
are breaking out.


58 INT. BUNKER--NIGHT

JOKER
loads an M-60 machine gun, then hunches
down watching the main gate of
the perimeter.

      JOKER
Hey, I hope they're just fucking
with us. I
ain't ready for this shit.

      STORK
Amen.


The sound ofa truck approaching.

The marines get set.

The truch
smashes though the gates.

The marines open fire.

The truck is hit
by a hail of automatic fire; it
explodes and starts burning.

N.V.A.
troops follow the truck through the gate.

The attackers are cut down
by a withering fire
from the marines.

The attack peters out.


People yell, "Cease fire."

The firing trails off:

Prisoners are led past.

      LOCKHART

(voice over)
The enemy has very deceitfully taken
advantage of
the Tet ceasefire to launch an
offensive all over the country. So
far, we've
had it pretty easy here. But we seem to be
the
exception.


60 INT. SEA-TIGER OFFICE--DAWN

Dirty and still in. their
combat gear, JOKER,
RAFTERMAN, PAYBACK and the other correspondents

are slumped in, their chairs around the table.

      LOCKHART

(walking)
Charlie has hit every major military target
in
Vietnam, and hit 'em hard. In Saigon, the
United States Embassy has
been overrun by

suicide squads. Khe Sahn is standing by to
be
overrun. We also have reports that a divi-
sion of N.V.A. has
occupied all of the city of
Hue south of the Perfume River. In
strate-
gic terms, Charlie's cut the country in
half... the
civilian press are about to wet
their pants and we've heard even
Cronkite's
going to say the war is now unwinnable.
In other
words, it's a huge shit sandwich,
and we're all gonna have to take a
bite.

Long, serious pause.

      JOKER
Sir ... does this
mean that Ann-Margret's not
coming?

Laughter.


LOCKHART
      (pissed off)
Joker.... I want you to get
straight up to Phu
Bai. Captain January will need all his people.


JOKER
Yes, sir.

      LOCKHART
And Joker, you will take
off that damn button.
How's it gonna look if you get killed wearing

a peace symbol?

      RAFTERMAN
Sir? Permission to go with
Joker?

      LOCKHART
Permission granted.


RAFTERMAN
Thank you, sir.

      JOKER
Sir, permission
not to take Rafterman with
me?

      LOCKHART
You still

We see Vietnamese below running and falling.


DOORGUNNER
Get some ... get some ... get some ... get

yeah ... yeah ... get some ... get

After a while the
DOORGUNNER stops firing and
grins at JOKER.

      DOORGUNNER

(shouting to be heard)
Anyone who runs is a V.C. Anyone who

stands still is a well-disciplined V.C.
      (laughs)
You
guys oughtta do a story about me
sometime.

      JOKER

Why should we do a story about you?

      DOORGUNNER
'Cause
I'm so fucking good! That ain't no
shit neither. I've done got me
one hundred
and fifty-seven dead gooks killed. And fifty
water
buffaloes, too. Them're all certified.

RAFTERMAN gags.


JOKER
Any women or children?

      DOORGUNNER
Sometimes.


JOKER
How can you shoot women and children?

RAFTERMAN gags.


DOORGUNNER
Easy. You just don't lead 'em so much.

Excuse me! Sir ... we're

Cowboy there.

      TOUCHDOWN
You people one-one?


JOKER
No, sir. We're reporters for Stars and Stripes.


TOUCHDOWN
Stars and Stripes.

      JOKER
Yes, sir.


TOUCHDOWN
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander. Cowboy's
just down
the road in the platoon area.

      JOKER
Oh. You mind if we
tag along, sir?

      TOUCHDOWN
No problem. Welcome aboard.
By the way, my
name's Schinoski. Walter J. Schinoski. My
people
call me Mister Touchdown. I played a
little ball for Notre Dame.


JOKER
Notre Dame?

      TOUCHDOWN
      (laughing)

Yeah.

      JOKER
All right!

      TOUCHDOWN
You
here to make Cowboy famous?

      JOKER
Ha! Never happen,
sir.

      TOUCHDOWN
Well, if you people came looking for a

this is your lucky day. We got Condition Red

definitely expecting rain.

      JOKER
Outstanding, sir. We
taking care of business?

      TOUCHDOWN
Well, the N.V.A. are
dug in deep. Hotel
Company's still working this side of the river.

Street by street and house by house. Charlie's

definitely got his
shit together. But we're still
getting some really decent kills
here.

      JOKER
We heard some scuttlebutt, sir, about the

N.V.A. executing a lot of gook civilians.

      TOUCHDOWN

That's affirmative. I saw some bodies about

Can you show me where, sir?


TOUCHDOWN
Here's the canal...


65 EXT. MASS GRAVE--DAY

JOKER
stands looking down into a large open grave
at a row of white,
lime-covered corpses.

Journalists, marines and civilians are grouped

around the grave.

A work detail leans on their shovels, their faces

covered with bandanas against the stench.

      JOKER

(voice over)
The dead have been covered with lime. The
dead
only know one thing. It is better to be
alive.

JOKER approaches a
young lieutenant-- CLEVES.

      JOKER
Excuse me. Good
morning, Lieutenant.

      LT. CLEVES
Good morning.


JOKER
I make it twenty. Is that the official body
count, sir?


LT. CLEVES
      (sharply)
What outfit are you men with?


JOKER
Sir, we're reporters from Stars and Stripes.

      LT.
CLEVES
      (warms up)
Oh, I see.

      JOKER
I'm
Sergeant Joker and this photographer's
Rafterman.

RAFTERMAN
starts shooting pictures of the
Lieutenant.

      LT. CLEVES

I'm Lieutenant Cleves. I'm from Hartford,
Connecticut.


JOKER
Have you got a body count, sir?

      LT. CLEVES

We think it's twenty.

      JOKER
Do you know how it
happened, sir?

      LT. CLEVES
Well, it seems the N.V.A.
came in with a list
of gook names. Government officials,

policemen, ARVN officers, schoolteachers.
They went around their
houses real polite and
asked them to report the next day for
political
re-education. Everybody who turned up got
shot. Some
they buried alive.

A marine COLONEL who has been watching JOKER

turns from the group arourzd the grave and strides
up. JOKER snaps to
attention.

      COLONEL
Marine !

      LT. CLEVES

Colonel.

      COLONEL
Marine, what is that button on your
body
armor?

      JOKER
A peace symbol, sir.


COLONEL
Where'd you get it?

      JOKER
I don't
remember, sir.

      COLONEL
What is that you've got written
on your
helmet?

      JOKER
"Born to Kill," sir.


COLONEL
You write "Born to Kill" on your helmet and
you wear a
peace button. What's that
supposed to be, some kind of sick joke?!


JOKER
No, sir.

      COLONEL
You'd better get your head
and your ass wired
together, or I will take a giant shit on you!


JOKER
Yes, sir.

      COLONEL
Now answer my question or
you'll be standing
tall before the man.

      JOKER
I
think I was trying to suggest something
about the duality of man,
sir.

      COLONEL
The what?

      JOKER
The
duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.

      COLONEL
Whose
side are you on, son?

      JOKER
Our side, sir.


COLONEL
Don't you love your country?

      JOKER
Yes,
sir.

      COLONEL
Then how about getting with the program?

Why don't you jump on the team and come
on in for the big win?


JOKER
Yes, sir!

      COLONEL
Son, all I've ever asked
of my marines is that
they obey my orders as they would the word

of God. We are here to help the Vietnamese,
because inside every
gook there is an
American trying to get out. It's a hardball

world, son. We've gotta keep our heads until
this peace craze blows
over.

Oh, you seen much combat?

JOKER returns the smile.

great days we're living, bros!'We are jolly

DOC JAY crawls to him and starts mouth-to-mouth.

SERGEANT
MURPHY crawls up, has a look, moves to

CRAZY EARL, keeping low,
scrambles up to the
LUSTHOG SQUAD.

      CRAZY EARL
Okay.
Lusthog Squad, listen up! We're gonna
move up these two roads here

First and second fire team behind me up this
other road, okay?


Adlibs of "Right!" and "Okay!"

      CRAZY EARL
Let's go!
Let's get it done!

Bending low the squad moves out past the tanks,

leapfrogging toward some ruined buildings a couple
of hundred yards in
front of them.

HAND JOB peers cautiously around the corner of a

house and is killed instantly by a burst of
automatic fire.

ANIMAL
MOTHER opens fire with his M-60 machine
gun at some windows where the
shots came from.

Everyone opens fire, blasting chunks out of the

building with a zillion rounds.

T.H.E. ROCK fires an M-79 grenade,

RAFTERMAN photographs the action, his Nikon

violently shaking.

The fire slackens.

Then it gets quiet.

All

They reload.

As CRAZY EARL reloads he spots six V.C. dashing
across
the street fifty yards away. They are out of
sight in a second.


Having missed his first chance, CRAZY EARL gets
set hoping for another.


Two more V.C. rush out into the open. He fires a

Freedom.

Tough break for Hand Job. He was all set to

Well ... like, like you see, you know, it's a
major city, so we have
to assault with, uh ...
tanks. So, they send us in first squad ...
to
make sure that there are no little Vietnamese
waiting with,
like, B-40 rockets that blow the
tanks away. So we clear it out and
we roll the
tanks in and ... basically, blow the place to
hell.

(chuckles)

      COWBOY
When we're in Hue ... when we're in
Hue City
... it's like a war. You know like what I
thought
about a war, what I thought a war
was, was supposed to be. There's
the enemy,
kill 'em.

      RAFTERMAN
Well, I don't think
there's any question about
it. I mean we're the best. I mean all
that
bullshit about the Air Cav ... When the shit
really hits
the fan, who do they call? They call
Mother Green and her killing
machine!

      CRAZY EARL
Do I think America belongs in
Vietnam? Um

you that.

REPORTER
Sure.

      DOC JAY

"I will not send American boys eight or ten
thousand miles around
the world to do a job
that Asian boys oughtta be doin' for

themselves."

      EIGHTBALL
Personally, I think, uh ... they
don't really
want to be involved in this war. I mean ...
they
sort of took away our freedom and gave it
to the, to the gookers,
you know. But they
don't want it. They'd rather be alive than free,

I guess. Poor dumb bastards.

      COWBOY
Well, the ones I'm
... I'm fighting at are some
pretty bad boys. I'm not real keen on
... some
of these fellows that are . . . supposed to be on
our
side. I keep meeting'em coming the other
way. Yeah.


DONLON
I mean, we're getting killed for these people
and they
don't even appreciate it. They think
it's a big joke.


ANIMAL MOTHER
Well, if you ask me, uh, we're shooting the
wrong
gooks.

      RAFTERMAN
Well, it depends on the situation. I
mean,
I'm--I'm here to take combat photos. But if
the shit gets
too thick, I mean, I'll go to the
rifle.

      ANIMAL MOTHER

What do I think about America's involvement
in the war? Well, I
think we should win.

      COWBOY
I hate Vietnam. There's not
one horse in this
whole country. They don't have one horse in

Vietnam. There's something basically wrong
with that.

(laughs)

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Well, if they'd send us more
guys and maybe
bomb the hell out of the North, they might,
uh,
they might give up.

      JOKER
I wanted to see exotic
Vietnam, the jewel of

Southeast Asia. I wanted to meet interesting

and stimulating people of an ancient culture
and ... kill them. I
wanted to be the first kid
on my block to get a confirmed kill.

and only dropped once.

Laughter and derisive adlibs.

      ARVN
PIMP
      (angry)
Okay, five dolla. You give me.

Adlibs.


COWBOY
Okay, okay!

EIGHTBALL, a black grunt, walks up to the
girl.

      EIGHTBALL
Let's get mounted.

      HOOKER

(speaks in Vietnamese)

      ARVN PIMP
      (argues in
Vietnamese)

      EIGHTBALL
Something wrong there, chief?


ARVN PIMP
She says, uh, no boom-boom with soul
brotha.


EIGHTBALL
Hey, what the mother fuck?

      ARVN PIMP
She
say soul brotha too boo-coo. Too boo-coo.

      EIGHTBALL

Hey, what is this, man?

      COWBOY
      (breaiting up)

I think what he's trying to tell you is that
you black boys pack too
much meat.

Laughter.

      ARVN PIMP
Too boo-coo. Too
boo-coo.

      EIGHTBALL
Oh, shi-i-i-t! (laughs) This
baby-san looks
like she could suck the chrome off a trailer

hitch.

Laughter.

      ARVN PIMP
She say too boo-coo. Too
boo-coo.

      EIGHTBALL
Uh, excuse me, ma'am. Now what we
have
here, little yellow sister, is a magnificent...

(takes out his dick)
. . specimen of pure Alabama blacksnake.

But it ain't too goddamn boo-coo.

The girl looks at it.

Hoots and
catcalls.

      TEENAGE HOOKER
Okay. Okay. Emjee.

More
hoots.

      COWBOY
      (mimicking Vietnamese word)

Okay! Okay! Emjee! Emjee!

Adlibs of "Emjee."

EIGHTBALL starts to
lead her away.

      EIGHTBALL
All right! This is my boogie!


COWBOY
Hey, we need a batting order.

ANIMAL MOTHER grabs the
girl's arm, EIGHTBALL
holds on to the other one.

      ANIMAL
MOTHER
I'm going first.

      EIGHTBALL
Hey, now back
off, white bread. Don't get
between a dog and his meat.

ANIMAL
MOTHER slaps EIGHTBALL on the wrist like
he's a naughty boy and pushes
the girl into the
movie theater.

      ANIMAL MOTHER

(jokingly)
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

Adlibs of "Fuck
you!" and laughter.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Hey, hey! I won't be
long. I'll skip the
foreplay.

FADE IN:


74 EXT. HUE CITY
RUINS--DAY

The LUSTHOG SQUAD on patrol moves slowly in
single file,
fifteen yards apart, through the ruined,
smouldering city.


JOKER
      (voiceouer)
Intelligence passed the word down that
during
the night the N.V.A. had pulled out of our
area to
positions across the Perfume River.
Our squad is sent on patrol to
check out the
report.

75 INT. BOMBED FACTORY--DAY

The patrol
moves carefully through the gutted shell
of a building. The clink of
their gear as they walk
sounds loud in the unnatural silence.

CRAZY
EARL stops to pick up a child's stuffed toy.

BANG!

The toy triggs a
booby trap, blasting CRAZY EARL
across the room.

The squad dives for
couer.

      COWBOY
Face outboard and take cover! Do it!


DOC JAY scurries up to CRAZY EARL, who is
unconscious and gives him
mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.

COWBOY scrambles up to them. He looks
at CRAZY
EARL. Then JOKER runs in.

      DOC JAY

(stops for a second)
He aidt gonna make it.

      COWBOY

(to himself)
Shit.

COWBOY doesn't know, what to do. Then he
fumbles
for his field radio.

      COWBOY
Hotel One Actual,
this is Cowboy!

DOC JAY continues the mouth-to-mouth.


COWBOY
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy!

      MURPHY

(o.s.)
Hotel One. Over

      COWBOY
Murph, this is
Cowboy. Craze is hit. Booby
trap.

      MURPHY

(o.s.)
Roger. Understand. Wait One.

COWBOY looks around edgily.


MURPHY
      (o.s.)
You're senior N.C.O. You take charge and

continue on with the patrol. Call in at the
next checkpoint. Over.


COWBOY
Roger. Out.

COWBOY stares at the radio. He looks scared.
He
turns to JOKER.

      COWBOY
I'm squad leader.

JOKER
punches him reassuringly in the arm.

      JOKER
I'll follow
you anywhere, scumbag.

DOC JAY stops working over CRAZY EARL and
slowly
looks up.

      DOC JAY
He's dead.

The three men
stare at the body.

76 EXT. BURNING FALLEN BUILDING--DAY

The squad
moves past a burning five-storey
building that has collapsed and is
lying on its side.


DISSOLVE TO:


77 EXT. LOW CONCRETE WALL--DAY


EIGHTBALL, on point, studies a map as he walks.
Then he slours to a
stop and signals to halt the
squad.

The squad stops ancl crouches
down in the rubble.

EIGHTBALL gestures for COWBOY to move up.


EIGHTBALL
      (quietly)
Cowboy!

COWBOY moves up and they
kneel behind a low
concrete wall.

      COWBOY
What's up?


EIGHTBALL
I think we made a mistake at the last
checkpoint.


He shows COWBOY the map.

      EIGHTBALL
Here ... see what
you think. I think we're
here and we should be here.

COWBOY
studies the map.

      COWBOY
We're here?


EIGHTBALL
Yeah.

      COWBOY
We should be here?


EIGHTBALL
Yeah ...yeah ... that's right.

COWBOY is confused and
scared.

He checks his compass. Then he peers over the wall
through
his binoculars.

COWBOY looks back nervously at the squacl strung
out
behind him.

      COWBOY
Fuck ... What do you think?


EIGHTBALL
Well, I think we should change direction.

EIGHTBALL
doesn't sound like he really knows what
to do either.

COWBOY knows
he has to make a decision.

      COWBOY
Okay. We'll change
direction.

COWBOY motions to the squad to come up. They
rattle up
and take positions behind the low wall.

      JOKER
What's
up?

      COWBOY
Changing direction.

      JOKER

What, are we lost?

      COWBOY
Joker, shut the fuck up!


COWBOY
      (to squad)
Okay! Listen up! Can you hear me?


Adlibs of "Yeah!"

      COWBOY
Okay, we're changing
direction. We're heading
over that way.

COWBOY points over the
wall to some ruined
buildings across an open space to their Left.


COWBOY
Eightball's gonna go out and see if he can
find a way
through.

EIGHTBALL shrugs, apprehensiuely.

      COWBOY

Got it?

Adlibs of "Yeah!"

      COWBOY
Eightball ... let's
dance.

EIGHTBALL slowly gets to his Knees and peers
over the wall.


EIGHTBALL
Put a nigger behind the trigger.


78 EXT. RUINED STREET
HUE--DAY

EIGHTBALL climbs over the low wall and moves
cautiously out
into the open, heading for the
damaged buildings.

The squad covers
him.

EIGHTBALL reaches the buildings and stops to
study the
smoke-filled square.


79 SNIPER P.O.V. -- DAY

P.O.V. from a concealed
position on the second
floor of a building on the square, an AK-47
rifle is
slowly raised and aimed at EIGHTBALL.

EIGHTBALL turns back
to wave the rest of the
squad up.

BANG!

The SNIPER fires.


EIGHTBALL is hit in the leg.

Seen in slow motion, EIGHTBALL twists and

crumples to the ground.

The LUSTHOG SQUAD fires blindly, wildly, at
every
door and window in the direction of the shot.

      COWBOY

Okay, cease fire! Cease fire, goddamn it!

Some of the squad keep
firing.

      COWBOY
Cool it, goddamn it! Cool it! Cease
fire!

AdLibs of "Cease fire!"

The firing stutters to a stop.


COWBOY
Okay, listen up! Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody
see anything?

      T.H.E. ROCK
      (down the line)

Did anybody see a sniper?

      DOC JAY
No!


DONLON
Nothing!

      RAFTERMAN
Negative!


T.H.E. ROCK
Nothing!

Adlibs of "No!"

      COWBOY

Okay, then save your ammo! Nobody fire till I
tell you!

Seen, in
slow, motion, the SNIPER fires again and hits
EIGHTBALL in the arm. He
screams in pain.

The squad opens fire at buildings facing them.


COWBOY
No, no! Cease fire! Cease fire! Animal, cease
fire!


Keeping low, DONLON comes up and hands COWBOY
the radio.


DONLON
Cowboy, it's Sergeant Murphy.

      COWBOY

(into radio)
This is Cowboy. Over.

      MURPHY

(o.s.)
This is Murphy. What is your present
position? Over.


COWBOY
Murph, we're receiving enemy sniper fire.
Eightball is
down. Our position is about half
a klick north of checkpoint four.
Believe pos-
sible strong enemy force occupying buildings
in
front of us. Request immediate tank
support. Over.


MURPHY
      (o.s.)
Roger. Understand. I'll see what I can do.

Over.

      COWBOY
Roger. Over and out.

      COWBOY

(to Donlon)
Stay close.

      DONLON
Got it.

COWBOY
thinks hard for a few seconds.

      COWBOY
      (to squad)

Okay, listen up! I think we're being set up
for an ambush. I think
there may be strong
enemy forces in those buildings over there.

I've requested tank support. We're gonna sit
tight until it comes,
but keep your eyes open.
If they decide to hit us, we'll have to
pull
back fast.

The SNIPER fires, wounding EIGHTBALL again, this

time in the foot. He shrieks in agony.

Again the squad opens fire.


COWBOY
Goddamn it! Hold! Cease your fire, Mother!
Cease your
fucking fire!

The firing stops.

      DOC JAY
Cowboy!


COWBOY
What?

      DOC JAY
We can't leave him out there!


COWBOY
We're not leaving him! We'll get him when the
tank comes
up.

      DOC JAY
He's hit three fucking times! He can't wait

that long!

      COWBOY
I've seen this before! That sniper's
just trying
to suck us in one at a time!

The SNIPER fires and
hits EIGHTBALL in the thigh.
His cries echo across the open space
ground.

ANIMAL MOTHER fires madly.

      COWBOY

(shouting)
Goddamn it! No!

The squad continues firing.


COWBOY
Goddamn it, cease fire!

The firing trails off:


ANIMAL MOTHER
He's out there alone!

      COWBOY
Cease
fire!

The firing stops.

      DOC JAY
Man, fuck this, fuck
this shit! I'm going out to
bring him in!

      COWBOY

No! You stay the fuck down!

      DOC JAY
Cover me!

DOC
JAY jumps over the wall and, ducking low, zig-
zags across the open
ground.

The squad fires to cover him.

DOC JAY gets there safely and
momentarily drops out
of sight.

      COWBOY
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it! Okay, cease fire!
He's there!

Adlibs of "Cease fire!"



80 SNIPER P.O.V.--DAY

DOC JAY, Seen over the sights of the SNIPER's
AK-47,
drags EIGHTBALL toward cover.


81 EXT. THE SQUARE--DAY

The
SNIPER fires. DOC JAY is hit and falls next to
EIGHTBALL.

The squad
opens fire again.

      COWBOY
Hold your fire! Hold your
fire!!! Cease fire!
You can't see the sniper! Save the ammo!

Nobody fire till I tell you! Nobody!

      ANIMAL MOTHER
What
the fuck do we do now, Cowboy?

      COWBOY
Gimme that
fucking radio.

DONLON scuttles over with the radio.


COWBOY
      (into radio)
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.


MURPHY
      (o.s.)
This is Murphy. Over.

      COWBOY

Murph, we're in some deep shit. I got two men
down. What's the story
on that fucking tank?
Over.

      MURPHY
      (o.s.)

Sorry, Cowboy. No luck so far with the tank.
Will advise. Over.


COWBOY
Roger. Out.
      (muttering to himself)
Numbnut
bastards!
      (to the squad)
Okay, listen up!


T.H.E. ROCK
Listen up!

      COWBOY
Can't afford to wait
for the tank. I think
they're gonna hit us any minute. When they

do we won't have time to pull out. We gotta do
it now. Let's get
ready to move.

No one moves or says anything.

      T.H.E. ROCK

Get ready to pull out!

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Wait a minute!
Hold it! Hold it! Nobody's
pulling out! There's only one fucking
sniper
out there!

      COWBOY
Back off, Mother! I'm
calling the plays! I say
we're pulling out!

      ANIMAL
MOTHER
Yeah, well, what about Doc Jay and Eightball?


COWBOY
I know it's a shitty thing to do, but we can't
refuse to
accept the situation.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Yeah, well, we're
not leaving Doc Jay and
Eightball out there!

      COWBOY

Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted! You know
that!

      ANIMAL
MOTHER
Bullshit! Come on, you guys! We gotta go
bring'em back!
Let's go get 'em! Let's do it!

      COWBOY
Stand down,
Mother! That's a direct order!

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Fuck you,
Cowboy! Fuck all you assholes!

ANIMAL MOTHER jumps over the wall and
runs
screaming and firing his M-60.

The squad fires to cover him,
blasting chunks of
mortar and concrete from the buildings.


ANIMAL MOTHER
      (screaming)
Fucking son-of-a-bitch! You
motherfucker!
Aaagh! Whooo!

ANIMAL MOTHER reaches the buildings
and drops
down against a shattered wall. He calls across the
open
street.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Doc! Doc! Doc! Where's the
sniper?

DOC JAY tries to speak.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Doc,
where's the sniper?

Barely able to move, DOC JAY tries to point in the

direction of the SNIPER.

Suddenly he and EIGHTBALL are riddled by a
burst
of automatic fire from the SNIPER, Killing them
instantly.


ANIMAL MOTHER's eyes widen in horror.

      ANIMAL MOTHER

(under his breath)
Shit!

ANIMAL MOTHER gets to his feet and edges
forward to
the corner of the building.

He carefully looks around the
corner across the
square at the black building, from where he thinks

the shots were fired.

BANG!

A shot from the SNIPER ricochets off
the wall a few
inches from his head.

He ducks back around the
corner, breathing hard.

ANIMAL MOTHER looks around and carefully works

his way to a safer spot behind another building.

He shouts to the
squad.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Hey, Cowboy!

      COWBOY

Yeah!

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted!
There's
only one sniper, nothing else. Move up the
squad!
You're clear up to here! Come on!

COWBOY isn't sure what to do.


COWBOY
      (mutters)
Son-of-a-bitch.

The squad look to
him.

He takes a couple of thoughtful breaths and decides
to go.


COWBOY
Okay, listen up!

No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock--you
come
with me, we'll take a look! The rest of you

stay put and
cover our ass! We may be
coming back in a big hurry!


JOKER
I'm going with you.

      RAFTERMAN
I'm coming,
too.

      COWBOY
Okay.
      (To the others)
You
all set?

Adlibs "Yeah!"

      COWBOY
Let's move out!


T.H.E. ROCK
Let's do it!

The five men clamber over the wall and
dash
across the broken ground to the smouldering
cluster of
buildings.

When they reach ANIMAL MOTHER he leads them
to a street
off the square where they duck down
against a shattered building.


They catch their breath and move forward to the
next building, where
they crouch down against
the wall.

      ANIMAL MOTHER

(pointing)
Cowboy .. . top of the black building,
around the
corner.

COWBOY cautiously moves to the corner of the
building and
studies the strange-looking black
building which commands the square.


Then. he ducks back around the corner, more
uncertain than ever what
they should do.

      COWBOY
Donlon ... give me that radio.


COWBOY moves to DONLON to take the radio.
Facing away from the black
building, COWBOY does
not notice that from the place he has moved to he

can be seen. by the SNIPER through a jagged hole in
the building.

83
SNIPER P.O.V. OF COWBOY

The SNIPER's P.O.V. --COWBOY's upper body is
just
visible through the hole in the building.


84 EXT. SQUARE--DUSK



COWBOY
Murphy, this is Cowboy. Over!

A gunshot reverberates.


In slow-motion COWBOY falls.

      JOKER
Cowboy!

ANIMAL
MOTHER starts firing his M-60.

      RAFTERMAN

(shouting)
Holy shit! The sniper's got a clean shot
through the
hole in the wall.

Much yelling, shouting and confusion as the men

realize where the shot came from.

      JOKER

(shouting)
Get him! Get him the fuck outta here!!

COWBOY is
carried behind the building.

All talk at once.

      JOKER

Easy! Easy!

      DONLON
Get him on his back.

Adlibs.


COWBOY
      (weakly)
Oh, I don't believe this shit.


Adlibs, fumbling for bandages, etc.

      JOKER
Shut up!
You'll be all right, Cowboy.

      T.H.E. ROCK
Take it easy,
Cowboy.

Four pairs of hands doing things.

      COWBOY

(moaning)
Uhhh, that son-of-a-bitch!

      JOKER
You're
gonna be all right.

      T.H.E. ROCK
You're going home, man.
You're going home.

      DONLON
Easy, man. Easy. Easy.


COWBOY
Ohhhh, don't shit me, JOKER! Don't shit me!


JOKER
I wouldn't shit you, man. You're my favorite
turd.


COWBOY begins to lose consciousness.

      JOKER
Cowboy...


DONLON
Hang on, man. Hang on!

      COWBOY

(coughs)
I ... I can hack it.

      T.H.E. ROCK
You can
hack it.

      COWBOY
I can. I-I...

COWBOY spits up some
blood and dies in JOKER's
arms.

JOKER bends down and hugs COWBOY.


Nobody moves.

Then, one by one, they slowly get to their feet.
JOKER
is the last to get up.

They stand looking at the body.

ANIMAL
MOTHER leaves two men to continue firing
at the SNIPER, and he scuttles
around the corner to
the group around COWBOY's body.

He looks at
COWBOY and then at JOKER.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Let's go get
some payback.

JOKER looks up slowly.

      JOKER

(in cold anger)
Okay.

ANIMAL MOTHER leads then down a narrow
street.

They stop to take cover behind a building just off
the
square.

They have to cross the open. square, ruhich would
give the
SNIPER a clear shot at them.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Give 'em
some smoke.

He and JOKER toss three smoke grenades into the
square.
They explode ruith a dull bang.

They wait while the square slowly
fills with
smoke.

ANIMAL MOTHER waves and they run out blindly

through the thick smoke to the other side of the
square.

85 INT. BLACK
BUILDING

They work their way into the shattered, burning
building,
past twisted steel girders and huge broken
chunks of concrete.

They
come to a place where they have to split up.
ANIMAL MOTHER points one
way.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Donlon, Rock--that way. You two with
me.

DONLON and T.H.E. ROCK move off as ordered.

JOKER and RAFTERMAN
follow ANIMAL MOTHER the
other way.

They come to another place where
they have to
choose which way to go.

      ANIMAL MOTHER

(pointing)
JOKER, in there! New Guy with me.

JOKER cautiously
enters one door. ANIMAL MOTHER
and RAFTERMAN disappear through the
other.


86 INT. WRECKED AND BURNING LOBBY--DAY

JOKER finds himself in
what was the lobby of the
building, a large room, which is on fire,
with
shattered columns, oriental arches, and windows
with large
decorative grillwork.

JOKER inches slowly into the room.

He hears a
noise, ducks behind a column and peers
around it.

He sees a small, b lack-clad figure standing at a
window - the SNIPER.

He raises his
rifle, aims and squeezes the trigger.

A loud click.

In slow motion
the SNIPER turns to face JOKER.

We see the startled face of a
beautiful Vietnamese
girl of about fifteen.

In slow motion JOKER
frantically works the bolt of
his M-16.

With the hard eyes of a
grunt, the SNIPER fires her
AK-47 rifle.

In slow motion JOKER ducks
behind the column,
desperately trying to unjam his M-16 rifle.

In,
slow motion the SNIPER fires and runs down a
few steps to get a better
shot at JOKER.

The bullets from her AK-47 tear large chunks of

masonry from the column shielding him.

Suddenly the SNIPER's body
seems to explode as she
is hit by a burst of automatic fire.


RAFTERMAN has come up and fires his M-16 into the
girl's body.

JOKER
stands trembling against the shattered
column.

RAFTERMAN snaps
another M-16 magazine into
place, gestures JOKER to stay put, and moves

forward like Supergrunt to check out the rest of the
room.

It's
clear.

He moves to the window, and shouts to the two men
in the
square.

      RAFTERMAN
We got the sniper!

The SNIPER lies
on the floor, writhing in pain.

JOKER and RAFTERMAN cautiously
approach her.

RAFTERMAN kicks away her AK-47.

The two men stare at
her in disbelief:

The SNIPER is a child, no more than fifteen years

old, a slender Eurasian. angel with dark beautiful
eyes.

They are
startled by a faint sound.

They dive for cover.

They listen.


ANIMAL MOTHER calls from behind cover at the other
end of the room.


ANIMAL MOTHER
Joker?

      JOKER
Yo.

      ANIMAL
MOTHER
What's up?

      JOKER
We got the sniper.


RAFTERMAN and JOKER circle around the SNIPER as
DONLON and T.H.E. ROCK
and ANIMAL MOTHER walk
up.

      RAFTERMAN
I saved JOKER's
ass. I got the sniper. I fucking
blew her away.

RAFTERMAN laughs
hysterically, and kisses his rifle.

      RAFTERMAN
Am I bad?
Am I a life-taker? Am I a heart-
breaker?

No one pays any
attention to RAFTERMAN.

The SNIPER gasps, whimpers.

DONLON stares
at her.

      DONLON
What's she saying?

      JOKER

(after a pause)
She's praying.

      T.H.E. ROCK
No more
boom-boom for this baby-san. There's
nothing we can do for her.
She's dead meat.

ANIMAL MOTHER stares down at the SNIPER.


ANIMAL MOTHER
Okay. Let's get the fuck outta here.


JOKER
What about her?

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Fuck her. Let
her rot.

The SNIPER prays in Vietnanese.

      JOKER
We
can't just leave her here.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Hey, asshole
... Cowboy's wasted. You're
fresh out of friends. I'm running this
squad
now and I say we leave the gook for the
mother-lovin'
rats.

JOKER stares at ANIMAL MOTHER.

      JOKER
I'm not
trying to run this squad. I'm just
saying we can't leave her like
this.

ANIMAL MOTHER looks down at the SNIPER.

      SNIPER

(whimpering)
Sh . . . sh-shoot . . . me. Shoot . . . me.

ANIMAL
MOTHER looks at JOKER.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
If you want to
waste her, go on, waste her.

JOKER looks at the SNIPER.

The four
men look at JOKER.

      SNIPER
      (gasping)
Shoot .
. . me . . . shoot . . . me.

JOKER slowly lifts his pistol and looks
into her
eyes.

      SNIPER
Shoot . . . me.

JOKER jerks
the trigger.

BANG!

The four men are silent.

JOKER stares down at
the dead girl.

      RAFTERMAN
      (laughs)
JOKER ...
we're gonna have to put you up for
the Congressional Medal of...
Ugly!
      (laughs)

JOKER looks at RAFTERMAN, blankly.


DONLON
Hard core, man. Fucking hard core.


87 EXT. BURNING
CITY--NIGHT.

The platoon moves through the city, silhouetted
against
the raging fires. A scene in, hell.

      JOKER

(narration)
We have nailed our names in the pages of
history
enough for today. We hump down to
the Perfume River to set in for
the night.

The marines start to sing.

      MARINE PLATOON

      (voiceover)
My thoughts
drift back to erect nipple wet
dreams about Mary Jane Rottencrotch
and
the Great Homecoming Fuck Fantasy. I am so
happy that I am
alive, in one piece and short.
I'm in a world of shit . . . yes. But
I am alive.
And I am not afraid.

      MARINE PLATOON

(singing)
Come along and sing this song and join our
family.

M-I-C-K-E-Y- M-O-U-S-E

The marines march off into the distance.


MARINE PLATOON
      (singing)
Who's the leader of the club
that's made for
you and me?

Hey
there! Hi there! Ho there!
You're as welcome as can be.
