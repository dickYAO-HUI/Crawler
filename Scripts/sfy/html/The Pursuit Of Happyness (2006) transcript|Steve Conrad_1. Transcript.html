            <hr>Time to get up, man.<br>
-All right, Dad.<br>
-Come on.<br>
Should be here soon.<br>
-I think I should make a list.<br>
-What do mean?<br>
-For your birthday gifts?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
You know you're only getting<br>
a couple of things, right?<br>
Yeah, I know. Just to look at<br>
and study so I can choose better.<br>
Okay, well, that's smart.<br>
Yeah, make a list.<br>
Can you spell everything<br>
you're thinking of?<br>
-I think so.<br>
-All right. That's good.<br>
-How you doing in here, man?<br>
-Okay.<br>
Can we go to the park today, after?<br>
No, I gotta go to Oakland.<br>
Well, maybe, we'll see.<br>
Give me a kiss.<br>
I'll talk to you later.<br>
Excuse me.<br>
Oh, excuse me...<br>
...when is somebody<br>
gonna clean this off?<br>
And the Y?<br>
The Y. We talked about this.<br>
It's an I in "happiness."<br>
There's no Y in "happiness." It's an l.<br>
I'm Chris Gardner.<br>
I met my father for the first time<br>
when I was 28 years old.<br>
And I made up my mind<br>
as a young kid...<br>
...that when I had children...<br>
...my children were gonna know<br>
who their father was.<br>
This is part of my life story.<br>
This part is called "Riding the Bus. "<br>
What's that?<br>
It's a time machine, isn't it?<br>
Seems like a time machine.<br>
That seems like a time machine.<br>
It's a time machine. Take me with you.<br>
This machine...<br>
...this machine on my lap--<br>
This guy, he has a time machine.<br>
He travels in the past<br>
with this machine and....<br>
--it is not a time machine.<br>
It's a portable<br>
bone-density scanner.<br>
A medical device I sell for a living.<br>
Thank you for the opportunity<br>
to discuss it with you.<br>
-I appreciate it.<br>
-We just don't need it, Chris.<br>
It's unnecessary and expensive.<br>
-Well, maybe next--<br>
-Thank you.<br>
It gave a slightly denser picture<br>
than an x-ray for twice the money.<br>
-Hey.<br>
-Hey, baby.<br>
-What happened?<br>
-No, nothing.<br>
Look, I can't get Christopher today.<br>
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.<br>
I'm back on at 7.<br>
I know. I have got to go to Oakland.<br>
So I gotta get Christopher home,<br>
feed him, bathe him...<br>
...get him in bed,<br>
and be back here by 7?<br>
-Yes.<br>
-And we got the tax-bill notice today.<br>
-What are you gonna do about that?<br>
-Look, this is what we gotta do.<br>
You see that car? The one<br>
with the pretty yellow shoe on it?<br>
That's mine.<br>
There's no parking near hospitals.<br>
That's what happens<br>
when you're always in a rush.<br>
Thanks anyway. Very much.<br>
-Maybe next quarter.<br>
-It's possible.<br>
I needed to sell at least two scanners<br>
a month for rent and daycare.<br>
I'd have to sell one more...<br>
...to pay off all of those tickets<br>
under my windshield wiper.<br>
The problem is...<br>
...I haven't sold any for a while.<br>
Since when do you not like<br>
macaroni and cheese?<br>
Since birth?<br>
-What's that?<br>
-What?<br>
-What is this?<br>
-It's a gift for Christopher.<br>
-From who?<br>
-Cynthia from work.<br>
It's for adults. Chris can't use it.<br>
She didn't know.<br>
What are you supposed<br>
to do with it?<br>
Make every side the same color.<br>
Did you pay the taxes?<br>
No, I'm gonna<br>
have to file an extension.<br>
-You already filed an extension.<br>
-Yeah, well, I gotta file another one.<br>
That's-- It's $650.<br>
I'll have it in the next month.<br>
That means interest, right?<br>
-And a penalty?<br>
-Yeah, a little bit.<br>
Look, why don't you let me do this?<br>
All right, just relax. Okay?<br>
-Come here. Calm down.<br>
-I have to go back to work.<br>
Let's get ready for bed.<br>
Hey, put your plate in the sink.<br>
A few days ago I was presented<br>
with a report I'd asked for...<br>
...a comprehensive audit, if you will,<br>
of our economic condition.<br>
You won't like it. I didn't like it.<br>
But we have to face the truth...<br>
...and then go to work<br>
to turn things around.<br>
And make no mistake about it,<br>
we can turn them around.<br>
The federal budget is out of control.<br>
And we face runaway deficits<br>
of almost 
$80 billion...<br>
...for this budget year<br>
that ends September 30th.<br>
That deficit is larger than<br>
the entire federal budget in 1 957.<br>
And so is the almost $80 billion...<br>
... we will pay in interest<br>
this year on the national debt.<br>
Twenty years ago, in 1 960...<br>
...our federal government payroll<br>
was less than $ 1 3 billion.<br>
Today it is 75 billion.<br>
During these 20 years, our population<br>
has only increased by 23. 3 percent....<br>
Man, I got two questions for you:<br>
What do you do?<br>
And how do you do it?<br>
-I'm a stockbroker.<br>
-Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.<br>
Had to go to college<br>
to be a stockbroker, huh?<br>
You don't have to. Have to be good<br>
with numbers and good with people.<br>
-That's it.<br>
-Hey, you take care.<br>
I'll let you hang on to my car<br>
for the weekend.<br>
-But I need it back for Monday.<br>
-Feed the meter.<br>
I still remember that moment.<br>
They all looked<br>
so damn happy to me.<br>
Why couldn't I look like that?<br>
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.<br>
I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm<br>
after work.<br>
-For what?<br>
-I wanna see about a job there.<br>
Yeah? What job?<br>
You know, when l--<br>
When I was a kid, I could go through<br>
a math book in a week.<br>
So I'm gonna go see about<br>
what job they got down there.<br>
What job?<br>
Stockbroker.<br>
-Stockbroker?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
Not an astronaut?<br>
Don't talk to me like that, Linda.<br>
I'm gonna go down and see about this,<br>
and I'm gonna do it during the day.<br>
You should probably<br>
do your sales calls.<br>
I don't need you to tell me<br>
about my sales calls, Linda.<br>
I got three of them<br>
before the damn office is even open.<br>
Do you remember<br>
that rent is due next week?<br>
Probably not.<br>
We're already two months behind.<br>
Next week we'll owe three months.<br>
I've been pulling double shifts<br>
for four months now, Chris.<br>
Just sell what's in your contract.<br>
Get us out of that business.<br>
Linda, that is what I am trying to do.<br>
This is what I'm trying to do<br>
for my family...<br>
...for you and for Christopher.<br>
What's the matter with you?<br>
Linda.<br>
Linda.<br>
This part of my life<br>
is called "Being Stupid. "<br>
Can I ask you a favor, miss?<br>
Do you mind if I leave this here<br>
with you just for five minutes?<br>
I have a meeting in there<br>
and I don't wanna carry that...<br>
...Iooking smalltime.<br>
Here is a dollar and I'll give you<br>
more money when I come back out.<br>
Okay? It's not valuable.<br>
You can't sell it anywhere.<br>
I can't even sell it, and it's my job.<br>
All right?<br>
-Chris? Tim Brophy, Resources.<br>
-Yes. How are you?<br>
-Come with me.<br>
-Yes, sir.<br>
Let me see if I can find you<br>
an application for our internship.<br>
I'm afraid that's all we can do for you.<br>
See, this is a satellite office.<br>
Jay Twistle in the main office,<br>
he oversees Witter Resources.<br>
I mean, I'm-- You know,<br>
I'm just this office.<br>
As you can see, we got a hell of lot<br>
of applications here, so....<br>
Normally I have a resume sheet,<br>
but I can't seem to find it anywhere.<br>
-We....<br>
-Thank you very much.<br>
I need to go.<br>
I'll bring this back.<br>
-Thank you.<br>
-Okay.<br>
Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner.<br>
Why did I do that?<br>
Excuse me. Excuse me.<br>
Like I said, this part of my life<br>
is called "Being Stupid. "<br>
Hey!. Hey!. Hey!. Don't move!.<br>
Don't move!. Stay--!.<br>
Stop!. Stop!.<br>
Don't move!.<br>
Stop this--!. Stop the train!<br>
Stop! Stop!<br>
The program took just 20 people<br>
every six months.<br>
One got the job.<br>
There were three blank lines after<br>
"high school" to list more education.<br>
I didn't need that many lines.<br>
T ry and sleep. It's late.<br>
It's a puzzle measuring just 3 inches<br>
by 3 inches on each side...<br>
...made up of multiple colors<br>
that you twist and turn...<br>
...and try to get<br>
to a solid color on each side.<br>
This little cube<br>
is the gift sensation of 1 98 1.<br>
Don't expect to solve it easily.<br>

Although we did encounter<br>
one math professor at USF...<br>
... who took just 30 minutes on his.<br>
This is as far as I've gotten<br>
on mine.<br>
As you can see,<br>
I still have a long way to go.<br>
This is Jim Finnerty reporting<br>
for KJSF in Richmond.<br>
Hey, wake up.<br>
Eat.<br>
-Bye, Mom.<br>
-Bye, baby.<br>
-Come back without that, please.<br>
-Oh, yeah, I'm going to.<br>
So go ahead, say goodbye to it,<br>
because I'm coming back without it.<br>
Goodbye and good riddance.<br>
You ain't had to add<br>
the "good riddance" part.<br>
Bye, Mom.<br>
Bye.<br>
It's written as P-P-Y, but it's<br>
supposed to be an I in "happiness."<br>
-ls it an adjective?<br>
-No, actually it's a noun.<br>
But it's not spelled right.<br>
-ls "fuck" spelled right?<br>
-Yeah, that's spelled right.<br>
But that's not part of the motto,<br>
so you're not supposed to learn that.<br>
That's an adult word to show anger<br>
and other things.<br>
-But just don't use that one, okay?<br>
-Okay.<br>
What's that say<br>
on the back of your bag?<br>
My nickname.<br>
We pick nicknames.<br>
-Oh, yeah? What's it say?<br>
-"Hot Rod."<br>
-Did you have a nickname?<br>
-Yep.<br>
-What?<br>
-"Ten-Gallon Head."<br>
-What's that?<br>
-I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas.<br>
Everybody wears cowboy hats.<br>
And a ten-gallon's a big hat.<br>
I was smart back then,<br>
so they called me Ten-Gallon Head.<br>
-Hoss wears that hat.<br>
-Hoss?<br>
Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza.<br>
-How do you know Bonanza?<br>
-We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.<br>
-You watch Bonanza at daycare?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
When? When do you watch it?<br>
-After snack? After your nap?<br>
-After Love Boat.<br>
I made my list for my birthday.<br>
-Yeah, what'd you put on there?<br>
-A basketball or an ant farm.<br>
-He says he's been watching TV.<br>
-Oh, little TV for history.<br>
-Love Boat?<br>
-For history. Navy.<br>
That's not the Navy.<br>
I mean, he could<br>
watch television at home.<br>
We're paying you $1 50 a month.<br>
If he's gonna be sitting around...<br>
...watching TV all day,<br>
we're taking him out of here.<br>
Go pay more at other daycare<br>
if you don't like Navy TV.<br>
You late pay anyway.<br>
You complain. I complain.<br>
Can you at least put the dog upstairs<br>
in your room or something?<br>
Bye.<br>
I was waiting for<br>
Witter Resource head Jay Twistle...<br>
...whose name sounded so delightful,<br>
like he'd give me a job and a hug.<br>
I just had to show him I was good<br>
with numbers and good with people.<br>
-Morning, Mr. Twistle.<br>
-Good morning.<br>
-Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner.<br>
-Hi.<br>
I wanted to drop this off personally<br>
and make your acquaintance.<br>
I thought I'd catch you on the way in.<br>
I'd love the opportunity to discuss...<br>
...what may seem like weaknesses<br>
on my application.<br>
We'll start with this, and we'll call you<br>
if we wanna sit down.<br>
-Yes, sir. You have a great day.<br>
-You too.<br>
Hey, yeah, how you doing?<br>
This is Chris Gardner calling<br>
for Dr. Delsey.<br>
Yeah, I'm running a little late<br>
for a sales call.<br>
I was wondering if--<br>
Yeah, Osteo National.<br>
Right. We can still--? Half an hour?<br>
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.<br>
Thank you, thank you.<br>
Hey! Hey!<br>
Hey!<br>
This part of my life...<br>
-Wait!<br>
-...this part here...<br>
...it's called "Running. "<br>
Hey! Hey!<br>
Wait!<br>
Hey! Wait!<br>
That was my stolen machine.<br>
Unless she was with<br>
a guy who sold them too.<br>
Which was unlikely...<br>
...because I was the only one<br>
selling them in the Bay Area.<br>
I spent our entire life savings<br>
on these things.<br>
It was such<br>
a revolutionary machine.<br>
-Can you feel it, baby?<br>
-Oh, yeah.<br>
You got me doing all the work.<br>
What I didn't know<br>
is that doctors and hospitals...<br>
...would consider them<br>
unnecessary luxuries.<br>
I even asked the landlord<br>
to take a picture.<br>
So if I lost one, it was like losing<br>
a month's groceries.<br>
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!<br>
Hey, get back here!<br>
Hey, man, l--<br>
-Who's he?<br>
-He's that guy....<br>
-Did you 
forget?<br>
-Forget what?<br>
You're not supposed<br>
to have any of those.<br>
-Yeah, I know.<br>
-You have two now.<br>
Hey.<br>
Hey, Mom.<br>
One, two, three!<br>
-That's a basketball!<br>
-Hey, hey. What do you mean?<br>
You don't know that<br>
that's a basketball.<br>
This could be an ant farm. This could<br>
be a microscope or anything.<br>
-No, it's not.<br>
-There, there.<br>
All right, come on.<br>
Open him up. Open him up.<br>
-That paper's a little heavy, huh?<br>
-Yeah, but I got it.<br>
You should've seen me<br>
out there today.<br>
Somebody stole a scanner.<br>
I had to run the old girl down--<br>
Whatever.<br>
-What?<br>
-Whatever, Chris.<br>
What the hell<br>
you got attitude about?<br>
-"Whatever" what?<br>
-Every day's got some damn story.<br>
Hey, Roy. Roy!<br>
Can you beat your little rug<br>
when nobody's out here?<br>
There's dust and shit all over.<br>
-I'm trying to keep a clean house.<br>
-Hey, wait a second.<br>
Look, Linda, relax.<br>
We're gonna come out of this.<br>
Everything is gonna be fine, all right?<br>
You said that before,<br>
when I got pregnant. "lt'll be fine."<br>
-So you don't trust me now?<br>
-Whatever. I don't care.<br>
-Taxi!<br>
-Mr. Twistle.<br>
-Yeah, hi.<br>
-Hi. Chris Gardner.<br>
Yeah, hi. Listen.<br>
What can I do for you?<br>
I submitted an application for the<br>
intern program about a month ago...<br>
...and I would just love<br>
to sit with you briefly--<br>
Listen, I'm going<br>
to Noe Valley, Chris.<br>
-Take care of yourself.<br>
-Mr. Twistle.<br>
Actually, I'm on my way<br>
to Noe Valley also.<br>
How about we share a ride?<br>
-All right, get in.<br>
-All right.<br>
So when I was in the Navy,<br>
I worked for a doctor...<br>
...who loved to play golf,<br>
hours every day...<br>
...and I would actually<br>
perform medical procedures...<br>
...when he'd leave me in the office.<br>
So I'm used to being in a position<br>
where I have to make decisions and....<br>
Mr. Twistle, listen.<br>
This is a very important--<br>
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br>
This thing's impossible.<br>
-I can do it.<br>
-No, you can't. No one can.<br>
-That's bullshit.<br>
-No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.<br>
-No, you can't.<br>
-Let me see it.<br>
Give it here.<br>
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,<br>
you really messed it up.<br>
Sorry.<br>
It looks like it works around a swivel,<br>
so the center pieces never move.<br>
So if it's yellow in the center,<br>
that's the yellow side.<br>
If it's red in the center,<br>
that's the red side.<br>
-Okay.<br>
-So.... You can slow down.<br>
Listen, we can drive around all day.<br>
I don't believe you can do this.<br>
-Yeah, I can.<br>
-No, you can't.<br>
-Yes, I can.<br>
-No, you can't.<br>
I'm telling you, no one can.<br>
See? That's all I ever do.<br>
You almost have this side.<br>
Holy cow.<br>
-You almost had that one.<br>
-I'm gonna get it.<br>
Look at that.<br>
You're almost there.<br>
-1 7.1 0.<br>
-This is me.<br>
Good job.<br>
-Goodbye.<br>
-Yeah. I'll see you soon.<br>
Where are you going, sir?<br>
Excuse me, sir.<br>
Where are you going, please?<br>
Two-- A couple of blocks.<br>
-Just flip around.<br>
-Okay.<br>
Hey! Stop it! Hey!<br>
-Where are you going? Come here!<br>
-No!<br>
-No, no, no!<br>
-You asshole, give me my money!<br>
-Give me my money.<br>
-Please stop.<br>
-Please, please, please!<br>
-Son of a bitch.<br>
Please! He should've paid you!<br>
-Come here!<br>
-I'm sorry.<br>
-I'm so sorry.<br>
-I'll kick your ass!<br>
-I'm sorry!<br>
-ldiot.<br>
I'll get you!<br>
I'm going to kill you!<br>
I'm going to kill you!<br>
Hey!<br>
Stop it, you son of a bitch!<br>
Stop him!<br>
Stop him!<br>
The doors are closing.<br>
Please stand clear of the doors.<br>
No! No! No!<br>
No!<br>
-Hello?<br>
-Hey, yeah.<br>
Sorry I couldn't<br>
make it home on time.<br>
-Chris, I missed my shift.<br>
-Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that.<br>
Look, I'm on my way right now.<br>
Are you all right with Christopher?<br>
I'm leaving. Chris, I'm leaving.<br>
-What?<br>
-Did you hear what I said?<br>
I have my things together,<br>
and I'm taking our son...<br>
...and we're 
gonna leave now.<br>
I'm gonna put the phone down.<br>
-Linda, wait a minute. Hold it, hold--<br>
-I'm going to leave. We are leaving.<br>
It was right then that I started<br>
thinking about Thomas Jefferson...<br>
...the Declaration of Independence...<br>
...and the part about our right to life,<br>
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.<br>
And I remember thinking:<br>
How did he know<br>
to put the "pursuit" part in there?<br>
That maybe happiness is something<br>
that we can only pursue.<br>
And maybe we can actually<br>
never have it...<br>
...no matter what.<br>
How did he know that?<br>
Linda. Linda.<br>
-Hello?<br>
-Chris.<br>
-Who is this?<br>
-Jay Twistle.<br>
-Hey.<br>
-Dean Witter.<br>
Yeah, of course. How are you?<br>
I'm fine. Listen, do you still<br>
wanna come in and talk?<br>
Yes, sir. Absolutely.<br>
I'll tell you what. Come on by<br>
day after tomorrow, in the morning.<br>
We're interviewing for the internships.<br>
You got a pen and paper?<br>
Yes. Yes, I do.<br>
-Hold on one second.<br>
-All right.<br>
Hello?<br>
-Chris?<br>
-Go ahead. I have one.<br>
Write this number down so you can<br>
call my secretary, Janice.<br>
-She can give you all the specifics.<br>
-Yep.<br>
-Okay, 41 5.<br>
-41 5.<br>

Excuse me, did Linda<br>

Moons hits a three-pointer<br>

Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.<br>
Can't talk to you<br>

-What's your problem with numbers?<br>

-And you owe me money.<br>
-Yeah.<br>
You owe me $1 4.<br>
I'm gonna get that to you.<br>
I need my money.<br>

Fourteen's a number.<br>
Hey, don't you ever take my son<br>
away from me again.<br>
-You hear me?<br>
-Leave me alone!<br>
Don't take my son away<br>
from me again.<br>
Do you understand<br>
what I'm saying to you?<br>
Don't you walk away from me when<br>
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?<br>
-Do you wanna leave?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-You wanna leave?<br>
-Yes, I want to leave!<br>
Get the hell out of here,<br>
then, Linda.<br>
Get the hell out of here.<br>
Christopher's staying with me.<br>
You're the one that dragged<br>
us down. You hear me?<br>
-You are so weak.<br>
-No. I am not happy anymore.<br>
-I'm just not happy!<br>
-Then go get happy, Linda!<br>
Just go get happy.<br>
But Christopher's living with me.<br>
-Stop!<br>
-Did you hear what I said?<br>
Christopher's living with me!<br>
Hey. Come on, let's go.<br>
-How you doing, Mrs. Chu?<br>
-Hi.<br>
-Where's Mom?<br>
-Look, just get your stuff.<br>
But she told me she was<br>
coming to pick me up today.<br>
Yeah, I know.<br>
I talked to Mom earlier.<br>
Everything's fine, okay?<br>
Where do I sleep tonight?<br>
Let me ask you something.<br>
Are you happy?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-All right. Because I'm happy.<br>
And if you're happy and I'm happy,<br>
then that's a good thing, right?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-All right.<br>
You're sleeping with me.<br>
You're staying at home,<br>
where you belong, all right?<br>
Christopher.<br>
Hey, listen. I need the rent.<br>
I can't wait anymore.<br>
Yeah, I'm good for that, Charlie.<br>
I'm gonna get it.<br>
Why don't you go two blocks over<br>
at the Mission lnn motel?<br>
It's half what you pay here.<br>
Listen, Chris. I need you out<br>
of here in the morning.<br>
The hell am I supposed<br>
to be out of here tomorrow?<br>
I got painters coming in.<br>
-All right, look. I need more time.<br>
-No.<br>
All right, I'll paint it myself.<br>
All right, but I just-- I gotta have some<br>
more time-- I got my son up in here.<br>
All right. One week.<br>
And you paint it.<br>
Chris Gardner?<br>
Yeah. What happened?
<br>
-Payable to the City of San Francisco.<br>
-Does it have to be the full amount?<br>
You gotta pay each parking ticket,<br>
otherwise, you're staying.<br>
This is all I got.<br>
You verify at 9:30<br>
tomorrow morning.<br>
-What?<br>
-You gotta stay until this thing clears.<br>
No.<br>
No, I can't spend the night here.<br>
-I have to pick up my son.<br>
-You verify at 9:30 tomorrow.<br>
Sir, I have a job interview at Dean<br>
Witter at 1 0:1 5 tomorrow morning.<br>
-I cannot stay--<br>
-9:30 tomorrow morning.<br>
What am I supposed to do<br>
with my son?<br>
-ls there anyone else who can--?<br>
-I take care of him.<br>
Maybe we can go and have<br>
Social Services pick him up.<br>
All right.<br>
Can I have my phone call, please?<br>
-Hello.<br>
-Hey.<br>
What do you want?<br>
You gotta get Christopher<br>
from daycare. I can't.<br>
Just keep him for the night and I'm--<br>
And-- Just one night.<br>
What happened?<br>
I'll pick him up<br>
from daycare tomorrow.<br>
I'm gonna go right--<br>
You can just--<br>
You can drop him off<br>
and I'll pick him up.<br>
-No.<br>
-Come on, Linda.<br>
-Why you doing that?<br>
-No, I wanna take him to the park.<br>
To Golden Gate<br>
after daycare tomorrow.<br>
-How is he?<br>
-He's fine.<br>
All right, just-- All right,<br>

...and bring him back, all right?<br>
All right, just bring me my son back.<br>
Okay?<br>
Linda?<br>
I'll bring him back around 6.<br>
All right, all right.<br>
Thank you.<br>
Bye.<br>
I'm okay?<br>
Excuse me. Excuse me.<br>
Yes, I did.<br>
Mr. Gardner.<br>
This way.<br>
It'll be right this way.<br>
What is the word on that one?<br>
Chris Gardner.<br>
Chris Gardner.<br>
How are you? Good morning.<br>
Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner.<br>
Good to see you again.<br>
Chris Gardner. Pleasure.<br>
I've been sitting there<br>
for the last half-hour...<br>
...trying to come up with a story...<br>
...that would explain my being here<br>
dressed like this.<br>
And I wanted to come up with a story<br>
that would demonstrate qualities...<br>
...that I'm sure you all admire here,<br>
like earnestness or diligence.<br>
And I couldn't think of anything.<br>
So the truth is...<br>
...I was arrested<br>
for failure to pay parking tickets.<br>
Parking tickets?<br>
And I ran all the way here from<br>
the Polk Station, the police station.<br>
What were you doing<br>
before you were arrested?<br>
I was painting my apartment.<br>
Is it dry now?<br>
I hope so.<br>
Jay says you're pretty determined.<br>
He's been waiting outside<br>
the front of the building...<br>
...with some 40-pound gizmo<br>
for over a month.<br>
-He said you're smart.<br>
-Well, I like to think so.<br>
-And you want to learn this business?<br>
-Yes, sir, I wanna learn.<br>
Have you already started learning<br>
on your own?<br>
Absolutely.<br>
-Jay?<br>
-Yes, sir.<br>
How many times<br>
have you seen Chris?<br>
I don't know.<br>
One too many, apparently.<br>
-Was he ever dressed like this?<br>
-No.<br>
No. Jacket and tie.<br>
First in your class in school?<br>
-High school?<br>
-Yes, sir.<br>
-How many in the class?<br>
-Twelve.<br>
It was a small town.<br>
-I'll say.<br>
-But I was also first in my radar class...<br>
...in the Navy,<br>
and that was a class of 20.<br>
Can I say something?<br>
I'm the type of person...<br>
...if you ask me a question,<br>
and I don't know the answer...<br>
...I'm gonna tell you<br>
that I don't know.<br>
But I bet you what.<br>
I know how to find the answer,<br>
and I will find the answer.<br>
Is that fair enough?<br>
Chris.<br>
What would you say<br>
if a guy walked in for an interview...<br>
...without a shirt on...<br>
...and I hired him?<br>
What would you say?<br>
He must've had on<br>
some really nice pants.<br>
Chris, I don't know how you did it<br>
dressed as a garbage man...<br>
-...but you pulled it off.<br>
-Thank you, Mr. Twistle.<br>
Hey, now you can call me Jay.<br>
We'll talk to you soon.<br>
All right, so I'll let you know, Jay.<br>
"You'll let me know, Jay"?<br>
What do you mean?<br>
Yeah, I'll give you a call<br>
tomorrow sometime--<br>

What are you talking--?<br>
You hounded me for this.<br>
-You stood here--<br>
-Listen, there's no salary.<br>
-No.<br>
-I was not aware of that.<br>
My circumstances<br>
have changed some...<br>
-...and I need to be certain that I'll be--<br>
-All right. Okay.<br>
Tonight.<br>
I swear I will fill your spot. I promise.<br>
If you back out, you know what<br>
I'll look like to the partners?<br>
Yes, an ass-- A-hole.<br>
Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way.<br>
You are a piece of work.<br>
Tonight.<br>
There was no salary.<br>
Not even a reasonable promise<br>
of a job.<br>
One intern was hired at the end<br>
of the program from a pool of 20.<br>
And if you weren't that guy...<br>
...you couldn't even apply<br>
the six months' training...<br>
... to another brokerage.<br>
The only resource I would have<br>
for six months...<br>
... would be my six scanners,<br>
which I could still try to sell.<br>
If I sold them all,<br>
maybe we might get by.<br>
-I got him. I got him.<br>
-He's asleep.<br>
All right.<br>
Okay, baby.<br>
I got it.<br>
I'm going to New York.<br>
My sister's boyfriend...<br>
...opened a restaurant,<br>
and they may have a job for me there.<br>
So I'm going to New York, Chris.<br>
Christopher's staying with me.<br>
I'm his mom, you know?<br>
He should be with his mom.<br>
I should have him, right?<br>
You know<br>
you can't take care of him.<br>
What are you gonna do for money?<br>
I had an interview<br>
at Dean Witter for an internship...<br>
...and I got it.<br>
So I'm gonna stand out<br>
in my program.<br>
Salesman to intern's backwards.<br>
No, it's not.<br>
I gotta go.<br>
Tell him I love him, okay?<br>
And....<br>
I know you'll take care of him, Chris.<br>
I know that.<br>
-Dean Witter.<br>
-Yes, hi.<br>
Yes, I'd like to leave a message<br>
for Mr. Jay Twistle.<br>
-Your name?<br>
-Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner.<br>
The message is:<br>
Thank you very much<br>
for inviting me into the program.<br>
I really appreciate it and I'd be<br>
very pleased to accept your invitation.<br>
Is that all?<br>
Yes, that's it.<br>
-Okay.<br>
-Thank you.<br>
Bye.<br>
-Be careful with that.<br>
-What?<br>
Be care-- Go ahead.<br>
-Are we there?<br>
-Yep.<br>
-Hey, you know what today is?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-What?<br>
-Saturday.<br>
-You know what Saturday is, right?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-What?<br>
-Basketball.<br>
-You wanna go play some basketball?<br>
-Okay.<br>
All right, then we're gonna go<br>
sell a bone-density scanner.<br>
-How about that? Wanna do that?<br>
-No.<br>
Hey, Dad. I'm going pro.<br>
I'm going pro.<br>
Okay.<br>
Yeah, I don't know, you know.<br>
You'll probably be about as good<br>
as I was.<br>
That's kind of the way it works,<br>
you know. I was below average.<br>
You know, so you'll probably<br>
ultimately rank...<br>
...somewhere around there,<br>
you know, so...<br>
...I really-- You'll excel at<br>
a lot of things, just not this.<br>
I don't want you shooting<br>
this ball all day and night.<br>
-All right?<br>
-All right.<br>
Okay.<br>
All right, go ahead.<br>
Hey.<br>
Don't ever let somebody tell you...<br>
...you can't do something.<br>
Not even me.<br>
-All right?<br>
-All right.<br>
You got a dream...<br>
...you gotta protect it.<br>
People can't do something<br>
themselves...<br>
...they wanna tell you<br>
you can't do it.<br>
If you want something,<br>
go get it. Period.<br>
Let's go.<br>
Dad, why did we move to a motel?<br>
I told you. Because I'm getting<br>
a better job.<br>
-You gotta trust me, all right?<br>
-I trust you.<br>
All right, here.<br>
Come on, come on. Keep up.<br>
Dad, when's Mom coming back?<br>
Dad, when's Mom coming back?<br>
I don't know, Christopher.<br>
Dad, listen to this.<br>
One day, a man was drowning<br>
in the water.<br>
And a boat came by and said,<br>
"Do you need any help?"<br>
He said, "No, thank you.<br>
God will save me."<br>
Then another boat came by.<br>
Said, "Do you need any help?"<br>
And he said, "No, thank you.<br>
God will save me."<br>
Then he drowned,<br>
and he went to heaven.<br>
And he said, "God,<br>
why didn't you save me?"<br>
And God said, "l sent 
you<br>
two big boats, you dummy."<br>
 Do you like it?<br>
Yeah, that's very funny, man.<br>
Give me your hand.<br>
-Thank you very much, sir.<br>
-Yes, sir.<br>
-You got the bill of sale here.<br>
-Yes.<br>
All the information you'll need.<br>
Thank you very much<br>
for your business.<br>
Thank you.<br>
One hundred, 200,<br>
...7, 8, 9, 1 0.<br>
Thank you.<br>
-Hey, you want one of those?<br>
-No, it's okay.<br>
Come on, you can have one.<br>
Which one?<br>
-You like that one? How much?<br>
-Twenty-five cents.<br>
This part of my life<br>
is called "Internship. "<br>
The 1 200 building is<br>
Medley lndustrial and Sanko Oil.<br>
The building across the street<br>
is Lee-Ray Shipping.<br>
In a couple weeks,<br>
you'll get call sheets...<br>
...with the phone numbers<br>
of employees...<br>
...from every Fortune 500 company<br>
in the financial district.<br>
You will be pooling<br>
from 60 Fortune companies.<br>
You will mainly be cold-calling<br>
potential clients.<br>
But if you have to have lunch<br>
with them, have breakfast with them...<br>
...even baby-sit for them, do whatever<br>
it takes to familiarize them...<br>
...with our packages. We need you<br>
to match their needs and goals...<br>
...to one of our many financial plans.<br>
In essence, you reel them in...<br>
...we'll cook the fish.<br>
Some of you are here<br>
because you know somebody.<br>
Some of you are here because<br>
you think you're somebody.<br>
There's one guy in here<br>
who's gonna be somebody.<br>
That person's gonna be the guy...<br>
...who can turn this into this.<br>
Eight hundred thousand<br>
in commission dollars.<br>
You, you, help me hand these out.<br>
This is going to be your bible.<br>
You'll eat with it.<br>
-You'll drink with it.<br>
-It was simple.<br>
X number of calls<br>
equals X number of prospects.<br>
X number of prospects<br>
equals X number of customers.<br>
X number of customers<br>
equals X number of dollars...<br>
-...in the company's pocket.<br>
-Your board exam.<br>
Last year, we had an intern score<br>
a 96.4 percent on the written exam.<br>
He wasn't chosen.<br>
It's not a simple pass/fail.<br>
It's an evaluation tool we use<br>
to separate applicants.<br>
Be safe, score a hundred.<br>
Okay, let's take a break.<br>
Be back in 1 0.<br>
-Hey, Mr. Frohm. Chris.<br>
-Hi.<br>
-Chris, how are you?<br>
-I'm good. How you doing?<br>
-Fine, thank you for asking.<br>
-First day in there. It was exciting.<br>
You're not quitting on us yet,<br>
are you?<br>
No, sir. Ten-minute break.<br>
Pop out, get a quick bite and then<br>
back in there for board prep.<br>
Oh, man, I remember mine.<br>
And ours were only an hour,<br>
not three like yours.<br>
We didn't do world markets,<br>
didn't bother with taxes...<br>
...and it was still a pain in the ass.<br>
Funny what you remember.<br>
There was a beautiful girl<br>
in that class.<br>
I can't remember her name,<br>
but her face was so--<br>
I've seen an old friend of mine.<br>
Do you mind?<br>
-No, go ahead.<br>
-Good talking to you, sir.<br>
Hey, asshole.<br>
Are you all right, asshole?<br>
Are you okay?<br>
What were you thinking?<br>
What are you doing?<br>
I could've killed you.<br>
I'm trying to cross the street.<br>
-Well, you're all right?<br>
-Yeah, yeah.<br>
-Where's my shoe?<br>
-What?<br>
-You knocked off my shoe!<br>
-I don't know where your shoe is.<br>
-Where's my damn shoe?<br>
-I don't know.<br>
Hey.<br>
-Did you see it? I lost my shoe.<br>
-No, I'm sorry.<br>
Hey. Hey, where are you going?<br>
-We should wait for the police.<br>
-I gotta go to work.<br>
Hey, you just got hit by a car.<br>
Go to the hospital.<br>
I'm in a competitive internship<br>
at Dean Witter.<br>
Hey, man, you're missing a shoe.<br>
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thank you.<br>
Dad.<br>
-You don't have a shoe.<br>
-Yeah, I know.<br>
-Wanna know what happened?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
I got hit by a car.<br>
-You got hit by a car?<br>
-Yep.<br>
-Where?<br>
-Just right by the office.<br>
-No, where in your body?<br>
-Like, the back of my legs.<br>
-Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu.<br>
-Goodbye.<br>
-Where you on the street?<br>
-
Yeah, I was running in the street.<br>
Don't do that. You can get hurt.<br>
Yeah, thanks.<br>
I'll remember that next time.<br>
And here I was again.<br>
-Show up early.<br>
-While qualified persons...<br>
...qualified persons are interested in<br>
investing and have money to invest.<br>
-Now, Chris.<br>
-Yes, sir.<br>
Would you get me<br>
some coffee, please?<br>
Favors for Frakesh,<br>

Okay, yes, thank you.<br>
Who wants to get me a doughnut?<br>

Good afternoon, my name is Chris<br>
Gardner. I'm calling from Dean Witter.<br>
In order not to waste any time...<br>
...I wasn't hanging up the phone<br>
in between calls.<br>
Okay, thank you very much.<br>
I realized that<br>
by not hanging up the phone...<br>
...I gained another eight minutes<br>
a day.<br>
Why, good morning to you,<br>
my name is Chris Gardner.<br>
-I'm calling from Dean Witter.<br>
-I wasn't drinking water...<br>
...so I didn't' waste any time<br>
in the bathroom.<br>
Yes, I'd love to have<br>
the opportunity--<br>
Okay, no problem at all, sir.<br>
Thank you very much.<br>
But even doing all this...<br>
...after two months, I still didn't have<br>
time to work my way up a sheet.<br>
We're feeling really confident<br>
about that one as well.<br>

-Hey, Mr. Frakesh.<br>
Hey, do you have five minutes?<br>
I got a green light<br>
from Walter Ribbon--<br>
I'm supposed to present commodities<br>
to Bromer. Could you move my car?<br>
That'd really help me out. It's on<br>
Samson, half block, silver Caprice.<br>
Just move it to the other side. They're<br>
street sweeping. There's spaces.<br>
Hang on to these.<br>
I have backups in my desk.<br>
And you have to jimmy that.<br>
-Jimmy what?<br>
-You have to jimmy the key.<br>
And the other doors don't unlock.<br>
You have to jimmy it.<br>
Come on, I'm jimmying it.<br>
Oh, no!<br>
Come on.<br>
-Here's the file, Mr. Ribbon.<br>

Oh, you just missed him.
<br>
Thank you.<br>
-What's that?<br>
-Just filling out a check...<br>
...paying some bills...<br>
...and a parking ticket.<br>
We don't have a car anymore.<br>
Yep, I know.<br>
I'm gonna need to take you<br>
with me this weekend.<br>
A couple of doctors' offices.<br>
-On sales calls, okay?<br>
-Okay.<br>
Then, possibly,<br>
we'll go to the football game.<br>
-Really?<br>
-Possibly.<br>
-All right?<br>
-All right.<br>
Come on, finish up.<br>
-Are you sure?<br>
-Possibly.<br>
Really?<br>
-Are you bringing it to the game?<br>
-Yeah, I don't wanna leave it.<br>
And maybe<br>
we're going to the game.<br>
-Where are we going now?<br>
-To see someone about my job.<br>
I don't understand.<br>
-You don't understand what?<br>
-Are we going to the game?<br>
I said possibly<br>
we're going to the game.<br>
-You know what "possibly" means?<br>
-Like probably.<br>
No, "probably" means there's<br>
a good chance that we're going.<br>
"Possibly" means we might,<br>
we might not.<br>
-What does "probably" mean?<br>
-lt means we have a good chance.<br>
And what does "possibly" mean?<br>
-I know what it means.<br>
-What does it mean?<br>
It means that we're not going<br>
to the game.<br>
-How did you get so smart?<br>
-Because you're smart.<br>
-Are we there?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-Mr. Ribbon.<br>
-Yes?<br>
How are you, sir?<br>
Chris Gardner. Dean Witter.<br>
-Oh, hi. Hi.<br>
-This is my son, Christopher.<br>
-Hi.<br>
-Hey, Christopher.<br>
-What are you doing up here?<br>
-I came to apologize...<br>
-...for missing our appointment.<br>
-You didn't need to come up.<br>
We were in the neighborhood<br>
visiting a very close friend...<br>
...and I wanted to take this opportunity<br>
to say thank you for your time.<br>
-I know you probably waited for me.<br>
-Little bit.<br>
I want you to know<br>
that I do not take that for granted.<br>
Oh, come on. What's that?<br>
Oh, it's an Osteo National<br>
bone-density scanner.<br>
A company I bought into<br>
prior to going to work at Witter.<br>
-I have a meeting after the game.<br>
-You're going to the game?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-Possibly.<br>
-Possibly.<br>
-We're going too.<br>
I'm taking my son, Tim.<br>
My 1 2-year-old.<br>
We were just leaving. Tim!<br>
Listen, we'll get out of your way.<br>
Again, thank you very much,<br>
and I'm sorry about the other day.<br>
And I hope that<br>
we can reschedule for later.<br>
-You got it.<br>
-Thank you very much.<br>
You take care. Here, come on.<br>
-Say bye-bye, Chris.<br>
-Bye.<br>
Bye, Christopher.<br>
Hey, you guys wanna<br>
come with us?<br>
-What--? To Candlestick?<br>
-We're going now. Come with us.<br>
-Where are your seats?<br>
-We've-- We're upper deck.<br>
We got a box. Come on.<br>
-You wanna sit in the box?<br>
-No.<br>
It's not actually a box.<br>
It's, you know, a private section.<br>
It's more comfortable.<br>
You wanna go?<br>
-Okay.<br>
-Okay, kids in the back.<br>
Hey, why don't you just put that<br>
in your car?<br>
-Yeah, okay. Sure, sure.<br>
-We don't have a car.<br>
-Oh, my--<br>
-What happened?<br>
I think I got stung by a bee.<br>
-You all right?<br>
-Oh, yeah. Goodness. I'm fine.<br>
-You're not allergic or anything?<br>
-No, no, no.<br>
-Where'd he get you?<br>
-Just right at the back of my head.<br>
-Are you okay?<br>
-Yeah, I'm fine, Christopher.<br>
-Does it hurt?<br>
-Christopher, I'm fine.<br>
-Let me see.<br>
-Christopher, sit back. Sit back.<br>
Thomas Jefferson mentions<br>
happiness a couple times...<br>
...in the Declaration<br>
of Independence.<br>
May seem like a strange word<br>
to be in that document...<br>
...but he was sort of....<br>
He was an artist.<br>
He called the English<br>
"the disturbers of our harmony. "<br>
And I remember standing there<br>
that day...<br>
... thinking about<br>
the disturbers of mine.<br>
Questions I had:<br>
Whether all this was good.<br>
Whether I'd make it.<br>
And Walter Ribbon<br>
and his Pacific Bell pension money...<br>
... which was millions.<br>
Yeah!<br>
It was a way to another place.<br>
Wow, this is....<br>
This is the way<br>
to watch a football game here.<br>
-Thank you very much 
for this, really.<br>
-Hey, it's my pleasure, Chris.<br>
And, Mr. Ribbon, I also wanna thank<br>
you for giving me the opportunity...<br>
...to discuss the asset management<br>
capabilities of Dean Witter...<br>
...which we believe<br>
to be far superior...<br>
...to anything you got going<br>
over at Morgan Stanley.<br>
Really, I think you're gonna<br>
be blown away.<br>
Point blank, Dean Witter needs to be<br>
managing your retirement portfolio.<br>
You know, I didn't have any notion<br>
that you were new there.<br>
I like you, but there's not a chance<br>
I'm gonna let you direct our fund.<br>
That's just not gonna happen<br>
anytime soon, buddy.<br>
So, you know, come on, relax.<br>
Let's play the game. Go, go, go!<br>
Yes!<br>
Yes! Yeah!<br>
-Here you go.<br>
-All right.<br>
I've had a few ideas<br>
already, absolutely.<br>
-Chris, I'll talk to you later.<br>
-I'm gonna give you a call.<br>
Nice to meet you, Chris.<br>
Give me a call.<br>
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.<br>
-Bye.<br>
-Bye, Christopher.<br>
After four months, we had sold<br>
all our scanners.<br>
It seemed we were making it.<br>
What's the...<br>
-...fastest animal in the world?<br>
-Jackrabbit.<br>
It seemed we were doing good.<br>
Till one day...<br>
...that day...<br>
...that letter brought me<br>
back to earth.<br>
This part of my life is called<br>
"Paying Taxes. "<br>
If you didn't pay them...<br>
... the government could stick<br>
their hands into your bank account...<br>
...and take your money.<br>
Dad.<br>
No warning. Nothing.<br>
It can't be too late.<br>
That's my money.<br>
How is somebody just gonna<br>
just take my money?<br>
I was-- I was--<br>
Listen, l--<br>
That's all the money that I have.<br>
You cannot go into my bank acc--<br>
No--<br>
It was the 25th of September.<br>
I remember that day.<br>
Because that's the day<br>
that I found out...<br>
...there was only 21 dollars<br>
and 33 cents left in my bank account.<br>
I was broke.<br>
-Dressed yet?<br>
-No.<br>
Chris! Chris!<br>
Don't jerk me around, okay, Chris?<br>
I'm not jerking you around, Ralph,<br>
all right? I'm gonna get it.<br>
-I need that money now, not later.<br>
-When I get it, you get it, Ralph.<br>
Now!<br>
Hey, what's happening, man?<br>
Wayne, I need to get<br>
that $1 4 from you.<br>
I thought I didn't owe you that now.<br>
-What? Why?<br>
-Why what?<br>
Why would you think<br>
you don't owe me my money?<br>
I helped you move.<br>
You drove me two blocks, Wayne.<br>
That's 200 yards.<br>
It's been four months, Wayne.<br>
I need my money. I need my money.<br>
I need my money right now.<br>
-I don't have it, man. I'm sorry.<br>
-Go get my money.<br>
-Wayne, get my mo--<br>
-I really don't, man. It's $1 4.<br>
It's my $1 4!<br>
Go get my money!<br>
-All of this for $1 4.<br>
-Get my money, Wayne.<br>
Dad, look at me!<br>
Dad.<br>
-Should I go?<br>
-Sure, man. Why not?<br>
-Stay here.<br>
-Dad, look.<br>
-No, no. Stay right here.<br>
-Dad.<br>
Did you hear what I said?<br>
Did you hear me?<br>
-Dad, where you going?<br>
-Hey, what did I say?<br>
Dad!<br>
Dad, wait! Dad!<br>
-Dad.<br>
-I gotta--<br>
I gotta get back to the '60s, man.<br>
That's what I wanna do.<br>
When I was younger. I wanna see<br>
Jimi Hendrix do that guitar on fire.<br>
Bring back my time machine!<br>
Bring my time machine back!<br>
-Dad, where are we going?<br>
-Just be quiet.<br>
Go get your things. Go.<br>
-Chris?<br>
-Yes.<br>
Dr. Telm can't get back to meet you.<br>
I'm sorry.<br>
Where are we going now?<br>
Gotta-- We gotta<br>
see somebody else.<br>
I'm tired.<br>
I know.<br>
Doesn't seem to be functioning<br>
right now.<br>
-I have to go now, Chris.<br>
-No, no, no.<br>
Just give me a second. I'm sure<br>
I'm gonna be able to figure it out.<br>
Chris. Chris, just come back<br>
when it's working.<br>
-No, no. I have to fix it now.<br>
-No.<br>
Look, I'll still be putting money<br>
in the office, then, all right?<br>
I really have to go, Chris.<br>
Thank you. Thank you.<br>
Thank you for your time.<br>
I appreciate it.<br>
I'll see you soon.<br>
Why are our things here?<br>
Dad.<br>
-Let's go.
 Come on.<br>
-Where?<br>
-Just out of here.<br>
-Why?<br>
-We can't stay here tonight.<br>
-Yes, we can. Open the door!<br>
-Did you hear what I said? Let's go.<br>
-Open the door!<br>
Hey, did you hear what I said?<br>
Stop it.<br>
Stop it.<br>
Come on.<br>
Come on.<br>
Wayne!<br>
Wayne!<br>
Wayne!<br>
Get up. Stand up. Come on.<br>
Where are we going?<br>
-Dad, where are we going?<br>
-I don't know.<br>
It's not a time machine.<br>
Dad.<br>
It's not a time machine.<br>
The guy said it was a time machine.<br>
It's not a time machine. He was wrong.<br>
-What guy?<br>
-The guy. He was at the park.<br>
He said it was a time machine.<br>
Yes, it is.<br>
No, it's not.<br>
-lt is.<br>
-No, it's not.<br>
All we gotta do is push<br>
this black button right here.<br>
Wanna push it?<br>
Okay.<br>
Come on.<br>
Come on, man.<br>
Right here.<br>
Wait a minute.<br>
Where you wanna go?<br>
I don't know.<br>
Some place from before.<br>
You gotta close your eyes.<br>
You close your eyes. I wanna see.<br>
All right, come on.<br>
We'll push it together.<br>
You gotta close your eyes.<br>
Close your eyes.<br>
It takes a few seconds.<br>
Oh, my goodness.<br>
Open, open, open!<br>
-What is it?<br>
-Dinosaurs.<br>
-Where?<br>
-You don't see all these dinosaurs?<br>
Look around.<br>
Look at all these dinosaurs.<br>
-Can you see them?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
Wait. Come on, come on.<br>
-Wait, watch out.<br>
-What is it?<br>
Don't step in the fire.<br>
We're cavemen.<br>
We need this fire,<br>
because there's no electricity...<br>
...and it's cold out here, okay?<br>
-Watch out!<br>
-Whoa! Oh, my good-- A T. rex.<br>
Get your stuff.<br>
Get your stuff. Get it.<br>
-We gotta find someplace safe.<br>
-Like what?<br>
We need a cave.<br>
A cave?<br>
-We gotta find a cave. Come on.<br>
-Okay.<br>
Come on, come on.<br>
Watch your back! Look out.<br>
Here it is. Here's a cave. Come on.<br>
Right here, right here.<br>
Go, go, go.<br>
Go ahead. Get in.<br>
Hurry, hurry, hurry.<br>
-Are we safe?<br>
-Yeah, I think so.<br>
Hey.<br>
-How you doing, Jay?<br>
-I'm doing good.<br>
How are you getting along?<br>
-Good. I'm good.<br>
-You doing good?<br>
-How you doing?<br>

Where you going?<br>

Because I'm trying to move<br>
a couple guys from--<br>
They're at PacBell,<br>
and I'm trying to bring them over--<br>
Get them over to us.<br>
So they got me<br>
going out there golfing.<br>
Awesome.<br>
Hey, let them win a round.<br>
Deborah, someone's asking for you.<br>
-Where?<br>
-He's outside. Please come with me.<br>
Hi.<br>
-Can I ask you a question?<br>
-Sure.<br>
We need a room.<br>
Just until I can fix this and sell it.<br>
-There's just some glass work.<br>
-Let me stop you right there.<br>
-I wish I could help you--<br>
-This is my son, Christopher.<br>
-He's 5 years old.<br>
-Hi, baby.<br>
-We need some place to stay.<br>
-Okay, and I would love to help you...<br>
...but we don't take men here.<br>
It's only women and children.<br>
He can stay here, but you have<br>
to find someplace else to go.<br>
We gotta stay together.<br>
We got-- We're--<br>
-Okay, listen.<br>
-You gotta have some place--<br>
Try Glide Memorial.<br>
The building books up at 5.<br>
So you hurry up. There's a line.<br>
-And where is it? Come on.<br>
-Ellis and Jones.<br>
Hey, everybody. We have<br>
four spots left, and that's all.<br>
-Man.<br>
-Hey, come on, man.<br>
-Come on.<br>
-Come on, what?<br>
-Hey, that's my spot.<br>
-Back off.<br>
Come on, don't do this to me.<br>
Don't--<br>
Dad!<br>
Stop it! Break it up!<br>
Break it up!<br>
Stop! Stop!<br>
Get out of the line, both of you.<br>
Both of you.<br>
I was here first. They told me<br>
that we had to be on time.<br>
I got here on time. I was in line.<br>
I came from work, I got my son.<br>
I was here on time.<br>
We were here on time!<br>
He sliced in front of him in line.<br>
-Who did?<br>
-He did.<br>
Come on, come on, Rodney.<br>
Come on. Let's go. Get out of line.<br>
That's it. No more.<br>
-What's your favorite color?<br>
-Green.<br>

-Trees.

Trees. What else?<br>
Holly.<br>
-Holly. What's holly?<br>
-The Christmas stuff.<br>

What's that?<br>
I guess they want us to go to sleep.<br>
Here you go. We gotta make sure<br>
Captain America's warm in there.<br>
Can you breathe?<br>
-You're good?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-I gotta go work on the scanner--<br>
-Don't go.<br>
No, no, no. I'm gonna be<br>
right outside the door.<br>
All right? I'm just gonna be right there.<br>
I'll leave the door open a little bit.<br>
And I'll be able to hear you<br>
if you call me.<br>
I wanna go home.<br>
But that's why I gotta<br>
work on the scanner.<br>
All right?<br>
I'm gonna go out there.<br>
I'm gonna leave the door open.<br>
I'll be right up the stairs.<br>
I'll be able to hear you<br>
if you call me.<br>
-All right?<br>
-All right.<br>
You gotta trust me, okay?<br>
You gotta trust me.<br>
I trust you. I trust you.<br>
I trust you.<br>
-I can't hear you.<br>
-I trust you. I trust you.<br>
Give me a kiss.<br>
-I'll just be a little while, okay?<br>
-All right.<br>
-I'll be right here.<br>
-Okay.<br>
-Can you still hear me?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-Can you hear me?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-Do you trust me?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-Like that?<br>
-Yeah, put that....<br>
-Then you go like that.<br>
-ls that okay?<br>
-I don't know. What do you think?<br>
Good.<br>
Let's go. Get your stuff.<br>
-Hey, why don't you leave it?<br>
-We can't.<br>
We're gonna have<br>
a different room later.<br>
Go.<br>
Hey, Chris.<br>
-Hey, good morning, Mr. Frakesh.<br>
-What's up?<br>
Work trip.<br>
Your wife, Martha, works at<br>
PacBell also, correct?<br>
-Yes, she does.<br>
-And you guys are both...<br>
...Iooking to retire at the same time?<br>
We'd like to retire<br>
and maintain our lifestyle...<br>
...without paying a lot of taxes.<br>
So basically, you want nobody's hands<br>
in your pockets but your own?<br>
Are you familiar with<br>
tax-free municipal...?<br>
I learned to finish my work quickly.<br>
I had to finish quickly.<br>
To get in line at Glide by 5.<br>
Come on.<br>
Come on.<br>
Hold that bus! Hold the bus!<br>
My Captain America!<br>
Dad! Dad! Dad!<br>
Stop it! Shut up! Shut up!<br>
-Why don't you let the lady in?<br>
-Hey, back up.<br>
-Hey, man, that's not cool.<br>
-Back up! Back up!<br>
Come on.<br>
Dad, we need to get it!<br>
The important thing about<br>
that freedom train...<br>
...is it's got to climb mountains.<br>
We all have to deal with mountains.<br>
You know, mountains<br>
that go way up high.<br>
And mountains that go<br>
deep and low.<br>
-Amen, preacher!<br>
-Yes.<br>
We know what those mountains are,<br>
here at Glide.<br>
We sing about them.<br>
Lord, don't move that mountain<br>
Give me strength to climb it<br>
Please don't move<br>
That stumbling block<br>
But lead me, Lord, around it<br>
My burdens, they get so heavy<br>
Seems hard to bear<br>
But I won't give up<br>
No, no<br>
Because you promised me<br>
You'd meet me at the altar of prayer<br>
-Lord don't move that mountain<br>
-Please don't move that mountain<br>
But give me strength to climb it<br>
When's your test?<br>
T omorrow.<br>
Are you ready?<br>
Of course.<br>
Thank you, sir.<br>
-Hey. How you doing?<br>
-Hey.<br>
So did you finish the whole thing,<br>
or you have to go somewhere...?<br>
I have to go somewhere.<br>
-But I finished the whole thing too.<br>
-Oh, good.<br>
-You?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-How'd you feel about the graphs?<br>
-Easy.<br>
I struggled with the essay question<br>
on the back. What did you write?<br>
-Essay question?<br>
-Yeah, on the back.<br>
Hey, Chris.<br>
-Hey. Jeff, right? 49ers game.<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-Yeah, you were gonna give me a call?<br>
-I never actually got your number.<br>
Here's my number. Call me, okay?<br>
Yes, sir. Absolutely.<br>
Thank you very much.<br>
Chris, you got five bucks?<br>
I left my wallet upstairs.<br>
Let me run up and grab that<br>
for you, Mr. Frohm.<br>
No, I gotta be at CAL Bank at 4,<br>
and I'm late.<br>
-I'll pay you back, honest.<br>
-Five is good?<br>
Five is lovely. Thank you.<br>
Thank you.<br>
That's it. That's the room quota.<br>
There's 
no more space.<br>
You gotta head out.<br>
That's it for today.<br>
Come back tomorrow.<br>
All the rooms are full.<br>
It's completely full.<br>
That's it. Just keep heading out.<br>
Come back tomorrow.<br>
You like it?<br>
Twenty. One, two, three, four.<br>
Now, here's your bulb,<br>
and there's your ferrite core inductor.<br>
-How much?<br>
-Eight dollars.<br>
-What's that?<br>
-It's to repair the light.<br>
Can I see it?<br>
Yeah, sure. Just don't break it.<br>
Unless you wanna sleep in a room<br>
with me for the rest of your life.<br>
I don't mind.<br>
Yeah, you will.<br>
Why don't you<br>
get some sleep, okay?<br>
Okay.<br>
-Warm enough?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
All right.<br>
Did Mom leave because of me?<br>
-What?<br>
-Did Mom leave because of me?<br>
Don't-- Don't even think<br>
something like that.<br>
Mom left because of Mom.<br>
And you didn't have anything<br>
to do with that, okay?<br>
Okay.<br>
You're a good papa.<br>
All right, go to sleep.<br>
-I love you.<br>
-I love you too.<br>
So far, so good, Chris.<br>
-lt works.<br>
-Thank you very much.<br>
Two hundred and fifty dollars.<br>
Four more weeks of oxygen.<br>
One hundred, 20, 40, 60, 80, 200.<br>
Twenty, 30, 40, 50.<br>
-Anything else?<br>
-No, sir.<br>
Thank you. Thank you.<br>
-You ready?<br>
-Yep.<br>
-Are we going to the church place?<br>
-No.<br>
Where are we going, then?<br>
-Probably stay at a hotel.<br>
-A hotel?<br>
Just for the night.<br>
We can go back to the cave<br>
if you like.<br>
No, thank you.<br>
-Ever?<br>
-I hope not.<br>
Why not?<br>
Well, because some things are fun<br>
the first time you do them...<br>
...and then not so much the next.<br>
-Like the bus?<br>
-Yeah, like the bus.<br>
I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh,<br>
should I?<br>
Sometimes when we're moving<br>
at night...<br>
...we pass houses with lights<br>
and people.<br>
Sometimes you can<br>
hear them laugh.<br>
The next day, after work...<br>
... we just went to the beach.<br>
Far away from anything.<br>
Everything.<br>
Just Christopher and me.<br>
-Did you see me?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
Far away from buses and noise...<br>
...and a constant disappointment<br>
in my ten-gallon head...<br>
...and myself.<br>
-Chris, thank you very much.<br>
-Well, thank you, Dean.<br>
-Take care.<br>
-You made all the right moves.<br>
Thanks, Chris.<br>
Because when I was young...<br>
...and I'd get an A on a history test<br>
or whatever...<br>
...I'd get this good feeling about<br>
all the things that I could be.<br>
And then I never became<br>
any of them.<br>
-Hey, Chris.<br>
-Hey.<br>
-How you doing, Jay?<br>
-I'm doing fine.<br>
Rumor has it you signed 31 accounts<br>
for us from Pacific Bell.<br>
Yeah, yeah.<br>
Met some guys at a ball game,<br>
got some cards. I've been working.<br>
I guess.<br>
So one more day.<br>
Getting nervous?<br>
-No, I'm okay.<br>
-Yeah?<br>
Listen, whatever happens...<br>
...you've done a fantastic job, Chris.<br>
I mean that.<br>
Take care of yourself.<br>
Yes, Mr. Johnson.<br>
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.<br>
Yes, sir. Just calling<br>
to thank you very much...<br>
...for your support<br>
at last month's seminar.<br>
Yes, sir. Absolutely.<br>
Yes, sir.<br>
No, sir, that's it.<br>
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.<br>
Chris. Come.<br>
-Hi, Chris.<br>
-Mr. Frohm, good to see you.<br>
-Nice shirt.<br>
-Thank you, sir.<br>
-Chris.<br>
-Hey, Jay.<br>
-Chris.<br>
-Chris, sit down, please.<br>
I thought I'd wear a shirt today.<br>
You know,<br>
being the last day and all.<br>
Well, thank you. Thank you.<br>
We appreciate that.<br>
But...<br>
...wear one tomorrow though, okay?<br>
Because tomorrow's<br>
going to be your first day...<br>
...if you'd like to work here<br>
as a broker.<br>
Would you like that, Chris?<br>
Yes, sir.<br>
Good. We couldn't be happier.<br>
So welcome.<br>
-Was it as easy as it looked?<br>
-No, sir. No, sir, it wasn't.<br>
-Good luck, Chris.<br>
-Thank you. Thank you.<br>
Oh, Chris.<br>
I almost forgot.<br>
Thank you.<br>
This part of my life...<br>
...this little part...<br>
...is called "Happiness. "<br>
Christopher. Christopher.<br>
Come here.<br>
So how 
many...<br>
...planets are there?<br>
-Seven.<br>
-Seven?<br>
Nine.<br>
Who's the king of the jungle?<br>
-Gorilla.<br>
-The gorilla?<br>
The gorilla?<br>
No. Lion.<br>
Oh, yeah. Lion, lion, lion.<br>
Hey, Dad, listen to this.<br>
Knock, knock.<br>

When she comes<br>
-Knock knock.<br>
-Who's there?<br>
