EXT. STREET - DUSK

FRIDA and JENNIFER walk down the sidewalk together. Frida is
mousy and frumpy. She wears glasses and has her hair tightly
pulled back into a ponytail. She wears baggy drab clothes --
has no fashion sense and wears flat &quot;sensible&quot; shoes.
Jennifer, on the other hand, is trendy, stylish and sexy.
She's a head-turner. Men check out Jennifer and ignore Frida.

			FRIDA
	I have cramps. I can't believe I
	let you talk me into this.

			JENNIFER
	Come on, we've been double dating
	since the fourth grade.

			FRIDA
	Yeah even then look what happened:
	Michael Mortenson kissed you and
	Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.

			JENNIFER
	Well that's not going to happen
	tonight. George said Carlton's a
	nice guy.

			FRIDA
	Translation: a total geek.

			JENNIFER
	Anything's better than Mark.

			FRIDA
	My shrink says he's not so bad.

			JENNIFER
	Your shrink always gives you bad
	advice. He only hears what you
	choose to tell him. Mark's an
	asshole, he cheated, he borrowed
	money and never paid it back, he's
	never had a regular job.

			FRIDA
	He's a very talented musician.

			JENNIFER
	Every woman at some point has to
	date a musician. I wish you'd get
	rid of Mark for good. Every time
	you break up you see him more than
	when you were going out.

			FRIDA
	I guess I have a weakness for him.
	It's those big brown Bambi eyes.

			JENNIFER
	So don't look in his eyes.

Two guys passing by on the street check out Jennifer. One of
them stops in front of her.

			GUY
	That's the girl who should be
	havin' my baby.

			JENNIFER
	Yeah, that's likely.

She rolls her eyes and walks around the gawking guy. Frida
and Jennifer continue walking in silence for a moment.

			FRIDA
	I wonder what it's like being you.
	Being noticed all the time.

			JENNIFER
	People notice you Frida.

Another guy gawking at Jennifer, isn't watching where he's
going and bumps smack into Frida.

			FRIDA
	Oh, uh, sorry.

The guy, still not noticing Frida, keeps walking and turns
back around to check out Jennifer's ass.

Jennifer and Frida turn a corner and keep walking. Both a bit
embarrassed, for different reasons, at what just happened.
They head into a bar/restaurant. Pan up to the name of the
restaurant. It's called &quot;Coyote Ugly Saloon.&quot;


INT. RESTAURANT/TABLE - NIGHT

Jennifer sits between GEORGE and CARLTON, who both lean in,
hanging on her every word. They're all having steak.

			JENNIFER
	So I asked the bartender what
	&quot;coyote ugly&quot; meant. It's like the
	&quot;bagger&quot; system. You know, a two-
	bagger -- someone so ugly that you
	need two bags -- one bag to put on
	their head and another one in case
	it blows off. Or a three-bagger...

			GEORGE
	Two bags for them, and one bag for
	your head in case her two fall off.

Jennifer, George and Carlton laugh.

			JENNIFER
	But coyote ugly... well it's so
	totally offensive... it's when a
	guy wakes up with a girl sleeping
	on his arm. He looks over, and
	she's so ugly that he chews through
	his own arm to get away from her.

Carlton and George crack up. Too much.

PULL BACK to reveal Frida, also sitting at the table, though a
bit apart from the other three, picking meekly at her salad.
Jennifer looks over and sees Frida's not having a good time.

			JENNIFER
	Have you heard of that Frida?

Frida looks up from her plate of leaves.

			FRIDA
	Sorry? I guess I wasn't listening.
	I just have really bad PMS.

A total mood killer. Jennifer, George and Carlton just stare
at Frida. Jennifer puts her fork down and clears her throat.

			JENNIFER
	Uh, Frida... sorry about the steak
	house. It's Carlton's favorite.

			CARLTON
	How come you're a vegetarian?

			FRIDA
	When I was a kid, we couldn't eat
	meat on Fridays. I loved Fridays
	because of that. Now I can't stand
	the thought of eating bloody flesh.

Jennifer, George and Carlton look down at their rare steaks.

Suddenly they don't look so great.


INT. RESTAURANT/BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jennifer and Frida are in neighboring stalls. We see only
their feet below the stalls and panties around their ankles.
Jennifer's panties are red lace; Frida's are white cotton.

			FRIDA
	He hasn't said one word to me.

			JENNIFER
	Maybe he's just shy.

			FRIDA
	My date always pays more attention
	to you than to me.

			JENNIFER
	Frida, I don't mean this as a
	criticism, but you might not want
	to talk about PMS around men.

			FRIDA
	Sorry. It's just so bad lately.
	You're so lucky you never get PMS.

			JENNIFER
	I get a little bloated sometimes.

			FRIDA
	I'd kill for just a little bloated.

We hear a toilet FLUSH.


INT. RESTAURANT/TABLE - NIGHT

George and Carlton are sitting at the booth, waiting for the
women to return from the bathroom.

			GEORGE
	It all starts with them going to
	the bathroom together.

			CARLTON
	That many women in one place --
	nothing good can come from that.

			GEORGE
	Sorry about Frida. She's been
	friends with Jen forever.

			CARLTON
	What's with her? If they're not
	bleeding they're PMSing. If
	they're not PMSing, they're warning
	you about the impending doom. If
	you're lucky, you get a sane person
	one week a month. Then you gotta
	date three or four women just to
	get some normalcy in your life.

They laugh.

			GEORGE
	I'm lucky Jen's not like that.

			CARLTON
	I don't believe in PMS. Women made
	it up just so they can be bitchy.

			GEORGE
	My brother has an answer to PMS.
	A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A
	man gets sperm build-up, and if his
	woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's
	gotta get it elsewhere.

			CARLTON
	Yeah and when your woman says
	you're an ass, say yes, I have
	Abundant Sperm Syndrome.

They both laugh.


INT. RESTAURANT/BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jennifer and Frida are now in front of the mirror. Jennifer
fixes her make-up while Frida watches her. ECU of Jennifer
putting lipstick on in slow motion from Frida's POV. Jennifer
smacks her lips in a sexy way when she's done. Frida avoids
looking at herself in the mirror.

			FRIDA
	I always say the wrong thing. I
	shouldn't have come.

Frida catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror.

			FRIDA
	I'm coyote ugly.

Jennifer looks at Frida through the mirror.

			JENNIFER
	How about I give you a make-over?
	You'll feel better about yourself.
	You're actually pretty, you're just
	not bringing it out.

			FRIDA
	You're just saying that.

Jennifer squints at Frida for a closer look. She pulls
Frida's hair out of the ponytail and tries to fluff it up.
She takes off Frida's glasses.

			JENNIFER
	Do you really need these?

			FRIDA
	Only to see.

			JENNIFER
	Can't you get contacts?

			FRIDA
	No, it grosses me out even thinking
	of putting something in my eye.

			JENNIFER
	Try to get through dinner without
	them. You have beautiful eyes.

She snaps open Frida's purse and drops the glasses inside.
Frida looks at herself in the mirror. We see her POV and it's
out of focus.


INT. RESTAURANT/TABLE - NIGHT

Jennifer and Frida rejoin Carlton and George at the table.
From Frida's POV things look blurry. She stumbles as she sits
down. She squints, hoping things will come back in focus.

			CARLTON
	You two must be in sync.

			JENNIFER
	Excuse me?

			GEORGE
	He was saying that when women are
	close friends they get their
	periods at the same time.

			JENNIFER
		(sarcastically)
	Yeah and when we're mad at each
	other we're out of sync. It only
	works if you're on good terms.

			FRIDA
	Or if there's a full moon.

			JENNIFER
	Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.

She elbows George in the stomach. Frida tries to take a sip
from her drink, but because she can't see well she knocks it
over. Everyone stands up and it's a huge ordeal.

			FRIDA
	I'm so sorry! I'm such a clutz.

She fishes in her purse for her glasses and puts them on as
Jennifer helps her wipe up the spilled drink.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Frida's apartment is neat and conservatively decorated. She's
got some film posters on the wall.

Frida, in a big puffy bathrobe with bearclaw slippers, lounges
on her sofa. Sammy, a black cat, sits on her lap purring as
Frida reads a script. She nibbles on a chocolate bar. From
the way Frida shakes her head and flips through the pages of
the script, we can tell it's awful.


INT. FRIDA'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida sits at a claustrophobic cubicle. There's a small stack
of screenplays sitting in front of her. Frida's on the phone.

			FRIDA
	Yes, I do think it's important to
	tell the Mother Teresa story... but
	no way can I pitch that to my boss.

			MAN (ON PHONE)
	Why the hell not?

			FRIDA
	It won't get the ratings. He only
	wants &quot;women in jeopardy&quot; stories.

			MAN (ON PHONE)
	How about if Mother Teresa's being
	stalked by the Pope?

			FRIDA
	Only if Jane Seymour plays Mother
	Teresa and Richard Chamberlain
	plays the Pope. It's just not for
	us. I'm sorry. Good luck with it.

Frida hears the phone slam down and a dialtone. She hangs up
just as her boss, MR. GRANT, barges in and barks at her.

			MR. GRANT
	The Nielson's?

			FRIDA
	On your desk.

			MR. GRANT
	Script coverage?

			FRIDA
	On your desk.

			MR. GRANT
	Coffee and...

			FRIDA
	Your desk.

Mr. Grant abruptly turns and heads back into his office.

			FRIDA
	There was a script I wanted to talk
	to you about... I thought maybe...

She gets up with a script. As she does, she spills her coffee
all over the desk.

			FRIDA
	... I could produce it.

Mr. Grant ignores her and slams the door to his office. Frida
wipes up the spilled coffee with the script.


INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida's at her SHRINK's office.

			FRIDA
	I had a dream last night, that I
	was a doormat.

						CUT TO:


EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

Frida lies on her back outside the front door of a house, like
a welcome mat. People walk over her. We see from her POV:
people stepping over her and wiping their shoes on her.



BACK TO SHRINK'S OFFICE

The shrink makes a note.

			SHRINK
	And what do you think this means?

Frida stares at the shrink for a second, surprised he doesn't
get such an obvious reference.

			FRIDA
	That I'm a doormat of course.
	The shrink makes more notes.

			SHRINK
	Oh, I see... interesting theory.



EXT. PARK - DAY

Jennifer and Frida sit on a bench surrounded by shopping bags.

			JENNIFER
	Okay, just one more stop and you'll
	be all set. Victoria's Secret.

			FRIDA
	What do I need overpriced fancy
	underwear for? Shouldn't a guy
	have already decided that he likes
	me before he sees me in lingerie?

			JENNIFER
	It's not about him seeing you in
	it. It's how you feel. You'll
	feel sexy in lingerie and it'll
	show. It's an inner thing.

			FRIDA
	I don't know.

			JENNIFER
	There's a sale. It's such a nice
	place -- classical music, relaxing
	atmosphere. You deserve to pamper
	yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.


INT. VICTORIA'S SECRET - DAY

Chaos. Hardly the &quot;relaxed atmosphere&quot; Jennifer described.
Though there is indeed classical music playing.

CUT TO an overhead shot of a huge circular bin of women's
underpants and another bin of bras. All different colors.

Various women's hands pick frantically through the bins,
looking for the right size and color. Sometimes hands grab at
the same one simultaneously. The atmosphere seems hectic.

			WOMAN 1
	Give me that. You ain't a D cup.

			WOMAN 2
	If you're a D cup, I'm Pamela
	Anderson.

			WOMAN 3
	Is that a medium?

			WOMAN 1
	Why do they have large thongs?
	Anyone in a large ain't gonna be
	wearin' no thong.

			FRIDA
	Where are all the mediums?

			JENNIFER
	Frida, grab that red one.

Jennifer's finger points to a red panty and Frida snatches it
and gives it to her.

			WOMAN 2
	Large, small. No fucking mediums.

More and more hands pick through the bras and panties, with
increasing fervor. Frida's hand grabs a pair of blue panties.

			FRIDA
	Jennifer, I got a medium!

As Frida pulls the pair of panties out of the pile, she
realizes an OLIVE-SKINNED WOMAN is grabbing the other end of
the panties. They have a bit of a tug of war over it.

			OLIVE WOMAN
	That's mine!

			FRIDA
	No I had it first.

The tug of war continues. Frida and the Olive Woman both
refuse to let go. It looks like they're about to rip when the
Olive Woman's head comes into frame -- the back of her head
fills the frame with brunette curls. Frida screams.

			FRIDA
	OUCH!



EXT. STREET - DAY

Frida and Jennifer walk down the sidewalk with Victoria's
Secret shopping bags among others.

			FRIDA
	Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?

			JENNIFER
	And she got the medium.

			FRIDA
	Even on sale that stuff's a
	fortune. I worked all week to pay
	for a bra.

Frida looks at her wrist, which is beginning to swell.

			FRIDA
	I think she broke the skin.

			JENNIFER
	What a bitch. You should see a
	doctor. That can be dangerous.
	George bit me once and I had to go
	to the emergency room.

			FRIDA
	George bit you?

			JENNIFER
	I kind of asked him to. We were,
	you know... he got a little carried
	away...

Frida looks at Jennifer uncomfortably. Jennifer smiles to
herself, reminiscing.


INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida sits, wearing a white hospital gown, on an examining
table. She's bored as there isn't much to look at and it's
cold in there -- especially in the skimpy gown.

She goes to a mirror and puts on chapstick. She smacks her
lips as Jennifer had in after putting on lipstick.

Suddenly the door opens and nearly hits her. Frida backs up,
embarrassed, as a male DOCTOR in a white coat walks in. He
barely looks at Frida and stares at his clipboard.

			DOCTOR
	A bite... Where'd you get bitten?

			FRIDA
	At Victoria's Secret.

The doctor looks up from his clipboard, confused.

			FRIDA
	There was a sale.

			DOCTOR
	I mean where on your body?

			FRIDA
	Oh, on my wrist.

She holds it up for him to see. He takes a look at it.

			DOCTOR
	A dog at Victoria's Secret?

			FRIDA
	No, it was another woman.

The doctor seems skeptical. He examines her wrist closer.

			DOCTOR
	This doesn't look human. Did she
	wear dentures or... damn this is
	the oddest bite I've ever seen.

The doctor makes a note on his clipboard.

			DOCTOR
	How's the rest of your health?

			FRIDA
	Good. Except for PMS.

The doctor resists the temptation to roll his eyes.

			DOCTOR
	PMS. What symptoms are you
	experiencing?

			FRIDA
	It's hard to describe. I get
	really bloated and irritable and
	emotional and depressed and...

			DOCTOR
	That's just part of being a woman.
	Diet and exercise should help.
	Avoid salt, sugar, starches,
	caffeine, alcohol...

			FRIDA
	What else is there?

			DOCTOR
	And keep a journal of your symptoms
	to make sure it's related to your
	period and not just in your head.

			FRIDA
	It's not just in my head.

The doctor snaps his folder shut and heads for the door.

			DOCTOR
	I'll send a nurse in to clean that
	bite and give you a tetanus shot.
	And a rabies shot... just in case.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Frida chomps on a carrot. She presses PLAY on her answering
machine and picks up a framed picture of herself and MARK.
They're both smiling. Frida puts the picture back, face down.

			FRIDA'S MOM (ON MACHINE)
	It's mom. I ran into Herman today.
	I wish you'd move back home and
	marry him. He's got a great job at
	Penneys. I don't know why you're
	in New York with all those freaks.

Sammy, the black cat, whizzes by with his tail puffed.

Frida enters the kitchen and sees the cat's dishes are empty.
She gets a cat food can out of the cupboard and accidentally
scratches herself. She notices her nails are surprisingly
long. She stares at them, confused, then opens the cat food.

			FRIDA
	Sammy? Seafood Feast?

Frida sniffs the cat food as though it smells good to her.
She nearly eats some -- then shakes her head, realizing it was
a crazy thought. She stands up and sniffs around her kitchen.

She searches the cupboards. Then the refrigerator. It's full
of fruit and vegetables. The other cupboard has healthy stuff
as well. Frida slams the cupboard shut. Obviously not
finding what she's looking for.

A MONTAGE with jump cuts as Frida paces in circles. She clips
her fingernails and toenails, which are quite long and thick.

She goes to the refrigerator, opens the door, looks in and
closes the door. She does this several times as if its
contents will change the next time she opens it.

She paces faster and faster in a tighter circle. She feels
claustrophobic in her clothes and practically rips them off.


INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

Frida hurriedly shoves several chocolate bars in her basket,
which is filled with junk food (frozen yogurt, chocolate-
covered pretzels, Doritos), a box of tampons, and some Midol.

Frida senses someone watching her as she grabs a bag of
Hershey's kisses. She looks up and sees BRUNO, an intriguing-
looking man. They make eye-contact and he smiles at her.
Frida is nervous but flattered. She heads for the cashier.



EXT. GROCERY STORE/STREET - NIGHT

We see Frida walking from behind. We're in the POV of someone
who's following her. Then CU Frida as she continues walking,
holding her grocery bags. She senses someone following her
and spins around to look.

She sees Bruno walking behind her. She smiles a tad and then
turns back around and keeps walking. She hears Bruno's pace
quicken and she quickens her own.

We see Frida from Bruno's POV as he speeds up and is gaining
on her. What started out as a briefly sexy moment has
suddenly become kind of scary. CU on Frida walking fast. We
hear her heart beating fast. Bruno catches up to her -- he's
right behind her. Frida can hear him breathing hard.

Frida spins around and stares at Bruno. Her normally blue
yes look oddly bright -- like they're orange. She swipes at
the Bruno's face with her fingernails and slashes him. He
jumps back in pain and covers his face.

			BRUNO
	Jesus Christ!

He pulls his hand from his face to reveal large bloody
scratches on his cheek. He looks up at Frida, but she's gone.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Frida, in her bathrobe, is downing chocolate bars rabidly.
Her cat, Sammy, is hiding, frightened under the bed.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Frida's asleep on the sofa with her bathrobe draped over her.
She wakes up slowly, in a daze, like she has a bad hang-over.

She looks around, squinting -- the light hurts her eyes. Her
apartment's in disarray -- furniture moved around. She sits
up and puts her bathrobe on, realizing it's ripped.

			FRIDA
	Sammy?

Frida gets up and notices the cat food dish is empty. She
opens a can of cat food. The cat's nowhere to be seen.


INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

Frida looks in the mirror. She examines her arms and legs and
thinks they look hairy. They look fine, but she's obsessed.
She has a quick flash in which they look hairier, but then
they're normal again. Is it all in her head?

Frida leans closer to the mirror and scrutinizes her face and
&quot;mustache&quot; area. She then opens the medicine cabinet and
finds some Neet liquid hair remover and turns on the shower.


INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - DAY

Frida takes a brand new bra out of her Victoria's Secret
shopping bag. She puts on the bra -- it's clearly too tight.
She adjusts the straps to no avail -- she's still bulging out.
She pulls on a shirt and blazer.

Frida grabs her coat and briefcase and leaves. As soon as she
shuts the door, the cat comes out and goes to its food dish.


EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY

Frida sits in the sunshine eating chocolate pudding like
there's no tomorrow as she reads a script. She wears tennis
shoes with her suit. She feels a little hot and unbuttons the
top few buttons of her blouse.

GREGORY, a tall, good-looking guy in a suit, stands casting
his shadow on her. Frida is startled for a moment. She looks
up at him looming over her, but he's hard to see since the sun
is right behind him.

			GREGORY
	Didn't mean to scare ya. It's
	Frida, right? I'm Gregory. From
	accounting.

Frida's a little uneasy about him staring at her chest.

			FRIDA
	I know.

			GREGORY
	So you're Grant's secretary?

			FRIDA
	I do development for TV movies.

			GREGORY
	Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a
	really great idea for a screenplay.

Frida tries to avoid cringing.

			FRIDA
		(slightly sarcastic)
	You're kidding, really?

			GREGORY
	No, I'm serious. How about we have
	dinner and I tell you about it?


EXT. POLICE BUILDING - DAY

Two male police detectives, PETER and LLOYD, are getting out
of an unmarked car.

			LLOYD
	Nah, I don't wanna break up with
	Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.

			PETER
	Man, you're livin' dangerously.
	Let me ask you somethin', you
	always have to get women drunk
	before they'll sleep with you?

			LLOYD
	You kiddin'? They try to get ME
	drunk.

			PETER
	You're some catch Lloyd.

			LLOYD
	Hey, you hear about the chick that
	came in today? Said some chick bit
	her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches
	are outta control these days.



INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frida, in her ripped bathrobe, is setting up her new makeup on
a table. She hears a knock on the door and heads for it.

			FRIDA
	Jennifer, you're early...

She opens the door and sees MARK, the guy from the photo she'd
put face down. Mark is cute, but a bit of a geek. He does
have the nice brown eyes Frida mentioned earlier. He carries
a McDonald's bag and is eating a French fry.

			FRIDA
	What are you doing here Mark?

He pushes his way past her and into the apartment.

			MARK
	I missed you. I wanted to see you.

Frida's skeptical.

			MARK
	Hey what's all this stuff?

He shoves aside some of the makeup and puts down his
McDonald's bag on the table.

			FRIDA
	Jennifer's giving me a makeover.

Mark takes a burger out of the bag and unwraps it. Frida
sniffs at the burger.

			MARK
	What, you got a date or somethin'?

			FRIDA
	Since when do you care?

Frida lustily eyes the burger. Mark sees her check it out.

			MARK
	Sorry, I know you hate the sight of
	meat.

Mark looks at Frida for a moment -- for the first time really
since he barged in.

			MARK
	You look different. I mean you
	look good.

			FRIDA
	You never say that.

			MARK
	You do though. You look really...
	is that a wonderbra?

			FRIDA
	No.

He walks closer to her. Frida backs up.

Mark moves in closer, puts his arms around her and tries to
kiss her. Frida turns her head away from his kiss. She looks
down and sees the burger, which sits on the table behind Mark.

ECU of the burger looking delicious like in a commercial.

Frida sniffs and makes a little moan -- she's completely
focused on the burger. Mark thinks she's moaning for him, and
he continues kissing her neck. As he does, Frida reaches
down, picks up the burger and takes a huge bite out of it.

CLOSE ON Frida's face as we see her sheer near-orgasmic
enjoyment of the burger. Suddenly Mark jerks away.

			MARK
	OUCH! Shit! What the fuck?

He twists his arm to reach around to feel his back.
Completely ignoring Mark's pain, Frida takes a few more chomps
of the burger as though she hasn't eaten in days.

Mark lifts his shirt, which is ripped. He sees in the mirror
that his back has huge bleeding scratches on it.

			MARK
	Look what you did!

			FRIDA
	Oh my god, I'm sorry!

			MARK
	Shit. And you're eating my burger?
	You don't eat meat.

			FRIDA
	I can't help it, it smells so good.

Frida finishes the burger with an enormous bite and then runs
into the bathroom and gets rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball.

			MARK
	Fuck you have sharp nails.

Frida dabs his scratches with the rubbing alcohol.

			MARK
	OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I
	going to do with my back like this?

			FRIDA
	Worried about what all your
	girlfriends might think?

			MARK
	Frida, you know you're it for me.

			FRIDA
	Yeah right... You better go.

Frida pulls him towards the door. Mark grabs his empty burger
wrapper and fries.

			MARK
	Hey wait, I paid three bucks for
	that burger. You owe me...

			FRIDA
	You haven't even paid me back the
	thousand bucks you owe me!

			MARK
	I'm working on it...

Frida rolls her eyes. She drags him and pushes him out the
door. Mark's surprised by how strong Frida is.

Frida slams the door and locks it.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - LATER

ECUs of Jennifer putting make-up on Frida.

			FRIDA
	Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean
	he's cute -- he probably just wants
	to pitch his screenplay idea.

			JENNIFER
	Maybe he likes you, ever think of
	that? It's good for you to go out
	-- get your mind off Mark.

			FRIDA
	You're so lucky you have George and
	don't need to go on dates anymore.

			JENNIFER
	What I really hated about dating
	was the lines guys used to get into
	my apartment. &quot;Can I use your
	phone?&quot; &quot;How about a nightcap?&quot;
	&quot;I want to meet your cat.&quot; And my
	all-time favorite, the old standby,
	&quot;I have to use your bathroom.&quot;

			FRIDA
	Maybe they have to pee.

			JENNIFER
	Are you kidding? He might as well
	say, &quot;Can I date rape you?&quot;

			FRIDA
	I never thought of it like that. I
	never know what to do on dates. Do
	guys still pay?

			JENNIFER
	They better. Of course, trouble
	is, you never know what they'll
	expect for it. You gotta know what
	to order, and what you're willing
	to do. Like if a guy spends a
	fortune on you, he's gonna feel
	like you owe him something.

Frida looks worried. She picks up a big hand mirror on the
table and looks at herself.

			FRIDA
	Oh my god, I have a mustache!

Jennifer looks closely at Frida's face.

			JENNIFER
	Where?

			FRIDA
	Where? Where do you think a
	mustache would be. Look!

			JENNIFER
	I don't see anything. Maybe just a
	little.

			FRIDA
	Holy shit, I'm a freak.

			JENNIFER
	You are not Frida, we all have a
	little hair there. I didn't even
	notice till you showed me. We can
	bleach that, it's no big deal.

Jennifer brushes Frida's hair. She pauses and looks at
Frida's eyes.

			JENNIFER
	Hey, did you get contacts?

			FRIDA
		(suddenly realizing she's not
		wearing glasses)
	Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got
	stronger from not wearing them.


INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Frida sits across the table from Gregory.

			GREGORY
	You hungry?

			FRIDA
	Starving.

A waiter hands each of them a menu.

			GREGORY
	Have whatever you want. My treat.

They each look at menus. The entrees are listed from lighter
fair down to steaks. CU of each menu item and its price.
Frida does a double-take at her menu.

Instead of seeing a dollar amount, Frida reads it like this,
&quot;Chef's Salad = French Kissing and Groping; Pasta Special =
Heavy Petting and Breast Feel; Chicken Marsala = Blow Job;
Steak Frites = Regular Fucking; Surf and Turf Lobster = Kinky
Sex till you're sore.&quot;

			GREGORY
	Man I'm starving too, I think I'll
	go for the Surf and Turf.

			FRIDA
	I'm not really hungry after all.

			GREGORY
	You said you're starving. Come on,
	I can't stand a woman who won't
	eat.

Frida hungrily eyes a steak the waiter passes by with. She
inhales deeply.

			FRIDA
	Maybe just one little steak...


INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER)

CU of Frida eating. Devouring everything on her plate. Slow
DOLLY IN to CU of Frida as Gregory goes on about himself.

			GREGORY
	My senior year, I was waiting for
	that letter from Harvard. I'd
	heard from Yale. Got in. Brown,
	MIT, got in. But Harvard... here's
	the suspense... a letter comes...
	And everyone knows if it's a thin
	envelope you don't get in, right?
	So I get a thin envelope and I
	wasn't even gonna open it. I was
	just gonna jump off a bridge.
	Cause it was Harvard or bust...

Frida looks up momentarily as she rips off a particularly
tough piece of meat. Her food is much more interesting than
her date. Gregory blurs a bit into the background. His voice
is slightly altered -- as now we're hearing his subtext.

			GREGORY
	Okay let's face it, I got into
	Harvard cause my dad donated
	$50,000. I barely got a thousand
	on my SATs and was kicked outta
	prep school, but hey, that's life.
	I have a really small penis. Which
	is why I tell stories about how
	great I am. I'm also losing my
	hair and I have no interest in a
	relationship. I just want you to
	like my screenplay idea but I do
	expect you to fuck me later...

The camera's still on Frida as she's eating. She looks up at
Gregory again momentarily as he snaps back into focus.

			GREGORY
	So there I was, hanging from the
	edge of a bridge, when my mom said,
	&quot;Son, you got into Harvard!&quot; It
	took three of them to pull me back!
	Frida keeps eating.

			GREGORY
	Well, whattdaya think?

			FRIDA
	That's great. Highly original.

Frida cleans her plate with her finger and licks it. Gregory
stares at her. He's only half finished -- he's been busy
talking, and she's been busy eating. Frida eyes his half-
eaten steak and points at it with her fork.

			FRIDA
	Are you gonna finish that?


EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Gregory is walking Frida home. She gets her keys out.

			FRIDA
	I'd really feel more comfortable
	paying for my half of the dinner.

			GREGORY
	Hey, how about a little nightcap?

He leans against the door, blocking Frida as she tries to
unlock the door.

			FRIDA
	I'm really tired.

			GREGORY
	Come on, didn't all that steak make
	you thirsty?

			FRIDA
	No. Really, I'm... I don't feel
	well. I've got terrible PMS.

			GREGORY
	They say sex is great for cramps.

			FRIDA
	Well I have it worse than cramps.
	Goodnight Gregory.

She tries to push him aside from the door. He doesn't budge.
In fact he leans closer to Frida. She can feel his breath.

			GREGORY
	Can I use your bathroom?

Frida spins around.

			FRIDA
	What?

			GREGORY
	I really gotta pee.

			FRIDA
	You should have gone at the
	restaurant.

			GREGORY
	I didn't have to pee then.

			FRIDA
	My apartment's just such a mess.

			GREGORY
	That's okay. I just have to use
	the bathroom and then I'll leave.

			FRIDA
	Oh come on. Knock it off.

			GREGORY
	Knock what off?

			FRIDA
	You don't have to pee.

			GREGORY
	Yes I do have to pee!

			FRIDA
	You're just saying that to get into
	my apartment and then you're hoping
	that'll turn into something else.

			GREGORY
	I wouldn't mind doin' something
	else, but I do really have to pee.

			FRIDA
	Uh huh. So pee.

			GREGORY
	So pee? Here?

			FRIDA
	Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to
	see it -- that's what this is all
	about, right?

Gregory looks at her, not sure if she's serious. Then he
takes a step back and looks around to make sure no one's
watching. He then unzips his pants and pees. Frida has the
urge to laugh for a moment, but then she holds it back.

An awkward moment as Gregory takes a really long time to pee.
He looks over at Frida once or twice, and they exchange an
awkward glance. Finally he's done and he zips up his pants.

Frida and Gregory look at each other. Frida's eyes seem to
glow. She takes a step towards him. Gregory's taken off
guard as Frida grabs him and kisses him.

FADE TO WHITE and dissolve into next scene.


EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Dissolve down from a bright morning sky and then dolly in
quietly on the building.


INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING	31

Move in slowly on a CU of Frida sleeping. She wakes up and
squirms around a little. She notices a bloody handprint on
her pillowcase and jolts awake. She bolts up and sees blood
on her hand. She quickly pushes her sheets down and sees more
blood on her white sheets and on her legs. She sighs,
realizing she's gotten her period.

			FRIDA
	Thank god.

Frida looks around and squints. Her vision's blurry. She
grabs her glasses and puts them on. She sees Sammy curled up
at the foot of her bed, purring. She pets him.

			FRIDA
	Even you know when PMS is over.


EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Frida and Jennifer are each holding laundry baskets full of
laundry. Frida is juggling trying to lock her door while
balancing her basket on her leg.

			FRIDA
	It was like I woke up in a murder
	scene. It took me a few seconds to
	realize it was just my period. I
	must have had a bad dream.

Peter and Lloyd are at the end of the hallway looking at Frida
and Jennifer, but the women don't notice them.

			PETER
	We're looking for Frida Harris.

Frida and Jennifer turn and see Peter and Lloyd approaching.

			FRIDA
	I'm Frida Harris.

Her eyes lock with Peter's. There's some attraction there,
but we don't dwell on the moment too long. LLoyd is in no way
subtle checking out both women.

			PETER
	We're police detectives.

Frida feels guilty. She's not sure why. Maybe just cause
she's Catholic.

			LLOYD
	It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.

			FRIDA
	Oh my god, what happened?

			PETER
	He was found a few blocks away.

			LLOYD
	Torn apart. Limb from limb. A
	bloody gruesome mess.

Frida looks down at her laundry and sees the bloody sheet on
the top. Peter and LLoyd look down and see it too.

			FRIDA
	I had a little accident.

Jennifer sees Frida is embarrassed. Both men stare at her
bloody sheet. Lloyd clears his throat.

			JENNIFER
	Jesus Christ she got her period.
	Relax guys. It happens.

			PETER
	Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's
	roommate told us you were out with
	him last night.

			FRIDA
	Yes... I... we had dinner.

			LLOYD
	Did he come home with you? Did you
	go to his apartment?

			FRIDA
	No, it was our first date.

			LLOYD
	Looks like it was your only date.
	Unless you go to his funeral.

Lloyd chuckles. Peter shoots him a look.

			PETER
	When's the last time you saw him?

			FRIDA
	We... he walked me home and... we
	said goodnight. Um, he kissed me
	goodnight and that was it.

			LLOYD
	A kiss? Did you have sex with him?

			FRIDA
	No, I said it was our first date.

			JENNIFER
	How the hell is that your business?

			PETER
	We're just trying to figure out
	what happened.

			FRIDA
	I wish I could help but last I saw
	Gregory was outside my front door.

			PETER
	Okay, if you think of anything
	else, please give us a call.

Peter tries to hand Frida a business card, but she has no
hands free so he puts it on her bloody sheet. Lloyd can't
keep his eyes off the bloody sheet.

			LLOYD
	Uh... mind if we take those sheets
	in for testing? You know, to rule
	everything out.

Frida turns red.

			JENNIFER
	You want her sheets?

			PETER
	We can just take this pillowcase.

			LLOYD
	We can get a warrant if you like.

			FRIDA
	No, take it.

Peter slips on a glove and picks up the pillowcase with the
bloody handprint on it. He's nearly as embarrassed as Frida.
Their eyes lock for a moment, then they both avert their gazes.

			PETER
	Sorry.


INT. LAUNDROMAT - MORNING

Frida and Jennifer are taking their clothes out of dryers.

			FRIDA
	He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?

			JENNIFER
	There you go, blaming yourself for
	everything again.

			FRIDA
	And he was ripped limb from limb?

			JENNIFER
	I'm sure they were exaggerating.

			FRIDA
	Why would they exaggerate?

			JENNIFER
	To sound like big macho cops. He
	was probably just found with a
	knife in his back.

Jennifer looks up at Frida, who looks overwhelmed.

			JENNIFER
	So did you do it?

			FRIDA
	Did I kill him? Of course not!

			JENNIFER
	No, did you fuck him?

			FRIDA
	No. I don't think so.

			JENNIFER
	You don't think so? You either did
	or your didn't.

			FRIDA
	I don't remember. We kissed at my
	door and next thing I knew I woke
	up with my period. Alone.

			JENNIFER
	Did you get smashed or what? You
	have to eat if you're drinking.
	And not just those little salads.

			FRIDA
	I ate a burger in the afternoon and
	a steak and a half with Gregory.

			JENNIFER
	I guess you're off that vegetarian
	kick you've been on for ten years.

			FRIDA
	I couldn't stop eating steak. I
	felt out of control -- like I was
	making up for all those years being
	a vegetarian. I couldn't get
	enough. And then Gregory walked me
	home... and he peed in front of me.

			JENNIFER
	What? Why the hell did he do that?

			FRIDA
	He was trying to get into my
	apartment and... I know this sounds
	gross but I was so turned on. I
	grabbed him and kissed him!

			JENNIFER
	And then?

			FRIDA
	I think I went in and fell asleep.
	I guess Gregory walked home and got
	killed! I blacked out.

			JENNIFER
	At least your PMS is over.

			FRIDA
	And my bra finally fits again.

Jennifer folds some of George's boxer shorts.

			JENNIFER
	I thought you were going to stop
	wearing your glasses.

			FRIDA
	My vision got worse again.

Frida pulls out a pair of men's briefs from the dryer.
Jennifer eyes them suspiciously.

			JENNIFER
	Are those Mark's?

			FRIDA
	No, Mark wears boxers. They must
	have been in the dryer already.

			JENNIFER
	Uh huh... good thing those cops
	didn't see that.

Frida picks up Peter's card.

			FRIDA
	He was cute, huh? Of course
	whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing
	no make-up.

			JENNIFER
	Rule one: always wear make-up.

			FRIDA
	I wonder if he's married.

			JENNIFER
	He wasn't wearing a ring. But you
	don't want to date a cop Frida.
	They're so blue collar.

Frida leaves the briefs on the laundry table. She notices
they're ripped.


INT. POLICE OFFICE - DAY

Peter and Lloyd are going over some papers.

			LLOYD
	I didn't trust her. All that blood
	on the sheets. She may look sweet,
	but she could be a wolf in sheep's
	clothing. Something's weird.

			PETER
	That dude was torn limb from limb.
	No way a woman like that could have
	done it. You never seen blood on a
	chick's sheets from her period?

			LLOYD
	Hell no, I'm not into that shit.
	The sight of blood makes me sick.

			PETER
	Oh, so you decide to be a cop?
	Seriously? You don't have sex with
	a woman cause she's on the rag?

			LLOYD
	No man. Blood is not a turn on.
	You sure let that Frida off the
	hook. You weren't even going to
	take the sheets. If I didn't know
	better, I'd think you liked her.

			PETER
	I can tell she's not a killer. You
	just don't like her cause you have
	a hang up about menstruation.

			LLOYD
	Nah, man, I'm just saying, you
	should never date a woman who was
	the last one to see a guy alive.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jennifer is giving Frida a manicure. She's filing her nails.

			JENNIFER
	Your nails are so tough and pointy.
	What is this stuff under them?

Jennifer scrapes what looks like flesh from under her nails.
The phone rings.

			FRIDA
	Ignore it. It's probably my mom.

The machine picks up.

			FRIDA (ON MACHINE)
	Hi it's Frida. Leave a message!

The machine beeps.

			MARK (ON MACHINE)
	Frida, Frida, Frida. I get so hot
	thinking about yesterday. My
	scratches have almost healed and
	I'm ready for more.

Jennifer freezes.

			JENNIFER
	Gross, so this is Mark's flesh?
	When did you see him?

			FRIDA
	Um, he stopped by yesterday before
	you came over.

			JENNIFER
	Why didn't you tell me? You said
	you hadn't seen him for a month.

			FRIDA
	I'm sorry. I didn't want you to
	think I was still a doormat.

			JENNIFER
	Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not
	judging you... You didn't sleep
	with the creep did you?


INT. FRIDA'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida sits at her desk typing at her computer. A larger stack
of scripts sits beside her. Mr. Grant walks by and plops
several more on her desk. Frida's looking buried in scripts.

			MR. GRANT
	Find me that &quot;Woman in Jeopardy&quot;
	story.

He starts to pass by as usual, then stops, stares at Frida,
looking her up and down. He's noticed something has changed.

			FRIDA
	How about a &quot;Man in Jeopardy&quot;
	story?

			MR. GRANT
	Did you change your hair?

			FRIDA
	A little.

Mr. Grant nods and continues on his way. Frida gives him the
look of death.


INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida sitting at her shrink's office.

			FRIDA
	I had the strangest dream -- that I
	was really hungry, and I was
	chasing someone... I think I was
	some sort of animal. And my sex
	drive... it's embarrassing but I've
	had these sexual dreams too.

The shrink leans forward eagerly.

			SHRINK
	Anything about bestiality?

Frida looks back at him quizzically.

			FRIDA
	What's that?


EXT. STREET - DAY

Peter and Lloyd are walking. Peter's reading a lab report.

			LLOYD
	Frida's sheets checked out fine.
	It was just her own blood. From
	her... you know.

			PETER
	I told you she was innocent.

			LLOYD
	Hey, there was a lot of blood.

			PETER
	She was never a suspect Lloyd.
	Some animal must have done this.

			LLOYD
	I checked all the zoos. No missing
	animals. You think a pitbull?


			PETER
	Maybe. What about all those hairs
	they found on his body?

			LLOYD
	Waiting for DNA tests. He was
	hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.

			PETER
	Madonna's in Penthouse?

			LLOYD
	Back in the '80's. You didn't see
	the pictures? They were from
	before she got famous. She was
	hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.

			PETER
	Hairy women are kind of sexy.
	Women in their natural state.

Lloyd gives Peter a grossed out, horrified look.

			PETER
	What?

			LLOYD
	And you think I'm sick?


INT. FRIDA'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida sits at her desk, typing a letter. We hear a VOICE OVER
of what she's typing.

			FRIDA (V.O.)
	Thank you for your submission of
	&quot;Woman on the Tracks.&quot; Although
	the story of a woman being rescued
	by Fabio after being tied to the
	train tracks is indeed the kind of
	lame ass &quot;Women in Jeopardy&quot; genre
	that my company seeks, I cannot of
	sound mind pass this script on to
	anyone. In a nutshell: it sucks.

Mr. Grant walks by and dumps a few scripts on Frida's desk.

			FRIDA
	Wait. Mr. Grant.

He keeps walking. Frida rises and speaks with more authority.

			FRIDA
	Mr. Grant.

He stops in his tracks, surprised at her tone. He turns
around slowly.

			FRIDA
	I can't read any more crap. These
	women are all victims.

			MR. GRANT
	Yes, that's what we're looking for.

			FRIDA
	I think we should do something with
	strong female characters...

			MR. GRANT
	I'll make a note of that. Put the
	coverage on my desk.

Mr. Grant walks into his office. Frida sits down, satisfied
and surprised she had the nerve to speak to him like that.


INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida sits across from her doctor as he examines her wrist.

			DOCTOR
	That bite healed up quickly. It's
	been about three weeks?

			FRIDA
	Nearly four.

			DOCTOR
	How have you been feeling?

			FRIDA
	Okay, but I'm worried about the
	next PMS bout. It's gotten worse.
	I'm not myself during it. I get
	bloated, irritable, my breasts get
	huge, my nails turn into claws, my
	teeth get sharper and I have more
	facial and body hair.

			DOCTOR
	Sounds all stress related. Your
	teeth may feel sharper if you're
	grinding them at night. You don't
	seem hairy to me. Is that all?

			FRIDA
	I get crazy dreams and I black out.

			DOCTOR
	Diet and exercise, that's all there
	is. I'm not a big proponent of the
	PMS craze, but there's a book my
	wife mentioned called &quot;The PMS
	Diet,&quot; which may be helpful.

			FRIDA
	Does she have PMS?

			DOCTOR
	Now it's menopause. She's always
	hot. I gotta wear a parka around
	the house cause she keeps it so
	cold. It's always something.


MONTAGE

of Frida dieting and exercising -- eating carrots and salads.
Working out at a gym. Sometimes with Jennifer. Jogging.
Showing a passage of time and Frida trying to overcome PMS.


EXT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

Peter, wearing a &quot;University of Michigan&quot; T-shirt, is standing
across the street from the bookstore. Frida walks out of the
bookstore with a shopping bag and heads down the sidewalk.
Peter follows her.

Frida keeps walking but senses someone's following her. She
turns around quickly and sees Peter duck behind a corner. She
thinks about this for a second and then turns around and heads
for him. Peter realizes he's been seen and faces the music.

			PETER
	You busted me.

			FRIDA
	Are you following me?

			PETER
	No... no... this is embarrassing.
	I was returning your pillowcase...
	and I saw you cross the street...
	and I sort of started following
	you. I just find you really
	intriguing. I don't know why.

			FRIDA
	Intriguing?

Someone walks by, walking a dog. The dog barks viciously at
Frida, and the dog's owner has a tough time controlling him.
Frida looks afraid. Peter's a little weirded out too. The
dog's owner finally drags the barking dog away.

			FRIDA
	I gotta get going.
	Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.

			PETER
	At least let me give you this back.
	I washed it.

Just as Peter hands Frida the pillowcase, Mark rides by in his
bike. He screeches to a halt, nearly falling off his bike.
Mark stares at the pillowcase.

			MARK
	What's going on Frida?

Peter checks Mark out. Less like a cop than a jealous suitor.
Mark looks at Peter like he wants to kill him.

			FRIDA
	Where'd you get the bike?

			MARK
	I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's
	this, Mr. Date-Guy?

Mark, clearly jealous, looks at Peter, then the pillowcase.

			FRIDA
	No, this is Peter. He's a cop.

Mark suddenly seems nervous.

			MARK
	Oh, hi, uh, Pete. Gotta run Frida.

He takes off on his bike. Peter and Frida watch him ride off.

			PETER
	Being a cop has such a warm effect
	on people.

			FRIDA
	That's my ex. He's an asshole. In
	case you couldn't tell. I think
	he's been following me.

			PETER
	There's a lot of that going around.

She starts walking. Peter walks beside her.

			PETER
	You wanna get some coffee?

			FRIDA
	I'm trying to stay away from
	caffeine.

			PETER
	Some decaf then? That was stupid.
	Obviously you said you were staying
	away from caffeine as a nice way of
	blowing me off.

			FRIDA
	No. Really. I don't drink coffee
	anymore. I used to love it but my
	tastes have changed recently.

			PETER
	Okay well. Maybe some other time.
	They continue walking together.

			PETER
	So what book did you buy?

			FRIDA
	Oh, it's nothing.

			PETER
	No really, I love knowing what
	people read.

			FRIDA
	It's stupid.

			PETER
	I can forgive you a bestseller.

Frida takes her book out of her bag. It says &quot;The PMS Diet.&quot;

			PETER
	My mom used to get PMS too.

			FRIDA
	Used to? Did it stop finally?

			PETER
	No, she died when I was twelve.

			FRIDA
	I'm sorry.

			PETER
	I've had time to get over it. She
	was killed by wolves they think.

			FRIDA
	Oh my god, by wolves?

A chill runs down Frida's spine.

			PETER
	We lived in northern Minnesota.
	She went for a walk one night and
	they never found her body -- just
	her torn apart clothes with her
	blood and wolf blood on them. Then
	the town rounded up bunch of
	hunters and shot all the wolves in
	the area.

			FRIDA
	I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure
	puts my problems in perspective.

			PETER
	The weird thing is I've had an odd,
	morbid fascination with wolves ever
	since.


EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

Frida and Peter are walking across the bridge. The sun begins
setting. They look like they've talked all day.

			FRIDA
	I've read scripts about detectives,
	but never met one. Must be wild.

			PETER
	Sometimes it's frustrating. Like
	this Gregory Jameson case. We
	don't even know what killed him.
	I'm putting together little details
	to see if we're missing something.

			FRIDA
	Like what?

			PETER
	You know how moms always tell you
	to wear clean underwear in case
	you're in an accident? Well this
	guy wasn't wearing any underwear.

			FRIDA
	A lot of people don't wear
	underwear.

			PETER
	Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would
	need briefs to keep things in line.

Frida blushes.

			PETER
	Sorry. Sometimes I'm a bit frank.

They keep walking for a few moments.

			FRIDA
	How about you? Briefs or boxers?

			PETER
	Briefs.

			FRIDA
	Cool. I don't get guys who wear
	boxers. My ex wore boxers. I
	never got how he could wear khakis
	and not have his boxers bunch up.

			PETER
	Me neither. That's why I wear
	briefs... So why did you and...
	Mark break up?

			FRIDA
	He's bad news. He cheated on me,
	he insults me. Now suddenly he
	gets jealous if I have a date.

They keep walking. CU of Peter and Frida's hands as they
accidentally hit a few times as they walk. Peter reaches over
and touches her fingers. They hold hands for a moment, then
Frida lets go.


EXT. NY CITY - NIGHT

Night shots from throughout NY city. We hear Frida and
Peter's dialog over ominous shots.

			FRIDA
	I really gotta get going.

			PETER
	Thanks for the walk. Maybe we
	could... get a bite sometime?

			FRIDA
	Yeah. Maybe.

			PETER
	Goodnight.

			FRIDA
	Goodnight.

We see the moon and it's nearly full.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jennifer and Frida, on their way in, plunk themselves down
with big shopping bags.

			FRIDA
	I don't think I've ever actually
	liked anyone I've dated before.
	Peter even likes me without makeup.

			JENNIFER
	Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.

			FRIDA
	I don't know much about him. How
	do you know if a guy is decent?

			JENNIFER
	Give him the tampon test.

			FRIDA
	What the hell is the tampon test?

			JENNIFER
	You're at his place, and you come
	out of the bathroom looking all shy
	and say, &quot;I'm so embarrassed but
	could you run out and get me some
	tampons?&quot; If he says no, he's too
	embarrassed, then you know he's a
	wus. If he says he's got some in
	the bathroom, then you know there
	are other women around a lot. But
	if he says yes and goes to get you
	tampons, well then he's a decent
	guy. Then, while he's out...

Jennifer's voice over continues into the next scene.


INT. PETER'S APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Frida is searching through Peter's desk.

			JENNIFER (V.0.)
	... you search his apartment. Look
	for drugs in his medicine cabinet,
	look for pictures of women, look
	for bank statements.

Frida looks at some framed pictures, one of Peter when he was
a boy with his mother. Lots of pictures of Peter as a
teenager with wolf-looking dogs.

She searches some drawers and finds just normal guy stuff.
His police badge. His bookshelves are filled with wolf-
related books: Virginia Wolf, Thomas Wolfe, The Three Little
Pigs, Little Red Riding Hood. His CD collection: Bob Seeger
and the Silver Bullet Band and Los Lobos.

Suddenly she hears the front door opening. She quickly
straightens herself up and spins around as Peter opens the
door holding a bag full of tampon boxes.

			PETER
	I didn't know what kind to get.

He dumps out the bag. He got every make and model of tampon.

			PETER
	So I got one of each.


INT. PETER'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Frida sits at a candle-lit dining room table while Peter
serves her a dinner he's cooked and pours her some wine.
Frida notices some bullets in a glass frame on the wall.

			FRIDA
	What are those?

			PETER
	Silver bullets. A collectors item.
	These are very valuable. They were
	melted down from a crucifix.

			FRIDA
	What are they for?

			PETER
	Oh just my wolf paraphernalia.
	Some people collect beanie
	babies... I collect silver bullets.

They both eat. Frida takes a sip of wine.


INT. PETER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Frida and Peter are on the floor in front of the fireplace.
They have a long, slow, ongoing kiss and cling to each other
while they have dialog in between.

			PETER
	So... did you rummage through my
	stuff while I was gone?

He kisses her again.

			FRIDA
	What?

They kiss between sentences.

			PETER
	I'm a cop -- I notice everything.
	That drawer's ajar, that picture's
	been moved about an inch, the
	closet wasn't closed when I left...

			FRIDA
	Okay, you busted me.

They continue to kiss. Things start getting hot and heavy.
Frida lies back on the ground and gently pulls Peter on top of
her. They kiss for a moment then Peter pulls away.

			FRIDA
	What's wrong?

			PETER
	Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well
	don't you have your period?

			FRIDA
	My period? No.

Peter's confused.

			PETER
	But... what were those tampons for?

Frida remembers now.

			FRIDA
	Oh, yes, you're right. I guess I
	got carried away in the moment.

Frida straightens herself up.

			PETER
	I mean we can still... whatever...
	Maybe I should get a towel?

			FRIDA
	No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should
	go. I mean... I don't want our
	first time to be like this.

			PETER
	Frida, wait. Don't go. We can
	just sleep. I just want to wake up
	with you.

Frida has an itch on her arm. She looks at it and in a quick
flash, her arm looks incredibly hairy -- then it returns to
normal. Frida's freaked out. She puts her arms behind her
back. Peter doesn't get what's wrong.

			FRIDA
	I have to go. I'm not good at
	relationships.


INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Frida wakes up. She squints instinctively and looks for her
glasses. Then she realizes she can see clearly and doesn't
need them.

Sammy the cat immediately whizzes by hissing and ducks into
the other room. Frida looks insulted.

Frida looks in the hand mirror and notices her eyes have a
strange glow. She opens her mouth and her lower teeth look a
bit like wolves' teeth. She looks back up at her eyes again
and blinks, doing a double take. She looks down at her teeth
again and now they seem normal.

Frida inspects her face for facial hair. She touches her
breasts, which feel large and painful.


INT. FRIDA'S KITCHEN - DAY

Frida looks through the &quot;The PMS Diet&quot; book and makes a list.
Strange spices, odd and completely unappetizing ingredients.

MONTAGE of Frida coming back into apartment with all the diet
regimen stuff -- also bottles of Neet hair remover and tough
nail clippers, Midol.

Some ultra-quick cuts -- jump cuts, etc. of Frida working out,
trying to stick with her diet. Finally a shot of her covered
in chocolate like Al Pacino with cocaine in &quot;Scarface.&quot;


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frida, still with chocolate on her face, is on the phone.

			FRIDA
	I'm freaking out. I'm like an
	animal and totally out of control.
	My arms keep getting really hairy.

			JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
	You have to stop being so self-
	critical Frida.

			FRIDA
	I looked like an Italian man!

Jennifer laughs over the phone. Frida's dead serious.


INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jennifer, also on a cordless phone, is getting ready to go
out. She wears a tight dress and is putting on red lipstick.
George comes up behind her and kisses her neck.

			JENNIFER
	How'd it go with the cop?

			FRIDA (ON PHONE)
	We almost slept together... and...
	then the hair started and I booked.

			JENNIFER
	Frida, this hair thing is all in
	your head. You're using it as an
	excuse not to get close to anyone.

			FRIDA (ON PHONE)
	It's just as well. I'm afraid of
	getting hurt again. Mark seemed
	great at first too. I don't want
	to get too attached to Peter and
	then find out he's a creep.

			JENNIFER
	Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out
	with the three of us.

George hears this, shakes his head and motions to Jennifer
furiously with his hands, &quot;No, no!&quot; Jennifer shrugs him off.

			FRIDA (ON PHONE)
	Carlton hated me.

George glares at Jennifer. She playfully blows him a kiss.


BACK TO FRIDA'S APARTMENT

			JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
	No he didn't. Come on, I don't
	want to be alone with those two.
	All they talk about is basketball
	and it bores the hell out of me.

			FRIDA
	Okay. I guess so.

			JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
	Great. George is meeting Carlton
	first for drinks. We can meet and
	go together. It'll be a blast.


INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - DAY

Peter's eating a TV dinner, alone. He's doing a crossword
puzzle. CU of the puzzle -- Peter has written the name
&quot;Frida&quot; everywhere.


INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jennifer finishes her make-up and George paces the room.

			JENNIFER
	Come on, I've been working with
	Frida. Carlton won't even
	recognize her now. She's really
	coming out of her shell.

			GEORGE
	She's just so... pathetic.

			JENNIFER
	She's just insecure. Once you get
	to know her she's fabulous.

			GEORGE
	She'll talk about PMS and stare at
	her salad.


INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

A montage as Frida spreads Neet on her body in the shower.
Frida getting dressed. Her breasts are so big that she can't
fit into her biggest bra. She improvises with some tape.


EXT. STREET - DUSK

A pair of high heels walk down the street. We hear a guy's
whistle. Pan up the sexy legs that wear them. She's wearing
a miniskirt and a short jacket. Finally we get to her face
and it's Frida! She's a knockout. Beside her walks Jennifer.

Frida's sexier than we've seen her. Even Jennifer looks at
her like, &quot;Wow.&quot; The PMS starting again makes her sexy.

			FRIDA
	I started out on that eye-of-newt
	diet the doctor gave me and wound
	up in the tub covered in chocolate.

			JENNIFER
	Well whatever it was, seems to have
	worked cause you look great.

			FRIDA
	You're just saying that.

A couple of CUTE GUYS pass by. Jennifer looks at them,
expecting them to comment on her as men usually do. Instead,
the guys are checking out Frida.

			CUTE GUY
	Hey there beautiful.

Frida and Jennifer keep walking.

			FRIDA
	What did he say?

			JENNIFER
	I think he called you beautiful.

			FRIDA
	Oh my god. I've never had that
	before. I've had guys say they
	want me to suck their dicks and
	gross stuff but no one's ever said
	&quot;Hey there beautiful.&quot;

Jennifer's obviously a bit miffed that the comment wasn't
directed at her.


INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

CU of Frida eating rare steak. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Carlton
and George on each side of her, hanging on her every word as
they had been with Jennifer on the previous date. Jennifer
sits a bit off to the side feeling slightly left out.

			CARLTON
	Guess you like those Coyote Ugly
	steaks now, huh?

			FRIDA
	Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing
	down. I'm just starving.

			CARLTON
	Don't apologize. It's great to see
	a woman really enjoying her food.
	I hate it when I buy a woman dinner
	and she won't even touch it.

			GEORGE
	Yeah Jen here's always dieting and
	eating like a bird.

Jennifer is picking at her plate.

			CARLTON
	No one I've run into knows what
	&quot;coyote ugly&quot; means.

			FRIDA
	Maybe that bartender made it up. I
	mean I think coyotes are rather
	beautiful. Maybe &quot;coyote ugly&quot; is
	really a compliment. Like someone
	who's conventionally &quot;ugly&quot; but is
	really beautiful.

			CARLTON
	Yeah that's like a three bagger.
	Today a bag is also a condom, so
	now a three bagger can be a chick
	that's really hot. So hot you
	gotta put several condoms on to
	dull the senses.

			JENNIFER
	Charming Carlton.

			FRIDA
	It is so hot in here.

Frida takes off her jacket which reveals her newly large
breasts nearly bulging out of her shirt. Everyone at the
table can't help but notice.

			FRIDA
	Bag means condom now? I can't keep
	up with the word &quot;bag.&quot; It used to
	be &quot;No, that's not my bag&quot; --
	meaning not my thing. But now &quot;my
	bag&quot; means &quot;my fault.&quot;

			JENNIFER
	I still thought it was a purse.

			GEORGE
	Actually, it's &quot;my bad&quot; -- not &quot;my
	bag.&quot;  But you forgot the verb. To
	bag. &quot;I want to bag her.&quot;

			FRIDA
	Yeah but does that mean fuck her or
	kill her? Like a body bag?

Frida gulps down her water. Before she has a chance to ask
for more, Carlton and George trip over themselves getting the
waiter's attention.

			CARLTON
	Waiter! She needs more water.

			GEORGE
	Can we get some service here?

Jennifer takes her cigarette pack out and offers one to
George. He takes one as does Jennifer. She puts her
cigarette in her mouth and George lights his. Jennifer leans
over, expecting George to light her cigarette as well, but
he's not paying attention to her, so he blows out his match.
Jennifer is not amused. Frida's eyes light up at the smoke.

			FRIDA
	I have to go to the bathroom.

She bolts up, waving away the smoke. Jennifer follows her.


INT. RESTAURANT/BATHROOM - NIGHT

Frida and Jennifer are fixing their make-up in the mirror.

			JENNIFER
	You might want to tape your nipples
	down next time. It's really
	distracting.

			FRIDA
	I can't help it. My bra wouldn't
	even fit. I've been going to
	Victoria's Secret and exchanging
	bras for bigger ones and still I'm
	busting out. It's this PMS.

			JENNIFER
	Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.

			FRIDA
	No you don't, believe me.

Frida looks at her arm.

			FRIDA
	Oh my god, look. My arms are so
	hairy!

			JENNIFER
	No they're not.

They compare arms.

			FRIDA
	Yes they are! Look how much more
	hair I have than you!

			JENNIFER
	It's just cause mine is finer. A
	little bleach'll fix that.

			FRIDA
	I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.

A shot of Frida and Jennifer's arms and we don't see much
difference in them.


INT. RESTAURANT/BOOTH - NIGHT

Carlton and George back at the table.

			CARLTON
	No way is that the same chick. The
	other one was a dog.

			GEORGE
	Jennifer gave her a make-over.

			CARLTON
	Looks like a helluva lot more than
	a make-over. Was there surgery
	involved?

George and Carlton ponder this.


EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

Frida and Carlton walk through a remote area of Central Park.

			CARLTON
	Sorry I didn't recognize you
	earlier. You look so different.

			FRIDA
	I've changed a lot lately.

Carlton stops walking. Frida stops as well. Carlton touches
Frida's hair. Frida looks at him like she's tempted. She
sniffs, then turns away and keeps walking. Carlton walks too.
Carlton lights a cigarette. Frida flinches. Her eyes glow.

			FRIDA
	You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.

			CARLTON
	Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills.
	I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem
	like all the cool people smoke?

			FRIDA
	No.

			CARLTON
	James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...

			FRIDA
	Yul Brynner. They're all dead.

			CARLTON
	Yeah but they looked cool...

Carlton's voice trails off as he rambles on. Meanwhile Frida
is feeling strange symptoms. She's scratching like a dog.
She smells something and starts sniffing around.

Frida hears snippets of other conversations in various parts
of the park: a hold-up, a couple arguing, a couple making out.
Frida's head is spinning and she's breathing heavily. She
hears Carlton again.

			CARLTON
	As James Dean said, &quot;Live fast, die
	young, and leave a good-looking
	corpse.&quot;

ECU of Frida scratching herself with wolfian nails.

			FRIDA
	What?

			CARLTON
	Your lips look delicious.

Frida circles him slowly, staring into his eyes. He's turned
on and intrigued. She takes off her jacket, breathing heavily.
She zones in closer. Finally she's within reaching distance,
and Carlton grabs her waist and pulls her toward him.

			CARLTON
	Wow your body's really hot.

			FRIDA
	I've been working out.

			CARLTON
	I mean body temperature. Do you
	have a fever?

			FRIDA
	Never felt better.

She pulls the cigarette out of his hand and stomps it out.
She grabs his face and kisses him passionately. Then she
pulls away violently, which sends him spinning for a second.
He looks up and she's vanished. All Carlton sees is darkness.

			CARLTON
	Frida? Was it something I said?


INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

George is lifting some free weights. Jennifer's trying on a
wonderbra, trying to make her chest look bigger.

			JENNIFER
	I wonder how Frida and Carlton are
	getting along?

			GEORGE
	Carlton insisted on leaving with
	her. Maybe he got lucky.

			JENNIFER
	So now being with Frida is lucky?
	I thought you said she was a flake.


			GEORGE
	Well the flake got a lot hotter.


EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

Carlton is still searching in the darkness for Frida. He
hears a low growling from somewhere behind him.

			CARLTON
	Frida? Is this some sort of game?
		(playfully, as if calling a
		dog)
	Here Frida... Here girl....

He turns around but sees nothing. He takes a few more steps.

He hears another growl -- a bit louder and seeming a bit
closer. Carlton turns around and seems scared by what he
sees. He backpedals quickly away and breaks into a jog.

Whatever Carlton sees starts chasing him. We HEAR growling
and Carlton looks scared to death. He runs through the park
and is chased until he falls down, and we zoom in closer on
his terrified face as he screams. The growling gets louder.
Carlton's face is blocked by a shadow.


EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

A quiet and serene morning. DOLLY IN towards Frida's window.


INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Move in slowly on a CU of Frida sleeping -- same as the shot
earlier when she woke up with blood on her sheets. She wakes
up and sees a bloody handprint on her pillowcase. Frida's not
as alarmed, having seen this once before. She quickly pushes
her sheets down and sees some more blood and then quite a bit
more blood and...

A man's severed arm! Frida bolts out of bed screaming.

Frida goes back toward the bed where the bloody arm is in the
center. She circles the bed, wondering what the hell to do.

			FRIDA
		Holy shit, holy shit.

She picks up the cordless phone and dials, in a panic.


INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

CU of George smiling, leaning against the bed backboard. Pull
back to reveal he's sitting up on the bed naked, except for a
huge mound of whipped cream that covers his groin. Jennifer
is scantily clad and covered in whipped cream, spraying more
whipped cream on George's mound. They're giggling.

The phone rings. Jennifer bends down and licks a bit of
whipped cream off George's mound.


INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Frida, panicking and putting large boots on, hears the ringing
through her cordless phone.


BACK TO JENNIFER'S APARTMENT

The phone keeps ringing. Jennifer giggles. George sprays
whipped cream on Jennifer.

			JENNIFER
	Let it ring.

George reaches over to get the phone and picks it up.
Jennifer's disappointed that he answered.

			GEORGE
	Yeah?

			FRIDA (ON PHONE)
	George, I need to talk to Jennifer.
	It's an emergency.

Out of frame, Jennifer must be doing something to George,
cause he starts moaning with pleasure.

			FRIDA (ON PHONE)
	George? Is she there?

George hands the phone to Jennifer. Her face is now covered
with whipped cream as though she's just had a pie in the face.

			GEORGE
	It's for you. Frida.

			JENNIFER
	Tell her I'm eating.

Jennifer and George laugh. George hands the phone to Jennifer
and accidentally drops it in a pile of whipped cream.


INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Frida hears the muffled sounds of Jennifer and George
laughing. Finally she hears Jennifer, still half-laughing.

			JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
	Frida, this is a bad time. We're
	having sex and George actually
	answered the phone.

			FRIDA
	There is a man's arm in my bed.


BACK TO JENNIFER'S APARTMENT

			JENNIFER
	Frida, you are not coyote ugly.
	Everyone was drooling over you last
	night. Including George.

Jennifer flicks some whipped cream in George's face. He
tickles Jennifer, and she nearly drops the phone.


BACK TO FRIDA'S BEDROOM

Frida circles the bed again.

			FRIDA
	Jennifer. A severed arm. It's
	bloody and... I'm not sure but it
	may be Carlton's.

			JENNIFER
	You fucked Carlton? See I told you
	he liked you.

			FRIDA
	No! Not fucked him, I think I
	killed him.


BACK TO JENNIFER'S BEDROOM

Jennifer is laughing. George spreads her legs and sprays some
whipped cream on her. From Jennifer's POV -- we see George's
upper half as he holds her leg up to the side of frame.

			FRIDA (ON PHONE)
	Please come over. I'm begging you.
	What should I do with the arm?
	Should I call the cops or... Peter?

			JENNIFER
	Frida, you're not making sense. I
	can't come over right now.

Jennifer hangs up the phone and looks at George.

			JENNIFER
	Frida's hallucinating. Her PMS is
	out of control.


BACK TO FRIDA'S BEDROOM

Frida runs in wearing rubber gloves and holding a trash bag
and a broom.

She pokes the arm with the end of the broomstick.

Frida wraps the arm in a sheet -- careful to not touch it and
obviously grossed out. She opens the trash bag and spreads it
out on the floor. With the broom, she pushes the sheet-
wrapped arm into the trash bag.

MONTAGE of Frida darting around the apartment, searching for
places to stick the severed arm.


INT. FRIDA'S KITCHEN - DAY

Frida has the arm in her sink and is trying to fit it down the
garbage disposal. The phone rings. The arm is standing
straight up in her sink -- half shoved down the drain --
fingers side up. Frida runs to get the cordless and brings it
into the kitchen. She's a bit breathless when she answers.

			FRIDA
	Jennifer?

			MOTHER (ON PHONE)
	No it's mom.

			FRIDA
	Mom!

Frida recoils from the arm and the sink. Feeling somehow more
guilty about it with her mom on the phone.

			MOTHER (ON PHONE)
	We're worried about you. &quot;60
	Minutes&quot; was on same-sex couples.

			FRIDA
	What does that have to do with me?

			MOTHER (ON PHONE)
	You haven't mentioned dating anyone
	since Mark and, well you're not a
	lesbian are you?

			FRIDA
	No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.

			MOTHER (ON PHONE)
	It's okay if you are, we just want
	to know. I don't want to be
	expecting grandchildren if...

Frida glances at the arm in her sink.

			FRIDA
	I gotta go. My sink is clogged.

Frida hangs up. She inches over to the sink and turns on the
garbage disposal. It makes a horrid noise and blood spurts
about, but the arm slowly makes its way down the drain.


INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

Frida is alone in the laundromat. She shoves the bloody
sheets in the washer. Behind her, Peter walks in.

			PETER
	Frida?

Frida quickly slams shut the washer and spins around,
startled. She turns red and looks guilty.

			FRIDA
	Oh my god, you scared the shit out
	of me. You following me again?

			PETER
		(hurt by her accusation)
	No. I was doing my laundry.

			FRIDA
	I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.

Peter goes to one of the dryers and takes out his clothes.

			PETER
	Shit, where's my Michigan shirt?

He sticks his head in the dryer looking for it.

			PETER
	Was there anything in that washer?

			FRIDA
	No. Nope, nothing in it.

Frida backs up and puts her hand on top of the washer,
protecting it.

			PETER
	You sure? It's my favorite shirt,
	mind if I check?

			FRIDA
	NO! I... I checked when I put my
	stuff in. I always look through
	the washer first.

Peter backs up, noticing Frida's acting weird. He's a little
hurt by her distance.

			PETER
	Oh... okay well maybe I lost it
	somewhere...

He goes to his laundry bag. Trying to think of what to say.

			PETER
	Hey, I'm sorry if things got a
	little heavy the other...

His beeper rings. He takes a cellular phone out of his pocket
and dials.

			PETER
	Yeah? Uh huh... What? Torn to
	bits? Jesus Christ. Okay I'll be
	right there.

He puts the cellular phone back in his pocket.

			FRIDA
	Everything okay?

			PETER
	A man killed in Central Park.

Peter runs out. Frida paces nervously around the laundromat.


INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jennifer looks at Frida incredulously.

			JENNIFER
		(sarcastically)
	So where's this infamous arm now?

			FRIDA
	I put it down the garbage disposal.

			JENNIFER
	And what makes you think you killed
	a man?

			FRIDA
	Because of PMS, I get hairy, my
	nails turn into claws, I eat raw
	meat, I roam the city hunting for
	flesh. I've become a werewolf!

Jennifer stares at Frida.

			JENNIFER
	You're a PMS werewolf. Of course.
	Frida, are you on drugs?

			FRIDA
	No, last night I think I chased
	Carlton around as a wolf and killed
	him. I woke up with a taste of
	blood in my mouth and a severed arm
	in my bed. And my throat hurts.

Jennifer sits down. She shakes her head.

			JENNIFER
	You're delusional. Maybe you had a
	bad dream and bit your lip -- so
	you tasted blood. And the severed
	arm... well I don't see it and...
	maybe this is all in your head.

			FRIDA
	It took me an hour to clean it up.
	That was not in my head!

			JENNIFER
	Maybe the blood was from your
	period like before.

			FRIDA
	I haven't gotten it yet.

			JENNIFER
	Frida, listen to yourself. If I
	said I was a werewolf, would you
	believe me?

			FRIDA
	I don't know. You have to take
	Sammy. He's afraid of me.


INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE - DAY

Frida sits in her shrink's office.

			FRIDA
	I think I'm a werewolf.

			SHRINK
	Let's explore this. What makes you
	feel you're a werewolf?

The shrink makes notes on his pad, &quot;Insane. Delusional.&quot;

			FRIDA
	I ate a guy last night.

			SHRINK
	And how did you feel when you ate
	this guy?

			FRIDA
	I don't know. I don't remember
	doing it.

The shrink sits back in his chair. He thinks for a moment
while Frida stares at him. Finally he nods knowingly.

			SHRINK
	Dreams about killing usually
	signify feelings of guilt. You had
	sex last night and you feel guilty.

			FRIDA
	We didn't have sex.

			SHRINK
	You say you killed a man and don't
	remember it. Couldn't you have had
	sex and not remember it? It's
	sexual. Why did you choose &quot;eating
	him&quot; as the method of killing?

			FRIDA
	Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!

			SHRINK
	You use the word &quot;fucking.&quot; You're
	sexualizing things. Stop berating
	yourself. It's okay to have sex.


INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jennifer stands near the door with the cat carrying case.
George opens a window at the other side of the room.

			GEORGE
	I'm supposed to put up with a
	fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause
	your friend's got PMS?

			JENNIFER
	It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.

			GEORGE
	You have some weird friends. What
	does her thinking she's a werewolf
	have to do with us having the cat?

			JENNIFER
	Don't be stupid George. Obviously
	if she's a werewolf, she can't be
	around a cat. She might eat it and
	besides, cats are afraid of wolves.

George sneezes.

			GEORGE
	Oh great. What the fuck am I
	supposed to do?

			JENNIFER
	Take some allergy medicine.

			GEORGE
	You can't believe this bullshit.

			JENNIFER
	She's my best friend. I gotta be
	there for her -- no matter how
	crazy it sounds. I've been in some
	bad relationships and she's been
	there for me. She's lonely. If
	pretending she's a werewolf helps,
	then more power to her.

She hears another &quot;meow&quot; from the carrier.

			JENNIFER
	Do we have any tuna?


INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - DUSK

Frida, very tired, goes to sleep.


INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - DUSK

George takes his allergy medicine. Jennifer is opening a can
of cat food. The doorbell rings. George goes to answer it in
the background as Jennifer feeds the cat in the foreground.
George opens the door -- Peter and Lloyd stand there.

			PETER
	Are you George McCracken?

Jennifer looks over.

			JENNIFER
	They're police detectives.

George nods. Jennifer starts opening the cat food can.

			GEORGE
	Yeah, I'm George McCracken.

			PETER
	We're here about Carlton Fraser.

Jennifer freezes.

			LLOYD
	Your address was in his pocket.

			GEORGE
	Yeah, we were out last night. What
	happened? Was he in an accident?

			PETER
	He was found nearly ripped to
	shreds in Central Park.

			LLOYD
	And he was missing an arm.

Jennifer drops the can opener. Peter looks over. Jennifer
picks up the can opener and puts it on the counter.

			PETER
	When's the last time you saw
	Carlton?

			GEORGE
	After dinner, he left with Jen's
	friend, Frida.

Peter looks at Jennifer, who looks like she's seen a ghost.

			PETER
	Frida Harris? Was she dating him?

Peter seems jealous. Lloyd looks suspicious.

			JENNIFER
	No, heavens no. They're just...
	friends.

Lloyd looks at Peter. Peter changes the subject quickly.

			PETER
	Uh... do you know any enemies
	Carlton might have?

Jennifer and George look at each other, shake their heads, &quot;no.&quot;


INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Frida is sleeping. Suddenly she rolls over and opens her
eyes. Her eyes have an orangish glow. She's wide awake but
looks trance-like.

Fade to Black.


INT. SPENCER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

OVER DARKNESS, we hear the giggling of Frida and SPENCER.

			SPENCER
	Is Frida your real name or just
	what you tell guys you meet at
	clubs?

			FRIDA
	It's Frida. Frida the FREAK.

Spencer and Frida laugh. We hear the rattle of keys.

			FRIDA
	Having trouble sticking it in?

As the apartment door opens, we see (in silhouette) Spencer
carrying Frida over the threshold as a groom would his bride.
He then flips on the lights of his apartment and kicks the
door closed behind him. Spencer is longhaired and sexy.

Frida is dressed very seductively and wears a lot of makeup --
but she looks great. She's busty and curvy -- barely
recognizable from the frump of the first few scenes. Frida
holds her hand up to block the light from her eyes.

			FRIDA
	The lights bother my eyes. Can we
	turn them off?
			SPENCER
	But you're so beautiful. I want to
	look at you.

Frida takes a big whiff of Spencer.

			FRIDA
	Ummmm... you smell good.

Spencer puts Frida down. She immediately starts pacing and
circling the apartment, wolflike. She's on the prowl. She's
acting different than we've seen her before. Spencer is
wearing a Los Lobos T-shirt.

			FRIDA
	Are all these your guitars?

			SPENCER
	Are those your real breasts?

She struts over to him.

			FRIDA
	Why don't you decide for yourself.

Frida puts his hands on her breasts and gives him a deep,
aggressive kiss. She unzips his pants.

			FRIDA
	You're not too drunk, are you?


INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jennifer is on her cellular phone. She's hunched behind a
closed door like she doesn't want to be seen or heard.
She hears Frida's machine pick up.

			JENNIFER
		(whispering)
	Frida... pick up the phone...


INT. SPENCER'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT

Spencer leads Frida to his bedroom. He turns on the lights.
Frida turns them back off. Spencer turns them back on.

			SPENCER
	It's sexier with the lights on.

			FRIDA
	I prefer the darkness.

Spencer and Frida start taking off their clothes. Frida turns
off the lights before they're completely nude. Behind them, a
bit of light comes through the window.

We hear them going at it.

			SPENCER
	God, your nails are sharp.

Frida laughs. Spencer flips on the light as they make out.
Frida turns the light off.

			FRIDA
	Is this all you have?
			SPENCER
	Give it a few min... Oh yeah,
	nibble on my ear.

Spencer flips on the lights again.

			SPENCER
	The better to see you with.

Frida turns them back off. We hear them going at it again.

			SPENCER
	I love it when you bite me. Ouch,
	shit. Damn, that hurt.

Spencer turns the light on. He gets a quick look at Frida --
her eyes glow like wolf eyes. Frida turns the light off.

We hear Spencer freaking out and wolf-like growls and noises.
A vicious attack. From the darkness, we see the silhouette of
a human figure with wolf-like features get up from the bed and
walk off. Spencer is moaning.

The room remains dark for a moment. Then Spencer struggles
and turns on the light. He's all bloodied and can barely move
as he reaches for the phone. As soon as he grabs the
receiver, he dies. The bloody phone falls to the floor.


EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Peter and Lloyd are ringing Frida's buzzer. No answer.

			LLOYD
	I still don't get when you gave her
	back the pillowcase.

			PETER
	We only live a few blocks apart.

			LLOYD
	This is more than fishy, this chick
	dates a dude and he winds up dead.

			PETER
	Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she
	killed them.

Lloyd thinks for a second. He scratches his head.

			LLOYD
	She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe
	she hired someone to kill them.

			PETER
	She's not a suspect. What is her
	motive? There's nothing, NOTHING
	connecting her to either crime
	except that she dated both guys.

			LLOYD
	Sounds like you got a conflict of
	interest.

			PETER
	You take the cake Lloyd. Come on,
	she's not here. Let's check out
	her psycho ex.

Peter and Lloyd walk away. Lloyd glances back at the
building.

			LLOYD
	How do you know about her psycho
	ex?


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

We see Frida's POV as she runs through the streets. Quick
glimpses of her growling and panting. Shots of people on the
street who are looking at her, frightened. A little boy
stares at her as she passes.

			BOY
	Wolf! Wolf!

Montage culminates with a low angle shot of Frida's silhouette,
with wolflike features, howling in front of a full moon.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frida's asleep, disheveled, with scratches all over her. The
phone's ringing. Frida stretches like a cat and gets up and
sleepily answers the phone.

			FRIDA
	Hello?

			JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
	Frida? I was worried to death
	about you. I've called you for two
	days. Where have you been?

			FRIDA
	I've been here. What day is it?

			JENNIFER
	Tuesday. Are you okay?

			FRIDA
	Shit, I guess I missed work.

			JENNIFER
	Frida, Carlton's dead.

			FRIDA
	Oh no.

			JENNIFER
	And he was missing an arm.

			FRIDA
	Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to
	confession.

			JENNIFER
	Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No
	way could you have done that.
	Maybe you saw someone kill him and
	blocked it out... or...

There's a knock on the door. Frida whispers into the phone.

			FRIDA
		(whispering)
	Someone's at my door. Maybe it's
	the cops.

More knocks and Frida hears Mark's voice behind the door.
</pre>
<pre>			        MARK (FROM THE HALLWAY)
	Frida? I hear you talking. I know
	you're in there. Let me in.

			FRIDA
		(whispering into phone)
	It's Mark.

			JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
	Get rid of him!

			FRIDA
	Okay, I gotta go.

			JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
	I'm stopping by later. I'm worried
	about you. Bye.

Frida hangs up the phone.

			MARK (FROM THE HALLWAY)
	It's a matter of life and death.

			FRIDA
This really isn't a good time.

			MARK (FROM THE HALLWAY)
	Come on Frida, I'm not kidding.
	I'm totally fucked. Let me in.

He bangs loudly on the door. Frida opens it and he barges in.

			MARK
	I did something stupid. I had a
	courier job -- picking up a package
	from the airport. It turned out to
	be money -- so I kind of borrowed
	it to pay my rent and now these
	dudes are after me.

			FRIDA
	So pay them back and apologize.

			MARK
	These guys aren't the kind that'll
	take an apology. They're the kind
	that'll break my thumbs.

			FRIDA
	You think that story's gonna make
	me loan you money?

			MARK
	It's the truth. If you'd just
	loaned me the money last time this
	never would have happened.

			FRIDA
	Somehow this winds up being my
	fault? You always blame me.

			MARK
	Come on, I'm your biggest
	supporter.

			FRIDA
	My bra is my biggest supporter.

			MARK
	I just need a place to lay low for
	a few days. Come on, I know you
	hate me but you can't wanna see me
	at the bottom of the East River?

Mark looks up at her with his pleading Bambi eyes that Frida
always falls for.

Mark goes to hug her and kiss her neck. She sniffs him. Then
sniffs him again more closely -- like a dog. Mark giggles.
Frida doesn't like what she smells.

			MARK
	Do I smell? Can I take a shower?

He lifts his arms and sniffs his armpits.

			FRIDA
	I'm not feeling too well all of the
	sudden. Go take your shower.


INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - DUSK	88

Mark puts his wallet, watch and beeper on the dresser and
leaves the room, unbuttoning his shirt. Frida enters and sits
on the bed. Her head is spinning. Mark turns on the shower,
which we hear off screen. He passes in front of the camera,
shirtless. Frida sees him, gets up and walks toward him.

			FRIDA
	Mark.

			MARK
	Yeah?

He comes back into frame. Frida grabs him and kisses him on
the mouth. He's taken off guard. She then pushes him away.

			MARK
	Wow.

			FRIDA
	Take your shower.

Mark leaves frame. Frida goes back into the bedroom. She
hears Mark singing, muffled from the bathroom. Frida's about
to lie back on the bed when Mark's beeper goes off.

She reaches up to the dresser for the beeper. It's the kind
that has a message on it. She presses the message button and
sees, &quot;Mark you studmuffin, last night was awesome. See you
soon. Sherry.&quot; Frida puts down the beeper.

She leans back on the bed and stares up at the ceiling. Her
eyes are glowing.


INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - DUSK

Mark steps in the shower and pulls the shower curtain closed.
CU of the water coming out of the spout. Mark suds his body
with soap and continues singing. He starts even lightly
dancing in the shower -- looking vain and ridiculous.

A blurry human figure with wolf-like features appears behind
the shower curtain -- but Mark has his back turned and doesn't
see it. Then he hears a growl over the sound of the water
running. Mark turns around and sees the figure.

Then we see from the wolf-figure's POV an attack on Mark.
Reminiscent of the shower scene from &quot;Psycho.&quot;

After the attack, the blurry, wolfish figure runs off, and the
camera stays on Mark as he slumps to the ground. We zoom in
on his eye and on the bloody water going down the drain.
Dissolve from the eye to a full moon and then back to the eye.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Camera dollies creepily through the apartment as we still hear
the sound of the water running in the shower.

FADE TO BLACK.


INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

A knocking at the door awakens Frida. She is nearly naked
except for some shredded clothing. Her face is scratched.
She moves her mouth as though she has a bad taste in it. She
blinks a few times and her vision seems blurry.

She sits up, puts her glasses on, throws on her robe and
stumbles to answer the door. The shower water is still
running, but Frida doesn't seem to notice.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Frida opens the door and Jennifer walks in. Frida looks
really out of it, and there's blood on the front of her.

			JENNIFER
	Shit what happened to you? What's
	all over you?

Frida looks down at her chest and sees blood.

			FRIDA
	Holy shit, I don't know.

			JENNIFER
	Did you get rid of Mark?

			FRIDA
	I don't know... I'm spaced out...
	he was taking a shower... He must
	be still in there.

			JENNIFER
	He's been here all night?

			FRIDA
	Yeah, I guess. Mark?

Frida heads for the bathroom and Jennifer follows.


INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM/HALLWAY - DAY

Frida and Jennifer are near the bathroom and see a trickle of
blood on the edge of the white bathroom tiles.

			FRIDA
	Oh my god.

They inch closer to the bathroom and see Mark lying dead and
bloody, holding onto the shower curtain. Blood is all over
the white tiles. Frida flinches and spins out of the bathroom
and covers her eyes. Jennifer just stares at Mark.

			JENNIFER
	Frida, we need to talk.

Frida takes a deep breath and peeks back into the bathroom.

			FRIDA
	Oh god, did I do that?

Jennifer stares at the bloody mess that was Mark.

			JENNIFER
	Let's get him into the bathtub.

Frida and Jennifer pick up the still bleeding Mark to lug him
back into the shower/bathtub.

			JENNIFER
	Okay, so tell me again about that
	werewolf thing...


INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

The dead Mark sits propped up in the bathtub. Jennifer and
Frida are on their hands and knees with scrub brushes and
soap, cleaning the bathroom floor.

			JENNIFER
	If there's gonna be a bloody mess,
	at least it's in the bathtub.
	We'll just hose him off till the
	blood runs out.

Frida and Jennifer look at Mark. He's missing a tooth.

			JENNIFER
	What happened to his tooth?

			FRIDA
	I should call the police. Oh no
	Peter. Peter is the police!

			JENNIFER
	DON'T call the police.

			FRIDA
	Why not? There's been a murder.

			JENNIFER
	First of all, you're my alibi. I
	told George I was with you last
	night.

			FRIDA
	What? Why'd you do that?

			JENNIFER
	There's kind of this guy I'm
	seeing.

			FRIDA
	You're cheating on George?
	Jennifer, how could you?

Jennifer looks over at Mark in the tub.

			JENNIFER
	How could I? I'm helping you clean
	up Mark's remains and you ask how
	could I cheat on George?

			FRIDA
	You're right. It's just, I can't
	cover up a murder so George won't
	know you're cheating.

			JENNIFER
	You say murder, but you have no
	idea what happened. You don't
	remember doing it, so it's out of
	your control.

			FRIDA
	I think I turned into a werewolf
	and killed him.

			JENNIFER
	Why the fuck would you do that?

			FRIDA
	I could smell another woman on him.

			JENNIFER
	If you ask me, the fucker got what
	he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.

			FRIDA
	That's a terrible thing to say.
	Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.

			JENNIFER
	Okay, let's say that this is PMS-
	related. You think those male cops
	are going to understand that?
	You'll either be locked up for
	murder or locked up in the looney
	bin. We have to keep this hidden
	until we figure it out ourselves.


INT. POLICE CAR - DAY 95

Peter's driving with Lloyd in the passenger seat.


			LLOYD
	Nah, East Village poseur was
	grosser than the dude in the park.

			PETER
	The park dude was missing an arm.

			LLOYD
	Poseur was missing a chunk of his
	neck. And his eyes were open.
	That always bugs me out. Do me a
	favor, if some mutherfucker's about
	to blow me away, remind me to close
	my fuckin' eyes.

			PETER
	Deal. And if some mutherfucker's
	about to blow me away, shoot him.

			LLOYD
	Yeah okay. I still say Frida's
	involved. She's the last one to
	see two dudes alive...

			PETER
	She wasn't the last one to see them
	alive. Whoever killed them was.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frida and Jennifer have Mark in a bag in the kitchen.

			JENNIFER
	At least I finally saw the reason
	you couldn't get over Mark.

			FRIDA
	You should have seen it erect.

They hear the intercom buzzer and stare at each other.

			JENNIFER
	You expecting someone?

			FRIDA
	No.

			JENNIFER
	Ignore it.

The buzzer keeps buzzing. Frida goes to the window and looks
down to the street. Just as she does, outside, Peter and
Lloyd step back from the building and look up at Frida in the
window. Peter smiles and waves. Frida forces a smile and
waves back. Then she ducks back away from the window.

			FRIDA
	Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me,
	now I have to let him in.

			JENNIFER
	Tell them you'll meet them outside.

Frida goes to the intercom and presses it.

			FRIDA
	Uh.... hi!

			PETER
	Frida, can we come in? We need to
	talk to you. It's important.

			FRIDA
	Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be
	down in a second.

She releases the intercom buzzer.

			FRIDA
	What the fuck are we going to do?

			JENNIFER
	Hide him.

Frida and Jennifer both look around the small apartment.

			FRIDA
	The refrigerator.

She opens the refrigerator and starts taking everything out.
Jennifer helps her. They drag Mark's body over.

			FRIDA
	Go downstairs and stall them.

Jennifer goes.


INT./EXT. FRIDA'S BUILDING/ENTRYWAY - DAY

Jennifer walks toward Peter and Lloyd, who are standing
outside and can see her through the glass door. She swings
her hips as she walks and puts on a flirtatious smile. She
opens the door and stands in it -- blocking their entrance.

			JENNIFER
	Hi guys. What's up?

Lloyd is especially happy to see Jennifer.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frida has Mark shoved in the refrigerator and is closing the
door. She frantically puts the former contents of the
refrigerator into cupboards.


INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Jennifer, Peter and Lloyd are in the elevator. The doors are
about to close when Jennifer sticks her hand between them and
pokes her head out into the hall.

			JENNIFER
	I thought I heard someone coming.

She gets back in the elevator and the doors close. She pushes
the button for the fourth floor.

			JENNIFER
	Oh shit, wrong floor.

She pushes the button for the fifth floor. The cops eye her
suspiciously. She smiles as the elevator doors close.

			JENNIFER
	I was thinking about becoming a cop
	myself. Do you take a test or
	something or just sign up?

			PETER
	Why would you want to be a cop?

			JENNIFER
	I don't know, I guess the outfits
	are cool. And I want a big gun.

She winks at Lloyd who smiles back at her.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frida is shoving Mark's clothes in the freezer. She hears a
knock on the door and Jennifer's voice.

			JENNIFER (FROM THE HALLWAY)
	Frida? It's us... Jennifer and the
	nice detectives.

Frida takes a last look around, tries to compose herself, and
lets them in.

			FRIDA
	Hi guys! What's up?

Peter, Lloyd and Jennifer walk in. Jennifer looks around,
making sure Frida didn't forget anything.

			PETER
	We need to ask you a few questions.

There's a weird tension between Peter and Frida. He hates
having to ask her these questions.

			LLOYD
	You heard about Carlton Fraser?

			FRIDA
	Yes, Jennifer told me. What does
	that have to do with me?

			PETER
	You had a date with Carlton?

			FRIDA
	It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited
	me along to dinner with them.

			LLOYD
	Seems you were the last to see
	Carlton alive. And the last to see
	Gregory alive.

			FRIDA
	What makes you think I was the last
	one?

			PETER
	He means the last that we know of.

			LLOYD
	This one walk you home too?

			FRIDA
	No. We left the restaurant, and...
	and I felt sick... so... so I took
	a cab home. Alone.

			LLOYD
	You got a dog?

			FRIDA
	No, I have a cat.

			LLOYD
	How big?

Lloyd looks around. He starts coughing -- like he's choking
on something.

			PETER
	You okay Lloyd?

Lloyd tries to nod his head &quot;yes&quot; but keeps coughing.

			PETER
	He needs some water.

Peter opens the cupboard to get a glass and sees a carton of
milk, some cottage cheese, other products that should be in
the refrigerator. Lloyd is not facing the cupboard and is in
his coughing fit anyway, so he doesn't see this.

Peter turns to look at the refrigerator and then looks at
Jennifer and Frida. He makes eye-contact with Frida and sees
she's afraid. He lets her off the hook and just takes a glass
out of the cupboard and closes it as though nothing's wrong.

He fills the glass with water from the sink and hands it to
Lloyd. Lloyd drinks up and stops his coughing fit.

			PETER
	We're considering Mark Wilson a
	suspect.

Frida gulps.

			LLOYD
	He's got a record. Drug charges.
	Avoided jail on pleas. Plus a
	woman four years ago had a
	restraining order against him.

Frida is genuinely surprised by all this.

			JENNIFER
	See he was cheating from the get
	go.

			PETER
	He's been running money for the
	Mafia.

			FRIDA
	No he's not. He's a courier. He
	picks up packages from the airport.

			LLOYD
	Packages of money.

			PETER
	Seems he's stolen money from them.
	He's desperate and our only lead.

			LLOYD
	One of our only leads... You had
	dates with both men right before
	they were killed.

			FRIDA
	Am I a suspect?

Lloyd looks at Peter.

			PETER
	No, no... But Mark -- a jealous
	boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills
	men you date.

			FRIDA
	Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.

			JENNIFER
	Frida, you have to admit, he is a
	bit cold at times. And last time
	you saw him, he was quite torn
	apart.

Jennifer is tempted to laugh. Frida is more serious.

			FRIDA
	But you said the bodies were ripped
	to pieces?

			PETER
	Still haven't figured out how he or
	anyone else pulled that off. Never
	seen anything like it.

Frida sees some water leaking from her cupboard. She's
increasingly nervous.

			LLOYD
	Do you know Spencer Hale? East
	Village musician?

Frida shakes her head no. She looks confused.

			FRIDA
	No, why?

			PETER
	He was ripped to shreds also. In
	his apartment.

			JENNIFER
	Mark's an East Village musician.
	He probably knows Spencer.

			LLOYD
	Interesting. We'll have to check
	that out.

Peter and Lloyd head for the door.

			PETER
	This is probably the strangest case
	we've ever seen.

Frida lets them out. She and Peter exchange a glance. Frida
closes the door. She and Jennifer stare at each other.

			FRIDA
		(whispering)
	Peter knows something.

			JENNIFER
	Well if he does, he didn't give you
	away. He must really like you.


INT. PETER'S CAR - DAY

Peter and Lloyd driving.

			PETER
	Spencer's the key here. Frida is
	in no way associated with him. And
	her blood hasn't matched with any
	of the killings.

			LLOYD
	It's a bit farfetched that Mark
	would rip guys to shreds just outta
	jealousy. This makes no sense.

			PETER
	It's like some fucking monster
	dropped out of the sky and killed
	these dudes.

			LLOYD
	Like a vampire or some shit?

Lloyd looks skeptically at Peter.


EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Frida and Jennifer haul Mark's body into the trunk of his car.

			FRIDA
	Jesus Christ what are we gonna do?
	We can't bury him around here.

Both women pace.

			JENNIFER
	Okay, we put him in his car trunk.
	We drive it to a &quot;No Parking&quot; area
	where we know it'll be towed. The
	tow truck will come and take it to
	a huge lot. No one's gonna claim
	it. It'll sit there for a long
	time. By the time anyone discovers
	a body in it, it'll be all
	decomposed and we'll have thought
	of better alibis by then.


INT./EXT. MARK'S CAR - DAY

Frida is driving Mark's car -- she wears gloves. Jennifer,
also wearing gloves, sits in the passenger seat. Both also
wear dark sunglasses.


EXT. &quot;NO PARKING&quot; AREA - DAY

Frida and Jennifer leave the car in the &quot;No Parking&quot; area.
They cross the street and head up the street.

			FRIDA
	I think I just got my period.

			JENNIFER
	Does that mean this whole thing is
	over?

			FRIDA
	Probably for three weeks or so
	anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't
	get how it works.

			JENNIFER
	Let's do some research. I'll check
	the libraries. You surf the web.

			FRIDA
	You're such a good friend.

			JENNIFER
	So are you. Look, go about your
	life. Act like nothing's wrong.
	We'll get to the bottom of this.

Jennifer gives Frida a hug and heads off the other way.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

Frida is totally buried in scripts at work now. The phone
keeps ringing, but she lets it go to voicemail. She's reading
a werewolf book.

Mr. Grant walks by.

			FRIDA
	Mr. Grant. Did you read that
	script I was talking about?

			MR. GRANT
	Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman
	in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn
	Medicine Woman. Find me a true
	story about a crazed killer
	stalking beautiful women.

			FRIDA
	No.

			MR. GRANT
	No?

			FRIDA
	No. I quit. Take your lame ass
	ideas, your fake ass toupee, your
	fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids
	and shove them.

			MR. GRANT
	Very well then. Is that all?

He continues walking as though nothing's happened. Frida
starts packing up her things.


EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Frida comes out of the building carrying a box full of
personal items from her desk. She runs into Peter.

			PETER
	Frida. I was looking for you. You
	changing jobs?

			FRIDA
	Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?

			PETER
	I need to talk to you. About us.
	Frida... I... Can I carry your box?

			FRIDA
	No, I got it. It's okay.

			PETER
	What happened?

Frida gulps. She's nervous.

			FRIDA
	What happened?

			PETER
	I thought we were starting
	something... and then... I know
	it's unorthodox, I mean with you
	being involved in the case and all.

			FRIDA
	I just don't know if I should be
	dating anyone right now.

			PETER
	Yeah, every guy you date winds up
	dead.

Frida stops walking.

			PETER
	Except Mark of course.

			FRIDA
	What's that supposed to mean?

			PETER
	Did I tell you I have the worst
	sense of humor and I make bad jokes
	at totally inappropriate times?

			FRIDA
	No, but thanks for the warning.

			PETER
	Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to
	track him down and there's no sight
	of him. Vanished into thin air. I
	got a hunch he fled the country.

			FRIDA
	Interesting possibility.

They're near the subway entrance.

			PETER
	Lemme give you a ride. You can't
	take the subway with that box.


INT. PETER'S CAR - DAY

Peter's driving; Frida's in the passenger seat. We don't hear
the dialog but just see them laughing and having a good time.
Making eye contact from time to time.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frida is surfing the web. Jennifer looks over her shoulder.
She finds a page with PMS symptoms.

			JENNIFER
		(reading from screen)
	Symptoms include loss of emotional
	control, compulsive behavior,
	cravings, crying spells...

			FRIDA
	Peter keeps asking me out.

			JENNIFER
	Maybe you should go out with him.
	If you keep avoiding him he'll get
	suspicious. Besides, what better
	way to not get busted than to date
	the cop who's investigating you.

			FRIDA
	The thing is, I really like him. I
	finally meet a guy I really like
	and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.

			JENNIFER
	We don't know you're a werewolf.
	It might never happen again. You
	have to get on with your life.


EXT. ZOO - DAY

Frida and Peter walking through the zoo. Animals start
reacting strangely to Frida.

They look at the wolf cages. The wolves stare at Frida. She
runs off. Peter chases after her.


EXT. ZOO - DAY

Frida runs out of the zoo with Peter behind her.

			PETER
	Frida, wait. I thought you were an
	animal person.

Peter catches up to her.

			FRIDA
	I don't know what came over me.

They walk for a bit.

			FRIDA
	I need to tell you something. It's
	about... PMS. I get it real bad.

Peter laughs.

			PETER
	That's it? Hell my mom chased my
	dad around with a knife when she
	had it. She made us call her a
	different name. She'd say, &quot;You're
	talking to Betty now&quot; and we'd
	leave the house for a few days.

			FRIDA
	This is a lot worse than &quot;Betty.&quot;

			PETER
	You can't mean that. I'm sure your
	bark is worse than your bite.

			FRIDA
	No, my bite's a lot worse.

Peter stops walking. Frida stops as well. Peter caresses the
side of Frida's face.

			PETER
	Whatever it is, we can work it out.
	Frida, I love you.

Frida's eyes well up. She doesn't know whether to laugh or
cry. She ends up laughing.

			PETER
	Is it that funny?

			FRIDA
	No, it's just... no one's ever said
	that. And I thought if someone did
	ever say it, I'd have to say it
	first and then they'd sort of say
	&quot;I love you too&quot; cause they felt
	they had to after I'd said it.

			PETER
	Is that how you feel?

			FRIDA
	Like I had to say it? No, I wanted
	to say it.

			PETER
	You didn't say it.

			FRIDA
	I love you too.

They kiss.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Frida is opening a bottle of champagne while Peter looks in
the cupboards for glasses. He finds some squirt guns.

			PETER
	What's with the squirt guns?

			FRIDA
	They're for my cat. I use them to
	train him not to rip up paper.

			PETER
	You know, I've never seen your cat.

			FRIDA
	I loaned him to Jennifer. George
	moved out and she was lonely...

Peter takes a squirt gun and squirts Frida. Frida screams
playfully. She grabs another squirt gun and fills it.

MONTAGE of squirt gun fight. Played just like a &quot;real&quot; police
gunfight -- with them creeping through the apartment and
ducking behind furniture, trying to get a direct hit on each
other. And having a great time.

Peter's beeper goes off. He checks it. As he does, Frida
squirts him in the face. She cracks up.

			FRIDA
	Whatever you do, don't tell me you
	have to leave.

Peter heads for the door.

			PETER
	Okay. I won't tell you.

She walks him to the door. They kiss. Peter opens the door.
From the hallway, we see his POV of Frida as he closes the
door and she looks sadly at him.

MATCH CUT the closing of the door with the opening of the
trunk in the next scene.


EXT. CAR LOT - DAY

From inside the trunk, the door opens and we see Peter and
Lloyd looking down into it. They hold their noses from a bad
smell.

			LLOYD
	You think mafia hit?

			PETER
	Hard to tell. Looks like he's been
	cleaned up and he's decomposing as
	we speak. This case gets weirder
	by the minute.

			LLOYD
	It has to be Frida. This makes
	three guys ripped apart who are
	tied to her ass.

			PETER
	Okay Lloyd. First, no way does
	Frida have the physical strength to
	tear a guy to shreds. Second, why
	would she be so obvious and let it
	be known she was the last one to
	see these guys? Third, she's the
	one in danger. She's a woman in
	jeopardy and you're layin' a murder
	rap on her. Fourth, I look in her
	eyes and know she's no killer.

			LLOYD
	And fifth, you're dating her.

Peter looks shocked.

			PETER
	What are you talking about?

			LLOYD
	I know. I followed you. To the
	zoo, to her house, to your house...

			PETER
	What the fuck are you following me
	for? I'm not a suspect here.

			LLOYD
	Which brings up an interesting
	point. I wasn't following you. I
	was following the suspect. And you
	just happened to be there...


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jennifer is going through a stack of books on the sofa.
Frida's reading a magazine article on PMS. The apartment is
filled with werewolf research -- movies, books, articles.

			FRIDA
		(reading aloud)
	&quot;Paranoia, insecurity, depression,
	changes in vision, feelings of
	losing control; belief that you
	have a mental problem...&quot; Nothing
	about turning into a werewolf.

			JENNIFER
	Check out what I found.

Jennifer gets a very old-looking book out of her bag.

			JENNIFER
	I found it in this out-of-the-way
	used bookstore.

Jennifer opens it up to a page she marked and reads aloud.

			JENNIFER
	This is from a scientist in France,
	Madame Sconce. &quot;The original
	werewolves were females. They
	became werewolves on the lunar
	cycle because it corresponded to
	the woman's cycle. My suspicion is
	that the only cure is true love.&quot;

			FRIDA
	Great so all I have to do is fall
	in love? Like I haven't tried that
	for the past 24 years.

			JENNIFER
		(continuing to read)
	&quot;The female-cycle werewolf will
	only kill men and never kills
	someone she truly loves.&quot; See I
	knew you never loved Mark.

			FRIDA
	Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's
	find her and talk to her.

			JENNIFER
	She died at age 34 in the 1800's.
	They thought she was crazy. She
	was banished from her town. Seems
	her husband shot her.

			FRIDA
	Guess she never found true love.

			JENNIFER
	The weird thing is... he shot her
	with a silver bullet.

			FRIDA
	So... she was a werewolf. Do you
	think we can believe all this?

			JENNIFER
	What choice do we have?

			FRIDA
	So what do I do?

			JENNIFER
	Fall in love.

			FRIDA
	I think I already have.


EXT. SKY - NIGHT

A nearly full moon. A dark cloud passes over it.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - DAY

Dolly through the apartment. We hear the sounds of Frida and
Peter making love. Move in on the bedroom as they're
finishing. Peter gets behind Frida to cuddle. He cups his
hands around her breasts.

			PETER
	Your breasts feel larger.

			FRIDA
	They do? Oh no...

			PETER
	No, it's a good thing. I like it.
	Everything about you is great. I
	like how you don't shave your legs.
	Women are so much sexier when
	they're natural.

Frida sits up.

			FRIDA
	I did shave... Do I seem hairy?
	Peter laughs.

			PETER
	No. But I don't mind hairy. Are
	you okay?

Frida nearly flies out of bed, grabbing whatever she can find
to cover herself up.

			FRIDA
	I... I should just get up. I have
	lots to do today...

Peter stares at her strangely as she darts out of the room.


INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

Peter is peeing.


INT. FRIDA'S KITCHEN - DAY

Frida's furiously cutting her nails which are strangely long.


INT. FRIDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

As Peter pees, he notices something small and white on the
floor. He tries to reach it but can't till he finishes
peeing. Finally he's done. He bends down and picks up the
object, which is a large front tooth. Peter has a quick flash
of Mark's dead face in the car trunk. Missing a tooth.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - DAY

Frida notices her long nails and thinks she sees tufts of hair
on her hands. She hears Peter coming and quickly slips on
some rubber gloves to hide her hands.

ECU of Peter sticking the tooth in his pants pocket. He
enters the kitchen. Something's weighing heavily on his mind.

			PETER
	I gotta get downtown.

He goes to her to kiss her, but Frida, self-conscious about
possible facial hair, bows her head and he ends up kissing the
top of it. She recoils and he looks at her, concerned. She
won't let him get a good look at her face.

			FRIDA
	I have... a lot of... cleaning to
	do today.

She turns around. Peter shrugs. He knows something's wrong.
He heads for the door.

			PETER
	I'll call you later.

Frida nods. Peter leaves. Once he does, Frida rushes to the
calendar on the wall and into an ECU of her eye (at edge of
frame). ECU calendar -- panning past Monday, Tuesday, etc.
until we see in red ink &quot;the curse.&quot;

DOLLY IN/ZOOM OUT of Frida's face, reacting.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Peter takes the tooth out of his pocket and examines it. He
looks around, sees no one and throws it down a sewer grating.


INT. CHURCH/CONFESSIONAL - DAY

Frida in one side of the confessional; a PRIEST in the other.

			FRIDA
	I was just wondering... a person
	has a choice between killing
	themselves or killing others, which
	is worse? I mean you fry in hell
	either way, right?

			PRIEST
	If you kill yourself, you won't be
	around to ask for forgiveness or to
	make a last confession, whereas if
	you kill others, you can go to
	confession, do penance, and be
	absolved from your sins.

			FRIDA
	But if the person is killing
	several people, then maybe it's
	better to kill oneself cause then
	the killing stops.

			PRIEST
	You have a point. Hmmm... I've
	never been asked this before...
	Who is being killed? Catholics?
	Homosexuals? Protestants?


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frida runs into the room to grab her Midol. She downs some
and runs into the bathroom -- searches the medicine cabinet
for pills. Finds nothing.

She looks at herself in the mirror. She has the strange wolf
eyes, nails and teeth.


INT. PETER'S OFFICE - DAY

Peter is looking at a photo of the crime scene in Spencer's
apartment. He notices Spencer wearing a Los Lobos T-shirt.
Peter's troubled by it.


INT. FRIDA'S KITCHEN - DAY

Frida finds a large knife and practices stabbing herself. She
tries to slit her wrists but can't. She screams.

			FRIDA
	Ugh! I can't even kill myself!!

MONTAGE of Frida trying to kill herself.

Frida's on the phone with the yellow pages in her lap.

			FRIDA
	Yes silver bullets. Do you have
	any silver bullets? I only need a
	few. No this is not a joke...

Frida hears a dial tone.


EXT. BUILDING ROOF - DAY

Frida is walking near the edge of a roof, looking like she's
preparing to jump. CU of her feet as she leaps out of frame.

					  CUT TO:

INT. FRIDA'S KITCHEN - DAY

Frida's feet land in frame as though she had jumped here from
the rooftop shot. She lands in a squat and is picking up
spilled chocolate chips from the floor and eating them.

					  CUT TO:

A knock on Frida's door. Frida has her head in the oven. We
just see Frida's back half sticking out of the stove. She
doesn't answer the door. The knocking continues.

			JENNIFER (FROM HALLWAY)
	Frida? You there? Remember, you
	gave me a key for emergencies? I
	consider this an emergency.

Jennifer uses her key and barges in. She looks around and
sees Frida sticking out of the stove.

			JENNIFER
	Oh god Frida, don't do it!

She pulls her out and Frida has rubber gloves on and is
holding a SOS pad.

			FRIDA
	I'm cleaning my stove.

			JENNIFER
	You scared the shit out of me. I
	thought you were killing yourself.

			FRIDA
	I tried to kill myself -- earlier.
	It doesn't work. I think I need
	silver bullets. So I got depressed
	and when I'm depressed I clean.

			JENNIFER
	You'll get through this. You were
	fine for over three weeks.

			FRIDA
	I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I
	think I love him.

			JENNIFER
	Remember what Madame Sconce said.
	If you love him he'll be fine.

			FRIDA
	But how do I know if I really love
	Peter? And if he really loves me?

			JENNIFER
	I guess you'll find out.

			FRIDA
	No. I can't take that chance. I'd
	rather kill myself.

			JENNIFER
	No. I won't let you do that.

			FRIDA
	The werewolf always dies at the
	end. Didn't you see &quot;American
	Werewolf in London?&quot;


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jennifer and Frida are nailing boards onto the windows to
barricade Frida inside. They have put out tons of raw steak
and chocolate bars on large plates near the sofa.

			JENNIFER
	I think George knows.

			FRIDA
	About Mark? Carlton?

			JENNIFER
	About Benito.

			FRIDA
	Did I kill a guy named Benito?

			JENNIFER
	No, he's the guy I'm having an
	affair with.

They're done barricading the window. Jennifer picks up some
more wood and nails.

			FRIDA
	I thought you and George were
	getting married.

			JENNIFER
	We were -- I was just so tempted...
	It was sort of a test. I think
	after sleeping with Benito I know I
	want to be with George. But now
	George knows about Benito and he
	doesn't want to be with me!

			FRIDA
	I wish I only had your problems.

			JENNIFER
	Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about
	myself at a time like this. Are
	you sure you're going to be okay?

			FRIDA
	Yes, just check on me once a day
	for the next three days. Then the
	PMS should be over.

Jennifer hands Frida the wood and nails.

			JENNIFER
	Okay, just nail shut this door
	behind me. I'll call you later.

Frida looks worried.

			FRIDA
	I don't deserve a friend like you.

Jennifer leans in and kisses Frida on the cheek.

			JENNIFER
	Yes you do.

Jennifer smiles and leaves. After she closes the door, Frida
immediately starts nailing boards across the door to shut
herself in.


INT. PETER'S OFFICE - DAY

Peter dials the phone.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frida is resting on the sofa. The door is boarded shut. The
phone rings and Frida picks it up.

			FRIDA
	Hello?

			PETER (ON PHONE)
	Frida? You okay? Look, I think I
	know what happened to Mark. I want
	to help. I'm coming over.

			FRIDA
	NO! Don't come over. Peter...
	I... I don't want to see you
	anymore. Ever.

			PETER (ON PHONE)
	What? Is there someone else?

Frida hesitates for a moment.


INT. PETER'S OFFICE - DAY

Peter looks really depressed on the phone.

			FRIDA (ON PHONE)
	Yes, sort of. I mean no, not
	really.

			PETER
	Yes or no? Frida, can't you just
	be honest with me?


BACK TO FRIDA'S APARTMENT

Long pause as they each try to think of something to say.

			PETER (ON PHONE)
	You at least owe me the truth.

			FRIDA
	You want the truth? Remember I
	tried to tell you something the
	other day?

			PETER (ON PHONE)
	Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal
	with that.

			FRIDA
	No you can't. It... it gets so bad
	that I become a werewolf.

BACK TO PETER'S OFFICE

Peter shakes his head.

			PETER
	If you don't like me, just say so.
	You don't have to make up some
	bullshit like you're a werewolf.

			FRIDA (ON PHONE)
	I knew you wouldn't believe me!
	Just go away. Go very far away!

Peter hears a hang up. He puts the phone down and stares at
it sadly for a moment.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT - EVENING (DUSK)

Frida is crying. She takes the phone off the hook.


INT. PETER'S OFFICE - EVENING (DUSK)

Lloyd walks by Peter's door. Peter calls out to him.

			PETER
	Hey Lloyd.

Lloyd stops and comes in the office.

			LLOYD
	My girlfriend's predicting another
	murder in the next few days.

			PETER
	What makes her think that?

			LLOYD
	She says she's on the rag every
	time I get called in to investigate
	a murder.

Something clicks with Peter. He flips through a calendar.

			PETER
	So... they're on some cycle. The
	murders... Gregory... then 28 days
	later... Carlton.

			LLOYD
	And that was 28 days ago today.

			PETER
	Did we get those DNA tests back?

			LLOYD
	Just this morning. Animal hairs
	were found all over the victims.

			PETER
	What kind of animal?

			LLOYD
	Can't figure out the species.
	Similar to a wolf. They're jokin'
	at the lab that a werewolf probably
	killed him. Ain't that the
	stupidest thing you ever heard?


EXT. STREET - DUSK

Peter walks through the streets, quickly, on a mission. He
takes a handful of silver bullets out of his pocket and looks
at them. He's wearing a red, hooded sweatshirt.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT/HALLWAY - DUSK*/

Peter sees Frida's door open and broken wood and nails on the
floor. He walks into Frida's apartment.

The apartment is quiet, no sign of Frida. The plates that had
steak and chocolate on them are all empty now. Peter walks
around looking for her. He takes his gun out and peers around
the corner, expecting to find something. He hears something
and spins around facing the front door, pointing the gun.

It's Frida. She stands at the front door with a side of beef
so big she can barely carry it. She gnaws at it. Her eyes
are glowing orange. She sees Peter and looks embarrassed.

			FRIDA
	Go away. I might hurt you.

			PETER
	I'm not afraid. Frida! I love
	you.

			FRIDA
	Peter I love you too but...

			PETER
	I don't think you'll hurt me.

Frida, still gnawing at the beef, circles him slowly. He's
scared but he lowers the gun.

			FRIDA
	How do you know?

			PETER
	I don't think you would. No matter
	what form you take.

			FRIDA
	I can't take that chance... I
	couldn't live with myself if I did
	anything to you.

			PETER
	I have the silver bullets in case I
	need to protect myself. Does that
	make you feel better?

There is a long pause.

			FRIDA
	A little.

Peter sets the gun on the table. He takes a few steps closer.
Frida backs up.

			FRIDA
	Be careful!

			PETER
	Can't you bite me and then I'll be
	like you?

			FRIDA
	No. It doesn't work that way. Men
	can't get PMS. Unfortunately.

			PETER
	I'm staying here with you tonight.
	There's no getting rid of me.

He steps closer again and now Frida's backed up against the
wall. He can see her eyes look strangely wolf-like. He's
afraid but inches closer. Frida tries to inch away. It's
almost like a dance. Finally they find their way to each
other and embrace -- the side of beef between them.

			FRIDA
	Promise to shoot me if I attack
	you.

Peter closes his eyes and nods. Frida sniffs the side of beef
hungrily.

			FRIDA
	Can you order up some chocolate?

Peter smiles.


EXT. SKY - NIGHT

A full moon.


INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Peter is sitting up in bed reading Madame Sconce's werewolf
book. Frida is beside him asleep. Peter looks at her and
strokes her hair.


EXT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Same dolly in we've seen a few times.

INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Frida's asleep in bed. Dolly the same as when she woke up
with the severed arm. Frida wakes up. She's afraid to look
behind her for fear she's killed Peter. All she sees is an
empty pillow. She looks under the sheets. Nothing -- just
pure white, no blood. Frida smiles and sighs in relief.

From the next room, Frida hears whistling. Peter walks in
carrying a &quot;breakfast in bed&quot; tray. On the tray is a huge
rare steak and a red rose. Frida sits up.

Peter brings the tray to her and places it on her lap. He
sits at the foot of the bed.

			PETER
	I knew you wouldn't kill me.

			FRIDA
	Maybe we should have children. I
	don't think I'd kill the father of
	my child.

			PETER
	We can work this out. Other
	couples have worse problems.

			FRIDA
	Worse than this?

			PETER
	Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a
	little werewolf a few days a month?
	We can move out to the country
	where you can feed off deer.

			FRIDA
	What about... those guys... I might
	have...

			PETER
	No way can anything be proved. All
	they have are some wolf hairs. No
	one believes in werewolves.

			FRIDA
	I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't
	help it. You know I didn't mean
	to... to do any of that.

			PETER
	I know. The important thing is
	that it stop.

Frida nods as she digs into her steak.


INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Jennifer is eating a chocolate bar. She looks sad and her face
is pale and makeup-less. She's headed for her door and opens
it to reveal George. He smiles sheepishly at her. She beams.

			JENNIFER
	Truce?

George pulls out a can of Readi-Whip from his bag.

			GEORGE
	Truce.

George sneezes.


INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Frida's still eating. Peter gets up and kisses her on the
cheek.

			PETER
	I'm going to take a shower.

			FRIDA
	Okay.

He starts to walk out. Frida continues with her steak.

			FRIDA
	Peter?

Peter stops at the door and turns around.

			FRIDA
	Thanks. For everything.

Peter smiles and continues out of the room.


INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Jennifer's dialing on her cordless phone. George is in the
background covering his crotch with the whipped cream.


INT. FRIDA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Frida's still in bed chowing down. We hear the shower running
in the background. The phone rings; Frida picks it up.

			FRIDA
	Hello?

			JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
	Frida? You okay?

			FRIDA
	Never been better. Peter spent the
	night. I must really love him.
	He's still alive.

			JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
	Oh thank god. Maybe this whole
	thing is really over.

			FRIDA
	God I hope so. Hey can I call you
	later? Peter's still here. He's
	in the shower.

			JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
	Sure. See ya.


INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Jennifer hangs up. Then suddenly something occurs to her.

			JENNIFER
	In the shower?

She looks worried.


INT. FRIDA'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - MORNING	146

CU of the gun with silver bullets still on the table where
Peter left it the night before. We hear Peter in the shower
humming the tune from &quot;Peter and the Wolf.&quot; The camera
dollies from the gun into the bathroom. It continues to dolly
in as before when Mark was in the shower. Danger seems
imminent... Peter hears Frida calling.

			FRIDA
	Peter? Peter?

Dolly in close on his face. Behind him, through the shower
curtain, we see the blurry figure of Frida. Peter's a bit
worried for a moment too. He pulls back the curtain so he can
see her. She's standing there holding a towel.

			FRIDA
	Here's a towel.

			PETER
	Thanks.

The tension is broken. Peter's completely relieved. Frida
hangs the towel on the towel rack and leaves. Peter goes back
to soaping himself up.

			PETER
	Hey Frida?

Frida comes back into the bathroom.

			PETER
	Wanna join me?

Frida beams. She tosses off her robe and gets in the shower.
Frida and Peter kiss and suds each other up.

			PETER
	Want me to do your back?

Frida turns around. Peter starts scrubbing her back. Frida
appears to be enjoying it -- though we can't see her face
because she has her head down.

			PETER
	Doesn't this feel great?

Frida nodes her head. She lifts it and we see her face. Her
eyes are glowing. She smiles and we see fangs. Freeze frame
on CU of her eyes.
