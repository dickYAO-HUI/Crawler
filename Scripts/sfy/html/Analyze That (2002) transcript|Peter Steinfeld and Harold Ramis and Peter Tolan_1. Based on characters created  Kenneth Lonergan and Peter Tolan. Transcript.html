            <hr>How did he know about the money?<br>
And how did he know<br>
that Tony Cisco got popped?<br>
We didn't find out about it<br>
till this morning.<br>
- I don't know.<br>
- It was Peezee. Gotta be.<br>
He hates your fucking guts.<br>
- I don't know.<br>
- What is so hard to understand here?<br>
You said Peezee was a mamaluke<br>
and couldn't be trusted.<br>
Now all of a sudden<br>
you got a soft spot for this guy.<br>
- I just don't think it was him.<br>
- Okay, I'll buy it.<br>
If not Peezee, then who?<br>
Who? Tell me.<br>
I think it was you, Ducks.<br>
You gotta be kidding.<br>
Caesar? Caesar, you know me.<br>
What kind of fucking idiot would<br>
I have to be to try that with you?<br>
- A dead fucking idiot.<br>
- Come on, Caesar.<br>
Caesar.<br>
Caesar!<br>
- This is garbage. Change the channel.<br>
- Okay, Paul.<br>
No. Hey!<br>
What are you doing, asshole?<br>
Sorry, Mr. Vitti.<br>
Didn't mean any disrespect.<br>
Oh, man.<br>
- Forget about it.<br>
- Punks.<br>
Let them watch what they want.<br>
I'm going to bed.<br>
- Good night, Paul.<br>
- Good night.<br>
- All right, what do youse wanna watch?<br>
- Little Caesar!<br>
All right, all right.<br>
Step out.<br>
- Hey, Earl, what's up?<br>
- They're transferring me.<br>
- Did you ask to be transferred?<br>
- Not me.<br>
- What's up?<br>
- I don't know.<br>
Anyway, thanks<br>
for looking out for me, Paul.<br>
- I'll see you around.<br>
- Sure.<br>
Isaac Sobel was a man of rigorous belief<br>
and unflinching honesty.<br>
A patriarch with an almost biblical sense<br>
of integrity and conviction.<br>
A man of faith and courage,<br>
of spirit and humor.<br>
A rock and a tree.<br>
A good friend who will be deeply missed.<br>
I'd like to call on Isaac's son, Dr. Ben Sobel,<br>
who would like to say a few words.<br>
It's not easy for me<br>
to talk about my father...<br>
...because, in a sense,<br>
I'm talking about two people.<br>
One is the public Isaac Sobel...<br>
...the eminent psychotherapist...<br>
...and popular author known to millions<br>
of readers across the world.<br>
The second is the private man.<br>
My father.<br>
Dad.<br>
And for those of you<br>
who knew him well...<br>
...and know our family,<br>
well, I don't have to tell you.<br>
He was a psychotic, mind-fucking prick.<br>
An arrogant, ego-inflated son of a bitch.<br>
I wish you were alive<br>
so I could kill you. Rot in hell!<br>
Now I'd like to call on Isaac's son,<br>
Dr. Ben Sobel...<br>
...who would like to say a few words.<br>
Who the hell would have<br>
a cell phone in here?<br>
It's yours.<br>
Answer it before they notice.<br>
- Hello?<br>
- Guess who, you fuck?<br>
- I have to take this.<br>
- What?<br>
I'm sorry. It's mine.<br>
I have to take this.<br>
- Yes?<br>
- I left three fucking messages.<br>
- You don't call me back?<br>
- This is not a good time.<br>
Not a good time? Let me explain something,<br>
I'm in fucking hell right now.<br>
- This is not a good time.<br>
- This is a very bad time. My father died.<br>
Get off.<br>
- I have to go.<br>
- Don't you hang up on me, you...<br>
- Call back.<br>
- They're trying to kill me.<br>
Hey, Fredo. Yeah, you, Guido.<br>
Come over here.<br>
I've got something to show you.<br>
You're a dead man.<br>
- Thanks, Lorenzo.<br>
- Thank you.<br>
I can't believe he's gone.<br>
I can't believe what you said.<br>
"Cold and withholding"?<br>
- You had to tell everybody?<br>
- Why didn't you take a swing at the casket?<br>
I might have strayed<br>
from my notes a little bit.<br>
I'm grieving. It's a big loss,<br>
and grief is a process.<br>
Mr. And Mrs. Sobel,<br>
your housekeeper let us in.<br>
I'm Agent Miller,<br>
this is Special Agent Cerrone.<br>
Federal Bureau of Investigation.<br>
- We'd like to ask you a few questions.<br>
- Can I ask what this is about?<br>
We've just come from a funeral.<br>
We know this is a difficult time for you.<br>
It will only take a minute.<br>
Sure, sit down.<br>
- Sorry about your father.<br>
- Thank you very much.<br>
It's very, very difficult.<br>
I'm gonna miss him terribly.<br>
I mean, there were issues, like there are<br>
in any father-and-son relationship.<br>
He wasn't a very warm man.<br>
- Ben.<br>
- Yeah?<br>
Once today. Enough.<br>
Okay. No, I'm just saying<br>
that even so, he was a...<br>
...great, great legs...<br>
Man.<br>
Dr. Sobel, you received a call<br>
this morning from Paul Vitti.<br>
Why would you say<br>
that I got a call from Paul Vitti?<br>
Because we monitor<br>
all his phone calls from Sing Sing.<br>
Then, yes, I did.<br>
- That was him? On the phone?<br>
- Yes.<br>
- Why didn't you tell me?<br>
- Well, talk about withholding.<br>
- Michael.<br>
- You told her at the drop of a hat.<br>
Well, she's in the FBI.<br>
She needs to know this information.<br>
Okay, I see, and I don't.<br>
I don't need to know these things.<br>
No, don't tell Laura.<br>
She can't possibly handle a phone call.<br>
Did I say that? Did I say that?<br>
- You folks need a minute?<br>
- No, we're fine.<br>
Yeah, we're phenomenal.<br>
Listen, I'm gonna go to the kitchen.<br>
Just two words of advice,<br>
as one professional woman to another:<br>
Pants suit.<br>
She's grieving. You know, it's a process.<br>
Vitti?<br>
We were involved in some<br>
organized-crime activity a few years ago.<br>
I mean, I wasn't, you know, "involved."<br>
He was involved.<br>
But I was treating him<br>
therapeutically at the time...<br>
...and then some people tried to kill us.<br>
It was really nothing.<br>
Shortly after you two spoke,<br>
he seemed to have some kind of breakdown.<br>
Really? What kind of breakdown?<br>
I think you had better go up there<br>
and see for yourself.<br>
I'm treating him with Thorazine.<br>
Seems to keep him pretty calm.<br>
That would keep<br>
the Middle East pretty calm.<br>
And he just keeps singing<br>
West Side Story songs?<br>
"Tonight." "Maria." The balcony scene.<br>
You should get him to do "Officer Krupke."<br>
It's really good.<br>
- Paul?<br>
- Maria?<br>
Paul, it's me. Dr. Sobel.<br>
Maria?<br>
Tony?<br>
Maria! Oh, Maria!<br>
- Oh, my God! Thank God you've come!<br>
- Yes.<br>
- You've got to get me out of here!<br>
- Okay.<br>
- Do you promise?<br>
- I promise.<br>
- Te adoro.<br>
- Te adoro.<br>
This is how it's been.<br>
He sings for a while,<br>
then he goes completely catatonic.<br>
And you did a neurological workup?<br>
Yeah. No tumors, no seizures,<br>
no sign of stroke.<br>
Paul?<br>
If you're faking, Paul, I'm gonna know.<br>
When I was a resident,<br>
we used to play with the catatonics.<br>
Well, I don't think he's faking.<br>
I don't think he's smart enough.<br>
Street smart, yeah...<br>
...but we're talking about an IQ<br>
just north of a bedroom slipper.<br>
So if he is truly...<br>
...catatonic, if I stuck him<br>
with this needle...<br>
- This is just plain saline, isn't it?<br>
- Yeah.<br>
Yeah. Then he shouldn't<br>
feel a thing. Right?<br>
That's gotta hurt.<br>
No reaction at all.<br>
I want to do some<br>
neuropsychological testing, okay?<br>
Sure.<br>
Paul, I'm gonna give you some tests<br>
to assess your mental condition, okay?<br>
Now, do I have your consent<br>
to share the results of the tests?<br>
Mommy is mad at me<br>
because I made a boom on the rug.<br>
- I'm gonna take that as a yes.<br>
- Good.<br>
Okay.<br>
Paul, I have 10 cards, each with<br>
a picture of an inkblot on it, okay?<br>
Here's the first card.<br>
Now look at it,<br>
and tell me what you see.<br>
I see a bat.<br>
A bat or a weasel.<br>
- A bat or a weasel?<br>
- Yeah.<br>
Bat. Bat-weasel.<br>
Do you see anything else?<br>
Just a pussy with teeth.<br>
- Pussy with teeth.<br>
- Yeah.<br>
Next card.<br>
Excellent, Paul.<br>
One hour and 12 minutes.<br>
I want you to take a look at this<br>
picture and tell me what's happening.<br>
I think we got a picture of a guy,<br>
nice, hardworking fella.<br>
Comes home, sees his wife<br>
is in bed with a midget...<br>
...and she's been fucking him<br>
while he's out of town.<br>
So she's having intercourse...?<br>
With a midget.<br>
Very good.<br>
It doesn't matter<br>
who they know downtown.<br>
Tell them they got no leverage.<br>
- Mr. Chapin?<br>
- Come in. Come in. All right.<br>
- Hi, I'm Dr. Ben Sobel.<br>
- Hi. Thanks for coming in. I appreciate it.<br>
- My pleasure.<br>
- So, what have we got?<br>
Okay...<br>
Based on his symptoms and his test results,<br>
I would call it brief psychotic disorder...<br>
...and if it persists,<br>
schizophreniform disorder.<br>
And Dr. Kassam, the psychiatrist<br>
at Sing Sing, concurs with the diagnosis.<br>
- So he's crazy.<br>
- Not crazy. No. At least not permanently.<br>
See, in certain people, prolonged exposure<br>
to extremely stressful situations...<br>
...like soldiers in combat, for instance,<br>
or disaster victims or hostages...<br>
...can produce a temporary<br>
psychotic state.<br>
- How temporary?<br>
- A day, a week, a month...<br>
...if the precipitating stresses are removed.<br>
Which means he's not gonna get better<br>
as long as he's in the can.<br>
He could conceivably get worse.<br>
Right now he thinks<br>
somebody is trying to kill him.<br>
And he could deteriorate to the point<br>
where he's permanently schizophrenic.<br>
Then he's got a real problem. He goes<br>
before the parole board in four weeks.<br>
Would they actually release him?<br>
Oh, yeah. I'm sure they'll want<br>
to release a major Mafia figure...<br>
...who's now certifiably deranged<br>
on top of it.<br>
Why don't they release him<br>
to a halfway house...<br>
...or a center where he can get<br>
the care he needs?<br>
Based on my earlier work with him,<br>
I don't think he's dangerous...<br>
...and I think he's making<br>
a strong effort to reform himself.<br>
Okay...<br>
...I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.<br>
I'm gonna release him<br>
into your custody.<br>
Mine? Oh, no.<br>
No, I couldn't... No. No. No.<br>
Mr. Chapin, thank you, anyway,<br>
but this is a very bad time for me.<br>
- See, my father just died.<br>
- I'm sorry.<br>
And I'm grieving. It's a process.<br>
And I have a bulging disk in my neck.<br>
And I have this burning sensation<br>
when I urinate...<br>
- Yeah, I've had that too.<br>
- We're redecorating, which is a nightmare.<br>
- You wanna see him killed in prison?<br>
- No.<br>
Or sent to a facility<br>
for the criminally insane?<br>
- Of course not.<br>
- Then he's all yours.<br>
I told my son we couldn't have a dog.<br>
I'm gonna bring home Paul Vitti?<br>
I'm gonna talk<br>
to the Bureau of Prisons...<br>
...and get you certified<br>
as a temporary federal institution.<br>
I can't be an institution.<br>
I work in the suburbs.<br>
I handle neurotic soccer moms<br>
and alcoholic Gentiles...<br>
You have got 30 days to get him<br>
into shape for his parole hearing.<br>
That means sane, sober<br>
and gainfully employed.<br>
Now I'm warning you, doctor.<br>
If he screws up in any way, if he flees...<br>
...or if I find out this was a setup<br>
to get him on the street...<br>
...I will hold you totally responsible.<br>
And you will pay dearly.<br>
You'll be stripped of your license<br>
and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.<br>
Are we clear?<br>
Yes.<br>
Do you want him or not?<br>
- Yes.<br>
- Good choice. We'll be in touch.<br>
- Tony.<br>
- Hi, how are you?<br>
You okay?<br>
- Doctor, sign here and here, please.<br>
- Okay.<br>
Okay, thank you very much.<br>
You fucking piece of shit! I tell you someone<br>
is trying to kill me and you hang up on me?!<br>
- I knew it. I knew it! You faked!<br>
- You stuck me with a fucking needle!<br>
- You used me to get you out of prison.<br>
- It took you long enough.<br>
I'm singing West Side Story<br>
for three days. I'm half a fag already.<br>
- What were you doing?<br>
- I was in a funeral home!<br>
What's that got to do with somebody<br>
trying to kill me? You're my doctor!<br>
- My father died.<br>
- So?<br>
With you, it's always, "Me, me, me."<br>
He's dead, so get over it. That's life.<br>
Are you hearing this?<br>
Are you hearing you?<br>
- I'm deeply sorry for your loss, okay?<br>
- Yeah, I can see how touched you are.<br>
- All right. Who's after you?<br>
- You tell me.<br>
Could be my old crew, could be<br>
the Rigazzis, Lou the Wrench.<br>
Lou the Wrench? Why "the Wrench"?<br>
The guy's a maniac.<br>
He twisted some guy's head off once.<br>
- Off?<br>
- Off. Totally off.<br>
The feds are putting pressure on everybody.<br>
All the families are fighting each other.<br>
It's like the fall<br>
of the Roman Empire. WWIII.<br>
- What does this have to do with you?<br>
- They knew I was getting out.<br>
The last thing they want to do<br>
is see me get into it.<br>
Just explain to them that you're out of it<br>
now and you're starting a new life.<br>
That's a really imaginative thought.<br>
I wish I could have thought of that.<br>
Maybe they'd throw a party<br>
and give me a gold watch.<br>
What, are you kidding me?<br>
Believe me, nobody's happy<br>
that I'm getting out. Nobody.<br>
- Wanna grab your stuff?<br>
- No. Jelly's gonna pick me up in an hour.<br>
I don't think you understand.<br>
You're in my custody.<br>
You stay here. Therapy every day.<br>
You can't leave without permission.<br>
You gotta be kidding me.<br>
Are you coming in, or do I have<br>
to make a phone call?<br>
Some fucking life this is gonna be.<br>
Get my bags.<br>
Do you really think he's crazy?<br>
Don't you wanna get a second opinion?<br>
If he thinks I think he's crazy,<br>
he's crazier than I think he is.<br>
Locked up, he's of absolutely no use to us.<br>
But back on the street, Vitti has<br>
enough juice to be a threat to both families.<br>
It's like throwing gasoline on a fire.<br>
- That's if he goes back to his old life.<br>
- People like Paul Vitti don't change.<br>
He's been a menace to society<br>
since he was 12 years old.<br>
- Being a criminal is all he knows.<br>
- He's gonna head straight back for trouble.<br>
Then all we have to do is sit back<br>
and pick up the pieces.<br>
We need to stay on Vitti.<br>
How could you?<br>
How could you bring him here?<br>
That mobster in my house,<br>
eating off of my dishes.<br>
It's not like I had a lot of choice.<br>
It's a new law?<br>
You have to bring home a gangster?<br>
He's in my custody.<br>
I am a temporary federal institution.<br>
- Why couldn't he just go home?<br>
- Because his wife and his family are in Ohio.<br>
Sure, yeah, everybody gets<br>
to go to Ohio except me.<br>
- You wanna go to Ohio?<br>
- That's not the... Shut up!<br>
His life was threatened.<br>
He didn't want to endanger his family.<br>
How thoughtful.<br>
But it's okay to endanger our family?<br>
I know this is a terrible imposition,<br>
but it's not like I wanted him here.<br>
Well, you didn't want him,<br>
and I didn't want him, but here he is.<br>
Here he is.<br>
Hey, you.<br>
- Coffee?<br>
- What?<br>
Somebody said something about coffee.<br>
Yeah, that was you.<br>
You said you wanted some.<br>
So, what's the holdup?<br>
Ben, why don't you make<br>
your friend some coffee.<br>
I'm gonna take a long bath.<br>
And hopefully drown.<br>
Excuse her, usually<br>
she is a wonderful hostess...<br>
...but she's grieving. It's a process.<br>
Hey, doc, listen.<br>
I got a friend coming over,<br>
so I don't want you to be surprised.<br>
What kind of friend?<br>
Because if it's the Wrench, or the Pliers...<br>
- No, it's a personal thing, you know?<br>
- Oh, yeah?<br>
They won't be staying late, will they?<br>
- Are you that fucking pussy-whipped?<br>
- I'm not...<br>
- This has nothing to do with Laura.<br>
- I just heard her busting your balls.<br>
We were having a disagreement, yes.<br>
But some conflict is normal<br>
in a marriage.<br>
- Or?<br>
- Or what?<br>
- You're pussy-whipped.<br>
- Paul, I am not...<br>
When the coffee's ready,<br>
I'll be upstairs. Good night, whippy.<br>
Forty minutes.<br>
- How long are you gonna let them go on?<br>
- Let them?<br>
How much longer can they go on?<br>
Another five minutes, I'll break it up<br>
or I'll call the Guinness Book of Records.<br>
Oh, God. Oh, God.<br>
Give me a break. She's faking.<br>
What?<br>
Nobody sounds like that.<br>
Oh, yeah.<br>
Oh, God. Oh, God!<br>
Come on, nobody sounds like that.<br>
- I don't know.<br>
- "I don't know."<br>
Yeah?<br>
- Paul, I have to talk to you.<br>
- What's up?<br>
- I have to talk to you.<br>
- Talk later?<br>
Now.<br>
Hold on.<br>
- Yeah?<br>
- I have a 17-year-old son.<br>
I'll ask her.<br>
That's not what I'm talking about.<br>
I need to speak to you.<br>
Actually, I'm right in the middle<br>
of somebody. Can't you see?<br>
Paul, now.<br>
And, miss, there's no smoking<br>
in my house. Thank you.<br>
Okay, Paul, what do you think<br>
you're doing?<br>
Minding my own business,<br>
like you should be doing.<br>
That's difficult to do with<br>
The VaGina MonoloGues in the guest room.<br>
I been in the can<br>
for two and a half years.<br>
- What am I supposed to do?<br>
- Go to a hotel.<br>
That's what I wanted. You told me I can't.<br>
You said it's either here or Sing Sing.<br>
I'm not trying to punish you,<br>
but I do have some responsibilities.<br>
I thought you might appreciate a nice<br>
home-cooked meal after being in prison.<br>
Yeah, that's what I've been jerking off to<br>
for the last 850 nights in a row.<br>
A fucking home-cooked meal.<br>
Tuna casserole!<br>
- All right, Paul?<br>
- Doc?<br>
- The girl's gotta go.<br>
- The girl? You know, I bet you're jealous.<br>
Yes, I'm very...<br>
And what might I be jealous of?<br>
I didn't hear nothing<br>
out of your room.<br>
We don't think it's necessary to wake<br>
the neighbors every time we have sex.<br>
If you're quiet, you could do it<br>
without even waking your wife.<br>
Paul, that is not funny.<br>
What is that?<br>
I told her if I wasn't back in two minutes<br>
to start without me. I gotta go.<br>
- This is not a good start.<br>
- It was for me till you knocked on my door.<br>
- Here, Aunt Esther.<br>
- Thank you.<br>
And again, I'm so sorry<br>
we had to put you up at a hotel.<br>
We would've loved to have you stay with us,<br>
but we had an unexpected houseguest.<br>
His father always had room for us.<br>
- Don't say that to me.<br>
- Shut up.<br>
You go to hell! I am so out of here!<br>
Go on, get out of here,<br>
you fucking pain in the ass!<br>
You crazy pain in the ass!<br>
Get the fuck out of here!<br>
Go ahead, go back to turning tricks<br>
in Hoboken, you pain in the ass!<br>
How's it going?<br>
Food.<br>
Paul?<br>
- Paul, what are you doing?<br>
- Hey, doc.<br>
I'm just looking for something<br>
to eat over here. This all you got?<br>
Who do you have to fuck<br>
to get some bacon around here?<br>
Not you, I hope.<br>
He's new in town. Let's go in the office,<br>
I'll make you a plate.<br>
- What's in the office?<br>
- We're gonna go to the office and talk first.<br>
Hey, doc, what's up with your family?<br>
They tend to overreact a little.<br>
I know. All you did was flash everybody<br>
in the dining room.<br>
By the look of some of them broads, they<br>
ain't seen the old salsicc' for a long time.<br>
- It's good for them.<br>
- Good for them?<br>
Well, when the paramedics revive<br>
my aunt Golda, I'll be sure to ask her, okay?<br>
Sit down.<br>
So...<br>
Paul, do you mind?<br>
I think we've seen enough<br>
of the old salsicc' for one day. Thank you.<br>
So, what are you gonna do, Paul?<br>
I'm gonna find out<br>
who's trying to kill me. I'm a target.<br>
They could shoot through that window<br>
and blow my fucking head off. Then what?<br>
- So I gotta deal with that.<br>
- That would be a priority, I understand that.<br>
I'm talking about a job, work.<br>
There's gotta be something<br>
that you like to do.<br>
I like hitting guys over the head<br>
with a baseball bat. That's good.<br>
So sporting goods.<br>
- Yeah, exactly.<br>
- That's interesting.<br>
So who are you?<br>
- Who am I?<br>
- I just wanna know how you see yourself.<br>
I'm Paul Vitti. I'm the boss.<br>
The boss of what? The boss of Jelly?<br>
Because you're not the boss of me.<br>
So, what are you the boss of?<br>
I see what you're doing, you.<br>
I see. I get it.<br>
- What am I doing?<br>
- You're pissing me off. That's what.<br>
Look at me. I'm starting to get anxious.<br>
It's very understandable<br>
that you're anxious.<br>
I mean, you spent your whole life<br>
becoming something that you were...<br>
...and now you can't be that anymore,<br>
so it's scary.<br>
I mean, if you're not<br>
Paul Vitti "the boss," who are you?<br>
Let me ask you this way.<br>
When you were a kid,<br>
what did you want to be?<br>
- I was a kid. Who remembers that shit?<br>
- But you had to want to be something.<br>
- Did you want to be a baseball player?<br>
- No.<br>
A fireman? An astronaut.<br>
Come on, what did you wanna be?<br>
- It was stupid.<br>
- It's not stupid.<br>
- What, are you afraid to tell me?<br>
- Yeah, I'm afraid.<br>
So tell me. I'm not here to judge you.<br>
What did you want to be?<br>
There was one time<br>
when I was about...<br>
...maybe 6, 6 and a half, 7.<br>
Right in there. Right in that time.<br>
I thought that I wanted to be a...<br>
I wanted to be a...<br>
For a second...<br>
You know, a little kid.<br>
- What?<br>
- Maybe... I was a kid, you know?<br>
Little kid.<br>
What?<br>
- Tell me.<br>
- I wanted to be a cowboy.<br>
- A cowboy, really?<br>
- Would you believe that?<br>
Well, that's interesting.<br>
How did that start?<br>
I was watching television<br>
with my mother, father.<br>
You know, we watched<br>
those cowboy shows.<br>
And my...<br>
My father got me the whole outfit.<br>
He got me a 10-gallon white hat...<br>
...the boots, the spurs, the cap guns...<br>
...the whole bit.<br>
Then he took me upstate to my uncle's farm<br>
and led me around on this little pony.<br>
And there was cows and all that stuff.<br>
It was like, to me, the Wild West.<br>
And it was all "yippee kai-ay"<br>
and all that stuff. You happy now?<br>
So, what happened?<br>
- I don't know. What happened?<br>
- Why didn't you try to be a cowboy?<br>
I was in East Harlem. I joined a street gang<br>
when I was 12 years old.<br>
"Why didn't I become a cowboy?"<br>
Something else happened when you<br>
were 12 that was very difficult for you.<br>
Yeah.<br>
That's when your father was murdered.<br>
Yeah, I think about it every day.<br>
- What's that got to do with anything?<br>
- It has a lot to do with things.<br>
It's very interesting because your father<br>
was the one who got you the white hat.<br>
He was in the Mob,<br>
but yet he wanted you to be a hero.<br>
Yeah, he did.<br>
Your father wanted you to have<br>
a better life than he did.<br>
He did, yeah.<br>
He wanted me to go to college.<br>
I didn't even go to high school, hardly.<br>
That's because he had died<br>
and he wasn't around to guide you.<br>
See, Paul, before, you said,<br>
"I'm Paul Vitti, the boss"...<br>
...but when I look at you,<br>
I see Paul Vitti the 12-year-old kid...<br>
...who's scared and confused<br>
with a lot of hard choices to make.<br>
You.<br>
- You. You're good, you.<br>
- No, Paul...<br>
- No, you're good. You're better than good.<br>
- It's just the beginning.<br>
You're real good.<br>
You made me realize I'm a little fucking kid.<br>
That's all I wanted. I never could<br>
figure it out with my father. That's great.<br>
- But you have to...<br>
- It's clear now. New choices, new things.<br>
New beginnings. I'm ready.<br>
I'm here, front and center. Let's go.<br>
There's somebody that I work with.<br>
He's a career counselor.<br>
- He places people in jobs. He's excellent.<br>
- I'm ready. Sign me up. I'm ready to go.<br>
- I'm ready to jump in with both feet.<br>
- That's great.<br>
- I'm ready!<br>
- Down!<br>
That was not a good thing.<br>
Hi, doc.<br>
- Jelly, what are you doing here?<br>
- Hey, doc. It's been a while.<br>
- I thought you were in prison.<br>
- It would appear not.<br>
- Well, how did you get out?<br>
- I had a new trial.<br>
It turns out the evidence<br>
in my first trial was, you know, tainted.<br>
I see.<br>
Anyway, two of the witnesses decided<br>
not to testify, and the third guy...<br>
...he committed suicide.<br>
How?<br>
He stabbed himself in the back four times<br>
and threw himself off a bridge.<br>
Very unfortunate.<br>
Good to have you back.<br>
We're in a war, Paul.<br>
It's not safe out there.<br>
The Rigazzis are walking all over us.<br>
We need you, Paul.<br>
You know, Sally, I'm out of it.<br>
- It's over for me. I don't do this no more.<br>
- The family needs you.<br>
What are you talking about?<br>
No one did the big jobs like you.<br>
Air France, they're still talking about it.<br>
Paul, think about it. For me?<br>
- I'll think about it.<br>
- Okay.<br>
Come on, what is this?<br>
A fucking funeral?<br>
You just got out of college, for chrissakes.<br>
Let's have a party.<br>
I'll have one drink,<br>
and then I gotta go see the boss.<br>
- Yeah, what?<br>
- "Yeah, what?"<br>
That's how you answer the door, you?<br>
"Yeah, what?"<br>
You got a problem with that?<br>
- Yeah, what?<br>
- Don't bother getting up on our account.<br>
Paul, what a nice surprise.<br>
- Yeah, Patti, how's it going?<br>
- It's good.<br>
Come here, you. Give me a kiss.<br>
Get over here.<br>
Come on, what did I do?<br>
What did I do that you're mad at me?<br>
Come on.<br>
- How are you, Paul?<br>
- All right.<br>
- You missed a spot.<br>
- You can't be too careful.<br>
Hey, I know. Sorry to hear about Carmine.<br>
- He was a good man.<br>
- Yeah, I know.<br>
You live with someone for 21 years. Then<br>
one day they pull his torso out of the river.<br>
- It's hard.<br>
- Yeah, I'll bet.<br>
Especially since the talk was<br>
that you were the one that put him there.<br>
- That's why I try not to gossip. It's ugly.<br>
- Yeah, it is.<br>
Just a sec. Michelle, Theresa, it's 10:30.<br>
Stop fucking around and get ready for ballet!<br>
It's so hard being a single parent<br>
and a career woman.<br>
For instance, a lot of people<br>
are saying now that you're out...<br>
...that you're gonna try<br>
and take the family from me.<br>
I said, "No, Paul would<br>
never do that to me."<br>
- Never. Not me.<br>
- Good.<br>
So you look good.<br>
What, have you been working out?<br>
Yeah, I been working out who's been<br>
trying to kill me. Got any ideas?<br>
It's a dog-eat-dog world out there.<br>
And you know nobody will be safe<br>
unless we end this thing with the Rigazzis.<br>
- So you had nothing to do with it?<br>
- Paul, calm down, okay?<br>
I did not try and kill you. All right?<br>
Look, I want us to be friends, you know?<br>
Who knows?<br>
Maybe we'll be more than friends.<br>
You wanna lick my beaters?<br>
Patti, let's get serious.<br>
I wanna be left alone, okay?<br>
I'm not doing anything,<br>
I'm just taking care of my own self...<br>
...which is what I should<br>
always be doing, and that's it.<br>
- Sure, I understand, okay?<br>
- You understand?<br>
I do. I understand. Relax.<br>
Sit down, I'll make you a cup of coffee.<br>
No, I gotta go. I got a business thing<br>
with some guy.<br>
If you get something going, we'd expect<br>
some kind of consideration. A little taste.<br>
- No, this is a legitimate thing. It's different.<br>
- You gave me a chill.<br>
Yeah, well, you'll get over it.<br>
Give me a kiss.<br>
Come on, give me a kiss, you.<br>
- Take care of yourself, huh?<br>
- You too.<br>
All right.<br>
- Don't be a stranger, Paul.<br>
- Yeah, I'll see you around.<br>
Watch him like a hawk.<br>
It would break my heart, but if he steps<br>
out of line, shoot him in the fucking head.<br>
It'll be my pleasure.<br>
Look at the size of that trunk.<br>
You could put three bodies in there.<br>
Just kidding.<br>
Just trying to levitate the situation.<br>
- Okay, thank you. We appreciate it.<br>
- Sure.<br>
- Hey, what kind of car youse drive, anyway?<br>
- It's a Lexus 430 LS.<br>
That's like a Toyota.<br>
- It's a Lexus.<br>
- Yeah, Toyota, Lexus, same thing.<br>
Japanese, right?<br>
Let's not forget Pearl Harbor.<br>
Anyway, let's get serious.<br>
You wanna buy this car, or what?<br>
- We have to think about it.<br>
- What's to think about?<br>
You told me you liked it. You asked me<br>
You drove it. You love it.<br>
What more do you need to know?<br>
You know, it's a lot of money,<br>
and we need time to consider it.<br>
Consider it?<br>
Why don't you consider this.<br>
You been breaking my balls for an hour...<br>
...asking me about<br>
every goddamn accessory in this car.<br>
- "What about the light?"<br>
- You cannot talk to customers like that.<br>
You're not a customer<br>
as far as I'm concerned.<br>
- You want to buy the car or not?<br>
- Not from you. I wanna see the manager.<br>
You wanna see the manager?<br>
I'll show you the manager.<br>
- Here's the manager. Right here.<br>
- Unbelievable.<br>
- Come on.<br>
- Wanna talk to him?<br>
What should I do?<br>
Throw them out!<br>
You hear him? He just said,<br>
"Throw them out."<br>
What should they get?<br>
Tell them to get a Honda!<br>
Hey, he just said it. He's the boss.<br>
So tell me, how was your first day?<br>
Good. Good. Good.<br>
That's great, Paul. That's great.<br>
Did you sell any cars?<br>
Almost.<br>
- Paul, thanks for everything.<br>
- We have been waiting here 20 minutes.<br>
I only got two hands, left and right.<br>
I can slap you with either one.<br>
Now get out of here.<br>
You're a pain in the ass. Come on.<br>
- Mr. Torre. Mr. Torre. Let him through.<br>
- Hey, Paul. Glad you're out.<br>
- How are you? My son Michael.<br>
- Hey, Michael, nice to meet you.<br>
- I wanted to ask you something.<br>
- Yeah?<br>
You think the Yankees<br>
are gonna go all the way?<br>
- We'll do our best.<br>
- It would be very important to me personally.<br>
Very important.<br>
- Try.<br>
- I'll talk to the team.<br>
- Go eat.<br>
- Joe, good to see you.<br>
- Welcome back.<br>
- Thank you, Charlie.<br>
Hey, Paul.<br>
- Hey, Joey.<br>
- How are you? I heard you was out.<br>
- Yeah, well, you know...<br>
- The table for six isn't ready.<br>
I'm gonna take the four now.<br>
When Mr. Arnold comes in<br>
bring him right back.<br>
So, what are you doing?<br>
You working here?<br>
You know, I'm on parole.<br>
I gotta be a good boy, you know?<br>
I got a piece of the joint.<br>
So, what am I going to do? I gotta...<br>
I get it. We're gonna<br>
have a drink at the bar.<br>
- All right, okay. I'll see you, Joe.<br>
- Nice to meet you.<br>
Big smiles, everybody.<br>
Thanks, Paul. Appreciate it.<br>
Hey, can you get us a Pelligrino,<br>
round of drinks...<br>
...and more bread<br>
when you get a chance? Thanks.<br>
- You want more bread?<br>
- Yeah. Bread.<br>
There you go.<br>
I'll get your drinks now.<br>
This stone is supposed to be a G color.<br>
It looks a little yellow, doesn't it?<br>
That's the fluorescent light.<br>
It makes everything look yellow.<br>
No, I thought fluorescent light<br>
makes everything look blue.<br>
What am I, Edison? That's a fuck... It's the<br>
fluorescent light doing that. That's a G.<br>
Well, maybe.<br>
Look from that angle.<br>
What do you think?<br>
I don't...<br>
I don't know.<br>
- It's a little...<br>
- Yeah.<br>
Could we look at it with a lens?<br>
That might help us out.<br>
Do you have a lens?<br>
We just asked for a lens.<br>
- Where do you think you're going?<br>
- Where am I going?<br>
The orphanage found my real parents.<br>
I'm going to Jelly's house.<br>
No, you're not. You're in my custody.<br>
And we have therapy to do.<br>
For what? The more we talk, the worse I get.<br>
Look at me. I'm a fucking wreck.<br>
- I had that dream again.<br>
- The one where you're Mussolini?<br>
No, the other one.<br>
You know, I'm 16, you're Freud.<br>
And then I'm scared out of my mind...<br>
...and these giants are coming at me<br>
with guns. And I'm fighting them off.<br>
Too bad.<br>
- The limp-sword dream?<br>
- Yeah.<br>
- I probably shouldn't be listening to this.<br>
- Well, then don't.<br>
Paul?<br>
Sorry.<br>
Let's talk about it.<br>
And you don't think this dream is sexual?<br>
You're thinking the sword is my cock,<br>
I can't get it up. That ain't it.<br>
Because I was with Sheila last night,<br>
I had a hard-on you could swing from.<br>
- I don't need to know that.<br>
- You could hang wet towels on this one.<br>
Congratulations. It's a nice thing to have.<br>
- He's built like a racehorse in that area.<br>
- Thank you. I get it.<br>
- I've seen it.<br>
- Hey, wait in the car, you.<br>
- So, what does it mean?<br>
- Sex can mean a lot of things.<br>
I think, in this case,<br>
it's about performance anxiety.<br>
You're under a lot of pressure.<br>
You're changing your life,<br>
you're trying to find a job that fits you.<br>
Doc, nothing is gonna fit though.<br>
This 9 to 5 bullshit?<br>
Forget about it. I'll fucking kill myself.<br>
You know they take taxes out<br>
of your paycheck? What the fuck is that?<br>
Like, I'm doomed.<br>
I'll wind up selling hot dogs on the street.<br>
Take a deep breath, Paul.<br>
- I mean, my heart's beating like a rabbit!<br>
- Just relax. You're hyperventilating.<br>
That's all it is.<br>
Here, breathe into this bag.<br>
And breathe in and then breathe out.<br>
In, out.<br>
- This is your fault.<br>
- Excuse me?<br>
- This is all your fault.<br>
- My fault?<br>
You tell me to get a job like<br>
I'm a fucking nobody. It's humiliating.<br>
Really? Is it? You know what,<br>
I'm doing the best that I can. All right?<br>
If it's not appreciated,<br>
or if my best isn't good enough for you...<br>
...then find somebody else to talk to,<br>
you selfish son of a bitch!<br>
Because I didn't ask to be born!<br>
What the hell is that about?<br>
I'm sorry. I'm grieving. It's a process.<br>
All right, I'm the patient. That's enough.<br>
Now what are you taking?<br>
Echinacea, goldenseal.<br>
Immune system.<br>
There's a lot of plants and ticks.<br>
Okay.<br>
Do you know the television show<br>
Little Caesar?<br>
Yeah, I know it.<br>
The producer of the show<br>
is a man named Raoul Berman.<br>
A mutual friend told him I know you,<br>
so Mr. Berman called me this morning...<br>
...and said that he would like to meet you.<br>
- For what?<br>
I don't know. Why don't<br>
you meet him and find out?<br>
We just got him out of our house.<br>
Now we're having dinner with him?<br>
- That's not very professional, is it?<br>
- It's social.<br>
He's meeting a television producer<br>
who could give him a job.<br>
He's very nervous about it, and he<br>
asked me to buffer. I'm here to buffer.<br>
He's a grown man.<br>
Why does he need a chaperone?<br>
He doesn't. He needs a buffer.<br>
That's me. I'm here in a buffering capacity.<br>
If you say "buffer" one more time...<br>
We're gonna go eat something.<br>
We'll be back before they finish dinner.<br>
Didn't you just take two of those?<br>
Did I? No, that was the other... The Chinese<br>
herb enzyme thing. This is different.<br>
Just don't drink anything.<br>
Drink? Honey, I'm a doctor,<br>
I know what I'm doing.<br>
I adore this place.<br>
It is the best sushi in town.<br>
Yeah, it smells good.<br>
Did you try the yellowtail, Paul?<br>
They got any real food around here?<br>
I mean, this is like eating fucking bait.<br>
Raoul, what's very interesting about Paul<br>
is that he was born without a filter.<br>
He has no filter. He says whatever comes<br>
through his mind. He never edits himself.<br>
- What's with you?<br>
- What do you mean?<br>
- You sound like a fucking retard.<br>
- I took a pill. I took an ibuprofen pill.<br>
I probably shouldn't<br>
have had the mai tai or the sake.<br>
It interacted, and it's giving me a little<br>
problem with my upper lip. That's all.<br>
- It will be gone in about an hour.<br>
- Will you shut the fuck up?<br>
See that?<br>
He just told me to shut the fuck up!<br>
I love it! I absolutely love it.<br>
In two seconds, I'm gonna stick<br>
this fork in your fucking eye.<br>
He will stick a fucking fork in my eye!<br>
What did I tell you?<br>
Unfiltered.<br>
Could I get another one of these, please?<br>
Me too. I'd like a cosmopolitan.<br>
- No. No. No.<br>
- Why not?<br>
- The buffer has had too much.<br>
- Okay.<br>
Mr. Berman, I love your show.<br>
Thank you.<br>
And Anthony Bella,<br>
the guy that plays Nicky Caesar?<br>
He grew up in Bensonhurst, right<br>
next door to my cousin's friend's husband.<br>
I hate to bust your bubble, but there's<br>
no way he's from Bensonhurst.<br>
He's, like, a professional Italian<br>
from Connecticut or someplace.<br>
Listen, Paul, I have to ask, would you be<br>
interested in working on Little Caesar...<br>
...as a consultant and technical advisor,<br>
you know, coaching the actors?<br>
Making sure the dialogue rings true.<br>
- Yeah, whatever.<br>
- Oh, my God! This is so exciting!<br>
Fantastic!<br>
How about a toast?<br>
A toast to Paul and Little Caesar.<br>
Down!<br>
That restaurant was really good.<br>
I liked it up until the attempted whacking.<br>
Now, is that the right terminology,<br>
Mafia shrink?<br>
Sorry.<br>
Do you know that you were muttering and<br>
drooling like one of your relatives tonight?<br>
What are those pills? What are you taking?<br>
You know, at this point,<br>
anything I can get my hands on.<br>
Okay? Because I am staring<br>
into a big hole that I can't fill up.<br>
You don't need this. You don't need<br>
this Paul Vitti thing in your life right now.<br>
Especially not right now.<br>
I think you need to be grieving<br>
for your father.<br>
You know, it's just, I'm finding<br>
the whole thing just a little confusing.<br>
You know, I became a therapist...<br>
...because he was a therapist.<br>
I mean, it was that easy.<br>
Because his approval was so important<br>
to me. I mean, it was everything.<br>
And I never really got it.<br>
So now I'm thinking, is this...?<br>
Is this the reason I did it?<br>
And now that he's gone,<br>
do I still wanna do this?<br>
Because I don't know.<br>
Come here, baby.<br>
I just want you to be happy.<br>
Hey, pal.<br>
- I'll ask you once. Who are you working for?<br>
- I'm working for your mother.<br>
- Fuck you.<br>
- Fuck me?<br>
Yeah. No, no, no, wait, wait!<br>
Stop! Wait! Wait!<br>
- Stop!<br>
- Who are you working for?<br>
Get me up! Stop! Get me up!<br>
Drop him.<br>
I'm working for Lou the Wrench. Rigazzi.<br>
- The Wrench?<br>
- Yeah, the Wrench.<br>
- How do you spell his name?<br>
- I don't know how to spell it. R-I-Z-A-Z-Z...<br>
Can't even spell his fucking name right,<br>
you fucking moron.<br>
Pull him up.<br>
What's the matter with you?<br>
You said drop him.<br>
- I said pull him back up.<br>
- That ain't what I heard.<br>
Then you heard what you wanted to hear.<br>
I guess you got me there.<br>
What the hell happened to you?<br>
Vitti threw me off a roof.<br>
Vitti? You talked to Vitti?<br>
Yeah, I talked to Vitti.<br>
- What did you say to him?<br>
- Nothing.<br>
- You sure you didn't tell him anything?<br>
- I didn't say anything, Mr. Rigazzi.<br>
Can I go now? I think my leg's broken.<br>
That must hurt, huh?<br>
Wait a minute.<br>
I have something for that.<br>
I hate to see people in pain.<br>
Get him out of here.<br>
What about Vitti?<br>
He's a hard man to kill.<br>
But he's not immortal.<br>
Our time will come.<br>
- Okay, roll film.<br>
- Background.<br>
Hey, I like my sausage burnt.<br>
I don't know how you like your sausage?<br>
I been doing this 20 fucking years.<br>
- You got the money?<br>
- I almost got it.<br>
I'm still light 15 large.<br>
But don't worry about it, I got it covered.<br>
All I gotta...<br>
All I gotta...<br>
Cut! Cut! Can you do something<br>
about the goddamn smoke?<br>
Cut!<br>
Can you do something<br>
about the damn smoke?<br>
This is the trouble<br>
with shooting on location...<br>
...although it's worth it<br>
for the authenticity.<br>
Well, it looks authentic.<br>
Hey, Tony!<br>
Tony.<br>
Anthony Bella, Nicky Caesar.<br>
- This is Paul Vitti.<br>
- You don't have to tell me who he is.<br>
- It's a pleasure to meet you, mate.<br>
- Hey, mate.<br>
I don't believe this. An English guy.<br>
- You ain't even Italian.<br>
- Australian-Italian.<br>
- There's a lot of paisans down under.<br>
- Down under what?<br>
- You like to laugh, don't you?<br>
- It's a nervous defense mechanism.<br>
I don't have to do it if it bothers you.<br>
So I'll just...<br>
So, Paul, are you gonna join us?<br>
I'm thinking I might.<br>
I like the whole setup here.<br>
Sensational, mate. I can't wait to work<br>
with you. I got a lot of questions for you.<br>
- All right, mate.<br>
- All right.<br>
- Can we get this fucking shot?<br>
- Yes, yes.<br>
Paul, thank you. And welcome.<br>
Welcome aboard.<br>
Couple of things.<br>
I don't know who makes these decisions...<br>
...but there are things that<br>
I see that don't look right.<br>
Yes, I sensed this myself.<br>
Which elements strike you as wrong?<br>
Well, the people, mainly. I mean,<br>
you got a boss who speaks Australian.<br>
- What the fuck is that about?<br>
- Not my first choice.<br>
- And your background is what?<br>
- Theater, mostly.<br>
That figures. I got some people<br>
I could bring around...<br>
...that will add a certain authenticity<br>
to the whole thing.<br>
I would be eternally grateful<br>
to you if you could.<br>
Is there anything else that you would need?<br>
I'd like one of those trailers<br>
like the stars got.<br>
Done! Done! I am gonna go<br>
put that in the works right now.<br>
Right.<br>
Brian!<br>
- Hey, Paul. You really gonna do this?<br>
- Yeah, I'm really gonna do this.<br>
Are you out of your fucking mind?<br>
I'm going nuts already with this job thing.<br>
In a week, I'll fucking kill<br>
this Raoul or I'll kill myself.<br>
This is just a good cover till I figure out<br>
what I'm gonna do. But call the guys.<br>
- You know, there's a line here.<br>
- Yeah, it's in back of me.<br>
Take the chicken and the two pastas.<br>
You must be a teamster.<br>
Youse don't stop eating.<br>
"Tell me why I'd give a shit<br>
about your wife's cousin?"<br>
- No, no good.<br>
- It's not good?<br>
What about this line? "Stevie Wonder<br>
sees more shit than you do!"<br>
- No. Never.<br>
- It's not good?<br>
Never.<br>
"How much does the chosen snitch<br>
want for this?"<br>
- No?<br>
- No.<br>
- It's no good.<br>
- No good.<br>
Jesus.<br>
That's it. That's...<br>
That's the end of the scene.<br>
- There's no dialogue in the scene.<br>
- You're better off.<br>
Get in the car.<br>
- We going to the prom?<br>
- Shut up and get in the car.<br>
I know.<br>
Sit down.<br>
Careful. The eggs are on the bottom.<br>
- Oh, yeah?<br>
- Yeah.<br>
You the shrink taking care of Paul Vitti?<br>
- Yes, I am.<br>
- So is he nuts, or what?<br>
I'm sorry, I don't discuss<br>
my patients' cases with anyone.<br>
Discuss it.<br>
He's suffering from a chronic anxiety,<br>
and...<br>
And what?<br>
Antisocial personality disorder.<br>
Sociopathy.<br>
I'm getting a fucking headache here.<br>
What are you trying to say?<br>
He has a criminal temperament.<br>
He's a criminal?<br>
This is news?<br>
And for that you need a doctor degree?<br>
What do you do for him?<br>
I try to get him to see<br>
the possibility of change.<br>
Wrong.<br>
You do not want him to change.<br>
That's Mrs. LoPresti.<br>
Patti.<br>
Patti, I'm Ben Sobel.<br>
Paul Vitti is very important to this family.<br>
We don't want to see you<br>
turning him into a stromboni.<br>
Stromboni? The thing they clean<br>
the ice with at the hockey games?<br>
That's a Zamboni, asshole. Stromboni.<br>
It's a bull with his balls cut off.<br>
- No, we don't want to see that happen.<br>
- Not unless you want to be one too.<br>
No, I'm very attached to my balls.<br>
As you can probably tell.<br>
Then do the right thing. Understand?<br>
Yes. Yes, I do.<br>
Goodbye.<br>
No hard feelings.<br>
No, and probably never again.<br>
We're gonna need a grapple or a crane.<br>
Fifty-foot boom, at least.<br>
I seen one in Bayonne, but I'll call around.<br>
All right, see what you can do.<br>
And we're gonna need a city bus.<br>
Anybody got ideas about that?<br>
I got a guy in the Transit Authority.<br>
He owes me big.<br>
- Let me know when you want me to call.<br>
- Hello, Paul.<br>
- Hey. How you doing?<br>
- Hi, guys. How are you?<br>
- Patti, how you doing?<br>
- Good. I guess everyone's gone Hollywood.<br>
Excuse me. This is a closed set.<br>
We're about to start shooting.<br>
Yeah? So am I. Let's walk. Come on.<br>
- I heard you had some more trouble.<br>
- Yeah, Lou the Wrench took a shot at me.<br>
I don't have to tell you, Paul. Alone on<br>
the streets, you don't stand a chance.<br>
That's what the family is all about.<br>
Since the old days when<br>
the grandfathers first came over.<br>
It's not something you walk away from.<br>
When you're a Jet,<br>
you're a Jet all the way.<br>
- What?<br>
- Nothing.<br>
So you wanna tell me what's going on?<br>
I see you have your whole crew<br>
back together.<br>
Nothing's going on. They're actors now.<br>
Don't bullshit me, Paul.<br>
I know you're planning something,<br>
and I'm feeling left out.<br>
All right. All right, I'll tell you.<br>
Something's going down.<br>
You'll get your end.<br>
Just let us do what we gotta do.<br>
It'll be fine.<br>
Okay?<br>
You're a good friend. I would never<br>
insist on something like this...<br>
...but I'd feel better if you'd bring Eddie<br>
and a couple of my guys in...<br>
...you know, to help you with the job.<br>
Eddie "Yeah, what?"<br>
- He's a good man.<br>
- He's a fucking jerk-off.<br>
He's young. He's got a lot to learn.<br>
What is this, crime school?<br>
This is a serious thing we're doing here.<br>
Check him out. Talk to Frankie Brush.<br>
Talk to Jackie the Jew.<br>
He's worked jobs with them before.<br>
They'll vouch for him.<br>
Paul, please. For me.<br>
He does what I tell him, stays out of the<br>
way, and he keeps his fucking mouth shut.<br>
All right. Fine. Thanks, Paul.<br>
I really appreciate this.<br>
Oh, God. Dear God.<br>
Look, sweetheart...<br>
Sweetheart, first of all...<br>
...we're not shooting the hooker scene<br>
until tomorrow.<br>
And the hair, please, what is it?<br>
Something from the cliche store?<br>
Raoul. This is a friend of mine.<br>
Patti. This is Patti Lo. This is Raoul.<br>
Patti Lo...?<br>
Patti LoPresti?<br>
I am so very, very sorry.<br>
How dare you not inform me<br>
that Mrs. LoPresti is on the set today!<br>
You are fired! Get out!<br>
That is why I'm...<br>
Please, enjoy your visit with us.<br>
And if there is anything at all<br>
that I can do...<br>
Go fuck yourself.<br>
Immediately. Immediately.<br>
He's from the theater.<br>
- Should I wait here, Mr. Rigazzi?<br>
- No, pull the car up your ass and wait there.<br>
Get over your hurt feelings, okay?<br>
Tell me. Was she angry?<br>
Am I in danger?<br>
Don't worry about it. I just wouldn't start<br>
my car for a couple of weeks if I were you.<br>
I'll have Brian do it. He's new.<br>
Hey, Paul.<br>
Hey, Lou.<br>
This is Lou Rigazzi, Lou the Wrench.<br>
The Wrench?<br>
Brian? Sorry.<br>
Start my car!<br>
Now!<br>
Come on, I wanna talk to you.<br>
The guy who shot at you,<br>
he was acting on his own.<br>
- I never gave the order.<br>
- Yeah?<br>
He's been taken care of.<br>
There won't be another incident.<br>
Unless you're thinking<br>
of working for Patti Lo.<br>
Me? No.<br>
Good. Then I got no beef with you.<br>
Good, I can sleep better.<br>
Let me tell you,<br>
because that's not the way to go.<br>
You wanna back a winner,<br>
which is gonna be me, okay?<br>
It only makes sense.<br>
So you come work for me.<br>
I'll treat you right.<br>
No, thanks.<br>
So much for sleeping better.<br>
You be careful.<br>
Listen, Jelly, you just pick numbers.<br>
- You know why? It's an open race.<br>
- Jelly.<br>
- Hey, doc! How you doing?<br>
- How you doing?<br>
How are you?<br>
How are you, Yo-Yo?<br>
Mo-Mo.<br>
Mo-Mo, right. I was thinking of the cellist.<br>
Jelly, where's Paul?<br>
He's in his camper.<br>
Yeah.<br>
Doc, what are you doing here?<br>
What am I doing here?<br>
What are you doing here?<br>
I came to tell you that you had a meeting<br>
with your parole officer, and who do I see?<br>
Patti LoPresti!<br>
Patti who?<br>
Stop lying to me. Your whole gang is here.<br>
Who says I'm lying? I finally get a straight<br>
job, I start getting my life together...<br>
...and you start accusing me?<br>
That's how much you trust me?<br>
Paul, it's not that I don't trust you.<br>
It's just that I don't trust you.<br>
This is what's so hard<br>
about being an ex-con.<br>
You make one mistake<br>
and nobody lets you forget it.<br>
So now you're the victim?<br>
Paul, I want the truth.<br>
Wait a second.<br>
- Say that again.<br>
- Say what?<br>
- What you just said. "I want the truth."<br>
- I want the truth.<br>
- No, strong, like before.<br>
- Paul, I want the truth!<br>
That's it. That's good.<br>
- What?<br>
- I'm serious, that had power.<br>
- I believed you. You could be an actor.<br>
- Paul, I am not an actor.<br>
You're better than the bums here.<br>
- There's this part you could do.<br>
- I can't. We have this meeting.<br>
We're shooting now. There's this part,<br>
you could do it. I'm telling you, it's you.<br>
I did do Music Man in high school.<br>
People thought I was quite good.<br>
Jelly, what are you...?<br>
Help! Help!<br>
Hey, help me!<br>
I don't wanna do this!<br>
- Does that screaming sound real to you?<br>
- Yeah, that sounds pretty real to me.<br>
That was not funny at all. There was<br>
no harness. They could've dropped me.<br>
If you didn't wanna do it,<br>
you should've said.<br>
You said a scene on the roof.<br>
I didn't know they would throw me off.<br>
They didn't throw you off.<br>
They hung you over the side. That's it.<br>
I know what you're doing.<br>
You're upset that I have custody of you...<br>
...so you passive-aggressively<br>
make me look like a fool.<br>
Come on. You were great.<br>
You were great.<br>
Second take, I thought,<br>
was better than the first.<br>
Jelly wasn't giving me much, honestly.<br>
So I...<br>
Screw you, Paul.<br>
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. That's it. Okay.<br>
- What are you doing, self-medicating again?<br>
- No.<br>
Don't give me that decongestant,<br>
multivitamin shit.<br>
- Come on, what are you doing?<br>
- Ginkgo biloba. Helps my memory...<br>
...and I forget what else.<br>
But don't worry about me.<br>
Worry about what you're gonna say<br>
to this parole officer.<br>
I mean, what are you gonna tell him?<br>
That you left my house?<br>
That you got your gang back together?<br>
And for what? A high-school dropout reunion?<br>
- You recognize that car?<br>
- Which car?<br>
The one that's been following us<br>
for the last few miles.<br>
That? Oh, yeah. I know that car. That's a<br>
Mercedes S500. That is one sweet machine.<br>
It's an eight bore.<br>
It comes in a 12, which is a beast.<br>
- Lose them.<br>
- What?<br>
- Lose them.<br>
- What?<br>
- Lose them!<br>
- Lose that car? You can't...<br>
I'm gonna stop, Paul.<br>
This could be the FBI.<br>
The FBI is two cars back.<br>
You gotta be more observant. Left.<br>
I'm pulling over.<br>
They won't shoot us. It's daylight.<br>
Broad daylight is the best time.<br>
They can see better. Right!<br>
We gotta stop. This is a lease.<br>
Hey, it's a goddamn lease!<br>
- Move over. I'll drive.<br>
- Move over where?<br>
- Get in the back seat. Back seat!<br>
- Damn seat belt.<br>
Get over!<br>
- Buckle up, doc.<br>
- It's gonna get worse?<br>
It ain't gonna get better.<br>
Stop it!<br>
Oh, my God.<br>
You think they'll get out?<br>
Yeah, that's James Bond and that<br>
Sea Hunt guy, so they got a good shot.<br>
- I feel bad. Where are you going?<br>
- I gotta take care of this.<br>
- Paul, your parole officer...<br>
- Send him my regards.<br>
- Paul, I'm warning you. If you leave now...<br>
- So long, doc.<br>
That's it. You're on your own now, pal.<br>
That's it. I'm done.<br>
I'm...<br>
...screwed.<br>
So where is he, doctor?<br>
I wish I knew.<br>
Considering I released him into your custody,<br>
that's not quite the answer I was looking for.<br>
He's got something in the works.<br>
Care to tell me what you know?<br>
I don't know anything.<br>
I really feel he's making<br>
an effort to go straight.<br>
- Oh, yeah?<br>
- Yes.<br>
That's why we got two corpses<br>
in the bottom of the river?<br>
Here.<br>
Vitti with Sal Masiello.<br>
Vitti with Patti LoPresti.<br>
Vitti with Eddie DeVol.<br>
Let me know.<br>
I can order you some wallet-size.<br>
I am giving you 24 hours<br>
to find him and deliver him to me.<br>
Otherwise, you're looking at obstruction<br>
of justice and accessory to manslaughter.<br>
- Can I go?<br>
- Sure, but you can't take your car.<br>
We're impounding it as evidence.<br>
- Can I get a ride?<br>
- Have a nice day.<br>
I don't got a lot of time.<br>
They're probably gonna come looking for me,<br>
so we'll go over everything at the club.<br>
Paul, not that I'm questioning or anything,<br>
but what do we need with this Eddie DeVol?<br>
The guy is like a petty larceny scumbag.<br>
Hey, I ain't happy about it either.<br>
But if he keeps Patti off my back, so be it.<br>
- Yeah?<br>
- Mr. Vitti?<br>
- Mr. Bella asked to meet you in makeup.<br>
- Can't. Gotta go.<br>
- It's important.<br>
- I'll talk to him tomorrow.<br>
Here, here.<br>
Tell him you never saw me, okay?<br>
- Paul, excellent, mate. Come here, please.<br>
- I can't talk right now, mate.<br>
I've gotta ask you a question.<br>
Two seconds? Come on.<br>
- I gotta...<br>
- Come on.<br>
- Can we do it later?<br>
- Please. It's important.<br>
Paul, I'm looking for something to do when<br>
my character finds out he's being indicted.<br>
And I was thinking of punching the wall.<br>
But I did that when they killed Uncle Lenny,<br>
and I punched a car...<br>
...actually, it was a van, when Peezee<br>
screwed up the big drug-deal.<br>
So I'm looking<br>
for something different this time.<br>
Something that doesn't involve,<br>
you know, punching anything.<br>
Kick something. Let me know<br>
how it works out. I gotta go.<br>
Paul, wait.<br>
That's really interesting.<br>
- Kick what?<br>
- I don't know. Like, kick a guy in the face.<br>
- Who?<br>
- Anybody, just some guy.<br>
Knock him down, give him a<br>
couple shots in the head and walk away.<br>
- Why?<br>
- Why not?<br>
You're pissed, he's there.<br>
I got friends waiting for me.<br>
My character wouldn't do that.<br>
What else you got?<br>
- I don't know. You could yell real loud.<br>
- Yell real loud?<br>
That's really original.<br>
Shut your fucking mouth.<br>
I don't care what you do. I gotta go.<br>
Shut your fucking mouth.<br>
I don't care what you do. I gotta go.<br>
- What'd you say?<br>
- What'd you say?<br>
- Wait. What are you doing?<br>
- Wait. What are you doing?<br>
- You can cut that shit out right now.<br>
- You can cut that shit out right now.<br>
That was bloody great!<br>
My character could do that.<br>
Thank you.<br>
Jelly? Where's Paul?<br>
Michael. What are you doing?<br>
I'm working for Mr. Vitti.<br>
Yeah, I'm his driver now.<br>
Oh, no. No. No. No, Michael,<br>
you are not doing that. Sorry.<br>
- You keep telling me to get a job.<br>
- Making sandwiches at the Subway...<br>
...not driving a getaway car.<br>
Dad.<br>
No "Dad" about this. He should have<br>
spoken to me before he spoke to you.<br>
All right. Where is he?<br>
I cannot give you that information.<br>
You cannot give me that information?<br>
Look, I promised not to repeat anything<br>
I heard in the car, okay? I took an oath.<br>
You took an oath?<br>
Was there blood involved?<br>
Ben?<br>
What...? What happened? Where were you?<br>
I'll tell you the truth. I was involved<br>
in a high-speed car chase.<br>
- What?<br>
- My car was totally shot out...<br>
...and the men who were<br>
chasing us probably drowned.<br>
- Oh, my God!<br>
- It's not as bad as it sounds.<br>
- When is this all gonna end?<br>
- Tonight. I just have to find him.<br>
Why? A few days ago you weren't even<br>
sure you wanted to be a therapist.<br>
Honey, I have to finish this.<br>
I have to. Understand?<br>
Go.<br>
- Go. Just don't get shot.<br>
- Okay.<br>
- Please.<br>
- All right.<br>
- Hey, Clemenza. Where is he?<br>
- I can't.<br>
You are gonna tell your father...<br>
...or so help me God, I'll kick<br>
the ever-Ioving shit out of you.<br>
Little Darlings, okay? It's a club in Queens.<br>
- Give me the keys to the car.<br>
- I'm responsible for the Town Car.<br>
- Give me the fucking keys!<br>
- Take my car.<br>
- Okay.<br>
- Here.<br>
Thank you. Bye.<br>
Hi.<br>
Excuse me.<br>
Excuse me.<br>
Jelly.<br>
- Hey, doc, what are you doing here?<br>
- Where's Paul?<br>
- I think she likes you.<br>
- I have to talk to Paul.<br>
Man, give her a few dollars.<br>
Hi. I only have a 20,<br>
so could I get change?<br>
Ten, five, singles would be great.<br>
Thank you.<br>
Okay.<br>
Thank you very much for giving me this.<br>
Thank you.<br>
Listen, this is my meter money,<br>
I don't have any more bills, so...<br>
Where's Jelly?<br>
What are you doing?<br>
What do you mean? Blowing off<br>
a little steam. What's the big deal?<br>
Here he is.<br>
- How's it going, Paulie?<br>
- It's going all right.<br>
You know my guys?<br>
Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino?<br>
Al Pacino? That's your real name?<br>
No. They call me that<br>
because I look like Al Pacino.<br>
- The actor.<br>
- Anybody ever call you Carol Burnett?<br>
Why?<br>
Because you look as much like<br>
Carol Burnett as you do Al Pacino.<br>
- What are you looking at?<br>
- I actually see it.<br>
It's, like, right through here,<br>
it's just very much Pacino.<br>
So we're all here?<br>
- We're all here.<br>
- Then let's do this, all right?<br>
- Let's do what?<br>
- Let's go.<br>
- Let's do what?<br>
- Let's go.<br>
You're not telling me something.<br>
You're not telling me something.<br>
I want to know what's going on.<br>
- I'm not leaving till you tell me...<br>
- Get out of here. You're gonna get hurt.<br>
Okay, this is big.<br>
We only got one shot, and there's a million<br>
ways this fucking thing can go wrong...<br>
...so everybody listen carefully.<br>
The Federal Gold Depository<br>
in downtown Manhattan.<br>
Three times a year, a shipment of Gold bars<br>
Goes in a heavily Guarded armored truck...<br>
...from the depository to a vault<br>
in the Federal Reserve...<br>
...to hold for foreiGn Governments<br>
that trade in Gold bullion.<br>
Three o'clock in the morninG,<br>
about eiGht hours from now...<br>
...we're gonna hijack that truck.<br>
All right, everybody look at the map.<br>
This is where we're gonna be.<br>
- What the fuck is this?<br>
- He was listening by the door.<br>
- Hi, guys.<br>
- Get rid of him.<br>
- Hi, Carol.<br>
- You're a dead man, asshole.<br>
Put the gun down.<br>
Put the fucking gun down!<br>
Put the fucking gun down, okay?<br>
- What are you doing?<br>
- What do you think?<br>
- He can make every guy in this room.<br>
- Keep your hands off him. He's with me.<br>
Yeah? What, on the job?<br>
- Gonna start that "yeah, what?" shit again?<br>
- Either he's in or he's dead. Which is it?<br>
I think in is better.<br>
If I had a vote, I would vote in.<br>
- He's in. He's my responsibility.<br>
- Okay.<br>
No more surprises. And from this<br>
moment on, no one leaves my sight.<br>
Got it?<br>
Here, try this on.<br>
- Is this bulletproof?<br>
- You better hope so.<br>
See if it fits under your shirt.<br>
I could fit you under my shirt.<br>
Got anything smaller?<br>
What are we, a Bloomingdale's?<br>
Hey, nobody knew you were coming down.<br>
You're lucky to be alive, you know.<br>
We're all gonna be lucky to be alive.<br>
This plan is crazy. It's stupid.<br>
Hey, hey, watch it.<br>
Crazy, but not stupid.<br>
You wanna stay alive?<br>
You do everything I tell you, keep your<br>
mouth shut, and try not to pee your pants.<br>
- Can you handle an M-16?<br>
- You mean shoot it?<br>
No, twirl it like a fucking baton.<br>
- AK?<br>
- No.<br>
- Kalashnikov?<br>
- Jelly.<br>
- Stop me when something hits your fancy.<br>
- Well, can't I just use that?<br>
Yeah. This brings back fond memories.<br>
- Use it in good health.<br>
- Thanks.<br>
Great.<br>
Cold. Cold.<br>
- Check everything in there.<br>
- Talk to the doc, I think he's caving in.<br>
- You okay?<br>
- Yeah, I'm great.<br>
I'll try to get you out before<br>
the shit goes down.<br>
- Just don't flip out on me, okay?<br>
- Right.<br>
Here they come.<br>
Big, big mistake.<br>
- They're here.<br>
- Go. Go! Go! Go!<br>
Are you fucking kidding me?<br>
Move the truck!<br>
Where you going?<br>
It's a setup!<br>
Everybody get down, watch the walls!<br>
Watch the walls and the gates!<br>
On my command,<br>
get the drivers back in the trucks.<br>
You're gonna take the rear.<br>
I'm gonna take the point.<br>
We're gonna back<br>
these fuckers out of here.<br>
- What the fuck?<br>
- They're lifting the truck!<br>
They're lifting the fucking truck!<br>
Son of a bitch!<br>
Hold on!<br>
Hold on, Harold! Hold on!<br>
Going over.<br>
You have got to be fucking kidding me!<br>
Hang on!<br>
- It's not too late. You don't have to do this.<br>
- Let's go. Let's go.<br>
What a day for my balls.<br>
Open the fucking door.<br>
- Where's the keys?<br>
- We don't have the keys.<br>
They've got the keys at the bank.<br>
Keep your fucking head down.<br>
Get over here!<br>
Move. Get the fuck in there.<br>
Here we go.<br>
Take the gate. You guys take the gate.<br>
Get the wall. Climb the wall.<br>
On the wall, guys. Get up on the wall!<br>
Get the gate! Move. Move. Move.<br>
Break through the gate.<br>
Get the ramp.<br>
You know, this might just fucking work.<br>
Go! Go! Go! Get over the wall.<br>
Come on.<br>
Need some backup.<br>
Move! Move! Move! Over the wall!<br>
- Get over the goddamn wall!<br>
- You get over the fucking wall!<br>
Fifty bars. Fifty bars is all we need.<br>
Fifty bars.<br>
- Let's go.<br>
- How much is that?<br>
- 22,995,000.<br>
- What?<br>
Give or take.<br>
Hit it again!<br>
They're breaking down the door.<br>
Bobby, move up the Payloaders.<br>
Move them up.<br>
So much for not peeing in my pants.<br>
- That's 50.<br>
- All right, pack it up.<br>
- Come on. Let's go.<br>
- Let's get out of here.<br>
We're moving out.<br>
We're moving out.<br>
Paul, remember what you said<br>
about not flipping out?<br>
- Yeah.<br>
- Sorry. What have I done?<br>
I had a perfect life,<br>
and I threw it away!<br>
I'm going to prison. That'll be bad.<br>
I have delicate features.<br>
- I'm small. I'm gonna be popular.<br>
- You gotta calm down!<br>
- I can't calm down. I'm gonna die.<br>
- Calm down!<br>
- I can't breathe! I'm suffocating!<br>
- Listen. Relax.<br>
- Get a hold of yourself!<br>
- I can't! We're gonna die!<br>
- We're not gonna die.<br>
- We are! We're all gonna die!<br>
- You feel better now?<br>
- This is all my fault.<br>
I wanted to be there for you.<br>
I really wanted to help you.<br>
I want... But I couldn't<br>
because I'm not good enough.<br>
Ever since my father died, I lost my way.<br>
I didn't think this would hit me this hard.<br>
But, Paul, now I know how you felt<br>
when your father was killed.<br>
We don't have time for this.<br>
- But it's...<br>
- I'm telling you.<br>
- Don't do this.<br>
- It was 10 times worse for you.<br>
- Don't do this.<br>
- He was killed right in front of you.<br>
- You were just a little kid.<br>
- Don't go there.<br>
- But it's so sad.<br>
- Don't go there. I'm telling you...<br>
- All of his dreams for you died with him.<br>
- There I go. You happy now?<br>
- He loved you, Paul. He really loved you.<br>
- I know he did, and I loved him too.<br>
- Loved him too.<br>
- I know. I know.<br>
Oh, boy, this is bad.<br>
How's the heist going?<br>
Did you really think<br>
you were gonna live through this?<br>
- Yeah. I had my hopes.<br>
- Well, nice work.<br>
- Mr. Rigazzi will be very grateful.<br>
- I thought he worked for Patti LoPresti.<br>
Patti thought so too, but he played<br>
both sides against the middle.<br>
There's only one side<br>
as far as I'm concerned: mine.<br>
What did you think?<br>
I was gonna stand by...<br>
...and let some fucking broken-down valise<br>
like you move back in?<br>
So long, Mr. Vitti.<br>
I can't take it anymore!<br>
That's what I hate<br>
about you fucking sociopaths!<br>
You keep changing the rules<br>
to suit yourselves!<br>
Well, not this time, you antisocial,<br>
misfit piece of shit!<br>
This time<br>
you fucked with the wrong shrink!<br>
You want a fresh one?<br>
This session is over.<br>
Son of a bitch. Ram it!<br>
Take them up and leave them there.<br>
- Nice going. Good plan.<br>
- Shut up.<br>
- Bye.<br>
- Yeah, what?<br>
What's a sociopath?<br>
I don't know.<br>
- Somebody!<br>
- Come on, help us out here.<br>
Come on! This way! Come on!<br>
- They're getting away! Come on.<br>
- Let's go!<br>
Drop your guns!<br>
Drop your guns!<br>
Drop your fucking guns!<br>
Drop your weapons, now!<br>
- Who the hell is this?<br>
- Cut. Cut. Cut! What the hell is going on?<br>
Drop your fucking guns. Nobody move!<br>
Raoul! Look, if you're gonna<br>
change the script, you have to tell us.<br>
Who are these people?<br>
What are they doing in my shot?<br>
- What are you doing on my street?<br>
- I have a permit!<br>
- Take your permit and stick it up your ass!<br>
- Oh, my friend.<br>
Release traffic, please. Release traffic.<br>
This is like a bloody Chinese fire drill...<br>
Jesus!<br>
- You are in trouble. You are in trouble!<br>
- You are gonna be in federal prison!<br>
Prison? You think I'm powerless?<br>
- Enough. I'm going back to my trailer.<br>
- No, you've gotta stay.<br>
- Move these cars, goddamn you!<br>
- You, please be quiet. I'm trying to think.<br>
- Is there a problem, officer?<br>
- Keep your hands where I can see them.<br>
That's it, we're screwed.<br>
We are so screwed.<br>
You.<br>
Me?<br>
- You're one tough shrink.<br>
- All right.<br>
- Feeling pretty good, huh?<br>
- Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.<br>
What are you thinking?<br>
I mean, what's next?<br>
Do you go on the run<br>
for the rest of your life?<br>
Do you just go back to Sing Sing?<br>
Or maybe they find you dead in an alley?<br>
- How does this work now?<br>
- Those are my choices?<br>
Hey, doc. Can't you let me enjoy this<br>
for five fucking minutes?<br>
- Must you always be a fucking killjoy?<br>
- Five minutes?<br>
- Five minutes.<br>
- Okay. Five minutes.<br>
- And then what?<br>
- And then what?<br>
- And then you'll see what.<br>
- I'll see.<br>

Hey, doc.<br>
When I was a resident, we used to<br>
actually play with the catatonics.<br>
Just to have a little fun,<br>
it's just so dreary.<br>
Okay, let's just... Okay.<br>
When I was a resident at Downstate...<br>
...we used to play with the catatonics,<br>
just for a few laughs.<br>
Okay.<br>
I'm not hurting you.<br>
- Sorry.<br>
- Marker.<br>
You told her at the drop of a hat.<br>
She's with the FBI.<br>
She needs this information.<br>
I see. And I don't need this information.<br>
Okay.<br>
No. No. Why? Why tell Paula?<br>
She couldn't possibly handle a phone call.<br>
But your name's not Paula.<br>
- Who am I?<br>
- Laura.<br>
Okay.<br>
- Hey, you.<br>
- Coffee?<br>
- What?<br>
- Somebody said something about coffee.<br>
Yeah. That was you.<br>
You said you wanted some.<br>
Yeah.<br>
- "So, what's the holdup?"<br>
- I know.<br>
I'm taking a long time.<br>
I'm taking my moment.<br>
You also took mine.<br>
Here you go. Thank you very much.<br>
Hey, Michael.<br>
Jelly.<br>
Michael!<br>
If I could only get out of this car!<br>
Come on. Who would you...?<br>
Who are we kidding?<br>
- You hated your father.<br>
- I didn't hate my father.<br>
- No, I loved him.<br>
- You hated your father.<br>
You hated him. You fucking hated him.<br>
What the fuck we talking about?<br>
- All right. I got it. I'll stop.<br>
- Good, that was good.<br>

- Yeah, I can see how touched...<br>
- That's my line.<br>
- That's your line.<br>
What am I doing here?<br>
What are you doing here?<br>
I came here to tell you<br>

- Come back and try again.<br>
- I will.<br>
Preliminary meeting. Preliminary meeting.<br>
You have a preliminary meeting<br>
with your parole officer.<br>
Fuck you. Fuck you. It's "preliminary."<br>
I'm from the Bronx,<br>

Come in.<br>
Hey, doc, what are you doing here?<br>
- Preliminary.<br>
- Yeah, preliminary.<br>
Come in.<br>

A marker.<br>
You know who was always<br>
a favorite of mine?<br>
The late, great Groucho Marx.<br>
Because he would put stuff on his,<br>
on his...<br>
He would draw them in on his eyebrows<br>
and then...<br>
"That's the most ridiculous thing<br>
I've heard." He would do stuff like that.<br>
Hey, look.<br>
I'm the sheriff of the undersea club.<br>
Salute me, I'm Captain Midnight.<br>
Ultimately, it's just sad.<br>
That's what I've been jerking off to<br>
the last 850 nights, a home-cooked meal.<br>
Yeah, like a nice fucking lamb chop.<br>
A nice home-cooked meal. Like...<br>
- Let me think of a good one.<br>
- A tuna casserole?<br>
Help me.<br>
I just wanted to see it again.<br>
- We still going?<br>
- We're good? Okay. We'll beat it to death.<br>
All right. That was great.<br>
I think we can move on.<br>
