[<I>There is a lot of dying, but technically I would put it this way:<BR>
The  pictures  of  a battle are not objective, but subjective. You
don't see, what actually happens, but what a person believes, that
happens. When Lyle shoots you see his point of view,  every  shoot
scores.<BR>
A  real  example:  US  Bomber  crews over Germany believed 1943 to
shoot down about 10  times  as  many  German  fighters  than  they
actually did.</B></I></U></SMALL>]<BR>

(<I>The  shooting  stops,  soldiers, children soldiers, old soldiers,
leaving their cover, children, men,  soldiers,  looking.  No  hard
cuts  but  soft  fades between the scenes. The bounty hunters with
Thornton ride into the town, dead bodies all over, women in  black
dress  praying,  vultures  sitting on the walls, the old walls are
made of raw stones, plaster has often fallen down.</B></I></U></SMALL>)<BR>
